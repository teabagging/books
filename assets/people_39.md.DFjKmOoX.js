There isn't really anything I can add that wouldn't cover what was already said about this glorious novel. It is wonderfully crafted, the ambrosia of the literary world, and is the type of book that makes you think, and then think some more. It really snowballs in the end, and you will race through the final pages even if the beginning is slightly long-winded."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book was comical, warm, wonderful, and insightful. It covered all the bases. I loved how Kesey wrote about a mental insitution in the in-depth way that he did, instead of writing about the stereotypical mental institutions. I rated this a five out of five stars, as it was well deserving! This is a book that anyone and everyone could and should read. Thank you for taking the time to read my review!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Although this is a huge cliche, I must say that this novel works on so many levels. From a character study to humor to power struggles, this novel has many different themes to read and enjoy.Chief Bromden is a 6'8\\" powerfully built Native American on the outside, but inside he's a scared child, paranoid of machinery that runs through the world that only he can see. He is the narrator to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and it is through his eyes that we see the story unfold. Almost all the action takes place in an Oregon Mental Institution, where 40 inmates troll under the autocreatic command of the Big Nurse. But then Randle P. McMurphy is admitted, a loudmouthed con man only there to escape the drudgery of the work farm. He quickly realizes what is happening and begins to challenge the nurse's authority, giving hope and sanity to the inmates at the same time.As long as you're not put off by the constant repitition of mechanical images about the \\"Combine\\" that only the main character can see (bear in mind he is insane) you'll see what a beautiful book this is. You'll see how McMurphy (for once a savior is not a blatant reference to Christ) becomes more than just a source of entertainment to the men, how he enriches their lives and sets them free, how the more he acts against the Big Nurse the less mechanics Chief sees. If you didn't read it in High School, by all means, read it now. 8.5/10"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Much has been made of the thematic nature of this great novel: the way society relentlessly grinds us into conformity; the way those in power abuse it to bring those under them into submission; the way one who is outspoken is often firmly chastised; etc. These are all valid themes and wonderfully symbolized by the very real characters in this novel.A lot less has been made of the fact that the book in many ways and all by itself is very therapeutic. I read it for the first time in my mid-teens, a period when most of us go through the difficult stage of trying to determine who we are, and worse, whether what we are becoming is acceptable. I'd look around at people my age and wonder how in the world they were so confident, so smart, so sure of themselves. Me? I was not unlike the Chief of this novel, wandering around in a fog half the time, trying to figure out what in the heck I was supposed to do or say or think at any given moment.But I read this book and suddenly--well, not suddenly--it helped to make things easier. What it makes clear is this: it's okay to be yourself. You don't have to hide things. It's okay to talk while your delicate white hands float in the air and form what you say, like Harding. It's okay to write letters and look concerned, even though everyone in the world thinks you're a Neanderthal, like McMurphy. It's okay to feel sad, it's okay to want to be alone, it's okay to be nervous around girls. What a relief it was when this finally sank in: I wasn't some kind of a psychopath, doomed forever to be a figure of ridicule while my back was turned. It's ohhh-kayyy! To me this was the great soothing message of the novel, and why I will forever be grateful to it.But before I go running off to the shrink, I'd better mention that on top of everything else, this book is just a flat-out, crackling great read. Right off the bat the classic confrontation is set up: the brash, untamed, loud McMurphy against the powerful, establishmentarian, icy Big Nurse. Set in an insane asylum, it is literally psychological warfare, with each of them carefully probing and then cutting at the other's weakness. As the novel goes on the stakes become increasingly steeper, until the very souls of the men on the ward are at risk. Fascinatingly, the novel ends with neither party having a clear-cut victory, and fittingly, the casualties are terrible.It is spectacularly written. An inmate, the Chief, is the narrator of the story. In his crazy mind, everything is mechanical and impersonal. Wires, transistors, metal, girds, rust, smoke and oil are what things are made of. He knows the Big Nurse listens to everything with the radio equipment in her purse. He hears the machinery humming in the walls. This functions as a superb literary device, symbolizing his paranoia, but at the same time it creates wonderful imagery. Here is the nurse, early in the novel, angry that disorder--personalized by McMurphy--has come to her ward: &quot;Her nostrils flare open . . . She works the hinges in her elbows and fingers. I hear a small squeak . . . she's already big as a truck, trailing that wicker bag behind in her exhaust like a semi behind a Jimmy Diesel. Her lips are parted, and her smile's going out before her like a radiator grill. I can smell the hot oil and magneto spark when she goes past.&quot; So can we.The novel is loaded with memorable wit, much of which seems to have entered the daily lexicon. &quot;I wash my hands of the whole deal,&quot; says Ruckly, the nutcase in Disturbed. &quot;I'm TIRED,&quot; says Pete, after the nasty bickering he sees his friends engage in. Most memorable of all is the comment uttered by the relentless McMurphy, disgusted by his ward mates' timidity. &quot;But I tried, though. Goddamnit, I sure as hell did that much, now, didn't I?&quot; Is it possible to say that one has had a satisfactory life simply by being able to say that he has tried? I think so.In the end, the lessons to be learned from this novel are exemplified by the two greatest characters, McMurphy and Harding. (No, the Big Nurse is not one of them, being nothing more than a common symbol of ubiquitous societal rigidity). McMurphy goes out in a blaze of glory and despair, destroying himself, and sadly, destroying others. But it is Harding who goes out on his own terms. &quot;I want to do it on my own, by myself, right out that front door, with all the traditional red tape and complications . . . I want them to know that I was able to do it that way.&quot;Certainly among the ten or so best novels of the latter half of the twentieth century. If you haven't yet read this one, do yourself a favor."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This edition of Ken Kesey's first novel contains the author's sketches of the book's characters. The large format makes for easier reading."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Your horses are hungry, that's what she did sayCome sit down beside me, an' feed them some hayMy horses ain't hungry, they won't eat your hay-ay-aeeSo fare-thee-well darlin', I'm gone on my wayThis is one verse of McMurphy's comically mangled version of that fine old chestnut, The Wagoner's Lad, which he sings in the shower on his first full morning in the laughing academy--a ballad he booms out with such pitch and power that he just about joggles the wiring in all the walls. So sez Chief Broom at any rate and I for one believe him. It still cracks me up that this is the particular song Mister Red-On-The-Head sings as a kind of prelude to his plan to put a burr in the bloomers of Nurse Ratched--a plan that ultimately hinges on man bloomers of his own as a matter of fact, and what hilariously five-alarm man bloomers they are too: \\"coal black satin covered with big white whales with red eyes.\\" Ah, the betsy bug episode--what larfs, eh? I had more or less forgotten how satisfying the reading was in this great big book. And the writing too. Out of sight out of mind I guess but what a joy when it all comes flooding back, wha'? The story is unfolded in this wonderfully sinuous and continuous present tense by Chief Bromden in what amounts in the end to a long and lovely and heartbreaking reminiscence by one of the great undersung characters in all of fiction. Yup, that gentle giant spins a yarn fit for devotees of the nut cutlet everywhere. Look here at this transfixing little word picture from the time when the Chief is up in the middle of one moonlit night getting a faceful of fall through an open window:\\"Something moved on the grounds down beneath my window--cast a long spider of shadow out across the grass as it ran out of sight behind a hedge. When it ran back to where I could get a better look, I saw it was a dog, a young, gangly mongrel slipped off from home to find out about things went on after dark. He was sniffing digger squirrel holes, not with a notion to go digging after one but just to get an idea what they were up to at this hour. He'd run his muzzle down a hole, butt up in the air and tail going, then dash off to another. The moon glistened around him on the wet grass, and when he ran he left tracks like dabs of dark paint spattered across the blue shine of the lawn. Galloping from one particularly interesting hole to the next, he became so took with what was coming off--the moon up there, the night, the breeze full of smells so wild makes a young dog drunk--that he had to lie down on his back and roll. He twisted and thrashed around like a fish, back bowed and belly up, and when he got to his feet and shook himself a spray came off him in the moon like silver scales.\\"Ain't that a sight for sore eyes? If you've seen the flick Milos Forman made it's hard not to picture the big dude they got to play Chief Broom but that's all right I reckon coz the feller they ended up with, Will Sampson, was so good and such a ringer for his fictional counterpart that whoever had the casting here ought to be commended too by God. As a moony yoof I was generally mad for this novel, couldn't get enough of it to be frank, lashed into it on umpteen occasions and swallied it whole and happily each and every time. It tickles me no end now indeed how much of this writing I actually remember with delight--whole paragraphs flash back to me big and bold as life as I re-read them. Don't know about you folks out there but I truly love when that happens with the written word. Reading One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a lot like living only more so somehow. Plus given the dead man walking atmosphere currently fogging up my dadblanged place of work it is a blessed relief to be locked inside a different loony bin for a spell. Kesey's tale is at the close a melancholy one perhaps but there's a generosity of spirit amid all the yearning and desperation here that I find just impossible to resist."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Let me first explain that I can no longer write a long review for Amazon: time after time I have spent an hour writing one only to be cut off before I can even preview it. It is no doubt the fault of my own system-- I am not blaming Amazon-- but in any case, if anyone wants I the full text of this review, they must refer to my blogspot. I shall try to put it in a nutshell, if that is possible: McMurphy seems to me to be the perfect metaphor for the terrorist suspect facing US interrogators today. The techniques used by Nurse Ratched are similar to those developed by the CIA in collusion with unscrupulous doctors. The cornerstone of this method is ECT. It is used in combination with narco-hypnosis, but the latter would not be effective without the erasure of memory which ECT causes. I must note that this book, famous for its depiction of ECT, greatly underrates the dangers inherent in the treatment. For one thing, it does not mention the long-term effects on memory. Secondly, it leaves the impression that ECT is going out of fashion, when in fact it is experiencing an upsurge. Some 100,000 people a year receive the treatment, according to Dr. Peter Breggin. But the most sinister thing about ECT is that was found very effective in creating \\"Manchurian candidates\\" by the CIA, and may now be being used to create \\"phony terrorists\\".

McMurphy arrives, it begins to move more quickly. Kesey succeeds in describing the scene and the emotions of the characters and the events that take place in the novel. The descriptions are so vivid that it makes the reader feel as if they are there with the other patients looking on. The reader is also able to feel what the characters feel through the descriptions. The Big Nurse's emotions and expressions are especially emphasized. Her coldness, fakeness, and domination over the patients are conveyed throughout the novel and are really brought out when she is provoked by McMurphy.The novel is narrated by one of the patients in the asylum, Chief Bromden. Because he is a patient in the mental institution, it is vital for the reader to realize that and not believe everything he says. Bromden is in the institution for a reason and so reality and his imagination are mixed together to form his reality.The main theme of the novel is the struggle for power between authority and normal people, between woman and men."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The $7.99 Signet edition of \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a terrible printing job.

Signet has a lot of nerve producing such a poor quality product."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Okay, so it's difficult to read One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest without being stuck with the image of Jack Nicholson as R.P. McMurphy. Sometimes it seems to me that in this day and age novels hardly seem to have any value by their own right; the luckiest of novels, like this one, get good cinematic adaptations. The rest get bad ones. That makes me just a bit sad.Still, try to overlook everything you know about the story and just read this, and you'll find a masterpiece that is very unique and separate from the wonderful movie. Most importantly, the narrator and protagonist here is not McMurphy but \\"Chief Broom\\" Bromden; that in itself gives anyone who saw the film a fascinating new angle on the story. Bromden is a man who pretends to be deaf and dumb to be left alone by the staff in the mental ward in which he's hospitalized. Through this self-imposed solitude Bromden is a highly astute and accurate observer, and he gives the reader a full and personal account of the arrival of the rebellious new inmate R.P. McMurphy and his war against the management and especially the Big Nurse Ratched; through his ominous dreams and hallucinations he illuminates the nature of life in the ward, and the effect McMurphy's presence has on its routines and inhabitants.Nurse Ratched is hardly a secondary player in this story; she's as central and fascinating a character as Bromden and McMurphy, and the tension between her and the uproarious Irishman makes the novel tick. Once again, brilliant casting and acting - Louise Fletcher as the nurse - made Ratched as well as McMurphy a timeless cinematic character in addition to a literary one. Still, Kesey's presentation of Nurse Ratched through Bromden's simplistic eyes tells you everything you need to know about the woman and her motivation; it also tells you from the very beginning what will happen at the ending, an ending that is inevitable as it is shocking and surprising. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a powerful and captivating read from start to finish, and a difficult and harrowing one too; and if there's some comic relief in there - and there is, rest assured; the novel is often remarkably funny, filled with quirky characters and absurd, nonsensical dialogue - it serves only to make the rest of it all the more powerful. It's a book that's often paired up with A Clockwork Orange as two essential and representative novels of the 1960's, and it's not just because they both got terrific cinematic versions."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Let me start off by saying this book is absolutely incredible. I had to read it for a college English course and, upon finishing, I was left wondering why the hell I had waited so long to read it. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this book. I also saw the movie that, while it was good, can never compare to the book. I've kept the book so that I can reread it in the future. I can honestly say I had moments where I was laughing so hard my face turned red but I also had moments where I was crying so much I could no longer read the print on the pages.Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic anti-authority novel and a pretty good read. The story is told by Chief Bromden, a fragile giant who has delusions about the Combine, a conspiracy that runs the economy and keeps the population under control. In the mental hospital where he lives, the Combine is capably represented by Nurse Ratched, a rather tightly wound mother figure. Using a combination of psychological manipulation, drugs, and shock therapy, she and the rest of the staff keep the inmates in a passive state of acquiescence until her system is upset by the arrival of McMurphy, a red-headed drifter and non-conformist. The point of the book, of course, is to show how socialization processes have a homogenizing, leveling effect. Societies work best when people are interchangeable; exceptional people, or people who can't fit in, are usually not welcome."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is a great description of the United States' mind in the 60's. The United States' mind in the 60's was to be rebellious and to fight the machine. Ken Kesey put this thought into his novel but switched things around such as: The United States is a Insane Asylum, the rebel Is Randle Patrick McMurphy (aka Mack), and the machine is personified as Miss Ratched.An Indian inmate called Chief Bromden tells this book in the first person. He pretends to be deaf and dumb so he can avoid being annoyed by other inmates, and this makes his appearance almost invisible. This is important to the story and the reader he is then able to go into staff meetings that other patients are not allowed in and is then able to know what is going to happen to the other men or the asylum. He has done this ever since he has arrived to the hospital. This changes though after McMurphy arrives.It is hard however in some parts of the story to know if what he is seeing is actually happening since he is insane and has hallucinations at random parts in the novel. This can be confusing and also weird at times. Such as the fog he sees over and over in the asylum.The story picks up right away in the first five pages of reading. It starts with Chief Broom mopping (he helps out with cleaning around the asylum) and then a new inmate is brought into the hospital and is named Randle Mcmurphy. The instant Randle steps in he is automatically taking charge of the inmates and introducing himself as a gamboling man and would like to play with the inmates sometime. Miss Ratched instantly knows McMurphy will be a problem in the ward. \\"That is exactly is what the new patient is planning: to take over. He is what we call a \`manipulator'\\" (Ken Kesey page 29). It then picks up with McMurphy starting to hang out with the Acutes (patients in the ward that have not been there a better part of their lives) and becomes basically their leader. McMurphy is then introduced to group meetings and does not like how they are done, so he then starts to use him into his and other patients advantages such as turning the bathing room into a gamboling room and starting a basketball team. He also does other big things with this advantage but you will have to read to find out.Something though does not settle right with Mack. He notices that No one in the ward was or has ever laughed sense his arrival and that it seemed no one ever spoke or even asked of something to Miss Ratched. He then spoke to one of his better friends (later becomes his best) in the ward: Harding. Harding then starts to tell Mack about the shock therapy treatment and worse the lobotomy that Miss Ratched is capable of using on patients. This then gives McMurphy another reason to get on the Nurse's bad side. After that Randle starts coming up with more and more outrageous stuff to do in the ward.Chief Broom then reminds us about that Miss Ratched has always got the upper hand on things and that if you wanted to win the war with her you cannot win two out of three or three out of five, but you must win them all, then you have your victory.The thing I loved most about this book was how Chief Broom's literature got better as his state of mind got better, such as: in the beginning it is really weird on what is happening or not and that his words were messed up, and as the story progresses his literature gets a whole lot better and he starts using better and more advanced words in his sentences. This change struck me as very cool. Another great thing about this book was the character development, with your antagonist and your other protagonist. These characters also change as the story progresses. The conversations between inmates in this book (especially McMurphy and Harding's) are hysterical and witty. All of these things give the book a very good realism affect.I would suggest this book to anybody who likes reading comedy, adventure, drama, and conversations. Overall this book is one of the greatest of all classics out there to read and enjoy. It is one of my personal favorites. This book made me laugh, cry, get the true meaning of life (but I'm not going to tell), and maybe a little bit of pee came out. It lives up to its name."},{"Title":"To Deliver Me of My Dreams","review":"Elizabeth Avakian writes of the traumas of growing up as a woman in the early 1970's when large numbers of women were just beginning to become aware of what society had done to them growing up thinking that their place was [only] in the home and the only acceptable way to live as an independent being was to do it vicariously through some man.What particularly stood out for me was her pointing out the (probably well known) way in which the heroines of Shakespeare's comedies, &quot;all of whom are far superior to their male counterparts,&quot; dress as men in order to accomplish things which were forbidden to them otherwise (giving as an example Portia in the Merchant of Venice).The chapter titles are telling:I.

Having nothing apparently in common, besides being losers, each of our heroes suddenly discovers that the key to their salvation may be waiting for them in Paris where America, China and Russia have gathered to hold disarmament talks. For Matt, it means the chance to reunite with a Soviet diplomat who can prove Matt was not to blame for allowing an American nuclear scientist to defect to China. For Emmett, it means the chance to talk an embittered and dying German munitions magnate out of publishing memoirs that will hold the ex-president accountable for allowing the Chinese a nuclear arsenal. For Jay, it means reuniting with Hazel and uncovering proof she hinted at years earlier of Russian involvement in the Kennedy assasination, proof that will bring Jay back the journalistic stardom now only a memory. For Hazel, it means the chance to scoop her competitors and escape Jay's shadow.

For Matt, it means the chance to reunite with a Soviet diplomat who can prove Matt was not to blame for allowing the Chinese a toe-hold in the nuclear club; For Emmett, it means the chance to talk an embittered and dying German munitions magnate out of publishing memoirs that will hold the ex-president accountable for allowing the Chinese a nuclear arsenal; For Jay, it means reuniting with Hazel and uncovering proof she hinted at years earlier of Russian involvement in the Kennedy assassination, proof that will bring Jay back the journalistic stardom now only a memory; For Hazel, it means the chance to scoop her competitors and escape Jay's shadow; And for Medora, it means that Paris will be full of British diplomats, including the one who tricked her into leaving England and then yanked her citizenship.None of our heroes connects their plight to the underlying summit that has drawn diplomats of the world's most powerful nations to Paris to decide the fate of the world.

In this tale, Holmes is reduced to a semi-deranged cocaine addict in desperate need of mental help.The amount of plot in this book is about the same as one of Doyle's short stories. A tacked-on chase sequence at the end seems out of place, but since the author is a screenwriter, it is perhaps not surprising.But the worst of all is this, revealed right at the start of the book: Professor Moriarty, Holmes' most dangerous enemy in the real stories, is reduced here to a meek, ordinary schoolteacher. What a ridiculous and depressing idea! I kept waiting for the real Moriarty to show up, but no. Meyer's Holmes has no brilliant enemy to challenge him, just a boring cocaine addiction.

I have read many Sherlock Holmes novels and I must say I was really disappointed with this one. I just couldn't get into it at all. I felt the characterization was way off and the story line unbelievable. I think what first turned me off was that the author made Moriarty to be a good guy...that it was Holmes' cocaine addiction that led him to believe that Moriarty was his evil nemesis.Having no knowledge of what the novel was even about before I picked it up to read, I had to put it down when I read that Holmes was tricked into going to see Dr. Sigmund Freud. I mean come on. This novel is not without some good moments however. So if you're a Holmes and Watson fan, I wouldn't highly suggest this book but once again, I still applaud this author for his efforts.

Watson, M.D.","review":"This was the first novel I read that wasn't the writing of Sir Doyle, and, quite frankly, it was the worst. Meyer doesn't seem to be familiar with the Holmes's world. His Holmes is a weak hearted one; he is hooked on Cocaine. Yea, sure, Doyle's Holmes was hooked on Cocaine (that is what is meant by the seven-per-cent solution), but he never showed it as a weak point.Doyle's Holmes was able to take Cocaine whenever he wanted, and could easily quit it whenever he pleased, and, surprisingly, his addiction to Cocaine was only mentioned in the \\"sign of four,\\" so I don't really approve of Meyer's usage of it, and I do not really accept Holmes as a meager guy.Then, Meyer says, out of the blues, that \\"The Final Problem\\" was a forgery that Watson needed to assert in order to hide more interesting occurrences. What was the occurrences? It was trying to get Holmes out of the habit of using Cocaine ... Pshaw!He also claims that Moriarty was Holmes's math tutor, that Holmes's mother left his father, and that was why he hated women. He even describes Moriarty as a peace loving man, and that Holmes was blinded by Cocaine when he claimed that Moriarty was a villain.For Meyer to say that one of the stories written by Doyle is a forgery is a big mistake. Would any one of you say that the best Holmes's stories ever written, were written by anyone other than Doyle? This is ridiculous.One other aspect I hated about this story was that it inserts real existing people to the plot, like Freud! Aside from being dumb, this is really uninteresting. This makes the book a study of human thinking, not a mystery, which is the real essence of the Holmes's stories.Of course you figured out that Freud was supposed to be the one to make Holmes quit Cocaine ... I can say only one thing, \\"DUMB.\\"Near the end Meyer stoops to give us some mystery, sorry not a mystery but some wannabe thriller. It ends in a man hunt looking mostly like the one presented by Doyle in the \\"Sign of Four,\\" but on board of a train. I did not like it either.At the end, Holmes saves Vienna and then returns back home having had the silliest adventure in his carrier.

Watson, M.D.","review":"First, the review from &quot;henry@coombs.anu.edu.au&quot; contains several mistakes. Lestrade does not appear in &quot;The Valley Of Fear&quot;, and that story is a prequel to &quot;The Adventure Of The Final Problem&quot;. Second, it is probable that Watson altered events in FP in order that it would appear as though it was his first look at Moriarty, since it was the reader's as well. By &quot;Valley Of Fear&quot;, readers know who it is, so it is unnecessary to do the same thing. Watson has plainly stated that he altered facts to make stories suitable for the reading public. Third, there is no &quot;official&quot; Holmes continuity. You accept what you, the reader, wish to accept. Nothing more. I disagree with his thoughts on the later Doyle stories, but that is a matter of opinion.That said, this is a great book which does what Doyle never bothered to do; make the narrative an intense character study where we find out some of the deepest corners of Holmes' mind. This is Sherlock Holmes at it's best, filled with splendid characterization and a cunning mystery. The drama is this story is incredible; Holmes' confrontation with Sigmund Freud is heartstopping, and his moments of weakness are heartbreaking. There are also many nice touches that warm a reader's heart, like examining Watson and his wife, Mary Morstan, and her references to &quot;brandy and soda&quot; and calling him &quot;Jack&quot;.The mystery is also quite good, and appears halfway through the book (but does not forget to deal with Holmes' addiction). There are moments of high drama and action which are integrated nicely and paced swiftly. Holmes' deductions are excellent and well thought out.If you have ever felt that Doyle's stories lacked emotional investment for the reader, then this is the book to read.Doyle was an excellent writer, but he did not truly understand what a wonderful character he had created in Sherlock Holmes. He saw him as merely a calculating machine, perhaps never noticing the hidden passion that he placed within the character; the kindness and heart within Holmes.But Nicholas Meyer did.And he displayed it in a novel that was a bestseller, that led to a feature film, and revitalized Holmes in the late twentieth century. With creators like these, with people that care so deeply about him, Sherlock Holmes will survive for another hundred years.Final notes. Meyer is the director of several movies, including the movie adaptation of this novel, and a few Star Trek movies.This book does have it's mistakes, and one is that if Moriarty is what he is in this novel, then &quot;Final Problem&quot;, &quot;Empty House&quot; and &quot;Valley Of Fear&quot; are lies that slander an innocent, if annoying man."},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H. Watson, M.D.","review":"Brilliantly done. I've been reading Doyle's Holmes stories for nearly thirty years; I read Meyer's _Seven Per Cent Solution_ when it was new and I still have my original copy. I've also read some of the other attempts to bring Holmes to life again in full-length novels, and in my own view Meyer is the only one who nails it.Indeed he even improves on the original tales in some respects. His account of what _really_ happened between &quot;The Final Problem&quot; and &quot;The Empty House&quot; has the ring of plausibility, and it does far greater credit to Watson than many of Doyle's stories do.Especially in the later stories, Doyle tended to treat Watson as an inept dunderhead, a practice unfortunately followed by some of his blinder imitators. Meyer's take is that Watson employed artistic license in order to bring out the brilliance of his companion, but that the real Watson couldn't have been such an incompetent idiot if he was both a trained medical man and the valued companion of the world's first consulting detective.So in this &quot;rediscovered&quot; manuscript, Meyer does both of these Victorian gentlemen proud. The novel -- which is both an adventure and a warmly humane tale of Holmes's and Watson's friendship -- is sprinkled with touching scenes of genuine affection between the two lifelong friends; the good Watson finally gets his due as a companion and as a human being, and the not-so-bloodless-after-all Holmes comes vividly to life as well. One of the most moving moments (there are many) comes in Holmes's remark to Watson: &quot;Never let them say you were merely my Boswell, Watson. Never let them say that.&quot;I won't tell you where and when that remark occurs, and in general I won't spoil the novel for anyone who hasn't read it yet. But it's the sort of Holmes pastiche that reviewers like to describe as a &quot;corking good read,&quot; and in this case they're right. Moreover, Meyer relies on the very best Holmesian scholarship (notably William S. Baring-Gould) on matters of chronology and other detail, though I'm sure some of the Baker Street Irregulars will be able to pick nits. If you enjoyed Doyle's stories, you'll love this one -- and _The West End Horror_, too. (I was less impressed by _The Canary Trainer_.)[P.S. Most of you probably already know this, but just in case somebody doesn't: Yes, this is the very same Nicholas Meyer who directed the best of the _Star Trek_ movies. You'll find a bit of Holmes homage in _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_, which Meyer helped to script. Spock even quotes Holmes's dictum that &quot;when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth&quot; -- attributing it to one of his &quot;ancestors.&quot;Meyer also scripted and directed the film version of _The Seven Per Cent Solution_ -- which isn't as good as the book, I think, but the cast is terrific, especially Robert Duvall and Alan Arkin.]"},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H. Watson, M.D.","review":"There are two sorts of Sherlock Holmes pastiche. The first is written by people who like the original stories and wish there were more of them; so they try to duplicate them, to surreptitiously insert an extra bit of short fiction into the canon. If a writer does this and no more the result will almost certainly be a failure. (This is contingent. It would be nice if there were more Sherolock Holmes stories, and it would be nice if someone could practice direct mimickry; but no-one can.) Conan Doyle himself was reduced to doing this sort of thing by the 1920s, and the results were pallid.But there is another way. The original stories, as we all know, are peppered with oddities, allusions to untold events, and, more than anything else, flat contradictions. A good pastiche will make a meal of the oddities, fill out the allusions, and, in this case, explain away the contradictions. A good pastiche does not merely augment, but also extends, what has gone before.So consider \\"The Final Problem\\" and \\"The Valley of Fear\\". In the former story Holmes mentions - for the first time - the criminal mastermind of all London, Professor Moriarty, who in the end dies. In \\"The Valley of Fear\\" Holmes mentions Moriarty as still living, and Watson and Lestrade speak as if Holmes talks about Moriarty all the time. A contradiction right away. Moreover, one would think that \\"The Napoleon of Crime\\" would feature more prominently in Watson's tales about London's greatest detective. Moreover still, a penetrating analysis by a good friend of mine reveals the the apparently solid \\"The Final Problem\\" to be one of the most ludicrous Holmes stories in existence.Meyer solves all this by supposing Holmes's cocaine addiction (mentioned in \\"The Sign of Four\\") generated paranoid delusions about the perfectly harmless Moriarty; which, of course, necessitates a meeting with Dr. Sigmund Freud. (I have no doubt that Freud in this novel is totally unlike the real Freud, but criticims based on this fact are misguided. Meyer's Freud is exactly the sort of man who inhabits the Sherlock Holmes universe.) Meyer's solution to Moriarty ought to be made official.The novel suffers from a lack of real meat when Holmes gets around to detecting again, and the kind of climax which looks ahead to the film version rather than behind to the nineteenth century. But all in all, THE pastiche to read."},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H. Watson, M.D.","review":"Overall worth buying. Not as good as an original Sherlock Holmes story although which book really can be? This may just be bias on my part as I love the originals. I think it is difficult to create a \\"new\\" Sherlock story that captures the magic(for lack of a descriptive enough word) of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories. This book succeeds in telling an interesting story one that to me was well written in the sense that it did not feel like it tried to hard to copy the language or format of earlier stories. I could say more I am sure but bottom line is if you enjoy Sherlock Holmes and like me have read through the originals and still want more then this book is definitely worth looking into."},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H. Watson, M.D.","review":"The first of two Sherlock Holmes pastiches authored by Nicholas Meyer, The Seven Percent Solution expands on the original works' brief references to Holmes' cocaine use and undertakes a full-blown examination of what turns out to have been his very severe addiction. Turns out Holmes didn't really plunge over Reichenbach Falls in a deadly tussle with Professor Moriarty after all. That story was just Watson's smoke screen to cover for Holmes' addiction and cure. OK, interesting twist.Watson has to trick Holmes into going to Vienna to be treated by a controversial doctor with controversial ideas, Sigmund Freud, of course. Meyer does a nice job keeping the reader guessing whether Holmes is in a drug-induced paranoid state or is pulling the wool (again) over Watson's eyes. That question is resolved once they arrive in Vienna. Of course, once in Vienna, Holmes and Watson become enmeshed in solving a heinous, but clever, set of crimes involving Viennese society.Along the way Meyer works in a number of answers to unsolved issues raised by the original works but left unanswered. Early in the book the references to these conundrums are so frequent that the book begins to take on a scholarly feel. [That is not a plus, in my view. If you want scholarly (if somewhat tongue-in-cheek) analyses, they are available.] As a confirmed addict of the originals and of numerous knockoffs, that sort of thing would seemingly appeal to me, but it struck me as a bit overly cute. And much of the story itself was decidedly unlike the Doyle tales - too much action for one thing. Meyer does not, I hasten to add, totally distort Holmes and Watson like the recent abomination of a movie.Most Holmes fans will enjoy this effort and may want to proceed to theThe West End Horror: A Posthumous Memoir of John H.

Watson, M.D.","review":"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution is a Sherlock Holmes novel, but not by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Nicholas Meyer, the author claims to be the editor of these reminiscences of John H. Watson, M.D. In his Foreward he tells how the original manuscript was found in an attic in 1970. Then in an Introductory chapter Dr. Watson relates why, in his 87th year (1939), he undertook the task of writing once more of the exploits of Sherlock Holmes. He claims he was sworn to secrecy until one of the main characters of the story passed away. Thus begins a post-Doyle Holmes tale which tries to give the fictional characters of Holmes and Watson a greater claim to reality by entangling them with actual real people of their time.The story begins with Holmes seeking out Watson, convinced that his arch-enemy Professor Moriarty is hot on his trail and out to kill him with air guns. Dr. Watson finds that Holmes cocaine habit has become worse and, instead of being in danger of attack, he is delusional from his addiction. Seeking help from Sherlock's brother Mycroft, they devise a plan to lure Holmes to Vienna and into the care of Dr. Sigmund Freud. Freud successfully uses hypnosis to break the addiction, but it takes the strange case of a catatonic woman who escaped abduction and captivity only to attempt suicide to revive Holmes's spirit.Written with a sense of humor that will upset traditionalists, this story is a rousing, if not accurate, portrayal of Holmes that will entertain readers of post-Doyle Holmesiana. The Freud-Holmes relationship is well-portrayed as is the character of Dr. Watson. Serious Holmes scholars may find the author's portrayals of Mycroft Holmes and Professor Moriarty shocking, but I don't think this book was written with them in mind.Later made into a movie that was nominated for two Academy Awards, this novel is an enjoyable read, but the visual effects of the movie really brought it to life.

Like I said, I like the approach, and the author does a pretty good job of copying Watson's writing style. In fact he makes excuses for himself at the beginning, saying he's an old man and perhaps his writing isn't what it once was...very clever from the author.The actual case isn't as satisfying as the concept of mad Sherlock out of his mind on cocaine...it's okay, but the addition of a certain famous psychiatrist [psychologist?] is stretching things a bit.

Soon, &quot;The Game is Afoot!,&quot; and a recovering Holmes, Watson, and Dr. Freud are off to solve the mystery.Can't recommend this highly enough, and also recommend the movie based on the book."},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H. Watson, M.D.","review":"I decided to read this book based upon the positive critiques it was given on Amazon and other sites. I was hoping to indulge myself in another good Sherlock Holmes caper, but this book didn't satisfy. My main complaint is that the story, the plot, is so bogged down with details, and explanations that slowly wore me down. Scattered throughout the book Meyer includes references at the bottom of the page, providing more information, proof texts, or references...none of which, IMHO, enhance or further the plot. I felt that all of this extraneous information and detail was given to give the impression that this was actually Dr. Watson who penned this account.As an example, on page 17 (in my version)Watson is contemplating if he should wake Holmes to check for needle marks...\\"...but it was best not to risk waking him.\\" (next para)\\"I resumed my chair and thought. In the past I had known Holmes to go on cocaine \\"binges,\\" sometimes of a month's duration or more, during which time he would inject himself thrice daily with a seven-per-cent solution.\\"This is all fine, but then he continues this narrative for two(plus)paragraphs providing information that only bogs down the story - for me anyway. He continues...\\"Many readers have erroneously supposed that Holmes made use of our friendship so that I as a doctor might procure his supply of this terrible narcotic. Recently, I have even heard it postulated that my willingness to supply Holmes with this drug...It was by no means illegal, and therefor my own reluctance or willingness...\\"(next para)\\"For certain periods, indeed, I had been successful-or, not I so much as my powers of persuasion in conjunction with the arrival of a new and absorbing case...\\"... and on and on.Those two paragraphs (and perhaps another) in that portion could easily have been removed with no detraction to the story - it would keep it moving actually. I have read all of the original Sherlock Holmes stories at least twice, and \\"Watson's\\" writing style was much more succinct and provided enough detail to keep the story moving and that kept one's interest.As a result I soon lost interest. Now I know that many really loved this book. And perhaps my critique is somewhat unfair, and a result of overlooking the point of this book when it states, \\"Being a Reprint from the Reminiscences of John H. Watson, M.D.\\" For it does read as a reminiscence rather than a detective story from the annals of Dr. Watson. So if you're seeking to immerse yourself into another exciting case with Sherlock Holmes and Dr.Watson, then pass this up. My next book will be \\"Exploits of Sherlock Holmes\\" by Sir Adrian Conan Doyle and John Dickson Carr. I hope that book will satisfy my craving."},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H. Watson, M.D.","review":"THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION is a story unparalleled in the annals of criminal detection. Discovered in Hampshire, England, where it had lain neglected since 1939, then painstakingly researched and annotated for two years by editor Nicholas Meyer, THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION marks the first publication of a heretofore unknown and astounding episode in the career of Sherlock Holmes as recorded by his closest friend and chronicler, Dr. John H. Watson.Even more remarkable than the historic discovery of Watson's transcript are the revelations it contains concerning the real identity of the heinous Professor Moriarity, the dark secret shared by Sherlock and brother Mycroft Holmes, and the detective's true whereabouts and activities during the Great Hiatus when the world believed him dead.Most astounding of all, THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION details the events that led to the meeting in Vienna of the world's two most brilliant investigators and their collaboration on a sensational case of diabolic conspiracy.John Hamish Watson was born in England in 1847. After a childhood spent abroad, he returned in 1872 and enrolled in the University of London Medical School, where he took his degree six years later. After finishing the course at Netley prescribed for Army surgeons, he was attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers and sent to India. Severly wounded by a Jezail bullet at the Battle of Maiwand during the Second Afghan War, in 1880, he returned to England, his health ruined, with no specific plans other than to live as best he could on his Army pension. In January of the following year, quite by accident, he met Sherlock Holmes, who was then looking for someone to share his lodgings. The ensuing friendship, which lasted until Holmes' death found Watson his niche as the great detective's biographer through more than sixty cases. In his spare time he resumed the practice of medicine. In 1889 he married Mary Morstan. He died in Britain in 1940."},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H. Watson, M.D.","review":"Being a big fan of Sherlock Holmes stories and pastiches of the character, I felt that it was necessary to read this book which is considered one of the better of the Holmes pastiches. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this book was. I feared that it might be demeaning to the character of Holmes, however it was anything but that.It all begins in 1891. Sherlock Holmes is in the middle of his horrible habit of using a seven-per-cent solution of cocaine which worries Dr. Watson a great deal. So Watson, Mycroft Holmes and even Watson's wife (Miss Mary Morstan) plan to trick Holmes into visiting Dr. Sigmund Freud in Germany. Once there, Holmes strikes up a friendship with Freud and soon the detective, the good doctor and the renowned medical man set out to stop a international conspiracy.I found Nicholas Meyer's writing style to be very close with Arthur Conan Doyle's. He also portrayed Sherlock Holmes well too, and not like some lesser authors would have done. I truly felt sorry for Watson in the beginning of the narrative when Holmes hardly even knows him due to his addiction, and the terrible toll it has on the detective.Another interesting point which I thought was interesting in this story was the portrayal of Professor James Moriarty. Of course, Moriarty was the man who killed Sherlock Holmes in Doyle's \\"The Final Problem\\". However, here Moriarty is a weak old man who Holmes is persecuting in the midst of his addiction.In all, this was an excellent book which is part study of Sherlock Holmes, and part rip-roaring mystery. If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes and have not read this book yet, I suggest it. I assuredly have plans to read Meyer's follow-up novels, \\"The West End Horror\\" and \\"The Canary Trainer\\"."},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H. Watson, M.D.","review":"May not be an authentic Sherlock Holmes book but all in all its a great story. Depicting Holmes in a way that you wouldn't likely see him in. At the very least, it's very entertaining."},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H. Watson, M.D.","review":"The title of my review is taken from Chapter 5 of Part One of this novel...as it seemed fitting, considering what the 'seven per cent solution' of the title refers to, which is the cocaine addiction of Sherlock Holmes which his friend and companion, Dr. John Watson, endeavors to help release him from...which begins the 'journey through the fog' of the drug addicted mind of Sherlock Holmes.Having read only one true Conan-Doyle Holmes adventure thus far, that being The Sign of the Four; this novel represents my fourth 'Holmes' story....the others all having been written long after Conan-Dolye's death. Of this particular novel I can say that it truly does live up to the original thrill that Conan-Doyle created with the 'World's Greatest Detective'.In this bit of Holmes pastiche, the detective's mortal enemy, Professor Moriarty, comes to Watson with a dilemma.....that he is, in fact, the persecuted party....being maligned by none other than Holmes himself for 'crimes' of which he is entirely innocent.Watson and Holmes' brother, Mycroft; finding credibility to Moriarty's claim, decide that it is long past time to help Sherlock overcome his cocaine addiction, which has apparently transformed the innocent Moriarty into the monster that Holmes imagines him to be.Thereby, the game is afoot as Watson and Mycroft attempt to trick the most intuitive and observing man in the world...no easy feat.The story is every bit as much as page turner as I found The Sign of Four to be. For lovers of the adventures of the resident of Baker Street, London; give this 'continuation' of his legend a chance. I will certainly be searching out the other two Holmes novels from author Nicholas Meyer for future enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H. Watson, M.D.","review":"The extant reviews describe the story to an extent slightly short of uploading an e-version of this classic. This forces me to refrain from saying anything but the following:1. Meyer's writing is superb and way better than some other \\"writers\\" who defile Doyle by writing Sherlockian adventures in ghastly language & style;2. The story is taut and very exciting;3. Somehow, the end evokes the image of the wisest and the best man walking into the sunset all alone.Please read this work, if you like to see Sherlock Holmes as a human being who rose to become the immortal archetype of everything logical. Also read it if you want to immerse yourself in a story that explains a lot and yet, leaves a lot to imagine about."},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H. Watson, M.D.","review":"A fine read which purports to tell a lost tale from Watson's deathbed. As Watson is dying, a kindly nurse writes his tale as he dictates. This original beginning is the author's device for explaining away the differences in literary styles between this and an ACD read. Holmes has developed a debilitating cocaine habit which Watson wishes to break him of. Watson attempts to contrive a way to get Holmes help, but cannot think of a way to outsmart the master. Watson enjoins Mycroft to trick Holmes into traveling to Vienna under the guise of tracking Moriarty. There, Sigmund Freud helps Watson break Holmes of his cocaine habit. A mystery is of course dropping in their laps and adventure quickly ensues."},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H. Watson, M.D.","review":"I highly recommend this to all Sherlockians! This is the first non-ACD Holmes story that I've ever read and found this tale, even though it showed a side of Holmes never shown by ACD, greatly captured the true-to-Holmes writing style that so many authors fail to capture."},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H. Watson, M.D.","review":"Man, was this a disappointment. Nicholas Meyer's \\"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\\" starts with a killer premise: Sherlock Holmes' occasional indulgence in cocaine to stimulate his senses has exploded into an uncontrollable addiction, and the Professor Moriarty Holmes confronts during this period is not a nefarious criminal puppetmaster but an innocent old math teacher under persecution by Holmes's increasingly paranoid mind. That's what John Watson is told at the outset, anyhow, and the man sees that's it's up to him not only to find the truth, if any, behind Holmes's drug-fueled rantings of conspiracy but to find his friend deliverance from the narcotic that has taken hold of his brilliant mind.Watson frames the case as the real story behind Holmes's long disappearance after \\"The Final Problem,\\" one he could never tell while his friend was alive (Meyer bills it as a lost manuscript Watson churned out years later in a retirement home that was never found till the seventies ). The alternate take on one of the lower points in Holmes's career initially seemed tailor-made for me - I liked Watson's wife Mary Morstan, here a capable collaborator in Watson's desperate investigation/rescue attempt; I found the great villain Moriarty a dud and think the conceit that maybe he didn't really exist except in Holmes's mind is a possibility with much more potential; and it seems natural to me that being the support system for a man as exhausting, prickly, and idiosyncratic as Holmes could be would demand greater reserves of resilience, wisdom, and human understanding than Doyle ever acknowledged Watson to have on page. For the first fifty pages or so, watching Watson grapple with how to execute his initial idea - getting Holmes to a doctor in Vienna he hears specializes in treating addiction - was tense and intriguing, and I relished a story where Watson, not Holmes, was the protagonist, where Watson was forced to match wits against his friend in an effort to save him. Sad to say, the story collapses from there.The doctor in Vienna turns out to be Sigmund Freud. The prologue with Watson was a mere smokescreen; Meyer's real purpose in writing \\"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\\" is to fanboy how Freud is soooooo much better than Holmes OMG with all the subtlety of a fanfic about Goku beating up Superman. After his pasteboard Holmes is brought suitably low before Freud, the cocaine business is quickly dispensed with so that Meyer plunge into his Freud-Holmes superstar crossover teamup, yet he can concoct no better problem for them to tackle than a routine kidnapped-noblewoman yarn, which the respective fathers of ratiocination and psychoanalysis solve largely through a) playing tennis and b) shoveling coal into a furnace. Watson is most disappointingly kicked backseat to his typical role as Greek chorus of fatuous adoration, and the tale loses not only its sympathetic, stirring protagonist and intriguing hook of an inversion of the Holmes mythos but also most of its narrative steam through stopping and then having to restart a third of the way into the proceedings. I wish someone would make a fanfic of this fanfic, running with its fascinating premise instead of abandoning it for a trite Gary Stu fantasy.Oh, and as for that big personal revelation: ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, _please._"},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H. Watson, M.D.","review":"I enjoyed this more than I expected: the entire premise of Freud vs Holmes seemed ridiculous, but the author makes it work fantastically. It's fascinating to imagine an alternate reality on Moriarty, and I was provoked with real sympathy for Holmes' unhealthy addiction. If you've read the canons & have a craving for more Holmes, this is HIGHLY recommended over any other Holmes \\"fan-written\\" books."},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H.

It is a fun, fast read that attempts to resolve the Moriarty issue. There is a sequence that does seem a bit tailored to a movie adaptation but not any more so than some of the real Holmes stories. Hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Seven-per-cent Solution, Being A Reprint From The Reminiscences Of John H.

But the book is really interesting take - particularly Freud and Holmes taking turns at helpign each other was pleasantly done and interesting. Gave it one star less because of the train fight towards the end -very long drawn and unncessary, made it like a swashbuckler historical. The ending has a very unexpected twist to it. Overall the character of Holmes and Watson have been maintained and it is fast paced and well written."},{"Title":"Maigret and the bum","review":"As others have written elsewhere (seeThe Madman of Bergerac), George Simenon was a prolific author of over 100 Maigret novels and many other darker psychological investigations that he called 'romans durs' or 'hard novels' (see Simenon'sDirty Snow (New York Review Books Classics)).Set in Paris, as nearly all Maigret stories are, 'Maigret and the Bum', published in 1963, comes fairly late in the series. Maigret does not live outside of time. He shows signs of weariness and a desire to reflect back on days of a more vigorous youth as he strolls along the Seine in the book's opening pages. A down-and-out bum has had his skull cracked and been thrown in the river.Maigret is there to investigate. Rescued by two rivermen, the bum survives and Maigret learns much about the man's past - he is, or was, a doctor. Who would try to kill a down-and-outer? Does the man's distant past hold the answer? Or was it something more recent? Can Maigret get to the bottom of it? Well, yes, but can he get the truth out of the perpetrator.Simenon unwinds the tale in a way that compels the reader to rush to the finish; the book is only 147 pages and so the task is not so difficult. Having finished one Maigret tale, the reader wants more of Maigret's compressed psychology."},{"Title":"Maigret and the bum","review":"Although not commonly heard of nowadays (in the English speaking world at least) Georges Simenon was a very prolific writer of the detective genre, most famous for his Maigret series (with well over a hundred books stretching from 1931 all the way to 1972!!). Maigret is basically a French response to detectives like Sherlock Holmes. Not as interested in physical evidence and the rational, he seeks to understand the characters behind the cases and their often tragic lives. Maigret has an aspect of humanism and warmth throughout the books, especially for those less fortunate in French society. His cases present an element of uncertainty that is natural when dealing with people and are thus much more realistic than Sherlock Holmes type stories (although less satisfying \\"logically\\").In this particular book Maigret investigates what others would probably have dismissed as a nothing case. The attempted murder of a vagrant fails as he is fished out of the river. Who would want to kill a homeless mand and who cares anyway? But contrary to this common attitude of his environment, Maigret treats this case as one of primary importance. We see Maigret's warmth and humanity as he uncovers the life of Tubib, his family that he left and the circumstances that led to this seemingly petty case.The Maigret novels may not be profound literature but they are extremely well written, compassionate and involving detective stories."},{"Title":"Maigret and the bum","review":"A vagrant sleeping under a Paris bridge is brutally attacked and thrown into the Seine. He is rescued by two bargemen and Inspector Maigret is brought in to investigate the attempted murder. Who is the vagrant and why was he attacked? Another classic set up for an Inspector Maigret novel.I recently finished reading \\"Maigret and the Yellow Dog\\" which was written in 1931, near the very beginning of the series. It was very interesting to see how Georges Simenon was beginning to create the character of Jules Maigret. It was a good story but one discovers that Inspector Maigret had not yet become fully realized. In contrast, \\"Maigret and the Bum\\" was written in 1962 and George Simenon had over thrity years of working on the Inspector Maigret character. In this novel, Simenon is much more in control. The writing is more fluid and Maigret's interior world is more developed.Simenon wrote 75 Inspector Maigret novels and over 500 million copies have been sold. \\"Maigret and the Bum\\" is well written but it is not one of his classic, five star Maigret stories. For those who love the series, this is an ejoyable story. For someone new to Inspector Maigret there are better stories in which to become acquainted with the venerable inspector."},{"Title":"Maigret and the bum","review":"As the previous reviewer indicates, this book and others in the Maigret series are about humanity, smells, sights and intuition even more than physical clues. Maigret doesn't get his man in this story. But, the book is still a sheer pleasure to read. I couldn't put it down until I had finished it."},{"Title":"Maigret and the bum","review":"This is my first Simenon novel and, having spent a pleasant two days in Maigret's company, not likely to be my last. I can only hope that Simenon's other books have the same combination of tight plotting, sharply drawn scenes, unforgettably real characters, and deep psychological insight that were on display in \\"Maigret and the Bum.\\" If so, I'm in for a long and satisfying literary relationship: there are something like a hundred of these Simenon novels.This is a \\"mystery\\" novel where the mystery is a vehicle for a meditation on life and human nature, where the detective stands in for the philosopher. Less a whodunit in the contemporary sense, Maigret parses out the clues in the crime at hand as methodically as Socrates takes apart an opponent's argument. The crime is an attack on a homeless man living under a bridge on the Seine. Why would anyone want to murder a bum? What possible motive could there be that would be worth the risk? As for the victim, well, he refuses to help Maigret identify his attacker, even though Maigret is almost certain he knows who tried to kill him. Why won't he identify his would-be killer? Wouldn't you? Isn't it simple human nature to do so?It's the answers to these questions, these human \\"mysteries\\" that are really what concerns Simenon the most, what constitute the real mysteries at the heart of this novel.Readers who are looking for conventional resolutions, black-and-white judgments, shoot'em ups, and justice always done by novel's end may not be satisfied with the conclusion of \\"Maigret and the Bum,\\" but for those who are okay with ambiguity and enigma, who don't need a mystery tied up with a neat bow at the end, this book will provide you with food for thought--far more satisfying fare than what you're usually served up in genre fiction."},{"Title":"Maigret and the bum","review":"A vagrant is knocked on the head and thrown into the Seine, and two bargemen pull him out. Maigret is perplexed. Down-and-outs in Paris mind their own business, and violence among them is rare.Maigret examines the vagrant's sleeping quarters under a bridge and finds books and a medical journal. The other vagrants call the victim \\"doc.\\"How did a learned doctor end up a rag-and-bone man? Why the murderous attack? There's no media interest in this affair and no pressure from above to solve the case. After all, the victim is a bum, and may survive in any case. But Maigret has taken a liking to the doc and won't rest until he knows the truth.Madame Maigret undertakes some unofficial inquiries for her husband in this case. The glimpse we get of the comfortable love between these two is quite delightful."},{"Title":"The Glad Tidings: Studies in Galatians","review":"In the Autumn of 1888, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a young man delivered a series of lectures on the book of Galatians to a group of Seventh-day Adventist ministers and church leaders.The young man was an evangelist, a medical doctor, and co-editor of the Signs of the Times. His name was Ellet J. Waggoner. In his audience sat Ellen G. White.\\"Dr. Waggoner has spoken to us in a straightforward manner. There is precious light in what he has said.\\" she wrote about the meetings. \\"I want to receive every ray of light that God shall send me, though it should come through the humblest of His servants.\\"Waggoner's message rocked the newly organized church at it's foundations.

I recommend you avoid this edition."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"What was true thousands of years ago is true today. The book teaches you the simple principles that can turn your life around. Most of us in the culture of debt feel that we need to consume in order to be happy. We spend every dollar we earn, and more. TV commercials are trying to lure us into getting a new car loan. Don't! We spend everything, then we blame the government and protest when we fail. We should replace socialist principles with the timeless principles taught in this book. This book will enable each one of us to take charge of our own financial future. Socialism turns us into dependents; The Richest Men In Babylon will turn us into independent individuals. What would you rather be?This book is an eye opener. Today, I get my paycheck and, the first thing I do, I run to the bank and pay myself. I will NOT invest a penny less than 10% of my gross earnings. I am currently investing on CDs so I can build up a necessary safety net. I realize that you lose to inflation with savings accounts and certificate of deposits; however, you must build a decent emergency fund first, and you will be amazed at how fast you will change your finances around if you start living by the principles of this book. This book should be mandatory in school; however, our school system is doing a terrible job educating our kids. They should replace socialism 101 with The Richest Men In Babylon.You must invest 10% of your gross earnings, not net earnings. We have a different tax structure than they had thousands of years ago. For example, tax withholding didn't start in the United States until the WWII; therefore, it is safe to assume that the man from Babylon would invest 10% of his gross pay. You will have made the transition when you start enjoying watching your money grow as much or more than you like, say, the smell of a new car, or any other material thing that you buy. When we buy something, we are making other people richer.My story: It was at the time when the housing bubble was about to explode when I decided to change. We sold our house for more than it was appraised and bought a cheaper house with a 35% down payment. I used the leftover from the equity to pay off three car loans. Banks were willing to let me buy a mansion, but I bought a cheaper house. That was the best decision of my life! I got a 15-year mortgage and had enough money left to make a full payment every two weeks. Soon I was ahead six months with my mortgage payments, and eventually a full year. Today, four years later, I have fired my mortgage company and have ZERO debt. My debt to income ratio is now 0% for the first time ever. I live the dream of owning my own home. I have achieved it by living well below my means. I believe in the book's 10% rule with all my heart."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"The Richest Man in Babylon first appeared on the scene in 1926 as a series of informational pamphlets on basic financial management. By 1927, several of these pamphlets had been compiled into a book and this collection has been in print ever since.In short, The Richest Man in Babylon is a series of financial parables. These stories are set in ancient Babylon and relate the story of a Babylonian regular guy who used some basic financial sense and built up a great deal of wealth.What's so great about that, you ask? The stories are laid out like Aesop's fables: each story has a concrete point or two that becomes apparent from reading and digesting the message. These points are basic tenets of how to get ahead financially in any time, not just in Babylonian times or in the 1920s.This book is perfect if you learn by reading the experiences of others. The entire book is told in a story-like format, so it often goes down much like reading a collection of short stories. The language is a bit strange, as the author attempts to sound like this is an authentic tale from the ancient days, but the messages are as clear as sunlight.Seven Cures for a Lean PurseSince The Richest Man in Babylon is divided up into several short stories of varying degrees of quality, I thought I would review in great detail the one story that I found the most compelling.The tale \\"Seven Cures for a Lean Purse\\" relates a story about Arkad, the titular richest man in Babylon. He is requested by the king to teach a class to anyone who wishes to attend on the methods he used to build his wealth. He divides this class across seven days, with each day focusing on a particular method for saving money. Here are the seven methods.Start thy purse to fattening Take one-tenth of what you bring in and save it for the future. The book uses a coin analogy: for every nine coins you spend, take one and put it away for yourself. This is very sensible; a goal all of us should have.Control thy expenditures Don't buy frivolous things even if you have enough money to pay for them. Instead, make sure that you can continue to save one-tenth of what you bring in. For this reason, I write about frugality on The Simple Dollar.Make thy gold multiply Once you start to build up some savings, invest that money so that it will make more money for you. Another pretty clear point; if you start saving money, it shouldn't just sit in a mattress. Even a high-yield savings account is much better than that, and it can double your principal in about fifteen years.Guard thy treasure from loss This one is interesting: you should only invest in things where the principal is safe. In other words, the book seems to discourage stock investing. I found this to be particularly interesting given that it was written in 1927, right in the midst of the first big American stock market boom. Of course, 1929 proved the author right.Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment One should own their own home rather than renting because then money can be invested in the home or invested in other things rather than handed over to the landlord. Something tells me that this lesson applied better before people were looking at homes that were three or four times their annual income.Insure a future income In other words, invest for retirement and your family's well being after your passing. You should be dropping some Hamiltons right into your retirement account if you can possibly afford it.Increase thy ability to earn Work hard, look for opportunities, and educate yourself. Today, a college education is one of the best investments you can make; I'm not saying that it's a requirement to be successful, but it opens the door to greater possibilities.The Five Laws of GoldAnother story central to The Richest Man in Babylon is the tale of the five laws of gold, a five-point philosophy handed down to later generations by Arkad, the titular richest man in Babylon. Here are the five laws, with discussion of what they mean in a modern context.1. Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family. In other words, a person should put away 10% of his or her income for the future as a bare minimum. This rule is so incredibly fundamental, yet only a small minority even bother to follow it.2. Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field. If you invest your money well, your money will simply make more money. Again, a very simple and obvious rule, but one that many people never get to because they didn't follow the first rule.3. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling. This rule encourages cautious investing, or at least encourages the investor to at least be informed. In today's era, one can turn to the internet for plenty of investing information.4. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those who are skilled in its keep. This goes hand in hand with the third rule: if you invest in stuff you don't understand, you're likely to lose money. Don't buy the latest hot stock from your stockbroker; investigate and invest where you want.5. Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment. The worst option is to invest in anything that promises absurdly good returns, or anything that you're heavily pressured into buying. These investments are scams and won't stand up to serious research.The five rules really are all you need to know: save some money, do some research, and only invest in the fruits of that research. Anything else is a sure way to fall behind.Other TalesThe remainder of the book is loaded with similar tales, teaching basic principles of personal finance using stories from Old Babylon. Here are some of the other teachings found in the book:A Part Of All You Earn Is Yours To Keep This is a hard lesson for many of us to learn, as most of us are ardent consumerists who are trained to spend from earliest childhood. The truth is that we need to learn to always pay ourselves before we pay our debtors - once we do that, we'll be on the road to financial success.Men Of Action Are Favored By The Goddess Of Good Luck I found this principle to be quite interesting, but also quite accurate. At first, you might take it to think that people who gamble sometimes end up big winners, but that's not what this is all about. What the rule is saying is that people who succeed are the ones that do something. Even the most conservative of investments will pay better than cash stuffed in a mattress for a rainy day. If you do something, something will happen.Better A Little Caution Than A Great Regret On the other hand, if you push too hard, you can get burnt. Highly speculative investments can turn around and bite you hard, leaving you as if you had never invested at all. Respect your principal and it will respect you by earning well; toss it to the wolves and you may get nothing back.We Cannot Afford To Be Without Adequate Protection Retirement savings and insurance are both vital to ensuring that major accidents don't derail everything that we do. If you don't have these tools, a disaster can befall you, leaving you completely helpless.Where The Determination Is, The Way Can Be Found Don't give up on investing just because the road is bumpy. If you keep at it, eventually you will find a path to success. This is true no matter what you're doing - persistence pays off time and time again.Thanks Ralph"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Great advice, even though written generations ago!

In its pages we are admonished to save, invest, work hard, and continually better ourselves by increasing our ability to earn.Much of &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; may seem like good old-fashioned common sense, and it is. What makes this book so special, though, is the beautiful and inspirational manner in which it was written. If you are a fan of Og Mandino's work then you will be right at home with &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon.&quot;Very few books are still in print and widely read more than 50 years after they are first published. When they are, it must be for a reason. I seriously doubt that anyone will be reading &quot;Rich Dad/Poor Dad&quot; in 50 years.Buy this book, it's inexpensive and easily read in one day.

It is without doubt a book that has changed my life, because it has changed my relationship with money.There is no basic premise to this book. The only words that I can find to define what it is, is that it is a foundation stone, upon which you can and will build a great finacial future, if you adhere to the advice.This book is a philosophical/practical guide to wealth creation. The book in a sense tells a story. Interwoven into this story are anecdotes, which contain messages. Within the messages are real meanings that when applied to your life and wealth, will create profound change.I would have to disagree, with some people who say that this is the only book you will ever have to read, on the subject of money. I would recomend that you also read; The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace D Wattles, Born Rich Bob Proctor, Financial Peace by Dave Ramsay..if in debt &amp; Pysco Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz, as wealth creation will also need new sub concious thinking. With these books you will create a finacial fortress, that will amaze you. I guarantee it.This book is a brilliant synopsis of timeless ideas, that is a must read for anyone who has set a goal of finacial independence. It is both a practical, spiritual and philosophical guide to wealth creation. It should be read in conjunction with the other recomended books. If it is, it will change your financial future forever.

Through the narratives of Bansir, and his broke musician friend, we can see the standard folk who try to figure out how to get out of debt, the salary slavery and to finally attain wealth. Clason also uses the narrative of the richest man in Babylon Arkad who was initially poor but later learnt how to accumulate wealth. Through Arkad, the rest of Babylon gets to understand the secrets of wealth accumulation.Clason's book is a timeless classic and most of its message still holds true today. It teaches the values of saving, overcoming poor habits such as procrastination and being able to take advantage of opportunities. It is amazing how he was able to vividly elucidate the Babylonian lifestyle, as if he were there in that society. However, importantly, he was able to bring out these timeless values that anyone can apply today and in years to come. It is interesting that the ancient idea of compounding is what we today see as saving or making an investment.I highly recommend this simple book to anyone who may be looking for inspiration on how to accumulate wealth. Nevertheless, the idea here is to put what you learn into practice to see any results."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Written in the form of parables similar to parables from the Bible set in ancient Babylon, the concept behind this classic financial guide is: PAY YOURSELF FIRST. Simple to understand but difficult to implement, the parables allow the reader to see the concept in action and hopefully internalize it after having seen it in various contexts and from various points of view.After reading \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\", I realized that either I have control over money or money has control over me. I couldn't have it both ways and there is no middle ground, no position from which I could rationalize it or bargain my way out of this truth. Unless I was run over by a truck, I was going to get old, and I was going to need money.So, I began saving the recommended 10% of my income. I was young. It was a small amount. I figured I didn't have anything to lose. The first 10 years, it accumulated slowly, so slowly that it seemed like saving 10% of my earnings was the world's biggest waste of time. In the second decade, it began to seem like it might pay off. I am 65 now, nearing the end of my third decade of saving. Most people my age have little or no savings and will depend heavily on Social Security. Without money you have little choice.I started with $10,000, a gift, part of the profit from the sale of a condo. I have never worked outside the home since 1975. In lean years, I saved almost nothing. In other years, 20% of my income. I found a good financial advisor. My investments currently amount to more than 50 times my initial deposit and all I did was save and invest an average of 10% of my income...save and invest a little at a time."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This book is one of the most informative books I have ever read.

If you only have this book, and follow its' laws faithfully, your financial situation will improve greatly in a short amount of time with a minimal amount of sacrifice and extra work. I can say this from applying its' principles for just a little over two years: I have already accumulated a years' worth of income and have a sound estate upon which to build my future, I do not worry about money anymore, and can relax comfortably knowing that each passing day I grow more wealthy. This book is the keystone of my financial library and estate. I highly recommend that every person who can read should own a copy.

Written in the form of a delightful series of parables set in ancient Babylon, the book dispenses timeless advice on how to get out of debt, how to save, how to budget, how to do better on the job, and how to invest for the future.An interesting sideline--George Clason published the first road atlas of the US back in the 1920's, but it is as the writer of this timeless book of personal financial advice that he is best remembered today.If you only read one book on the subject, it should be this one."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I was introduced to The Richest Man in Bablyon nearly 30 years ago. This book is still in a class of it's own. Although written in a storybook style, The Richest Man in Bablyon also provides proven success principles.Aside from teaching how to create wealth, The Richest Man in Bablyon also teaches you how to maintain wealth. I found one idea about business saved me a bundle.The Richest Man in Bablyon is a good read and contains powerful, powerful material that will make a difference in your personal and business life."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"The Richest Man in Bablyon is more than just a classic in the world of personal finance books, this book offers timeless, powerful advice that really works.It's amazing that most people know about saving that first 10%, but how many do?The Richest Man in Bablyon is written like a novel in storybook style but offers advice that really delivers. Somewhat like Mark Victor Hansen and Robert Allen's great book The 1 Minute Millionaire.If you haven't read the Richest Man in Bablyon, then I highly recommend that you do. If you have read it, then I recommend that you re-read it.I also recommend The Automatic Millionaire by David Bach and for the ladies, Smart Women Finish Rich: 9 Steps to Achieving Financial Security and Funding Your Dreams."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Set in ancient Babylon, this book is a collection of articles written in the 1920's and 30's. Although the writing style may seem dated to modern readers, the advice is as true now as ever.Each story teaches a lesson on a valuable point, many of which we've all heard before, (pay yourself first, pay your bills on time, etc) but presents these points in a way that they are more easily taken to heart. As you follow the characters in these tales, it is easy to think of examples of how you can apply these principals in your own life.Following the principals of this book can help anyone become financially secure."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"When I worked as a financial planner, several of my clients who were teachers asked me to \\"discuss money\\" with their 5th and 6th grade classes. Each child received a book, we chatted an hour and that was intended to be the end of it. HAH! It turned into a weekly meeting, the kids began \\"investing\\" with monopoly money .. they began reading the financial section of newspapers to \\"follow their stocks\\", the real estate section to follow the market on property they \\"bought\\" .. by the end of the year they were all asking parents for a share of stock instead of guns and dolls for holiday gifts; they bought savings bonds with gift money; they got part time jobs to add to their treasure chests .. it was AMAZING!Thirty years later, I'm semi-retired, a number of the children from \\"my classes\\" have become very secure to wealthy, and their overall life path has been very stable .. from choosing life mates who shared their views of financial self-determination, to remembering to enjoy the lives they were building.My children have been raised the same way and my grandchildren look forward to the day they're old enough to receive their own copy of this book. I've found \\"old enough\\" to vary according to the individual child -Wesley Woo Woo was an early bloomer and insisted it be read TO him when he was only 5. He makes \\"money chooses\\" according to whether he wants something or really NEEDS it (some of his self discussions are hilarious) and he's making some very good choices."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Our society is so obsessed with rich people, but we only pay attention to their expensive mansions, cars, and lifestyles. But few of us notice how these people got there. Their expensive possessions are the end result. So, what do we do? We borrow and spend to accumulate possessions so that we can be seen as wealthy. If you truly want to know how to build wealth, read this book first.I absolutely loved it. I have read many books on personal finance, but this one gets the point across really well. The author teaches financial lessons through short stories. The main ideas behind this book are paying yourself the first 10% of your paycheck, spending less than you earn, and letting your money work for you. This is such a simple concept, but at the same time extremely hard for people to execute. Since this book was first written in 1929, I have to warn readers that it is written in old English so it might be a tough read for some people.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I am going out on a limb and disagreeing with the mass of reviewers who have raved over this book. I just can't see what the big deal is. Yes, it does present some great advice in a creative way, but I wasn't awestruck by how entertaining it was or what deep wisdom it takes to tell people to save money. I'll also mention that I'm not down on \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\" because it makes me feel guilty or inadequate; I was already practicing the principles Clason preaches when I read it. First I will comment on the writing and style, and then give my reaction to the book's message.This book wasn't written as a book, but as a series of pamphlets, and it shows. The style is consistent, but the points get very repetitive. This isn't the author's fault, since he wasn't trying to write a book for reading in one sitting, but it reduced my enjoyment. The writing style is highly affected. To give a flavor of antiquity, the dialogue is written in the style of English used in the time of Shakespeare and King James--the same king whose name was given to the King James Bible. I think this is a device that works better in small doses; I quickly found it pompous and tiresome. I have read a lot of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, and I much prefer the real thing to this pale imitation. I will note that one story/pamphlet is set in modern times and is mostly written in modern English. Looking past the style, Clason is a decent storyteller, and I found the chapters with a plot were entertaining, but many chapters are more lectures in fictional settings than stories, and I found these to be monotonous.The wealth-building system that is advocated ad nauseam is to devote 10% of income to debt reduction and 10% to investments. The fictional version of Babylon isn't equipped with modern markets, so the characters are more entrepeneurs than investors, but there is lots of flowery language about the power of compounded earnings. Along the way there is the obligatory call for home ownership, but the subject of renting vs. buying isn't covered in depth. The main message of the book is motivational rather than financial: it's basically a series of lectures on the benefits and satisfactions of being in control of your financial life, with a candy wrapping. I thought the book totally ducked the part of the system that's the hardest for most people, which is to live on 80% of your income. The attitude that I perceived was a cavalier \\"anyone can do it.\\" Well, anyone who is reasonably well off can do it, but some people have to choose between buying food and medicine, and not all of them are wasteful spendthrifts. But maybe people in such straits don't read this kind of book, so maybe it doesn't matter.I was already investing over 10% of my income and living debt-free (except for the obligatory mortgage) when I read this book, so it didn't change my life. If my finances were a mess and I was inclined to do something about it, I can imagine I would be inspired by the ideas in this book. On the other hand, if my finances were a mess and I was not inclined to reform, I can't imagine this book would change my behavior any more successfully than a modern tell-it-like-it-is book. Obviously people are inspired by different approaches, and this book has inspired many reviewers, but if I knew anyone seeking inspiration to straighten out their financial life, I would suggest they skim \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\", which shows how modern real people successfully manage finances, and skip \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\"."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This book was orignally given to me as a gift when I was a child by my father. My father told me that that within it's pages were the secrets that had made him a wealthy man. As a child I read the book and tossed it to the side.Later, my father died at the age of 52, and left my mother with enough money invested that she never needed to work.It took me a while, but I finally picked up the book again.

The book has a very simple and lucid style. It tells the stories of Babylonian people who mastered the laws of GOLD (MONEY). These rules are eternal. No school in the world teaches these rules to its students. But the very knowledge of these laws is a MUST for everybody. This book goes an extra mile in prospering the life of anybody who reads it and follows the laws of GOLD shared in it.An EXCELLENT gift on the occasion of birthday or marriage!No SCHOOL or COLLEGE Education can take the place of the LAWS of GOLD shared in the book!

I had read the actual book about 5 years ago, but this time I suppose being in a different place in my life I was able to really grasp much more of the author's intent. The best thing is now our entire family views money differently. Even though it is affordable to spend our \\"slaves\\" on many things we are choosing now to increase the number of \\"slaves\\" we have so they can multiply and be with us for ever. Get this book or audio CD read it and make your kids read it. The overall message is given to you in the first 5 minutes of the book and then the rest is a great storytelling that really provides you the understanding and motivation to begin changing your thought process in regards to money and therein lies the value of any self-help book the ability to read it and become motivated to change."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Given how many fans this book appears to have, I feel a little lonely noting anything negative about it, but it was so simplistic I couldn't stick with it to the end. The advice in The Richest Man..., is fine enough, but I found the &quot;thous and thys&quot; annoying and mostly common sense. A MUCH better bet is The Mindful Money Guide. This book simplifies financial advice and never forgets there's more to life than the bottom-line (without losing sight of the importance of financial security). It can also be enjoyed by someone with hip or mildly hip sensibilities. It's well-written and made me laugh out loud a few times."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"There is nothing new here in this book. If I were to be cruel, the messages of 'save 10% of your income', 'pay yourself first', and 'get out of debt as quickly as possible' are all old news. Any personal finance book worth it's salt will rehash those points over and over again....The Richest Man in Babylon is not like those other books. In it, George Clason manages to take these dry topics and wrap them in an entertaining package. Lets face the facts, reading a 'for dummies' book, and 6 other books that pontificate to you on the virtues of saving 10% of your income may be important, but the presentation will not allow you to *believe*, and therefore these basics will never go from your *head* to your *heart*.That is where this book shines. It is not even a continuous story, but several stories linked together by common threads, from different times and points of view. The version I read even changed typestyles between chapters to further emphasize the change in POV. The lessons are presented as if the reader were learning about people physically living in Babylon, and not only does the color and warmth of the message allow it to *stick* in your head, but it's almost as if that little light comes on, and you say &quot;so _that's_ what they've been talking about.&quot; Having lessons presented by example, even if it is a fictious example, allows the reader to truly understand and take them to heart.This is an outstanding book, and a required addition to anyone's personal finance library."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I was amused by some of the 1-star reviews. You should take a look at them to get an idea of how clueless most people are about personal finance in this country. I can look around me and see that the ideas in this book are universally acknowledged to be common sense. But as I look around me, few, if any, of my relatives, friends, co-workers, and neighbors are applying them. I see credit card debt, houses bought for idiotic prices with nitwit mortgages, new cars replacing other new cars, closets so full of clothes the racks come crashing down, crushing monthly fees for cable, cell-phones, and internet services that are ultimately just a lot of empty distraction. In short, I'm surrounded by 1-star reviewers. This book is not about getting rich like Bill Gates or Donald Trump. It's about achieving financial freedom. What would you rather have -- a new cell phone ring-tone or an investment account that lets you retire at 50? That's your choice in life -- repeated every day of the week.Richest Man in Babylon is an allegorical rendering of the basic principles of sound personal finance. The ideas in it, yes, are common sense. But you could say the same thing about Poor Richard's Almanac or books in the Bible like Ecclesiastes and Proverbs. However, to paraphrase Warren Buffett, \\"it's simple, but not easy\\" to get rich. The trick is self-discipline.To keep our focus on what we know is right we sometimes need a pep talk, and this is a good one. I give it 4-stars."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This book is a great beginners book and the first step toward financial independance. It is a nice little story but the principles found in this book are very powerful. It puts forth principles in a very simple way as cures for a lean purse. Like \\"Make your dwelling profitable\\" \\"Make thy gold multiply\\" and puts forward various ways to do this and much more. It is written in a very simple manner and is easy to implement. Saving 10% of your income and keeping you expenses low alone are worth the price of the book.It is very simple and yet very powerful."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I just finished reading the Richest Man In Babylon.

Clason uses the language of the King James Version of the Bible (although this book is not at all biblical) to create anecdotes set in ancient Babylon that tell you (the modern-day reader) how to handle your money. The amazing thing is that the advice is not at all outdated. It's right on the mark and shows money knowledge that hardly is taught in school. It's easy to read and understand and highly entertaining. In fact, one of its stories, &quot;The Luckiest Man in Babylon&quot; is almost enough to bring you to tears.It is shown in this book that when you are in debt, you are a slave to what it is that you agreed to go into debt for and you must pay it off to regain your freedom (are you a five-year slave to a car [or the institution that financed it] like I was?). Look at the state of the nation's economy and you'll see we live in a nation of slaves.That's why you must get the reverse into action; make money a slave that is working for you.Many people have heard the popular phrase from this book, &quot;pay yourself first.&quot; I highly suggest you read this book first so you can see how you should go about paying yourself first; there is a method to it.This book is truly a classic and should be required reading for all classes on money or for anyone going into business for oneself.

How wrong I was!! The book takes a couple of simple concepts and beats them to death in a series of mind numbing stories written in old English style writing. I struggled to force my way through this less than 100 page book.The entire book basically boils down to pay your bills, save some, make it grow and live on the rest! All of this is conveyed in story form without any real substance or relative guidance. If you're looking for financial advice or guidance, I would recommend looking elsewhere and saving yourself the time of wading through this \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"The most important &quot;success secret of the ancients&quot; I think is revealed on page 25: &quot;I found the road to wealth when I decided that a part of all I earned was mine to keep.&quot; So to start getting rich you have to save, but how much? The &quot;First Law of Gold&quot; has the answer: &quot;...not less than one-tenth of his earnings...&quot;The book's basic message in plain language is: If you want to be wealthy, save and invest at least 10% of your income. If you are already following this message this book won't help you. But if thinking of saving and investing as &quot;ancient secrets&quot; and &quot;Laws of Gold&quot; is what it takes to get you motivated to save then this book is for you.I deducted one star because one-tenth is not aggressive enough. The &quot;First Law if Gold&quot; should be at least 15%. There are signs that inflation after a long absence is on the way back."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"To the book's credit, it was worth reading; much of the content was based around good, old-fashioned common sense - hard work, investing, spending wisely and saving for the future. Great advice, but nothing unique that will set the world on fire either. I had hoped the book would depart some deeper knowledge, something that would be so enlightening to the reader one could say,&quot;Ah, now I have learned a signigicant lesson, something of value.&quot; Alas, that did not happen.The major drawback to the book was simply its length - far to short. The book is extremely elementary and if that is what you are looking for this is it. However, if you are searching for a book with more a deeper meaning, one that can be used as a learning tool particularly in teaching teens the value of a dollar, I highly recommend, &quot;Capitate Your Kids: Teaching Your Teens Financial Indepndence&quot; by Dr. John E. Whitecomb (a five star plus!)"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Childish and overly long for the simple lessons it contains.

He related this to Algamish, who castigated Arkad for this foolishness. \\"Every fool must learn,\\" he said.Collected from a series of informational pamphlets distributed in 1926. That is all it is, the text is written as if it were some ancient wisdom and there are a few interesting points there but will it really help you to become the richest man anywhere. No. Not really.So if you want to enjoy a few hours reading a few old pamphlets collected togeather and passed on as ancient wisdom. Go ahead.

I think what this book is probably trying to say by looking at the VERY nice cover, is that if you live in Babylon, (currently the nation of Iraq), and you found a wad of U.S. greenbacks stashed by Saddam in the walls of one of his castles, you would certainly be, if not the richest man in Bablylon, certainly one of the richest! This is of course, illegal, but if you could pull it off, you would be in a league of great Babylonian finaciers such as Martha Stewart, T. Bone Pickens, and Roger Rockefeller.If you have some extra money lying around, I highly recommend that you purchase this book instead of investing it as this keeps the American, NOT Babylonian economy, humming in its servicey non-productive manner.Have a nice day and keep an eye on future fine book recommendations.Love,J.D.

If you continue to eat the inferior candy you eventually become sick of it. That is this book.I found the first few chapters were readable - but then my pallet began to object and by the end I could ingest no more of this pointless prose. Where is the point? Save money and instantly you will become rich? Now I see why \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" is also a frequently purchased title by those who read this book. Perhaps it is just not my style of thinking. Maybe I just don't get it. If found it entirely pointless and a waste of time and money.At first I thought the \\"revelation\\" that we would get as readers was the the richest man in Babylon would learn he was poor - but yet rich in good things that transcended gold and silver... no the case. Then I thought the author would tell us that the 10% rule was to give to God first - and that living from a perspective of giving and stewardship would be the key to authentic wealth... not happening. In desperation I kept reading on and on thinking \\"surely there will be a moral to the story that has some actual merit or meaning\\" NO! To the contrary - it appears that all you have to do is pay yourself - and cram all the rest of your creditors into the same little confined space so they can all wait their turn - and you will be RICH! What? If that is the case, why only 10% for me? Why not everything to me and the heck with everyone else in the world?It is this sort of thinking that causes our young people to feel they must have an iPod in four different colors and a cell phone that can do eleven things at once. This \\"thinking\\" is a part of our society that takes us AWAY from being authentic to who were were created to be - children of God (not hoarders of stuff). It's NOT ABOUT YOU!I purchased this book on Kindle and I must also say that aside from the quality of the message, the formatting was pathetic. The entire document was one long formatting run-on sentence. Having published to the Kindle Digital Platform myself - I can say from experience that about 20 minutes of formatting work before releasing this to the public would have been all it would take to at least make the text presentable - but then, nothing could fix the content itself. Wow!"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"The reason many of us fail to succeed is that we buy into common sense. This book does just that by reinforcing bad practices. It suggests that one should save and invest wisely. There is little way in which a person could achieve significant wealth by this method though perhaps a good retirement. The most successful people do not follow this method. Unfortunately there is not a solid path to wealth (not that I know of). Compare the wealth of Richard Branson versus Donald Trump - two very different approaches with few similarities. I know many people who have followed this approach and ended with just a small savings.

You should spend no more than 70% of your earnings on household expenses. In other words, spend less than you earn. You can then spend the remaining 20% as you please.3.

Please buy this for yourself, for your child or for your grandchildren.The Richest Man in Babylon: Now Revised and Updated for the 21st Century"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Here's the bottom line. This book is one of many books on principles on how to control your finances. If you can control what you eat, how much you exercise, what educational degree to go after, when you wake up, when you sleep, etc., there's no difference in deciding how much you spend and how much you save (must know for what purpose!). All you need to do is read this book along with all the other informational books out there and apply the principles as it fits your current situation. It doesn't matter how much you make. It's all about the \\"principle\\" and how to apply it. The part that many, like myself in the past, seem to overlook is that you need to control and detach yourself emotionally from money. If you can understand how much you make, when it is due you, and how much it takes to meet your minimum required needs (now come on, let's not be too greedy), then think, think, think, plan and execute and do it all over if you fail. I think it worked well for me because I took the \\"emotional\\" part out of the equation and handle money objectively. So did this book help? Definitely. Every ounce of education is worth a ton of happiness. I think it important to keep the perspective realistic but yet with a steadfast attitude without ignoring all the help that is out there. The book cost as much as, if not lesser, than a fast food plate. Why not get it instead of wasting on junk food?"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I bought this book at the recommendation of a friend who has practiced the wisdom in the book and prospered financially. It seems, to me, the best material on personal finance. I prefer it to some other books written by high profile authors that that i previously read. I wish I read the book earlier, but I am glad I finaly did. Though small and cheap it is a rich source of finacial wisdom. I read a library copy then bought a copy for personal reference. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"During the late 1920s, writer and entrepreneur George S. Clason created a series of simple parables about the supposed financial \\"secrets of the ancients.\\" He compiled these tales, set in Babylon some 8,000 years ago, into an entertaining yet instructive book on becoming wealthy. In the 1930s, during the worst of the Great Depression, and for decades after, readers embraced Clason's engrossing, elegant little page-turner. They learned of wise Arkad, the richest man in Babylon; of Dabasir, the slave who became a wealthy camel trader; and of Sharru Nada, the rich man who learned about working hard when he was just a youth. Each universal parable teaches invaluable lessons about wealth, how to attain it, nurture it, protect it and sustain it. These stories also convey worthwhile lessons about life. getAbstract understands why Clason's magical little book has become such an enduring classic. If you read it, you will find that you can put its simple yet sensible lessons to work. Clason calls these lessons the \\"wisdom of the ages\\" and the \\"fixed stars that shine.\\" His common sense advice about wealth can make you rich in more than money."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Since Pat Thorton's was the first review, it was one of the first i read, but i think he said it best. \\"Common sense is not necessarily common knowledge.\\" the simple lessons contained within the book are somewhat common sense (save 10% of your income), but easier said than done, since most people are used to living beyond their means, especially in today's age of spending. It takes determination and financial responsibility to live below your means and save and invest for the future. Those that rated this book low are probably the ones that have the hardest time taking action on the book's recommendations. of the number of people out there saying \\"i knew that-just save money.\\"--how many of them are actually doing it?!?! a very quick 2 hour read and well worth the time and money spent. highly recommended."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I read this book back in 1994. It has much timeless knowledge.The Richest Man in Babylon is an inspirational book on helping to create an investment mentality by using parables of how the Richest Man in Babylon would have invested. It is for beginning investors who need good reasons to develop a proper mindset to start working towards becoming financially independent. It also is a good book for recharging a wealth mentality in any investor.The concepts in the book are simple, but their effects on wealth are profound! For example, George Clason covers The Five Laws of Gold. From the version I read, they are:I. Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantities to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family.II. Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks in the field.III. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling.IV. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep.V. Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.Overall an excellent book for beginners though advanced investors.The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Although this is an very older book.

ClasonBabylon, lying near Euphrates river, was once a flourishing kingdom. The Babylonians had great achievements in agriculture and construction and they knew secrets of becoming a rich.You may think the secrets are cliche or even common sense, like spending-wise, investing in premises, don't lend money to unexperienced proprietors etc.. But take an example, like investing in premises, there're at least two benefit to us. First, for the hard-workers, they'll have revenue from rent; secondly, for the less hard-workers, this involuntary kind of saving is definitely benefitial to them.People in modern society spend too much valuable time in day-dreaming to be a millioniare while doing nothing pratical and forget about hard-working and saving, two very important characteristics of being a rich. Yet saving time and improve own knowledge are important too, on my view, accumulating capital, seeking advice from experienced investors and investing in items that we know well is the rule of success.

The work was written beginning in 1926 as a series of pamphlets. Each contained timeless financial advise that was a gift to the masses in a time where monetary security was far from certain. Every gold piece truly counted. Financial and business book advocates may argue some of the messages are simplistic, but that is akin to saying that Alexander Graham Bell's telephone was not very high quality. In reality, the simplicity of the message is what makes the book great. Today, many investors are tempted by and exposed to a maelstrom of \\"money growing\\" products. From stock trades, loans, financial seminars, \\"get-rich quick\\" schemes, the path towards financial health can be quite confusing. In reality, however, the clear-cut road to success lies within the parables in this book. The message has a warmth and genuineness that is the polar opposite from the sleazy sensation associated with financial gurus and their $999 get rich box set....What exactly then does the book teach? Why is it valuable? While I don't want to give away the lessons, they reminded me that fundamentals are the key to success, even in 2011. Clason treats the reader as if, the reader him/herself is on the path towards financial discovery; yearning to hear the words from The Richest Man in Babylon and then proceeding to follow in his footsteps.

Clason. This classic is a favorite of many of my preferred authors, so I thought I would add it to my repertoire. Clason is a fascinating man, born in Louisiana, Missouri in 1874 and started his Babylonian-based writing in 1926. This book has very solid messages and it's no wonder why this book has become a finance classic.Clason uses parables set in Babylon to make his points throughout the book. One chapter does a really great job of encompassing several financial points, The Five Laws of Gold. Each of the five laws are very simple and if used can work wonders in building your wealth.Five Laws of Gold1: Gold comes gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put aside 10% of all he earns to build an estate for his family and future.2: Gold labours diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds it profitable employment.3: Gold clings to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling.4: Gold slips away from the man who invests it in businesses that he is not familiar or is not approved by those skilled in its keep.5: Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who follows the advice of tricksters or schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.I feel Law 1 is the most useful thing anyone can use when starting to accumulate wealth. I have touched on this in a couple blog posts, but I want to really drive it home. The best way for you to really start making a large sum of money is Paying Yourself First. YOU is the most important investment your have. YOU should have the mentality that YOU are your most vicious creditor you have. You owe YOURSELF before you pay anyone else.... Figure it into your budget. When you get your paycheck have a set number each month that you owe YOURSELF, I like no less than 10%. Never budge on paying yourself and always do it first. In my last blog about I Will Teach You To Be Rich, I showed you how to automate your finances. This makes it very easy to pay yourself. If you have $500 a month coming out of your checking account, and into your ING Direct or Emigrant Direct Savings Account, the day after you get your paycheck, you won't even consider that spending money. ING and Emigrant Savings Account pay 1.3% interest right now and it takes a day or two to get money when you do a transfer. I definitely recommend either of these accounts. I challenge you to start paying yourself first... trust me, you are worth every single penny. PAY YOURSELF FIRST!More on ING and Emigrant Direct Accounts.... I just changed from Emigrant to ING because ING allows you to have several sub-accounts under the same over arching account. You can create nicknames for each of your accounts and each can have automatic savings plans for each separate account. Let's play pretend... You have and ING Account with sub accounts named Wedding, New House, and Vacation (I will discuss retirement accounts in a separate blog down the road... saving accounts should be used for short-term expenses: 3-6 years). You want to Pay Yourself First so you have get paid on the 1st each month and on 2nd you have ING pull $500 from your checking account. This $500 will be split among your accounts $150 to Wedding, $250 to New House, and $100 to Vacation.... In 5 Years we will have... drum-roll... $9,294 for your Wedding, $15,490 for your New Home, and $6,196 for your dream vacation... Total Savings = $30,980. Determine what you want you pay to be and work your budget so you pay yourself before anyone else... be vicious... get creative and figure out a way to pay yourself what you want. I want to make a point that much more money can be accumulated than this for the long-term... More on that later.The Richest Man in Babylon is a great book with lots of great parables. It's not a long read just some different language usage. I think it would be a good read for anyone that has a little extra time... probably a vacation read... in 5 years you'll have plenty saved up for that! If you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"it is not an easy book to read, but after a few times it hits the spot, well done."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I have just finished this book and I cannot believe what I just read.

This was the most effective of all because it put things in terms of common sense and timeless wisdom and I can not say enough about it."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This book is absolutely phenomenal.

Simple, easy to follow ideas that when implemented guarantee wealth. This book should be required reading in all levels of education. Start early!"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I've read a lot of books and this easily goes down as one of my favorite books of all time, hands down. This is the kind of book that I would give/recommend to anyone regardless if their interest is outside of business/finance. Since finance can seem daunting these days due to its complexity, the book simplifies it through short stories. The insights that it provides allows me to step back and look at finance in simple terms. It opened up my eyes by introducing new possibilities, and adds positive reinforcements as to what a person can achieve in his/her lifetime. The wisdom that the book teaches is financially enlightening and it can totally change how you view your finance in many ways. Although the messages are delivered in a very unique fashion, the underlying nuggets of wisdom are direct and concisely to the point.The concepts might be a refresher to individuals who already has a solid grasp of their finance, but nonetheless, it solidifies what you already know in many ways. This is a type of book that I can refer back to time and time again. If you apply some of the concepts that is presented in the book to your life, you will be definitely on your way to financial freedom. If I can sum up the book in one word, it would be \\"refreshing.\\" I recommend this book to everyone regardless of your interest or age. Read, apply, then repeat."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This deceptively simple, easy to read book delivers a powerful message.I love the imagery of referring to the gold (money) you save as a slave that works for you by earning interest.When my Nephew graduated from college, I gave him a copy of this book. I hope he's wise enough to read it and apply the lessons.John L. White, author \\"I'm in Debt, Over 40, With No Retirement Savings, HELP!\\""},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"It is a very easy and light reading to introduce the concepts of wealth. It is based on a story how a man became rich in the ancient world of Babylon. However, the concepts are timeless, such as pay yourself first.Considering the time the book was authored, it is pretty impressive."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This is a very simple and practical book on personal finance. Narrated in short stories from the ancient city of Babylon, the basic principles of handling ones personal finances have remained the same- to live within one's means, save for the rainy day and not to be greedy while looking at investment options. The advice to pay oneself first - keep aside atleast ten percent of your income and the savings set aside in prudent and safe investments multiply manifold over a long period is at the core of this book. It is not necessary that one has to be stingy to save. It is a matter of planning and personal discipline.The stories and the characters are very interesting and is a good weekend read. This makes the book enjoyable to age groups."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"The Richest Man in Babylon is a series of stories set in the ancient city of Babylon, where people of extreme wealth and extreme poverty existed side by side. The reader is a &quot;fly on the wall&quot; as those who seek wealth ask the advice of those who have learned how to generate it.George S. Clason has taken several simple money management principles and wrapped them in colorful stories of an ancient culture, which reminds us that financial struggles and the principles of how to escape them are timeless. This book has travelled the years well because the dialogue is already that of another time. The author has cleverly devised a way to show how these principles also apply today.This book will give you a solid foundation for how to handle your money and get it working for you.Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This is an excellent book for education/introduction to personal finance. This book has the merits not to be boring as many other books could be. It introduces you to several aspects of personal finance such as insurance, savings, investing... using simple stories, explaining simple concepts that everybody should know. Unfortunately, for some of us, our ignorance on this subject causes us a lot of troubles and sufferings."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"The book is just 144 pages long - I read it in 2 hours. But it took me a couple of days to let all the timeless information sink in.I especially liked the 2nd story and the three rules it lays down:- Live upon less than you earn and save atleast one tenth of what you earn for yourself.- Seek the advice of wise men whose daily work is handling of money.- Learn to make gold work for you.These three lessons are given in a story and that makes it easier for the lessons to sink in. The other 9 stories are also interesting but the second story alone is worth more than the entire book.The cover of the book which I have says &quot;more than two million copies sold,&quot; and I am sure this small book has made those two million people - smart and rich."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This incredible little book was recommended to me for many years because of the texts inspirational qualities, in terms of offering timeless simple truths concerning thrift, financial planning and the value of a good work ethic. The formula offered for financial independence is highly practical and workable. Promoted as success secrets of the ancients, the text is written in parable form, similar to the bible, which gives the entire work a credible quality. I know from personal experience, that with persisitence, a good work ethic and a strong will to succeed; one can achieve a modicum of financial prosperity. Which, by the way, includes enjoying the fruits of one's labours. \\"Enjoy life while you are here. Do not overstrain or try to save too much...live otherwise according to your income and let not yourself get niggardly and afraid to spend. Life is good and life is rich with things worthwhile and things to enjoy.\\" (20) In other terms, the lesson offered is a practice in moderation, not letting one's behavioural pendulum swing too far either way, but earning well and living well in the mean is a key to achieving a happy life. If you read any 'financial success' book this year, let it be this one."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"The stories in the book are extremely motivating. The best thing about this book is that you can give it to your kids and get them started in building a habit that will help them the rest of their life. I gave this book to some of my friends and after reading it they became so motivated that they made a habit of saving a tenth of what they earned.I have read tons of books on the importance of saving and investing but not even one comes close to explaining the philosophy in a way this book does. This is one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This book uses parables to convey simple but profound financial advice. The ancient setting is excellent in showing the timelessness of this advice. The use of parables is a very entertaining way to convey information. While the advice offered in this book is not earthshattering or new, it is useful and true. The true value of this book, however, is not in its advice; it is in its motivational power. It will inspire you to do what you already know you should be doing. The characters are easily identifiable with, and despite it's ancient setting, the conversations are easy to follow and enlightening. This is one of my favorite presents to give to new graduates, and I frequently use it myself as a reminder to attend to my savings program."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Someone let me borrow this book a few months ago. I truly enjoyed reading it. The things stated are so eye-opening that you want to read it again and again. It's almost like a grandfather passing on wisdom he's learned over the years. A must for new graduates!!!! (I'm now buying a copy of my own)!!!"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I won't bore you with details in this review as other reviews have covered the details and some even include spoilers to the story.Some reviewers seem to think that it's much harder to live off of a portion of your income than this book suggests. One even suggested that it's difficult for most people to live on \\"80% of their income\\". Nonsense. It's not difficult to do. I have been in severe poverty to the point of \\"couch surfing\\" and not even owning a bicycle (read: homeless and walking)...Yet, I was able to do it. The difficulty level is only mental for the vast majority of people. One needs to have the discipline to say \\"no\\" to themselves and live below their means. Those who are too poor to use the principles in this book are only those who don't even have an income to begin with. Those people have to start at square one and get an income. I don't think one has to be \\"reasonably well off\\" to follow the principles in this book, but one does need a regular income--even a very small one. Step one: Get a full-time job.All that said, the book isn't too bad; however, the writing style comes off as being corny and silly. The first printing of this book that I'm aware of was in 1926; however, it attempts to use language from 1626. Unfortunately, the use of Middle English in this book is not entirely correct, accurate, or well done. Anyone who grew up on a King James Bible (or Shakespear) will probably find the writing silly and annoying. I thought it took away from the story and was a bit distracting. At the least, it is an unnecessary literary tool that is a distraction to the reading. At the most, it can be difficult for modern readers to understand and will cause readers to miss important information.Otherwise, the book seems to provide more of a starting point and an \\"imagine yourself rich\\" motivational story than a step by step guide to all aspects of gaining wealth. Fortunately, most people who need this introductory motivation more than anything else seem to also be those who have very little financial knowledge. Those who are confident and highly motivated to gain wealth have already done their homework and already know how to work the details. Those types of people probably won't need this book as they are already past it in my opinion.I'd recommend this book to the financially naive who can understand Middle English (e.g. graduates from private Christian schools, high schoolers who can understand Shakespear, etc). I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not familiar with that archaic language or who already has some financial smarts."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"The Richest Man in Babylon is a 1926 financial self-help book by George S. Clason. Here, Clason presents a number of short stories, set in ancient Babylon, that communicate basic wealth-building principles.Clason's principles are sound and timeless: work hard, live within your means, save, and invest wisely. Clason also presents a get-out-of-debt plan whereby the debtor lives on seventy percent of his income, saves ten, and pays his debts with twenty. All these concepts are offered so simply that just about any reader should be able to grasp them.The stories themselves hold the reader's attention most of the time, although the Babylon shtick gets a little wearisome toward the end (and this isn't a long book). The characters all speak in King James-style English, but it doesn't always sound right (recent revised editions of the book, I understand, have updated the English). But it's never too big a problem, and even so, a lot of people are going to find The Richest Man in Babylon a lot more appealing than a dry, straightforward book on finance.In short, The Richest Man in Babylon is a readable, accessible introduction to wealth-building principles and financial responsibility."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"\\"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step\\"...Confucius (604 BC - 531 BC)And the road to riches and wealth begins with this book.

You can see how some modern writers, such as Dave Ramsey got some of their inspirations and ideas from.

It's unabridged. I'm happy with the quality of production, and the narration is clear and well done. The case is not plastic, but a paper sleeve type case. Since The Richest Man in Babylon is a story, it's well suited for the audio format and is easy to listen to, and understand. It costs less than most paperbacks (currently $10.97), which is a very good price for an audio books in CD format. If you are thinking about the Audio CD version, you can't go wrong getting it. Recommended.With 500+ five-star reviews, it's superfluous to add anything more about the book itself. So suffice it to say that it's a well done work of fiction that gets the message and teaching across very well.

It provides the quintessential, capitalistic concept that the majority seem to miss- on saving and investing. This book is not the in-depth 21st century read about investing wisely in today's markets, rather it is the all time read to acquiring and investing your wealth. It shows how everyone, even a lowly trashman can one day retire comfortably as long as he learns the &quot;ways of money&quot;. It provides the basic concepts and you apply your current scenarios. Every time, without fail, you will come up with one thing: how to build your wealth. This is the TRIED AND TRUE method to increasing your worth. This IS NOT the get rich quick book you might be expecting. This book teaches you how to save, make your money work for you and in general how to be a lord of your wealth (or wise in the ways of money), as opposed to your money ruling you. Timeless and priceless knowledge that every single person not living under totalitarian or communistic rule should know so that they can seek their own financial freedom."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Like most people, I was confused on how some people accumulated great wealth while others(including yours truly) did not.

The examples given, the practicality of the theories, and the relevance to today makes The Richest Man in Babylon and Think & Grow Rich compelling reads. Changing the way you think of money, ways to attract money, and ways to build wealth are some of the key points addressed.

It works!"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This is a fantastic book. I loved the old English style of writing. It is a must read for anyone who does not pay themselves first. The concepts in this book are timeless. The book of Proverbs also has a fair amount of wisdom on money. You would do well to read both.

This book is undeniably valuable because it delivers PRINCIPLES that will never be obsolete. The passage that really hit me was the part where it said that if you're not paying yourself first by saving a portion of your salary, then you're really just a slave; you should really just ask your boss for room and board in exchange for the work you do! The truth of this statement hit me like a ton of bricks, and inspired me like never before to start saving my money. This book provides the instruction that all of us should have received while growing up. I can't count how many times I heard during my life that I should save money and invest, but I didn't really get any good explanation about the practice of saving until I read this book! I wish I had discovered this book ten years ago."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Get this book!

This is the perfect gift for a graduate or anybody looking to seriously start saving. The chapters are short and concise and the stories are easy to follow and understand.

And in case you don't actually figure out the point of each story, there is a short summary at the end of each one.'Richest' is a lot easier to read than most of the other books on similar topics and to think this one has been out longer!

Yet, the narrative, which reads like a translation of an ancient text, actually helps set it apart from all the other books out there, dealing with personal finance.The question is, how does one become wealthy?And we get basically the same answer that any reputable book will provide: save some money (they use the requisite 10 percent here), and spend less than you make. But there are a couple emphases placed in this book, in which it does add some real value:1) Increase your earning potential.2) Pay back your debts.I found the second to be the most instructive, and even convicting. The person that pays back debts in a timely way, may still need to ask for loans - but if you are good about attempting to pay them back, it will be easier to obtain money in the future. And personal loans from friends and family are always to be preferred over institutional loans.So - this book is not all it is cracked up to be, but good nevertheless. You can read it in a day, and should.Now - here's to paying back all my debts, first, and quickly!"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"The Richest Man in Babylon is an older book written by George Clason around 1926. To give you a real idea of the age of the book, its author served in the Spanish-American War (that was in 1898 for those of you wondering). The book is not written as one constant story; instead it is a collection of parables the author wrote over a period of time, all assembled into one collection. Each parable has a theme to it, such as seven cures for a lean purse and the five laws of gold.The writing style is unique. Most of the story is told through character dialogue, in a language that I can only describe as Shakespeare without the rhyme. You will see the words \\"thou\\" and \\"thy\\" frequently throughout the book. It took me a few pages to get used to the style, but after that I hardly noticed it.What I like most about this book is the length. My copy is only 155 pages, but those pages cover most of the major personal finance lessons with easy to understand stories that still manage to get the message across.The Seven Cures for a Lean Purse is the first lesson. The 7 steps to accumulating money (in my own words):1. Pay yourself first2. Spend less than you make3. Take advantage of compound interest4. Exercise risk management and don't lose money5. Own your own home6. Create passive income so eventually you can stop working7. Improve your ability to earn more moneyThe rest of book continues to build on these 7 ideas, as well as add a few new ones.Recommendation:If you are looking for a short but great lesson on personal finance this is the book to go too. The lessons in this book are timeless, and since it's such a quick read it's definitely worth a look. If you're just getting started on learning the basics of personal finance this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Short book. Timeless advice. What can I say.Well, the fact that it is set in ancient Babylon shows that the basics of finance are truly timeless, and only misinformation from our great friends banks and credit card companies have buried these understandings from us."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I was introduced to this book by a friend, bought a copy and put it down for a year. It sounded strange that a book about ancient culture of Babylon has something to say about making money. Furthermore, the back of the book purports that it is written in easy to read Biblical style language. I never found the Bible to be exactly an easy read.Nonetheless, one day I decided to read it. I was really impressed to the point of inspired! Such logical and practical sense in how to make money without first losing your shirt. In fact, you not only get to keep your shirt, but also provide shelter, clothing and food for your family on top of it! It is not worth writing the formulas or ideas in this review because it would only lose the impact. Read it so the wisdom is in it's proper context.A great book, &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot;, written sometime in the early 40's, I think, continues to be an excellent resource in making money. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is having trouble saving extra for the future."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This is an interesting book. To begin with, I believe than any book, even a bad book, has some useful truth that will benefit anyone. However, this book is a good book, despite its rater offish title. For non-Christians &#8220;Babylon&#8221; is a Biblical term for worldliness and all things evil. But that one objection aside, I think that this book on finances is useful for anyone.This book is written in a pseudo-scripture, or pseudo-ancient text approach that Nietzsche used in &#8220;Thus Spoke Zarathustra.&#8221; The benefit of this approach is that it gives the truths an air of mystique, so you pay attention. Clason even uses some of the awkward Elizabethan phrase constructions and Hebraisms found in the King James Version of the Bible. SO expect the reading to be a little different than say, Idiots guide to personal Finances, or the Motley Fool money guides. But if you can get caught up in the mystique and mythic feel of the book, then you can go ahead.Yes, this book covers a lot of basics that may be common sense to some people. But our economic education in this country is substandard that some people do not even know the basics. Shakespeare pointed out in Sonnet 66 that simple truth at times is miscalled simplicity, and I hope the simple truths in this book are not overlooked because they may be basic. Indeed this book is a primer on basic personal economics&#8212;say Economics 99. But you need to start somewhere, and this book provides a basic plan for anyone new to managing money correctly.There are some pieces missing, such as resisting the temptation to buy on credit, or worldliness in general, or how to invest wisely in the stock market, but the basics are covered here.Get this book for your teenagers, and have them memorize the seven &#8220;Rules of Acquisition&#8221; on the fly page. Then have them outline every chapter, to engrain the principles in your heart and minds. They will thank you later on, when their friends have $20,000 in credit card debt."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"After reading many books on finance and success I can honestly say this one changed my life.

Each time I find something profound that I somehow overlooked. Written in the style of ancient parables, this masterpiece should be shared with any young person about to embark on his/her first financial journey of earning and saving. Cutting through stuffy economic principles Clason lends good old fashioned horse sense to the mystery of accumulating wealth and security. I have made gifts of copies of this book to more people than I care to count and it has touched each one profoundly. Great company for a first paycheck!"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Training for my M.A. degree involved deep analysis of literature, and a mastery of the many known devices that authors use to grab a reader's attention.This book uses a simple device (called archaism) to deliver small stories which, stylistically, read like Biblical parables -- though they have nothing at all to do with Judaism or Christianity -- this book worships only at the altar of gold. And a most practical and profitable sermon it is.How ironic is it, that also during my M.A. studies, the great universities of our land never taught me one fraction of the financial truths laid out so clearly in this book. Profound truths, that can free the low-wage-earners like myself (or anyone who makes a living in the arts) from the slavery-like yoke offered by credit card companies, from risky and stupid investments, and from the foolish desires that generally cause people to overspend.The book centers on the theme of slavery. The literal slavery of ancient times is astonishingly allegorical of the financial slavery that debtors find themselves in. This type of slavery is not new. It hounded Charles Dickens, preoccupied Thoreau, and drove Marx to conclude that labor needed to revolt ... But all that is distraction. This book has the true answer to wage slavery, and that is that one must keep what he earns, and make it grow. Simple ideas to comprehend, and simple to execute if one can grasp the truths the author describes. Money, and the laws governing it, are unchanging.Some readers may be put off by the book's device of the parable. Its dialogue and situations are sometimes heavy handed and overly preachy, once you see the parable's moral coming at you a mile away ... but this book speaks the truths that are worthy of Aesop. I am richer for having read this book, both financially and spiritually."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I must admit that the rebel in me cringes that I bought and read this book, but you know, I'm following its principles anyway and I am pretty amazed at how my debt has started to melt away and that I have a nice little savings account.

But now he is designing a financial planning program at work and was partly inspired by the book!What I really like is that it has helped me to feel more secure, just knowing this powerful little formula.

There is also good practical advice about how to get out of debt. The best thing about the money acquisition plan is that anyone can put it into practice without becoming a miser.

It's a cute biblical story that is made up of serious life-lessons aimed towards properity.........NOT just money, but anything pertaining to self; ie: time, love, health, savings, possessions, income, etc. I used to own and run 3 retail stores with subcontractors, sales clerks, bookkeepers, service routes, product education seminars, on, and on and on. After reading this book, I realized that my time and health is as valuable as the money brought in, which a lot of times was paid out for overhead. I still own the same company, but I've geared WAY DOWN. It was a hard decision to make and I prayed real hard about what and how to do. We actually now live in a bigger house, enjoy each other more, and are a lot happier about life.......Amazing what reading a tiny little book can do for a life! The point of this story is to work smart and to put yourself first-----Oh, I still hate to say that-----because that's how you'll be more prosperous and more helpful to your family, friends, and all others.It's a short, quick book and I highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"\\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\" along with \\"The Baron Son\\" by Vicky Therese Davis are two of my favorite financial parables.

If there's only one thing I can mention that paves my way to become a professional personal financial planner, it's this little book by Mr. Clason. Today, I always have George Clason's &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot;, 5 in English and 5 in Chinese, nicely wrapped, in my gift stock. Whenever I met a fresh client or friend who have not yet built the belief that he/she could be a millionaire, this booklet is the first present he/she would received unconditionally. While most writers in financial planning says it takes only a fifth graders' mathematical knowledge to understand most of the truth about being financially freedom, this booklet is powerful and inspirational to tell all the basic truth for virtually every body. I found it a powerful tool to educate the kids about spending, savings and giving. In particular, the story about the confession by the Nottingham archaeologist Prof. Shrewsbury would save a lot of people from their debt."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I read this book in the early 1960s upon the recommendation of my then Dale Carnegie instructor.

In addition, the employer matched a percentage of each dollar saved which is like found money. Whenever I wanted to buy something NOW, I thought about the suggestion in the story to &quot;never sell your children,&quot; referring to not spending earned interest. I never forgot that. I am enjoying a comfortable retirement today. I credit the suggestions in this wonderful book with keeping me on track.

The principles embodied in the book are, in the author's words, \\"a cure for a lean purse.\\"The book is a collection of short stories that all revolve around five basic concepts:Money comes to those who save.Money multiples for those who invest it.Money stays with the person who entrusts it to wise people.Money is lost when invested in things with which you are not familiar.Money is lost at a fast rate by pursuing get-rich-quick schemes.The reader should keep in mind that Clason wrote these stories to be published as pamphlets and distributed to bank customers.

It is written in some older English, but it is not too difficult to follow since the stories are easy reads. It mainly talks about ten key ideas.1. Save 10% of what you earn2. Don't get involved in investments that you do not understand or don't invest in someone else' idea unless it is in the area of their expertise3. Don't gamble or get involved with quick rich campaigns4. Focus your energies on improving what you do so that you can increase your earnings5. Be true to your word - pay back debts and build relationships6. Invest wisely - mainly invest in your area of expertise or with a good friend in his or her area of expertise7. Be decisive - don't take too much time in deciding an investment is right. If you wait too long, the opportunity may be gone. This is a fine line because you don't want to rush in either.8. Invest in yourself so that you can improve your skills in the future9. Be a person of action - luck comes along with hard work10. Have a strong determination that you will succeed.The book was a very quick read - I read it in about hour or so. Much of it was a bit repetitive - I guess it helps to ensure that you got the points. Honestly, I thought I would get a lot more out of this book. I already knew of most of ideas, and in the places where I could use some help like being decisive it did not give me suggestions to improve in that area. I guess it will just take some more practice on my part. I would suggest stopping by your local library to pick up this book. If you like it enough, go out and get it and add to your collection."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Walk into any better bookstore, make a beeline to the personal finance and investment section, pick up any of over two or three dozen books, rip off the cover and boil it down it's main points, and you'd be left with one book: The Richest Man in Babylon by George S. Clason. Name authors you will - Suze Orman, Ric Edelman, David Bach, Dave Ramsey - none, and I mean none, have improved on the simple and timeless principles laid out in these pages.The book began in 1926 as a series of informational pamphlets written in parable form. The parables, set in ancient Babylon, follow the travails of Bansir, the journey of Arkad, and the lessons of Old Kalabab and offer a financial plan to put readers on the road to riches. The principles, repeated often throughout the book, make the promise that \\"A lean purse is easier to cure than to endure.\\"While that may, or may not be true, the book should resonate with readers regardless of their financial status. Most readers will recognize that they've been where the parables take us, on the downside and on the upside, and quickly realize what steps should be taken to move forward. In that sense, this book is a fantastic guide to the laws that govern money. For, as the book suggests, \\"Money is truly governed by the same laws which controlled it when prosperous men thronged the streets of Babylon, six thousand years ago.Taken further, I view Clason as an ideological precursor of modern financial planners, who take a role similar to Old Kalabab and attempt to impress upon clients the very same principles Clason deftly weaves throughout the book. The terms are different, but the lessons identical. The importance of saving by paying yourself first, budgeting by controlling your expenses, intelligent investing with wise and experienced counsel, insuring yourself against catastrophic loss, and planning for your golden years are as sound for the time and place of the book's parables as they are today.While newer books may have flashier covers and contain three times as many pages, for those seeking to improve their financial condition and, better yet, accumulate wealth, I don't know of a better investment. The Richest Man in Babylon is a book you should not only read, but study."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I came upon this book from the reference section in &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot;. Actually if you read all the books in that reference section, you will have realized that Kiyosaki has no original ideas of his own. But getting back to this book...The Babylonians were the first engineers, the first mathematicians. They were the first with written history and a system of currency. They built huge buidings and their fortress walls are one of the seven wonders of the world. Now, all these are gone, but their wisdom remains eternal.This book contains stories of the ancient Babylonians, each with an important lesson. There is a bit of repetition, but this lesson is so important it might as well be repeated throughout the book. This is the lesson of saving what you earned. Save at least ten percent. Even when you are not making alot, save that ten percent! And before you know it, you will have this huge amount of money that you don't know what you should do with it. But before you spend it on playstation games, wait! This money should be used to help you make more money. And the money you make from this, you save ten percent. Then you use this money to make more money and save ten percent of what you earned and so on and so forth. And before you know it, whamo! You are the next Warren Buffet.The other important lesson in this book is to work hard. Treat hardwork as a friend rather as an enemy and you will be rewarded greatly.These are more or less the messages of this book. Simple as they sound, you should definitely read the book yourself because the stories are just amazingly inspirational and heart-felt. Can you imagine they were carved in stone many centuries ago and still, they are some of the best writing and with MEANING as compared to most of the garbage writing printed out today?

Read this book and share it with your family, your friends and your business associates."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"George Clason's Richest Man in Babylon is considered a classic in its field for good reason. This slim volume offers common-sense advice on how to gradually build solid wealth. Clason offers no get-rich-quick schemes or stock market tricks. Instead, he offers solid foundational principles which anyone can follow, such as \\"Save ten percent of your income\\" and \\"Live within your means\\". While they may seem obvious, far too many people fail to utilize them.Clason preferred to dispense his advice in the form of parables rather than simple lectures, so this is far more readable than your average investment or personal finance tome. The writing style, which is imitative of \\"King James English\\", is a bit corny, but this does not detract from the read. The stories are not exciting, but interesting enough to keep your attention. Most importantly, the principles are valid no matter what age or economy you live in, so the book, despite its age, is a wonderful introduction to the basics of personal finance for anyone."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Lots of successful people cite this book as having given them a solid grounding, which is why I was keen to read it.OK, a lot of the language is dated - thee, thou, wilt, didst etc - but it is extremely readable. The language in fact enhances the reading experience - it underlines the timelessness of what is being written.The book is a series of chapters, and each chapter has a truth, explained through a story, like a parable. The characters are, of course, from ancient times, but their thoughts and actions are exactly how people think and act today.It is no new thing that people look for the \\"get rich quick\\" and the \\"lucky\\" roads to wealth, but in fact the right way is quite simple. There is discipline involved, sure, but it isn't hard.The richest man in Babylon got where he did by working hard, taking advice, putting money aside and investing it wisely. What I particularly like about the book is that all the characters who succeed make mistakes along the way, but that doesn't stop them from ultimately getting to their goal.A true classic."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"The Richest Man in Babylon teaches sound financial habits that outline how you can start becoming wealthy solely on money you already earn.The book is broken into chapters, each told in a parable format that takes place in ancient Babylon to explain a certain area of personal finances (investing, savings, insurance against loss, etc). What's most clear is that these \\"ancient\\" financial secrets are actually applicable to people today, regardless of the advances in communications and technology. The idea is that sound personal finances are goverened by rules that are everlasting.On a side note, there is no real suggestion of the types of investments that one should make. If you're looking for a book on how to invest in stocks or mutual funds - this isn't it. Rather, it is an overall plan for success that you can custom-tailor to your situation.All in all, this book is fantastic, and at under $7, is something that even the most cash-strapped pauper can afford, and start on the way to a better financial future."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I had heard about this book for a long time but when finally got a chance to lay my hands on this.

I've given it to my mom to read. I'm buying copies for everyone who asks me for financial advice. I just graduated with an MBA- and apart from my major college loan debt I wanted to figure out a strategy to deal with quickly, because I work as a financial advisor with people who have major debt and nothing saved- this book has an amazingly simple startegy that could help them and me. Basically it tells you to save 1/10 of every paycheck. Send 2/10 to pay debts and fit all your expenses into 7/10 of every pay check.You'll grow in worth (because of the 1/10 put away every pay check), your debts will reduce overtime because of your 2/10 of your paycheck sent to them. Deciding you have to teak your expenses to fit into 7/10 your pay check is a much more organized way of doing your finances rather than the sloppy \\"I'll save if anything gets left over\\"- which never happens.Also because it's an old book, it explains the ideas behind financial concepts in simple words rather than using hard words that economics majors like me had to cram before exams and nobody else understands."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This is a beautiful little book.

Naturally, I had to check it out!This book was written in the 1920s, but is as relevant now as it was then - and prior to that time, as well. It is written in an allegorical format, making it much easier for the reader to understand, relate, and put into effect the ideas described in this book. If there are two major ideas to be learned from this book, they are, \\"pay yourself first\\" and \\"invest your money and your money's money.\\" It does sound like common sense, but you will be amazed how few individuals actually practice them.Even aside from the financial lessons contained herein, the stories are rather entertaining. I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone, either as a gift or for one's own benefit. This is one investment you cannot afford to forego!"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Don't let the simplicity of this short, easy-to-read book make you feel like you would get more value from something denser or more complex. The fact is, financial basics ARE simple. This book presents them in a story set in Ancient Babylon, which reads quickly yet resonates deeply with financial truth.Is it really that hard to be rich? Clason explores such topics as spending less than you make, repaying your debt, saving for the future, and investing wisely. There are no secrets, no tricks, no insurmountable challenges - just the basics that have escaped much of today's credit-card generation.The best plan is to go ahead and buy two copies of this book, one for you, and one to loan or give away. This is too good to keep to yourself. An obvious classic for college grads or new families, the wisdom within is just as relevant and accessible for learners of any age.If the book has a fault, it is its failure to address charitable giving. Whether you tithe at church, or choose other non-profits to share with, giving is an important part of financial management that is not mentioned at all here.Regardless, Richest Man in Babylon is a classic for a reason - its wisdom has stood the test of time, and will continue to shine a light on a simple, straight, yet often-overlooked path to financial well-being."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I loved this book.. .

Clason's &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon,&quot; vital ancient secrets are told on how to get rich. This book represents the valuable information in a series of stories, which in turn make the book more interesting and easier to follow. As an example, one of the most useful tactics about money in this book is &quot;The Seven Curses for a Lean Purse&quot; (22). These seven curses become more evident to one once read through their daily lives, as they are not so common sense traps that everyone falls into.Along with the great secrets and stories, is the choice of words presented in the text. A clever mix of modern English and biblical style make the book an easier read while adding onto the stories. On a scale from 1-10, this book would definitely receive an 8 if not better, due to its secrets told and guidelines presented in it such as \\"The Seven Curses for a Lean Purse\\" (22) and \\"The Five Laws of Gold\\" (57). If one liked \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" by Robert T. Kiyosaki or other books similar to it, one will enjoy this book.

It made money management extremely easy to understand and entertained me at the same time!"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"The Richest Man in Babylon was first published in 1929 by George S. Clayson, but written as if it had been translated from tablets taken from the ancient city of Babylon. Though the device is similar to something H.P. Lovecraft would use to establish credibility in a horror story, here it lends weight to his lessons and principles about how to create wealth. The basic principle boils down to save a dime from every dollar, but there are more nuggets of useful advice that would work wonders if you would but follow them faithfully.It is a bit jarring to the modern ear when Clayson talks of slaves and slavery, but when you think of it, being in debt instead of saving and having your savings and investments working for you is a kind of financial slavery. Like the 'drinking gourd' in the sky, if you follow the principles set forth in 'The Richest Man in Babylon' it will free you from the shackles of debt.I liked the last part where it described how Babylon was able to flourish despite not being a major port and not even having lots of natural resources such as forests or minerals. Through an ingenious system of irrigation and hard work, as well as systems of writing and record keeping, Babylon became a center of commerce. Kind of like Bakersfield, I'm thinking.10 Books for Further Study on Wealth Building and Personal SuccessHow to Be RichThe Millionaire Next DoorAs A Man ThinkethSeven Pillars of Wisdom: A TriumphThe Way to WealthThe Art Of WarRich Dad, Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money--That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!Gold Ahead by George S.

A lot of the financial advice in this book seems pretty obvious, but many people have no concept of saving money, working hard, and living frugally. The book also mentions that you should invest your money under the advice of wiser men so that it is working for you.Overall, the book delivered its message very clearly.

Good results like this take time. I had an hour-long audio tape from many years ago with some of this story of The Richest Man in Babylon and really enjoyed it, but, it was only an abridged version and I wanted to get the complete version to learn more, so I decided to buy the book and was so impressed with it that I decided to order the Audio CD pack as well. Since, as many other readers state, you must listen to these principles until they become imprinted in your mind to become successful at gathering wealth. I have already started to follow the principles in the book and CD and am starting to see my savings grow. I am very excited about continuing on this program. This is one of the very best books and CD's on wealth-building that I have ever had the good fortune to come across. I love it!!!

The content certainly follows what a person with common sense would do."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I wasn't expecting a fun book when i picked this book up. I expected to learn how to start saving for the rest of my life. Although I'm still worried about my future I feel a little more confident about it after reading this book. Instead of simply giving me a list of things to do to not end up homeless this book told several stories about men in much older times with financial struggles and men with no struggles thanks to their financial strategies. This helped the book find a balance between informative and interesting.To me the most important part of the book was the Babylon guard. He tells us how an enemy army was kept at bay because of the city walls. This is a great analogy for how if you have the necessities of life such as a house that's yours and plenty of food for your family, Its worth not being able to enjoy simple luxuries available to others. Needs and wants are to very different things. If I get certain things that I want I might not be able to get the things I need.That and the other parables I read in this book will hopefully sticj to my brain and help me in the future."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Book ReviewThe stories begin with Bansir, who is a chariot maker struggling to provide the luxuries his family desires.

Five clay tablets are read by Alfred Shrewsbury and his personal experience on suggesting Debasir's rules in life and taking advantage. Sharu Nanda describes how he luckiest man of Babylon and he talks about his troubled part of life to his partner's grandson to conclude work is not slave's job. In the last chapter it talks about Babylon. The location was on the banks of Euphrates River in a flat, dry valley. Ancient Babylonians are credited with the first feat of engineering for their massive irrigation canals that sustained their fertile soils.The intellectual level of this book would be technical. The books effectiveness is very great because, it teaches you how to become wealthy. It really shows you to start saving now for the future.

To my surprise, at the wedding a multi-millionaire (in 1950'dollars) pulled me aside for a private conversation. He slipped me a small wrapped present and advised me it was the absolute secret to his successes in life. Wow, I thought - a real key to success?!Upon unwraping the gift I was again surprised. It contained a very simply written, eary to read, book of basic financial fables. This was my first introduction to \\"The Richest Man In Babylon\\". I was disappointed, and dubious, until I realized that Bill H. so believed in its principles that he had written a private message to me (which will remain private) on the fly page and then signed it. Now I may have been a poor young cowboy, BUT my mom raised no fools! I wasn't about to second guess my wealthy mentor...and I was definately tired of being poor!First, I read it cover to cover. Then I contemplated what I had read for a period of time. Finally the power of the simple advice offered in the book hit home. I knew that if a person reads something new, 90 days later only 2-3% is still available for conscious recall, but if a person reads (or hears) a teaching in exactly the same words every day for one week it will become ingrained thinking. A 67% conscious recall is then available to the student. So I outlined the book's chapters and tape recorded them. I then proceed to listen to them, in order, for seven days each.Net-net, as I celebrate my 50th year with Nancy (a true keeper) and what we refer to as \\"the Book\\" (also a true keeper), I find us enjoying strong financial independence in our retirement age. As a life-long entrepreneur, my personal successes and the successes of my companies are directly rooted in this simple book Bill gave me so long ago.I recommend EVERYONE buy and learn from it (as opposed to just reading it!)

It changed my life too. Crocker Bank (now gone) was located on the corner of same property as Honeywell, on Century Blvd, in Los Angeles. I was a single mom and wanted to buy a house. I made an appointment to talk to the banker. I had no idea how I would be able to afford to purchase a home for my son on my income. I can't remember the bankers name, but I am forever grateful for his advice and recommendations. One bit of advice was to read this book. Needless to say, I transformed my thinking, attitude and behavior about money. I began investing in myself first by diverting 10% of my income into a saving and gave 10% away off the top. I also started a little business with MLM (now Network Marketing). The investment was affordable, (meaning very, very small) and so was the risk. The possibility was there to leverage my money and it was up to me to seize the opportunity, which in essence was sweat equity! I was a \\"Holiday Girl\\" and sold lotions and potions, when I wasn't in class or at work. Something amazing happened, in two years I was able to purchase my own brand new home in a new development. I must share that it was so much fun knowing I could afford a new home. I looked at different neighborhoods, models and square footage. I finally selected the development and re-designing the floor plan. I picked appliances, window covering, flooring and carpet. I redesigned the entry foyer and custom designed the fireplace, opened the master bedroom with sliding door out into the back yard, because I knew I would add a pool. The following year I put in a pool! I was the only single woman owner in the new hosing development - an obvious rare feat in 1977.The Richest Man in Babylon introduced Seven Principles:1) Fatten Your Purse -Win-win-win with 10-10-10. Pay yourself first-Give 10% away-Invest 102) Control Your Expenditures - Cut up those credit cards. Guard your desires. Stay within your budget.3) Make Your Moolah Multiply - Put your money to work honey. Get advice to avoid pitfalls of investments4) Guard Your Treasures From Loss - Protect your principle from loss and watch for corrupt banks and greedy lenders5) Build Your Home Into A Profitable Investment - Leverage your our home to create income, recurring revenue, rental properties - stay within your means.6) Insure A Future Income - Only do work that you love to do. Become excellent at it.7) Increase Your Ability To Learn and Earn - It is a heart and soul adventure. Continue to cultivate educate yourself through mentors, coaches and by reading books to increase your financial savvy.Recommendation: Ladies - Buy my friends new book see #5 - a new rendition of this classic written for women.My Five Favorite Books from my mentors and new Transformational Author friend, Annette tersigni R.N..Must read recommendations:1) \\"The Secret of the Millionaire Mind\\", T.

Like many parables, the instructive lessons it conveys usually are not unknown to us. Those readers who were disappointed by this book, particularly those who thought they would receive some magical advice as to how to become fabulously wealthy, missed Clason's more subtle message concerning human nature. It is, for instance, clearly good advice to place 10 percent of one's income into savings; however, Clason's character Arkad does not rest his advice on that point alone. Careful readers notice that several types of men approach Arkad for his advice. Some of these men are poor, while others are relatively well off; yet each man perceives his purse to be equally thin. Why? Arkad's (and therefore Clason's) more fundamental message addresses the human inclination to assess one's well-being according to the amount of material goods one possesses; and not just any material goods, but those that are quite unnecessary to living a good and happy life. A plain and simple life, we discover, is a good and happy life. Not only does such a life free us from petty distractions, but in so doing it reframes our perceptions of what truly matters in life by renewing our attention to objects far more important than the latest fashionable clothing, computerized vehicle, and technological gizmo.Clason's book is not so much a revolutionary self-help manual as it is a gentle reminder of how we ought to conduct ourselves in life. There is no shame in admitting that we need such reminders; I need them myself, and that is perhaps the principal reason that I appreciate this little story."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Many of my peers believe that they have to hit a windfall in order to become \\"rich\\". They don't understand how to get there in a methodical way since we live in a world that glamorizes lottery winners and serves up get-rich-quick schemes in the media.Those are the exact people I recommend this book to. The Richest Man in Babylon introduces the fundamentals of accumulating wealth to the masses. This book can really help shape the mindset of people looking to reach utopia one day. Aside from an awful lot of luck, getting rich starts with simply thinking a certain way.That said, where this book is lacking is in the tactics, which is fine. Building wealth is about creating and executing offensive and defensive strategies and not about 'just tell me what to do to get rich' formulas. Although the strategies here are timeless, those looking for a road map may be frustrated. To those folks, I must add the following: There is no step-by-step recipe that works for everyone. Learn these lessons and be your own pathfinder. If are are diligent, you will get there."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"If you have children, buy this book! This is a primer for life!Much as children have been read Aesop's fables, Uncle Remus, Vedas and the myths of whichever European or Asian early civilization you want to chose in order to teach them to grow up to be civilized people, this book is vital to teach them to grow up and be upward mobile upper class people.Mobility is a skill set, not a fortune of birth. Some people chose to find those skills for themselves but, much more commonly, upwardly mobile people are taught those skills and raised with them such that they become and ingrained part of who they are as a person, family and community.This book teaches those skills in parables and short stories that are simple enough that children will learn them. They are pointed enough that youth will listen to them. They are correct enough that adults will want to continue to adhere to them.Yes, this book is neigh a century old. I predict that when it is two millennium old, people will still be reading it as Aesop's works are still read today. Paul Bunion may be forgotten but the richest man in Babylon will still be told of in whispers to children who will grow up to achieve wealth."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"In this book,a man from Babylon learns his wisdom from an old man he met when he was younger and now teaches everyone else his wisdom, passing it down to other listeners. He teaches the people about the seven cures for a lean purse,1. Start thy purse to fattening. 2. Control thy expenditures. 3. Make thy gold multiply. 4. Gaurd thy treasures from loss. 5. Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment. 6. Insure a future income. 7. Increase thy ability to earn.It is basically saying pay yourself first, don't be tempted to spend any money on dumb things or invest in silly things and be confident in your investing and trying to be wealthy.This book would be good for the academic reader that wants to learn a few things and this book deffinetaly teaches you a thing or two in a creative way by telling the story of a rich man in Babylon.The books effectiveness for me and I certainly hope that will help others, will teach you about how to save money and how to deal with it on a financial level. I mean, whouldn't everyone want to gain knowledge on how to save and ivest their money wisley, becoming rich maybe one day themselves?

It's old, it's proven, it's removed from all the hype of today's financial gurus.My only issue is with owning real estate in the times this review is being written. It's not always smart unless you have a large down payment, at least 20%, and unless you get a great deal.Otherwise better to rent, live in your car/RV/van, live out in the country, or find free rent or negative rent opportunities. Or a combination of those.Free rent would be something like house sitting and negative rent would be a situation in which you are paid money to be a resident.With the money saved you could buy real estate at a time when it makes more sense than it does in current days.Jerry Katz"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Every 18 year old should have these concepts about money ingrained in their mind! This title is an amazing set of parables describing how great leaders of Ancient Babylon went from rags to riches... by following simple rules of money.\\"Start thy purse to fattening\\" is the first rule we learn. Through a fascinating and believable story of Arkad, we learn that \\"a part of all you earn is yours to keep\\". I immediately connected with Arkad, because he and I both thought all of my earnings are mine to keep. Algamish, the money lender, said to Arkad \\"Do you not pay the garment-maker? Do you not pay the sandal-maker? Do you not pay for the things you eat? Can you live in babylon without spending? You pay to everyone but yourself... If you did keep for yourself one-tenth of all you earn, how much would you have in 10 years?\\"This is the first of many valuable lessons I learned from these priceless parables. I can say if I read this book 7 years ago when I was 18, My assets would be at least $50,000 more today.

I bought my battered copy more than 50 years ago and it put me on the right track for personal success from the start, and again when I lost almost everything and had to start again.Inspirational writers through the years have sung the praises of The Richest Man in Babylon. I believe this has been without exception.The book was written in beautiful parable style and tells the story of The Richest Man in Babylon as he shares the secrets of his success with the poor citizens of the city.The greatest secret of all, and the one that truly drove this book to success for decade after decade, was to pay yourself first. Save 10% of everything you earn and live on the rest. Invest the 10% and keep investing it, adding all the interest you earn.This is such a simple rule, you may be inclined to dismiss it, but I urge you to buy the book and read it fully. Wisdom often is simple, and this is certainly wisdom that can be yours.I've given this book to many young people and those who took it seriously have succeeded beyond their expectations. Every young person should read The Richest Man in Babylon.And not so young. I'm very much youth-deprived now and I advocate the book for all ages. In fact, one of the stories in the book is about a professor in England who had fallen on hard times and was saved by the book's ideas.If you are doing it tough now, or if you want to make life better, or if you're just starting out and want wisdom to guide you, this is your opportunity.I urge you to dream, and dream big. And I urge you to do all you can to realize your dream. You would be well advised to use this book as a springboard."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This was a well written book.

The story-telling style makes its point without beating you over the head with dry and boring mantras that today's financial planners and financial network clowns love to repeat. Savvy financial types won't be shocked by anything found in this book; however, there are some useful ideas for most anyone. The tales are easy enough to remember that they should be helpful for explaining rather complex situations to clients and children as well.

Things that most of us have heard before but may have forgotten or never really focused on.

Sadly, I didn't have the sense to see how valuable this book was. It would be another 12 years before I finally sat down to read it. It drives me nuts to this day that I wasted those 12 years.This book introduced me to the concept of \\"pay yourself first.\\" Thanks to George Clason, I now realize that getting rich isn't a matter of how much you make--it's all about how much you keep.Babylon's basic premise is to save no less than 10% of every dollar you make; and not only save it, but put it to work. Do that consistently and continually, and you can't help but get wealthy. Why work like a dog only to hand over your paycheck to the landlord, the grocery store, the credit cards, etc? Much better to keep the 10% and have something to show for your effort. Once you accumulate enough, the money does all the work.Not sure this is for you? Go ahead then--keep living paycheck to paycheck. We'll see who comes out ahead.

It took me five years to read it and another twenty years to figure out how much wisdom it contained. I gave copies to my sons. The basic theme is that regardless of your income level or debt situation you can succeed and grow rich if you follow the simple formula. 10% for investment. 20% to pay off debts. And 70% to live on. The secret is the 10% to invest. Few of us can do that all the time, sometimes paying the electric bill takes all we've got and then some, but its good wisdom, and in a persuasive format.

In fact, the way the story is told, it's very easy to grasp, and very likely you will feel identified with several of the characters throughout it.

The best next book you must read after &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; is &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot;. This will forever change your financial life.I highly recommend that every person who can read should own a copy. &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; is a true classic and a great gift for those just starting out, e.g. on the occasion of birthday or marriage. This book is indespensible for old and young alike."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This is a good book.

Yes, this book tells you the same thing that all the others do, but this book presented it in a different way. There are a few concepts that finally sunk in. One of the few books worth every penny it cost you. I wish I had read it when I was 18."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I first heard about this book 17 years ago. At that time, I was in a direct sales company and had the good fortune to attend a seminar conducted by a businessman named Jim Rohn.Mr. Rohn talked about his early mentor, a man named Earl Schoff and went on to tell us how Mr. Schoff turned him on to personal development and pointed him to the right books to read. One of the most important books, said Rohn was The Richest Man in Bablyon.Rohn had made and lost a fortune but came back and made another fortune and gave credit to the principles in The Richest Man in Bablyon for helping him accomplish that feat.I read The Richest Man in Bablyon and have to admit, I hated it! I thought it was stupid, like feel good stuff that has no substance. When ever friends came over, I hid the book. I felt so ridiculous.But Mr. Rohns words of wisdom kept echeoing in my mind. So I read it over and over untill the principles were imbedded into my conscious and subconsious mind.Soon, after the fifth reading, the the principles became habits for me. My wealth esculated at a very rapid rate. I was no longer wasting money. I was now investing the first 10% of my income, tithing 10% and investing another 10% in capital like no load mutuals, real estate, discounted mortgages, tax liens and my own business.The Richest Man in Bablyon has 7 basic principles:1) Start thy purse to fattening - save/invest2) Control thy expenditures - watch out for self serving brokers3) Make thy gold mutiply - use powerful investments4) Guard thy treasures from loss - watch out for brokers withtheir hot tips.5) Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment - rental properties, your own home---but stay within your means.6) Insure a future income - do work that you love to do. Become excellent at it.7) Increase thy ability to earn - education never stops. Keep reading good books like this one, The Millionaire Next Door, Rich Dad Poor Dad and so on.The Richest Man in Bablyon is an excellent book. Although only 145 pages, it is packed with powerful information that can be life changing. It has helped some people like Jim Rohn and others become millionaires.George Samuel Clason was born in Louisiana, Missouri, on November 7, 1874. He attended the University of Nebraska and served in the United States Army during the Spanish-American War. Beginning a long career in publishing, he founded the Clason Map Company of Denver, Colorado and published the first road atlas of the United States and Canada. In 1926, he issued the first in a series of pamphlets on thrift and financial success, using parables set in ancient Bablyon to make each of his points.These were distributed in large quantities by banks and insurance companies and became familiar to millions, the most famous being &quot;The Richest Man in Bablyon,&quot; the parable which has impacted the lives of millions of people. These &quot;Babylonian Parables&quot; have become a modern inspiritional classic.The Richest Man in Babylon is must reading for anyone who wants to achieve maximum financial success. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I am continually amazed at how a book so small can contain so much content and be so powerful. This book should be mandatory reading beginning at the grade school level through college and should be given as a gift right along with a diploma.I took the advice of acde1034@yahoo.com who recommended 'The Millionaire next Door&quot; and &quot;More Weath without Risk&quot; and bought and have read both. Both of these books are in the same status as &quot;The Richest Man in Bablyon&quot; and should also be required reading by anyone who is serious about their financial future. I am now giving &quot;Richest Man in Bablyon&quot; as a accessory gift to a cash gift at weddings and graduations."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I often give this book out as a gift whenever a person younger than me asks for my advice on money. I always present this book to them saying &quot;if you read it and do as it says, it will work magic.&quot; It really contains excellent, time tested advice, and would make a good gift for someone in their early 20s who is on their own for the first time, and struggling.The book is a series of parables about money written in the 1920s by George Clason. They were written as individual essays of a few thousand words, but the theme throughout them is consistent -- save 10% of your money, give 10% away, use 10% to reduce your debt load, and live on the remaining 70%.The stories in the book are entertaining; they are reminiscent of some of the parables in the Bible, such as the Prodigal Son or the story of the Workers in the Vineyard. I think this is intentional on the part of the author; certainly readers in the 1920s had an appreciation for &quot;old fashioned stories with a moral&quot; that people today seem to have lost. I enjoy the book greatly, though, and any thoughtful person who reads the book should find it interesting, especially if they are trying to get their finances in order."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I first read &quot;Richest Man in Bablyon bac in 1975. At first I was taken back by it's compact size and story book style. This book should be read by everyone from grade school to the college level students, employees, executives and the self employed. In todays's society, where people spend most if not all of what they make, this book is mre valuable than ever. Other books I would recommend are; &quot;The Millionaire next Door&quot; by Dr. Stanley et all, &quot;More Wealth without Risk&quot; and &quot;Financial Self-Defense&quot; by Charles Givens. Great book. A must read for anyone seeking financial independence,"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I am still amazed that such a tiny book can deliver so much powerful and timeless information.

This was one of three he recommended and he was very successful.The other books were Think and Grow Rich and Success through a Positive Mental Attitude.

You only get wealthy by investing and Richest Man in Bablyon teaches that all important step of investing.Two other books to read in the area of personal finance are Wealth without Risk and Financial Self Defense by Charles Givens.

You missed the whole point!Common sense is not necessarily common knowledge.I used to work for a millionaire who credited the principles in this book for helpin create his fortune which was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Save a dime out of every dollar. That is all it takes to start your fortune. But how many actually will do it?"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Twenty-five years ago, I sold radio advertising and had a client who seemed to have it all. Owned two of the town's best restaurants, drove a Porsche and a BMW, the hot cars then, was always taking a week or two off to go skiing or something and was only one year older than me. I'd spent a lot of time with the guy--he wasn't a great brain, terribly clever or witty. But he knew how to handle money.After calling on him for a couple of years, I figured I knew him well enough to ask him how he did it. I expected to hear he was deeply into commodities trading, or had an uncle who worked on Wall Street, a wealthy family or something like that, but he said it was really very simple. Once a year, he read The Richest Man in Babylon, and the rest of the year, he tried to apply it in his daily life.Well, you know how it is with people who Get Relgion. I wasn't in a place where I could accept that something so simple as reading a hundred and fifty pages of Ye Olde Storey could actually turn my financial life around, but I bought a copy. And about a year later on a rainy Saturday, I started reading it and couldn't put down. I know that's a phrase you see repeated in countless Amazon.com reviews, but it was true. The characters from the book reached out across thousands of years and grabbed me by the lapels and shook some sense into me.I have tried to re-read the book at least once per year, every year since then. Something else: I've tried to give away two copies per year, to people I know and love who I feel can benefit from not making the same mistakes I made in my mispent youth.There aren't any magic formulas in this book. There is nothing about options or day trading or investing new whatever the latest new technology is. It's almost math-free. Kind of ironic, when you turn the pages of the average business best seller and try to figure out the charts and graphs and algebra.This is a book that ought to be used in our schools. It's written in a wonderful old-world style and the characters are real heroes, grapling with many of the same issues we struggle with today--they're just doing it without cable-TV and the internet. You want a new Lexus? These folks talk about how hard it is to survive without one of the newest-model chariots. It's the same thing, really.Do yourself, your spouse, your children, your neighbors a favor. Buy a few copies of this one. Keep one for yourself, and give away the rest. Mark yours up. Underline it. Make notes in the margins. Try to re-read it whenever you feel yourself being tempted to pop for ADSL or new cellular phone or a ski trip or the latest and greatest widget.Read a single financial book, and you get a few good ideas. Read two and you get a few more. Read several and you start to get very little new information. I've read dozens of titles, from Andrew Tobias to Martin Zweig. But I'd recommend you start right here. If you never read another book on money, you will have a very sound basis for a very good life, after spending a day in ancient Babylon and watching how they learned to handle money thousands of years ago. This is the money book to buy if you're only buying one."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I think that some people underestimate this book due to it's small size. This is NOT a book that you will want to read only once and put away, you will NEED to read this over and over untill the ideas saturate both your conscious and subscious minds and untill the ideas become habits. Then you will achieve some real results."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"How are the sophisticated doing financially?

He handed me this book (after he'd read it himself) and told me to read it. Worried it was just another dull, on-going investment book, I procrastinated... but when I finally started to read it, I was pleasantly surprised! It's very easy to read, fun, short, and to the point. My dad also made my mom read it, and he's planning on buying more copies to loan out to friends! It's really helped our whole family. If anyone out there is having a hard time getting a friend interested in mutual funds or any type of investing, this point will get the point across!

And for all those desperados out there dreaming of getting fantastically rich with ridiculously little effort: here is your guide. You will learn that making money and getting rich isn't hard at all, but it requires a little discipline. There are only a handful of tips given in this book, but they are sufficient to make a real difference in your wallet and a real difference in your life!The style is very easy to understand and very straight-forward. A child could read this book, even though the setting is that of the ancient city of Babylon, but that makes the story and the lesson all the more interesting. Five stars are awarded to this book and trust me, you'll agree with me!"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"As a practical guide for financial security; this book illustrates the laws under which the accumulation and preservation of wealth operate.The book is chock full of usable practical advice: control your expenditures (one tenth of all you get is yours to keep), invest wisely (look for evidence of prior successful experience), lend cautiously (get collateral), help others sensibly (do not take on their burdens as your own), and finally: avoid debts and gambling.These concepts are nicely framed within the context of both success stories and in lessons learned.

If one can follow the laws of wealth, the consequences of these laws will follow, just like throwing up a ball against gravity. The trick is in being able to follow these laws throughout the storms of life. There are better books that teach the \\"hows\\" of following these laws, but as a foundation for understanding what these laws are, there is no book of which I am aware better than this one. It has been around far longer than any of the other finance books, has simple truths, is very solid and still going strong. If I could only chose one book on finance and wealth to recommend, this would be it."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"The Richest Man In Babylon is a good guide for anyone whether they want to amass wealth or just live comfortably.According to the book it doesn't matter what your income is, anyone can save money, all it takes is the proper perspective. This book gives you way to look at money that many of us have been taught, but may have forgotten. As other reviewers pointed out, this is basic, common sense information, but good advice bears repeating. Each of my children have a copy of this book and began a savings program before age 16.I think the biggest point the book makes is, it does not matter what your income level is, anyone can save 10% of their income if they really think it is important enough to do, and that small amount on a weekly basis is hardly missed at the time, while growing over time to be a substantial amount. As Albert Einstein pointed out,there is nothing more powerful than compound interest and that is what you get by saving just 10% of all of your income. I highly recomend this book for kids old enough to read on up to anyone who needs to be reminded of the simple beauty of good advice."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"\\"A part of what you earn is yours to keep\\", one of the simple laws of money that George Clason develops in his personal finance bestseller \\"The Richest Man In Babylon\\". &lt;strong>&lt;em>This US Army soldier turned author...&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> &lt;span class=\\"fullpost\\"> and publisher simplifies the distilled wisdom of centuries. Even a 10 year old will love and understand these beautifully written stories of the Babylonian wise men. This book saved me money even before I bought it. How did that happen?At a book sale the other day, I wished I could find an interesting read. Since nothing caught my eye, I rather grudgingly picked up two rather uninteresting expensive books, ones I would normally avoid. Later as I wandered around my eyes lighted on this most unusual title. I like reading about ancient cities so I naturally picked this one up. It was a book on the basics of personal finance. A few minutes browsing through it were enough to convince me that I would be wasting my money on the first two books. So I put them back and returned home clutching a copy of \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\".On reading it, I understood a law which has transformed my thinking for ever. The law said \\" A part of what you earn is yours to keep.\\" I now pay myself first each month when I get my salary. Each rupee I pay myself, I put in the growth scheme of a mutual fund. Each rupee is a slave which will work for me throughout my life. Each slave will have children and those children will work for me too. They in turn will have children who will also work for me. And the cycle goes on... This is an important lesson I have learnt from the Babylonian wise men.You'll meet Bansir the chariot builder who can never make his ends meet and his wise friend Arkad, the richest man in Babylon. You will enjoy their life stories while you learn the simple laws that govern the acquisition of money. &lt;em>A part of what you earn is yours to keep. Try it, you will never regret it."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Hello all,Firstly, should state I have read the translated version of this book in Chinese. This book is probably one of the most useful personal finance books I've read. The advice, seemingly simple and straightforward, truly does make a difference in planning one's future.For it does not promise instant rags to riches, other practical advice includes 'working hard in one's job', 'saving 10% of your monthly salary' and 'do not be too stingy, enjoy the rest of the salary and life's many wonders' while keeping strictly to the principles of savings and investing.Right now, I'm working on 2.5% savings, it's less than the recommended amt but it's a mindset of \\"less now, more later\\". While paying off one's loans and debts, while saving, can feel the security and empowerment that comes with increasing one's savings as described in the book.In the end, what the book preaches is sticking to a simple formula of1)Earn one's money through labour2)Save 10% of earnings3)Spend the rest of 90%4)Invest savingsRepeat infinitely.The analogy of using a seed to describe the growth of money is apt as it requires discipline, patience and perseverance.A recommended read."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"In this easy to read and easy to understand book, you will find priceless, ageless advice for creating, building and maintaining wealth, woven into a wonderful story.

This small, 144 page book is worth its weight in platinum and will pay for itself over and over and over... again and again (I can't stress it enough ). The book is written in a story or parable format, where, through examples, a reader discovers how to harness the mysteries of money. These parables are relatively short and extremely enjoyable reading. It's time to invest in yourself!

It has basic and time-tested principles which will help you to lead a financially secure future. Quite simply put, it's now about how many Gs you pull down, it's how you spend those Gs which will determine your financial success.I have given this book out as gifts to colleagues and friends.

It's a natural choice for kids who are just starting to discover the pleasures and dangers of money; at that age, books can have a big impact of values!Don't look to this book to give you advanced financial planning information or directions on how to start a Roth IRA.

Although, many of the ideas in the book arewhat some people would call &quot;common sense&quot;, it is the delivery of these ideas which make this book a gem. Every financial principle that this book presents is encased in a fable and repeated more numerous times. It is the presentation of the principles which truely allow people to internalize them and apply them in their everyday lives!"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Put simply this is a great book. Not only is the wisdom solid and well-founded it is an enjoyable, easy to read book. I have allready begun applying the principle of saving one-tenth and it is giving a satisfying feeling allready. This book is so easy and valuable to read I will teach my children from it."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I have been advising investors and writing books on futures and commodities investing for the past 11 years.When I discovered this book I realized for the first time that success can be planned. There are systems that can be put in place that will guide you financially towards success.This book is essetntial for everyone that is trying to get out of the mundaneness of living from paycheck to paycheck.The first person narrative that Mr.Clason uses really drives the points home. He really brings a biblical aire to his writings and makes his points feel like gospel.I recommend this book to everyone of my clients."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"The \\"secret\\" is not merely \\"positive thinking\\", as some modern self-help writers (and Oprah) would have you believe. For those of us that live in the real world is also some hard work and self-sacrifice involved. This classic book contains the very advice that most sensible parents would want their child to hear, but unfortunately -- most kids don't listen to their parents. Of course, unlike this book, most parents these days don't speak in (supposed) Babylonian parables -- maybe if they did, kids would listen more. So give them this book in addition to your parental nagging and hope they learn the REAL secrets of success in this world.Oh yeah, and if you haven't read this book yet, it's a quick read and well worth your time."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"There are so many books and recordings out there on how to create wealth. The problem with these books are that they can only be implemented when you have accumulated certain amount of money (typically around $500k in assets), so it wouldnt benefit the average joe. On the other hand if you do possess the required assets, it is still a struggle to double your wealth because you dont have the knowledge of the fundamentals of creating wealth.Majority of the information out there would explain to you how to increase your assets, but what they dont explain to you is how to start with \\"Nothing\\" and create wealth. \\"The richest man in babylon\\" clearly addresses this important issue and have to admit that majority of the informations out there lack this principle. It is like teaching you how to write sentences without you knowing your ABC's,... and thats why lots of informations on creating wealth fails with so many people.Being successful in any area of your life means grasping and mastering the fundamentals, and \\"The richest man in babylon\\" delivers the fundamentals clearly, precisely and easily.I give this a 5stars based on the high quality of educational content it provides to its listener/reader(from all walks of life)."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"First of all, if you don't like reading books written in shakesperian language (thou, thy, blah, blah) then stay away from this one!! If that does not bother you then this book is good enough....I guess. The book deals with common sense issues which every investor should posses. Since the book is cheap and tiny and one can finish it up in a matter of hours, I guess it is a decent purchase."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I should have read the other 1-star reviews before buying this, but since I had already read the book years ago and loved it, I figured I didn't need to.The version I bought has a burgundy cover with the title in gold letters. It was published in 2011 by Myriad World Publishers. (The original book was published in 1926.)I bought this one to replace the copy I lent to a friend. The typography is TERRIBLE!!!! It's so small I'd need a strong magnifying glass for every page, and it's laid out quite strangely and unattractivly. I agree with what another reviewer said, it looks as if it were just cut-and-paste from somewhere else and never reviewed by a human eye before going to press.Bottom line: DON'T GET THIS VERSION, buy another one that you can actually read. It is a wonderful story, illustrating basic debt and financial principles easily and clearly."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"This book was pretty good, and I would have given it five stars had it not been for two things:1) The repeating of information over and over again (maybe the author wanted this to strike his points home, but for me it was a little overkill).2) The language used. It seemed to be in a NKJV of the book... I would assume all of them are like that, but this one was like \\"thou hast\\" and things like that. (Maybe it was the author's purpose to \\"bring you back\\" to the Babylonian times, but to me it was just a distraction and made it a little bit harder to read).Other than those two things, the book was great! It was a short read (important IMO) and I found it very hard not to continue on to learn the next \\"step\\" or find out more info that was just in the next section.Worth the few hours to go through it."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I would recommend this book as the best first book on money for anyone that would like to begin reading about the subject. It's engaging and fun, teaching the basics on saving and spending wisely for those who want to learn to develop a proper wealth building mindset. I would also recommend parents or educators give this book to their children to read (even though it's not a children's book) because it's accessible to people of all ages and enjoyable enough to keep the interest of even an overstimulated child.This is the place to begin to learn about money, but not the end of the road. After you've read this try more advanced books like \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" or \\"The Millionaire Mind,\\" both by Thomas Stanley. You should be well on your way to an understanding of how to build wealth."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"The Richest Man in Babylon is profound in its simplicity.

The heart of each ancient tale is still true today; learn to save by paying yourself first, invest in yourself through education, don't waste all your extra money on stuff that will eventually choke out your future and clutter your home.

It tells you not to invest with a shoe maker who wants to become a diamond trader. Why? Because the shoe maker knows nothing about diamonds. Sounds simple enough? It is, but we need to be reminded of this. Most new businesses are probably going to fail, but our aspiring capital seeker will tell us anything to get our money, so by the end of his pitch, if we're naive enough, our heads will be full of hot air and we'll be flying, dreaming of those profits to come, and perhaps to eager to break our piggy bank and multiply it.Luckily, books like this tell us fables that will remind is of the legendary mistakes of others, so we don't fall in the same traps."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"When you forget to appreciate yourself this book tells you how in technicolor.

An obvious one: as a person's wealth rises, so do their expenses.Translation, if you want to have money, learn to discipline yourself now and not later. Studies show that most lottery winners are bankrupt within a few years and mostly because they lacked self discipline. Therefore, the problem is not the lack of money but how it is managed.

I won't repeat what others have already said, except to say that having studied finance, I think the advice should really be to save 20% of everything that ever hits your checking account rather than just 10%. The reasons are twofold:1. Taxes on investments. They're much higher today than they were a few generations ago, so we need to invest more to overcome that. (Sorry!)2. The expected return on investments appears to have gone down.

Buy the book!"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"In the pages of history, there lives no city more glamorous than Babylon, known for its lavish houses, palaces and huge city walls. Its very name conjures visions of wealth and splendor. Its treasures of gold and jewels were fabulous. One naturally pictures such a wealthy city as located in a suitable setting of tropical luxury surrounded by rich natural resources of forests and mines. It was located beside the Euphrates River, in a flat, arid valley. Babylon is an outstanding example of man's ability to achieve great objectives, using whatever available means at his disposal.Babylon, as George S. Clason notes, it was also the cradle of modern finance: money as the means of exchange, tradable property titles, promissory notes and all forms of lending and borrowing were all highly developed. Its prosperity continued for centuries because its inhabitants were allowed to make money freely. Even slaves, if they could earn a bit on the side, could eventually buy their way to freedom.Moreover, Babylon's success inspired Clason to write a series of parables which would demonstrate the unchanging principles of finance and wealth building. When George S. Clason's introduced these parables in a famous series of pamphlets, they became very popular (All are pregnant with practical wisdom) and were distributed by banks, insurance companies, financial institutions and other employers to teach the benefits of saving and hard work.His advice soon provided guidance to millions of readers. Although first written over half a century years ago, these teachings are as relevant today as they were for the citizens of Babylon. The success secrets of the ancients -- an assured road to happiness and prosperity. Countless readers have been helped by the famous \\"Babylonian parables,\\" hailed as the greatest of all inspirational works on the subject of thrift, financial planning, and personal wealth creation.Acclaimed as a modern-day classic, this celebrated bestseller offers an understanding of -- and solution to -- your personal financial problems that will guide you through a lifetime. This is the book that holds the secrets to acquiring money, keeping money, and making money earn more money. These fascinating and informative stories have become a modern classic in their field.The Richest Man in Babylon is a book you will want to read yourself, recommend to friends, and give to young people just starting out in life. The best advice is often free. The solutions to life's toughest problems are often the most simple. Perhaps that is why the best advice too often is ignored. It's just too simple to be believable. The advice offered by this book is so simple that it most often is ignored. Yet it reveals the only reliable secret to obtaining and accumulating wealth. It is a simple (and safe) secret for obtaining riches. It is not easy, but it is simple. It is hard to execute, but it is unfailing.There are a lot of ways to build wealth, but there is a simple, sure way that can always work. And these are what George S. Clason made very clear in this timeless classic. His first prescription is to pay yourself first. Set aside 10% (or more) of what you earn before taxes, before expenses, and before debts. Then, tackle those debts by applying the next 20% against them until they are gone. That leaves 70% and you should live on this. Spend it and enjoy life as you can while staying within this budget. To be realistic, you must control expenditures. That is the second point, and often the biggest missing ingredient in accumulating wealth. All of a sudden expenses simply rise to meet the new level of income.Once the debts are gone and the savings grow, and then make your money work for you by investing in money-making ventures. But guard your treasures wisely, as money slowly gained can be quickly lost by risky choices. Here is where you have to rely on experts until your own experience affords you the knowledge to make good choices.Furthermore, Clason emphasizes that inaction is often the greatest thief of success. While building your savings be alert to good business opportunities and seize them when found. Own rather than rent and insure a future income by royalties, rents, and so on. Finally, and perhaps simplest of all, is to increase your ability to earn by acquiring additional new skills.Conclusively, this is a small and cheap book, readable in a few hours. However, don't fall under the false impression that the lessons are too simple. The laws and parables are simple, but executing a plan takes effort and the right mindset. It is the best starting book to discover the first steps of personal wealth creation and accumulation. If you haven't heard of or read The Richest Man in Babylon yet, maybe this is a good time to grab a copy for yourself and read it."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Lots of people say &quot;Money isn't everything&quot;, and they're probably right. However, most of the people who agree with that statment are those who have taken steps to ensure that Money is no longer a major concern in their life.The information contained in this book is ageless, practical and indeed, priceless; it can stand proudly against the modern-day texts, such as &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot; and &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot;. A word of advice - these principles do not work by merely reading and memorising; they only work through proper application. Those who use them properly will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Before reading Clason's The Richest Man in Babylon, I had high expectations. How could I not given the lofty Amazon rating (5 stars strong with many reviewers) and the book jacket's promise as \\"the book that holds the key to personal wealth\\"? This book does not disappointI would recommend the book because the parables do help describe Clason's points in an engaging way.To help in your purchase decision, the following is a summary of the book's contents:(1) Save a portion of your income (Put away X% of your income every paycheck)(2) Control your expenditures (Don't spend more than you need to)(3) Invest your money (If you are unable to invest effectively, get someone else to invest your money)(4) Purchase a home(5) Increase the amount of money you earn(6) Protect your wealth against lossesIn effect, the book can be summarized by the following statement:Maximize your wealth inflows (Points: 1, 3, 4, 5) while minimizing your wealth outflows (Points: 2, 6).If this all seems very basic to you, then this is NOT the book for you.

I first heard about this book back in the 1970s when I was involved in my first network marketing company. Fortunately, the people associated with that company taught more than just use the company products and put all of your money into company material.Many years later, I attended a seminar and met the great Jim Rohn. If you have ever heard Jim Rohn speak, then you know that this is along with Think & Grow Rich one of his must read books, the book his mentor Mr. Earl Schoff told him about and the book that allowed Jim Rohn to become financially independent in only 6 years.Don't let the size of this book fool you---it is packed with powerful information. It is must reading. This book is the basis of many of the top financial experts from Charles J. Givens who calls it \\"The 10% solution\\" through Suze Orman, Dr. Stanley \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" up to David Bach \\"The Automatic Millionaire.\\" I don't know of anyone who has amassed any real level of wealth without practicing these principles.It's a small book. An easy read. You can finish it in one evening. But if you use it, you can amass a fortune.Jim Rohn says he has recommended this book at his seminars, in his books and on his tapes for nearly 40 years and best as he can tell only about 3% actually go out, buy the book and actually read it and apply the techniques.

Don't be put off by the &quot;biblical&quot; lingo (this may be a turn *on* for some). Takes a few minutes to get used to the language, but you'll suddenly find yourself caught up in a series of &quot;a-ha's!&quot;The book is filled with common sense advice, but the beauty is that it's presented in such a way that you're vaulted into a different way of thinking about accumulating wealth (similar to the style of &quot;Who Moved My Cheese?&quot;, only this book was originally published in 1926!)Coming in at only 144 pages, &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; is an easy 1-2 hour read and will forever change the way you view personal finance. Especially recommended for those who can't seem to shake debt and need a new mindset. But the solid foundations contained within are a must-read for *anyone* interested in the road to wealth, whether you're a novice or an expert.And one more selling point: it's CHEAP!"},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Clason's classic remains timeless. A slew of business books have published since the original release of \\"The Richest Man in Babylon,\\" but few can match the simple and effective words of advice the reader receives; only a handful exceed it. The fundamental premise of Babylon is living below one's means (by saving at least a minimum of 10% of earnings) and having money work for you (passive income.) Clason solidifies these concepts by an engaging narrative readers can quickly identify with even today. I thought the emphasis placed on asset protection first, and selection of knowledgeable advisors to invest saved money with as particularly valuable. All too often the focus is on rapid returns without adequate investment of time with the potential pitfalls of an investment.

George S. Clason's \\"The Richest Man In Babylon\\" is one of the best books I have ever read.I read this book just over a year and-a-half ago when I first became interested in entrepreneurism. Though the book doesn't directly focus on entrepreneurism and business, but the lessons learned can definitely be applied in so many different ways.The book explores parables from the ancient city of Babylon, one of the richest cities known to man. Throughout the book you follow the lives of various businessmen who go off into the world to make something for themselves. It shows the struggles they encounter and the riches that come about from their hard work and determination.Each chapter is treated as a different lesson and goes into depth of how each lesson can be applied to your life by using the characters from each chapter to teach you numerous lessons.

Sometimes I read book with that claim and there ponder, 'Did XXmillion people REALLY read this literary effort?' I guess there must be a lot of bored people at airports with a poor judgement of cover-copy as I!So, what of TRMIB, is that worthy of the 'more than two million sold' stuck on the front of my book? the answer is YES! Yes indeed it is! I discovered TRMIB by accident and decided to give it a look over, neither in debt having any problems in the financial department per se. I was still spurred on by the other Amazon reviews into giving it a glance over; and how glad I am. Though I say \\"having no financial problems per se.\\" if the truth be told, I guess we could use a kick in the wallet and a 6 A.M. roll-call in that department. If you are in need of that then look no further. What this book offers you is a fool-proof formula to financial success, based not upon get-rich-quick-pull-rabbit-from-hat school of economics and good housekeeping. No, what Clanson has done is to develop pre-war spendthriftness into a simple yet effective Art. he has taken the basic principles of financial success and laid out clear rules towards that goal. What he has NOT done it to kid you that if you read this book you'll be an instant millionaire, or any such fictitious claims. Presented in the format of a series of fictitious conversations and tales Clanson time and time again relays the basic truths to financial security and financial success, based not upon external forces; rather based upon your own abilities to keep what you EARN (you have to work for your success) in your wallet, and not in someone else's. In the case you do find yourself in financial jam and have the desire to get yourself out Clanson offers a formula for that too.What I thought was impressive about this text was the simplicity of the ideas, the logical and rational way they were laid out and presented and the sheer accuracy of his approach. Maybe in this age Clanson's views will find less receptive ears, but anyone who can walk the path he guides us too can shortly achieve financial independence and attain victory over their leaky wallet.

It was written in 1929. The principles have taken good care of me all my adult life.

I know, I have tried to encourage people to read and impliment it but largely to no avail. It is 100 pages of fabulous information! I bought nine copies of this for my grandchildren and personalised each one with written encouragement. I hope they will be more receptive than the very large majority.

Well one of the things is, they're not reading this book, or if they are they are not applying what it teaches. Wise up, buy a copy, read it and do what it says! It will undoubtedly be the best fiver you ever spend on financial advice. You don't need a financial advisor. George Clason will give you all you need for five quid. If you're in debt you don't need a company to help you out. You can do it yourself for free. I am off on my 4th holiday this year. Thanks George! What more can I say? Just one thing.

The lessons taught bear striking similarity to those of Rich Dad, Poor Dad--that was published more than 70 years later--and fans of the later Kiyosaki/Lechter book will likely enjoy this older one written by Clason, published in the 1920's. I had minimal prior familiarity of Babylon prior to reading this book. While the forward does discuss the historical context of Babylon, the book itself is *not* about the city proper. It is about finance in a real-world, rags-to-richest sense.The 3rd-person narrative and biblical lexicon and grammatical style took me by surprise, though once I saw past the dialog into the stories themselves, I found myself entertained and frequently nodding in agreement. Non-native English speakers *may* stumble on the character dialog. For example, \\"Never, in all the years of our friendship, didst thou talk like this before...\\", or, \\"There were skekels which I cast with careless freedom to the beggars; there were pieces of silver with which I did buy finery for my wife...\\" will read without much issue to native readers, though may prove distracting for readers not accustomed to archaic English writing.Overall: 4 of 5."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Having been written in 1926 and not updated since, you'd think this book was more than a little dated.

Short and straight to the point."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I do not usually appreciate \\"self-help\\" books, but the points made in \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\" seem to be mostly just common sense. Unfortunately, most people completely lack common sense about money.One of the main ideas that most people never seem to get is that it is better, and more interesting, to make money from your MONEY than to make money breaking your back. However, this leads us to the first difficulty: in order to make money from your money, you have to have some.As we supposedly \\"all know,\\" we cannot have our cake and eat it, too. But most people spend every penny in their paychecks, and then some run out and charge more on their credit cards. They live from hand to mouth, from paycheck to paycheck, and they never even dream of actually saving 10 percent (or more) of what they earn.But how can you have money if you don't have any money? Let us imagine some typical American, earning (say) $40K per year. Saving 10 percent of his salary would give him \\"only\\" $4,000 in the bank at the end of one year. This looks pretty miserable, until you stop to wonder just how many people could actually lay their hands on $4,000 in cash WITHOUT doing a cash-advance on their credit cards. By the end of the fifth year, this fictional person would have $20,000 in the bank, assuming no interest and no investment income.But now this person is in a position to actually begin making investments, and watch his money work for him. And the profits from that should just be plowed right back into \\"the money tree.\\"My personal opinion: if you think there is another way to \\"financial freedom,\\" you are simply deluding yourself. Win the lottery? Gee, how many rich people do you know who got their start that way?Answer: none. Lottery winners usually run out and spend their winnings faster than they come in. Consider winning \\"a million dollars\\" in some phony lottery which does not actually hand you a million dollars, but doles you out $50,000 per year over 20 years. Most people turn this into a sort of middle-class welfare, and wind up as broke as they ever were. But, if you did NOT quit your job, and put that money in the bank, faithfully, over a 20-year-period, you would (after investing it) have a whole lot more than a million dollars.The author of this book was clever: he set it in ancient Babylon. The point was that reality, in many important respects, does not change.I would agree with all that there are many ways to be wealthy: in learning, in money, in love, in friends, and so on. But it is very difficult to attain those other happinesses if you can't make the rent.This is actually a good book. It has never gone out of print, and that may mean something."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I enjoyed The Richest Man In Babylon and appreciated this book by George S.

For those of you who are already well-off, you will have minimal gains by reading the book, but for the people who live paycheck-to-paycheck, and have trouble accounting for where their money went at the end of the money, this is your book.The prinicples outlined in the book will serve you well in starting to, and continuing to build wealth.

There's no homework to it either. Just do what it says and you should be fine, in theory. The tough part is putting it to practical use. I gave it a four because I didn't expect it to be this clear.

It is written in story form, telling parables about money and accumulating wealth. The story format makes it very impactful. I think even today we have slaves and slave masters. The slaves are the ones who work for other people and live paycheck to paycheck. The slave masters are the ones who own companies or have other types of passive income, thus having slaves work to support them. I have passive income myself, and I have slaves working 9 to 5 jobs to give me my income. I no longer work for other people. I'm self employed now and I have my own business. Working for other people was hell and working for myself is heaven. I was very abused in every job I had, but as my own boss I treat myself very well! I have it really good now and my life is easy and very pleasurable. This book promotes saving and investing so you can have a passive income too. Then you can live well without working for others.

This book has sage advice in literary form and is a joy to read."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"I believe the true definition of \\"timeless classic\\" means something is just as meaningful and relevant today as it was when it was first created. Such is the case with George Clason's, THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON. Originally published in 1926, this book is not only still relevant today, but over the past eighty or so years has spawned many a financial success book. In fact, this is like an early version of Robert Kyosaki's decade old, Rich Dad Poor Dad.It's even quite possible that this very book may well have been the financial training Kyosaki's rich dad used to create his wealth and became the financial knowledge he passed on. The timing is certainly about right. The lessons are more than similar.This book is written in the form of a parable as told in ancient Babylon. Clason uses what he thought to have been the proper language of the time, similar to the King James English derived from the translation of Textus Receptus. Herein lies my only knock on this great book. Unless you don't mind wading through all of the \\"thee\\", \\"thou\\" and \\"hath nots\\", the book does become tedious at times.Nevertheless, it is well worth the effort. There are precious pearls of financial wisdom to be gleaned from these pages. If you want the basic rules of creating wealth that has been proven for millennia, there is no better place to start than with this timeless classic."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"It's a simple advice he gives, but it's done in an entertaining and convincing way.

It's not getting rich quick, but it is getting rich."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Clason has written an elegant fable on how to be wise financially.He makes the education very entertaining in a short easy read. He fascinates us with what seems to be real historical artifacts and genuine history of a great nation.If one has read any other such material (like Rich Dad Poor Dad or Smart Couples Finish Rich) you will find many of the same principles. Mind you Clason's book came before the two mentioned so he gets more credit.What he has over the others is the simplicity of the concepts and their digestable telling. He gives very basic but essential advice that would guide the reading of other more technical books. He equips us with the CONCEPT of money management and the invaluable character that must accompany it rather than the technical details of particular industries.If you are just beginning to educate yourself on money or would like to introduce a friend to that world - this is the book to start with."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"If you are looking to get your finances up to par, then this is the first step.

Firstly, because it deals with problems that still plague a large majority of the population, the lack of savings. And it offers simple and practical advice as a remedy.I love the language used in this book. It sounds old, even biblical, and it gives an authentic feel to the stories told.Most of all, I love the way it presents history. Most of what we learn about Babylon comes from the Bible or Herodotus - and most of what is written is of wars and mad kings. Here is an everyday Babylon; and it is easy to see the reason why it came into existence in the first place. It is a place of trade and commerce - a small oasis of peace in the ancient world.Truly unique - this book is a gem! Buy it and read it over and over again, as I have! Then buy few more for your closest friends - they make great Birthday gifts."},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"What more can be said? This is a truly timeless classic. When I have followed this book's sound advice, I have always come out ahead. Think about it, no matter how much income you earn, you can always be broke, or wealthy in your own right. If you bring in 30 grand a year, and you spend 25 grand, you're doing good. If you make 300 grand a year, and you spend 325 grand, you are broke at a higher level. Clason's book reveals how to build wealth with money you already have coming in, that's it! Follow this advice from ancient ones crying from the dust of Babylon, and you really can be prosperous. Wisdom and patience is all it takes, not fancy advice for the current trend.

None of the concepts presented in the book are novel, in fact they are all common sense. That being said, they are presented in a very enlightening context that spurs self reflection. The concepts discussed focus on the importance of savings, and investing these savings in a responsible and safeguarding manner. The book also focuses on the importance of hard work, and advocates against debt and living beyond one's means.This is a very inspirational book that is both easy and entertaining to read for old and young alike. It is truly amazing that the basic laws of personal finance realized thousands of years ago still apply. Wikipedia has a detailed summary on this book for further reading: [...]. On a side note for readers, this edition is written in King James English.Below are some excerpts I found particularly insightful:1- \\"One may not condemn a man for succeeding because he knows how.Neither may one with justice take away from a man what he has fairly earned, to give to men of less ability.\\"2- \\"Preceding accomplishment must be desire. Thy desires must be strong and definite.\\"3- \\"...to attract good luck to oneself, it is necessary to take advantage of opportunities.\\"4- \\"Better a little caution than a great regret.\\"5- \\"Where the determination is, the way can be found.\\""},{"Title":"The richest man in Babylon (Babylonian parables dealing with the principles of finance, etc)","review":"Length:: 7:00 MinsIf you do not like financial books then that is ok.

A bit too long though."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Kriegel does a masterful job at covering Namath for the reader. That said, I found the book way too long for the subject matter. Definitely mainline skimming after Namath retires from the Jets. The author really covers Namath's flaws. He appears to have always been an industrial strength drinker with little regard for most of his teammates and others. Not an easy person to like. Consequently, I found myself asking why am I reading all of these words about such a person. The football parts are really good, especially I would think for old line Jets fans. However, other parts are less intriguing. I've noticed that authors who are also journalists tend to think we care as much about all the details as do they. I found Kriegel's book, Pistol, about Pete Maravich is a better read."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Unlike some of the other reviews, I will be brief. This is a very poorly written book, subjecting the reader to superfluous information about irrelevant people. I love a good biography about those people who have had a significant impact on our culture, and Joe Namath certainly fills that slot. He was the manifestation of the '60s for many of us, taking chances to express himself without apology and, often, without an audience. However, this book is about all of the other people who crossed through his life, many peripherals who simply do not matter, and who fill space without adding to the story. Why should we be subjected to the life histories of people on the fringes, and why can we not simply focus on the true impact of this man? Do not buy this book - there are better bios to read that will not bore you to tears."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"before Joe Montana,&Now Tom Brandy had Quarterback cool there was Joe Namath.

The author talked too much about Namaths youth and basically skims his time at Alabama and the pros. Gave it away and hope to never see again."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"I thought this book was going to be all about Namath, but there is way too much football history.Wished the history would have been edited and and the book had stuck to Namath."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"As a lifelong New York Jets fan I was very disappointed with this book. There was nothing in it that I haven't read before. The author rehashes old stories and anecdotes and presents them as new material.Wait until this hits the remainder bin."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Namath, through his legal mouthpiece, refused to cooperate with the author of \\"Namath: A Biography.\\" A terrific researcher and writer, Mark Kriegel didn't need him. Joe left enough bitter friends, teammates, and business partners who were willing to share the lowdown on Broadway Joe. Ain't a pretty picture, but neither is pro football.This was one of the most talented and courageous players ever to step onto a football field. The author pays due homage to Joe Namath, QB. Plenty of fascinating stuff on Beaver Falls, Alabama, and Jets heroics. His athleticism was a great gift; his grit in making the most of it was unyielding. If you utterly idolized him as #12, leave that as your only memory.What this book presents is Namath as man in full; which is to say, a user without peer, a smalltown pool hustler who brought that ethos to all that touched his life. There's me, and there are the suckers. When he was finished with you, you learned it this way: your phone calls were not returned. Out. Finis. A buddy for twenty years now dying? A teammate for a dozen years? Sorry. Your services in the lifelong promotion that remains Joe Willie \\"White Shoes\\" are no longer required. Perhaps the best example cited by the author of the crassness of Namath the man was when he wanted 60G to attend a charity golf tournament organized by his Jets teammates. Unfortunately that sum would drain the total funds earned by the event. So no Joe. Not that he wanted to go; that was the point of the exhorbitant fee--he didn't need them.When the primetime hustle that was Broadway Joe finally petered out, Namath decided it was family that mattered. He had always tried to take care of his natural family, which was a broken one. But he had no practice at real life. He waited too long. He soon married a user half his age who hustled him: she left him because she wanted to be a \\"serious actress\\" and \\"find herself,\\" as Kriegel painfully quotes her. This she did by ditching Broadway Joe for her own personal Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. She took the two Namath daughters with her, leaving her husband shellshocked as to how such a thing could happen to The Man Himself. He quickly returned to that which best sustained him through his desultory off-field existence: booze.Kriegel throughout makes the point that the Namath con is all part of the Big Con: The Enteraintment and Sports Sell. The original power behind Namath as Broadway Joe was Sonny Werblin, New York TV superagent and hustler extraordinnaire when he became a minority Jets owner. At the time, pro football was bringing up the rear in the American sports pantheon. Its owners still labored under the delusion they were in the football business. Namath-Werblin changed that. It was the perfect marriage in Joe's life. Joe and Sonny, Football and Show Biz.Namath's latest promotion has been his autobiography, surprisingly titled, \\"Namath.\\" This was the reason Joe risked an interview late last year with Sixty Minutes, notorious for slapping the self-satisfied smiles off its subjects. No problem: his attorney likely made sure he got what he wanted, a puff-piece where he charmingly skates Oprahesque across the wreckage of his life while walking a Florida beach. Trying to stay booze-free once again, moving on metal knees and arthritic hips, the man's hustle hasn't lost a step. And he may be alone, still devoted to his daughters, but he's certainly not lonely (wink, wink). Broadway Joe lives.If you want a well-written take on Namath that is as gritty as the man and his world, read the Kriegel book. It's all about Joe William Namath, who remains one of the most extraordinary football players I ever watched. And wish I could pay good U.S. money to go back and watch again in the autumn dust of Shea Stadium, New York."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"This \\"bio\\" is not simply the story of Joe Namath--his life is inextricably entwined with football itself, from the legend of Bear Bryant to the coming of age of modern professional football, and the culture (and counter-culture) of the 60's. This story not only sheds light on Namath but is also a fascinating lesson on some not-so-ancient history.As for the man himself, Kriegel presents a sympathetic and yet unflinching view of Joe Namath. Despite his larger-than-life persona, Namath is truly revealed in this book in all his (yes, sometimes self-contradictory) facets. You feel the excitement of the games and the rush of stardom, but you also can't escape the feeling that you're on a bullet train, going full tilt to its doom.The pictures are of a character with the prose... showing many different parts of Namath and his life, and including some of the most astounding sports photos I've ever seen--both the pain on the boy's face after the Orange Bowl loss and the amazing clearance he was able to achieve, lifting off to throw a pass.Overall, a fascinating story, well-written and alternately poignant, funny, sad, exhilerating... you name it, it's probably in there."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"I couldn't put this book down until I finished it. The author brilliantly weaves together Joe Namath's family background, socioeconomic circumstances, culture and football to clearly and movingly explain this complex hero and possibly unwitting revolutionary. I am thrilled that there is a biography that does justice to the great Joe Namath."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"I bought this book because I am from Beaver Falls though about 9 years younger than Namath. I was young enough to be influenced by Namath and saw him as one of us who made good. However, the main reason I wanted to read this biography was because I was interested in how place affected the personality. It is rare that Namath is ever mentioned without mentioning his roots. He is one athlete we strongly associate with backround. The author does attend to this theme by speculating how Namath's background influenced decisons he made focusing especially on his confidence as an athlete. I gave this book a four because I think the author fails us at the end. The last twenty years of Namath's life are covered in just a few pages. I would like to have seen more interviews with people who might have had some insight other than a few former teammates and various hangers-on. The author does do a creditable job of pieceing together a highly unusual and ultimately sad life.Namath was very typical of a number of guys I grew up with who hung around the Blue Room and played sports. Namath's swagger came from BF, as well as his \\"you need me, I don't need you\\" attitude. Beaver Falls produced a lot of Namaths. Not necessarily Namath wannabees but actual Namaths. I see them around and at class reunions.Ultimately, when Joe entered the world of adult responsibility, it was way too late and he had no tools or blueprints as to how adults behave. I am struck by the number of people who devoted themselves to Joe for so very long, and ultimately were cast aside without a word or any conscience on Joe's part.But then again, he was cool for a long time."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Joe Namath, just the name resonates with many images. Mark Kriegel, in his unauthorized biography \\"Namath\\" brings to life all of those images, and we get to know \\"up close and personal\\" the real man. \\"It brings me Goosebumps\\" is what Joe always said when he was asked about something wonderful or new in his life. This is a Goosebumps book.Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania is my birthplace. I never knew Joe Namath, but I knew and heard about the legend of the man. Joe Namath's grandfather, Andras Nemet immigrated to the United States from Hungary. He wanted to give his children the chance to grow up in freedom. He settled in Beaver Falls, Pa. and worked the steel mills as did most everyone. Joe grew up in the culture of old world values: hard work, family, education and alcohol. Joe also grew up with a talent for sports. He could throw the ball, catch the ball, hit the basket and run the field. He had brothers, who made life difficult, but they loved him and they made him practice. They understood that to make a life, to get away from the steel plants, Joe needed to make something of himself. Make something of himself, he did. He went to the University of Alabama, where the great coach, \\"Bear\\" Bryant helped mold Joe into a super football star. He and his team went to the Orange Bowl And, life was wonderful. Joe had what he wanted; wine, women and football. He didn't have enough credits to get that degree, but he got a contract with the Jets in New York and a bag load of money.The Jets brought him fame. Joe Namath lit up the streets and became known as \\"Broadway Joe'. Women, and many of them were his forte and the light of broadway kept him going. . Fame also brought pain- I lost count after five with the number of surgeries Joe Namath has had on his knees. His time with the Jets and then with other football teams was not an easy one. He had to prove himself. Part of this approval was to maintain his image of the sports elite, and he could do this best with the help of alcohol. He threw three touchdowns against the Boston Patriots while still drunk. This habit didn't cause many problems while he played football, but later on his life it brought him down.Joe Namath retired and at the age of 40 was ready to settle down. He met Deborah, a 21 year old actress and fell in love. They married and had two daughters, who became the light of his life. His image became immersed in their lives. Deborah, a strong woman lost herself in his image, and left him for another man. Joe moved on by himself, but with the love of his daughters. He embarrassed himself on public television and went into alcohol rehab. He lives in Florida with his daughters, painful knees and his memories.Mark Kriegel has written a book that gives us much insight into the man, Joe Namath, warts and all. No punches are pulled and all is told. This is a life, laid bare. Not enough description of the game of football is a critique, but this is about a man with many elements. All of the football games can be found elsewhere. Broadway Joe gives me Goosebumps. Highly recommended. prisrob"},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Joe Namath is clearly a Baby Boomer icon. As this book rightly shows he revolutionized the game of football not only by his fabulous arm but his persona. Now some may say he was the beginning of the \\"me\\" generation in team sports and all the bad that has come from that. But I think that's a tad unfair. Basically this is a story that needs to be told.But this book is not without flaws. I was glad to read in one place the complete Joe Namath story which contained many stories of which I was not familiar. But the mistake made by the author after spending so many hours of exhaustive research was to try and include it all. This book is clearly 50-100 pages too long. So while I enjoyed this, be prepared for a time commitment to read about a 60-70s icon. I enjoy learning but did I really want to learn everything about Joe that any source interviewed by the author found?"},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Or, in the case of Joe Nameth, be bigger that the times in which you live. The results of his guarantee of a Super Bowl win, like many of the stories concerning him, beat out more notable events such as Vietnam and the ravings of the counter-culture. Nameth was a product of his upbringing, and that was something, unlike blondes or the shortcomings of Earl Morrall, which he never talked about. As a man, his flaws were readily evident. He was a womanizer and a heavy drinker, yet he was also was one of the most profoundly talented athletes of his generation. Nameth was a star at both basketball and baseball along with football. In fact, he was even drafted by the Chicago Cubs. His toughness was apparent to the kids in his neighborhood and was an enduring feature of his presence. Nameth's was a life made for study and the reader won't be disappointed by this thrilling account.Mark Kriegel has written a fine biography which reads effortlessly as if it were a movie. Although, despite the clarity of the writing style, there are two attributes of the narration which cause me to lower it a star. Some of the text is tainted by Kriegel's own political/cultural opinions. This is not surprising as sports writers are often the most conformist in regards to trends. Political correctness is the rage today and Kriegel is a faithful imbiber of it. He appears to be obsessed with race which he refers to constantly even though Nameth was completely above racism. He also buys into the leftist canard about \\"social justice\\" and makes use of the term in its fashionable sense even though its appropriate definition should be, \\"when people keep what they earn.\\" This irritable element added a slightly acrid taste to an otherwise savory work."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Take a 1960s pop icon who refuses to cooperate with an author wanting to write a complete picture of his life; that is as long as a nice check isn't cut so he can share stories on the media creation, not the real person. Then have friends of the pop icon clam up when word gets out the the biography will be \\"unauthorized.\\"These are the hurdles author Mark Kriegel had in researching Namath: A Biography. I would hope that soon after the book was published that Super Joe read the book and then feel embarrassed about trying to derail the project.And in cases where roadblocks are set by the subject, an author can easily get the final word by lashing out. Kriegel does not fall for that trap and demonstrates impeccable investigation skills while obviously asking the right questions to those willing to be interviewed to get the most complete picture of Namath ever written.Ok, so Super Joe was a media-created radical like \\"The Rebel\\" - tennis great Andre Agassi - and showed the world a side of his personality that was controlled by his abuse of alcohol when he slobbered over ESPN's Suzy Kolber during a live sideline interview. But there was more to the picture than the incredible highs as a player and the extreme lows years after retiring from the game.To present Namath with his true personality does nothing to tarnish the image. But it certainly may mean Joe has had to revise stories he tells at memorabilia conventions.Kriegel ultimately adds to the myth of the gun-slinging quarterback. And that in itself speaks volumes....no matter how \\"unauthorized.\\""},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Namath was a fantastic quarterback and a major icon of the 1960s and 1970s. (I can recall when every kid on the playground wanted a Joe Namath jacket or lunchbox.) This book does a great job of recounting Namath's career and the major influence he had on professional football. No other player since Namath has made such a historical impact both on and off the field, and he brought some genuine style to the game. For at least one generation of Americans, he was once upon a time the game's greatest athelete - and the coolest dude alive. A well-written and inspiring biography that would probably translate nicely into a movie."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Overall, this biography of Joe Willie is an interesting, entertianing and fun read. However, Mark Kriegel's prose tends at times to be overly dramatic. At the same time, I enjoyed some of the overly dramatic language, as it made the book fun to read.As a Namath fan, this book provides an interesting insight in the development of the superstar athlete that today is all too cliche. Before Rodman, TO, Rose, ESPN, there was Joe in a Mink Coat with shaggy do for all the world to see, as he enjoyed being a celebrity super athlete is the greatest sports town in America. Unlike the Superstars of today, Joe seems just a bit more authentic based on the portrait painted in this book. The author also provides some insight in the troubled world of the private Namath from his broken family to his own deamons of alchohol and self doubt.In the end, this book further confirms to this 43 year old fan of Namath that he is like the rest of us and has to put his pants on each day, one leg at a time and take on the challenge known as life. Good luck Joe, your still my hero."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"This book is a biography of Joe Namath and starts out from his birth and follows the course of his life through high school, college, professional football, and thereafter. It gives an inside look at what type of person Joe Namath really is, and provides much insight into the personality of a very unique individual. The book gives many stories of life on the football field and off of it. I thought the stories of Namath's very fast paced life living in New York was the best part. I was a little surpirised that he was basically dumped by his wife and while he had many friends, he appears to have struggled with developing lasting and intimate friendships.Whether you are a football fan or not, this book is a great read, especially if you grew up in the 1960's and 1970's time era. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Author Mark Kreigel paints a thorough portrait of Joe Namath, one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, in this interesting and well-written biography.Namath, who signed for an unheard of $400,000 with the AFL New York Jets after playing for the University of Alabama, was both talented and flamboyant. He is credited with saving the New York Jets franchise, the AFL and eventually forcing the NFL and AFL to merge.Namath was the rare athlete who was equally talented and flamboyant. Known for favoring blondes, consuming lots of booze and partying nightly, Namath blazed many trails, on and off the field. His \\"Broadway Joe\\" image wasn't a lie; it was the \\"amplification of his virtues, faults and peacock personality,\\" according to author Kreigel. Namath was brash and refused to be regimented. He wasn't apologetic for his lifestyle, after all he was a bachelor.Alabama coach Bear Bryant called Namath, \\"the best athlete I ever saw.\\" Bryant, however, had to suspend Namath for the last three games of the regular season during his junior year for drinking. Namath didn't complain.Kreigel does an excellent job of chronicling Namath's boyhood in western Pennsylvania and explaining the events and interviewing the people who shaped his personality and approach to the game.The Jets always had two sets of rules--one for Joe and one for the rest of the team. Teammates, however, generally liked Namath and realized his value to the team and the league. The linemen protected him at all costs. Kreigel writes about how often lineman targeted Namath, hoping to hurt him and put him out of the game. Despite some brutal beatings, Namath never complained, and he never missed a game his first five-plus seasons with the Jets. He played in constant pain.Namath will always be remembered for leading the Jets to an upset of the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. Most sportswriters (49 of 55 picked the Colts) thought the game was going to be a folly. The Colts were favored by 18 points. Namath, however, refused to believe the Colts were better. The 23-year-old quarterback called most of his plays at the line of scrimmage and dissected the Colts and Matt Snell battered their defense all day. While, Namath didn't throw a touchdown, he was voted the Super Bowl MVP.Namath, known for his \\"gun-like arm, quick release and uncanny composure\\" was often underestimated for his intelligence on the field. He was a student of the game and a football genius.If Namath's knees had been as sound as his throwing arm, there's no telling what he might have accomplished. He had the first of four knee operations when he was 21, prior to his NFL rookie season. At 21, he was described as having knees of a 70-year-old.Namath played his final game for the Jets in 1977, and then finished his career with the Los Angeles Rams, mainly as a benchwarmer.Kreigel spends considerable time writing about Namath's post-football life, which included a failed stint on Monday Night Football, acting, a marriage and a divorce, and being a devoted father to his two daughters.If you're any kind of football fan, this excellent biography should be on your reading li"},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"This is a great sports book about a pioneer superstar of the old AFL.

There have been lots of good quarterbacksat Al,but only one Joe Namath. This book while not flattering by any stretch of theimagination is a good account of the high cost ofcelebrity status in this country. They are constantlyunder the microscope their every move recorded. I wish the author had devoted more to the relationshpof Joe and coach Bryant. He got Joe's attention, andbelieve me Joe even today holds coach Bryant in thehighest esteem. The book delves into Joe's womanizing, and drinking.I dont deny the incidents mentioned they probablyhappened as reported, but look at most of yoursuperstar athelets they arent exactly choir boys.Joe has paid a huge price for that behavior. Themain thing is he admits wrong, and is getting help. I dare say you will not find any self respectingAlabama fan that will change their opinion of Joebased on this book.

I grew up on him and completely adored him -- mostly because my parents and teachers thought he was a bad influence. The partying, the romances, the rebellions, the in-your-face talent ... I had no idea that he was always in so much pain (psychic as well as physical) and that he was always so remote from those around him. While this is most emphatically not a hatchet job, it is a warts-and-all portrait. Most of the negatives attributed to Joe Willie can be ascribed to his youth and immaturity (one of the most famous men in the country at 25) and his drinking (unfortunately his alcoholism seemed to be almost preordained, as for most of his life, booze was his painkiller of choice). The account of his life after football -- learning to live without fame and adoration, building a family and then losing it -- was fascinating to read. I wonder how Lance Armstrong will deal with the zero to 60 (or should I say 60 to zero?) loss of celebrity and adoration that will undoubtedly befall him now that he has retired. And, being a Chicagoland girl, I hope that someone someday writes this comprehensive a biography of our own Michael Jordan, one of the few people on the planet who can actually put himself in Namath's shoes."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Joe Namath was a childhood idol of mine. Kriegel captures very well what a great athlete he was and how he truly was the first of the new breed of made-for-TV sports stars. The book is very insightful about Joe's early years through the end of his professional playing days. I would have liked to have known a little more about his personal life since his football career ended, but maybe there just isn't that much to say. My two complaints are that the writing is sometimes overblown and in many places there is too much detail. We know he was a swinger and a drinker, how many times need we be reminded?"},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"This has to be ranked among the Top Ten sports biographies I've read, and I've been fortunate to read a lot of them. What makes this book good? It's comprehensive, neutral, a bit edgy, humorous, sad, sentimental, cynical.....on and on. This book has all the angles covered on the amazing life of Joe Namath.Having lived through all of \\"Broadway Joe's\\" career, I knew how flamboyant the man was and, yeah, I've seen all his ads, watched his games whenever they were on TV here, and thought I knew a decent amount about the Joe.....but, wow, this book blew me away. I never realized there were so many dramatic ups-and-downs in Namath's life, not just on the field but mainly off it, and after his career was over.I knew Namath played hurt his entire pro carer but never knew how much until I read this book by Mark Kriegel. I think that's the one thing that will stick in my mind: how Namath handled incredible amounts of pain. I hope it's an inspiration to me down the road, although I don't recommend the alcohol cure, but I understand it when you're in a lot of pain.Warts and all, Namath was/is one gutsy guy. I was stunned at the things I read in here that he endured on the gridiron. This is an absolutely fascinating portrait of an American sports icon of the \`60s and \`70s.If you read Kriegel's book on basketball legend Pete Maravich and liked it, you'll find this is even better."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"This is a very good read about a superb athelete who overcame serious injury (time and time again) to become a starring NFL quarterback who transcended the game to become ulitmately, a 60's icon.Namath could be compared with Mickey Mantle, another legend whose career was also shortened by alchohol and injuries. They both had New York City as their workplace (and the biggest media market) and they both were kings of it. At times they were the best, but not neccesary well liked.Although the book tries to touch on all the facets of his life including his rarely talked about childhood, the thing that will surprise readers the most would probably be that Joe Namath was not just a great football talent but he was a great athelete, period. The book makes note of his great running ability in high school and because of his achievements in high school baseball, the promise of a future in professional baseball loomed for Mr. Namath as well. But because he happened in the early 60's and well before ESPN tapes everything and everyone with a slice of talent, we can only be left with stories of how great Joe Namath really was before crippling knee injuries left him only as a great armed quarterback. Also, A point to note is that Joe Namath the student is revealed here. Many times Namath would take opposing game reels home to his appartment to study them and prepare himself better for the next game as he called all his own plays---something unheard in today's game. However the downside of Namath also comes into focus as well---the drinking, the greed, the inablity to become a team player, it's all here. The book loses points because Namath's voice is not here to help describe any of this or tell us what happened at any time. We are left with interviews and stories of what Namath and associates said to the media back when."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"This was a thoroughly researched and intriguing look into the life of a man who is an icon in the world of sports and marketing. There was nothing particularly radical or pioneering about Joe Namath. He was a very talented athlete, but also a flawed one. He made the leap from man to legend by guaranteeing victory in a Super Bowl, but this aparently was done as much to shut up an annoying heckler than due to supreme confidence on Namath's part. The Jets victory in Super Bowl III was mostly a result of their superior defense, some good breaks, and just enough big plays on offense to pull out a fairly dull game. But the prediction made by the man who played the most prominent position for his team established a legacy that would only become enhanced by time. As a testament to greatness during a period of turbulent change as the stuffiness of the 50's gave way to the revolution of the 60's and the \\"have your cake and eat it too\\" excess of the 70's, Joe Namath was a product of fortuitous circumstance. To his credit, like Frank Sinatra he did things his way and this ultimately turned out to be very lucrative for him. As a man, he comes off as an amiable drunk who is not particularly loyal to those who stood by him and those he fought alongside with. Mostly he is loyal to the protection of his legacy, particularly the revenue it generates, and to his children. He has made good money by living on his past but knows better than to live in it. Joe Namath's greatest accomplishments were backing up a prediction with the help of players he was isolated from who were alienated by the double standard put in place for him, and living a bachelor lifestyle that created an image he was able to capitalize on. By the end of the book he is a heartbroken (left by his wife) alcoholic loner rather than a carefree alcoholic surrounded by hangers on but not necessarily true friends. His life goes on, making his living autobiography a work in process. As for the bio adeptly written about him by Mark Kriegel, I found it be engaging and informative. Longtime football fans will especially enjoy it, particularly Jets fans looking to relive past glory."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Great book. I feel sad for a man who peaked at 25.J!E!T!S! Jets Jets Jets"},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"full life paean to Joe Namath. He was & maybe is by many accounts the most celebrated sports figure since Babe Ruth. Cool? Yes. Celebrated? Absolutely? Classy? No. In the rarefied air of winning QBs, with class, Starr, Staubach & Warner come immediately to mind, I don't think of Joe. Being drunk most of the time, even with a big foul mouth & $$$, still just makes you a drunk. A problem that Joe has to this day. He is a legend of great charisma. JFK, Elvis & Ali, three of his contemporaries had it. His celebrity comes from two related events. He defied the all powerful NFL by predicting, no guaranteeing that the New York Jets would defeat the heavily favored, over confident Baltimore Colts. Then he (with his team of course) went out & did it. A maneuver often copied, never duplicated. He was the winning quarterback of Super Bowl III. It cemented his image as counter culture sports icon. He parlayed that into a acting career, on tv, movies & stage. He was a pitchman for 100's of products & a middling good football commentator. Broadway Joe had a cool nightclub, & was the long-haired anti-establishment hero. He managed the cache' of President Nixon's enemies list. Given the fact that the president was a rabid football fan it seems unlikely that Nixon ever saw his name on the list. It is absurd. Namath was quite apolitical. There was to him only one cause, Joe Namath. He became what he had despised, a rich, white Republican. The bad knees caused unremitting, agonizing pain & in fairness his drinking may have helped him through many gruesome knee operations, the first even before his first pro game. On the other hand, there are millions of Americans with the same affliction who didn't get $400,000 to cushion the pain. Booze, women & pain killers washed down with more booze helped him get through it. He did make the Hall-of-Fame on the third try. The same week he got his award, televised by ABC, he premiered as a commentator on ABC football. Since Namath, you may argue that there have been more celebrated sports figures such as Michael Jordan & Tiger Wood. But off camera, they are rather dour, surly guys, without the million dollar smile of Joe. He had fallen in love several times but the timing was never right for marriage. He happened to be in love with Deborah & the timing was right. She cut off his balls & Broadway Joe was dead. She also cut him off from all his many friends & associates of the past & he let her. Soon she chafed under the weight of being Mrs. Joe Namath. She was an actress of no discernible talent & was variously know as Deborah, Debbie, Mae, Anna & finally legally settled on Tatania. She gave Joe two daughters & they have become the center of his life. When she discovered that Joe was a better actor than her, she left him. Later the girls went to live with her. Joe crawled deeper into the bottle. But he stayed sober enough to continue endorsing products & has a flourishing stage career.

In every sport there are a certain amount of sport stars that made their mark not only in the history of their particular sport but upon society in general. Joe Willie Nemet (his real name)made that and more.A larger than life character is brought to life in this wonderful read. From his roots in growinup up in a rough and tumble mill town of Beaver Falls to the bright lights of Broadway. Namath had the ability to overcome many demons with a unreal atheltic arm and mind. Today's professional athlete - football, baseball, basketball - should lay down and thank the Namath's of professional sport as the ones who made it possible for them to earn these out of sight salary figures kicked around today. Joe brought not only guts and grit to his game but a dertermination and intellegence to run an offense without all the help of modern coaching input seen in today's game. They just don't make em' like the Namaths', Title's, Unitas's, and Baugh's much anymore.Rank this one up there with it's realistic approach to how it was. A fun ride."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"This is neither a sugarcoat bio or a hatchet job. The author gives the reader a thourough look at Joe Namath both as a man and an athelete.For those of us who remember him as a gimpy kneed quarterback it came as quite the revelation to find out he was a slam dunking guard in basketball and a baseball prospect. Namath was a natural but he wasn't afraid of work either. In spite of his playboy image he spent a lot of nights at home studying game film. Not only of himself but of the next weeks opponent. Apart from the usual money motivation he also pursued endorsments because he thought he would have a short career due to his knees.His life most recently has not been the happiest, his wife left him for a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. Plus there was his humiliation on national TV when he offered to kiss a female reporter during a live interview.He is now sober and has gone from hawking popcorn makers and pantyhose to arthritis cream.This is an exellently researched book. I was never a huge Namath fan but once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Unlike other great biographies, Mark Kriegel's \\"Namath\\" takes a deeply subjective look at its central hero. Joe Willie Namath was one of those larger than life sports stars, whose fame outshone his on-field achievements, whose name lived on in inverse proportion to his off-field accomplishments. Namath came of athletic age in a particular moment in time, in the middle of a generational split where even a mere athlete could become a politically divisive figure.Namath did not submit to an interview for this book, and that is for the better. Kriegel did a remarkable job on his research, or perhaps his documentation is remarkable; I have not read many recent sports biographies with such extensive source notes. Kriegel even dates his interviews, so you can see how long he spent on the project. He interviews friends and enemies alike. While this book is certainly \\"warts and all\\", it is also hero worship. Kriegel watched all the game films and spoke to all the survivors. While Namath's less proud moments are on the page, this is not a sinister tell-all or a cynical debunking.The reconstruction of Namath's childhood in Beaver Falls, PA, would appear to be definitive. I can't speak to factual errors in the game summaries, but Kriegel has clearly watched the game broadcasts and NFL Films footage, so I would be surprised if there are any of the blatant errors that you would find in other football or baseball books. Namath's rise and his eventual Super Bowl III triumph takes up two-thirds of the text; the positive does outweight the negative.The sad end to Namath's career, including his one irrelevant season with the Rams, is described game by game. Perhaps this material could have been condensed. But, as the downside of Namath's career was perhaps a year longer than his rise, the book would be a cheat if it only spent a chapter or two on his post-1968 football play.More depressing, then, is the look at Namath's post-football media presence. The divisive figure with the long hair and the mink coat and the Fu Manchu became a dinner theater actor with a long string of second-tier endorsements for an electronics chain in the New York City suburbs. This is of course a gross oversimplification of things; Namath's investments, as described here, have been shrewd, and I can't think of other unauthorized celebrity bios that spend so much time on how much the hero loves his children. The book's true heartbreak comes when his girls follow their mother across the country in the wake of his divorce.Today's larger-than-life athletes seem to lack Namath's swagger: witness Barry Bonds' bizarre press conferences in the wake of BALCO, which eclipsed Namath's \\"I'm not selling, I quit\\" moment. Even Curt Schilling, whose journey with the 2004 Boston Red Sox echoes what Namath did for the AFL and the Jets, sold short the bloody sock in a mere ten days by doing telephone endorsements for George W. Bush. Namath would never have done that; in fact, to his credit, he made Richard Nixon's enemies list. On the other hand, Namath's retirement was absent the public humiliation that has recently attached to Mark McGwire and Rafael Palmeiro, or the belated admiration finally won by Ali. His worst moment came on the sidelines of an ESPN broadcast, embarrassing but hardly ruinous.Maybe the fact that he wound up with such an \\"ordinary\\" life makes \\"Namath\\"'s final 150 pages a bit hollow. He paid his bills, he loved his kids, he rejected the chance to host \\"Family Feud\\". However, \\"Namath\\" is still a well-researched monument to a great man from a pivotal moment in history. Without embarrassment, you could say the \\"N\\" in \\"NFL\\" now stands for \\"Namath\\"."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"I really enjoyed listening to this book on CD. I'm not sure I could have done as well with the written version. The author provides way more details than I normally like, but in the end I'm glad to have the information.

It's a good read."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"I enjoy biographies, not just sports but any lively individual. Joe Namath was a gifted athlete and an American phenomonon. The author has captured Mr. Namaths glory days and then some. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Chances are you would too."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"I grew up watching football with my brothers in the late 1970's, just as Namath's career was ending, so I never saw him play. Though very much aware of who he was, I did not know much about him beyond the historic Super Bowl victory.Well, having read this book, I now know more about him than I ever wanted to know, right down to his prolific vices. Though developing a strong distaste for Namath throughout the book, I have to admit that he becomes a sympathetic character in the last third or so, as the story of his divorce is told.It is certainly ironic that the user of so many women winds up being used himself in tragic circumstances. I believe that this was written about the time of the infamous Monday Night Football interview with Suzie Kolber, and the book leaves little doubt about how something like that could happen to Namath.I have two complaints with the book. First, it is overly macho. I know that this is the world of sports and testosterone, but the author's habit of using the F-word every couple of pages or so in unnecessary circumstances wears thin. Referring to women as 'broads' is also grating.Secondly, the author assumes that he is writing to an audience that watched Namath's career over the years and is more interested in who he slept with rather than what he did on the field. I would have preferred more sports action and game statistics. We aren't even told what his career stats are."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Before I read this book I liked Namath. I've seen him play at Alabama. After reading it I see him as selfish, money hungry drunk. The book is good, Namath is not.AW Moble, Alabama"},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Mark Kriegel's work now stands as the definitive biography of Joe Namath. It is a painful story as the very sad truth about Joe is exposed. This football great, and sporting icon for my generation, clearly popularized the professional game. However, the \\"off-the-field\\" side is beyond disturbing. What was billed as cool about \\"Broadway Joe\\" turns out be horrible psychological problems dulled only by \\"booze and broads.\\" Namath's desire to escape a reality everyone perceived as so desirable only confirms the extent of his mental instability.Kriegel's work illustrates this ever so clearly.The book is quite in depth from Namath's childhood up and to the point of his greatest triumph, Super Bowl III. I think the content after January 12, 1969 becomes sparse. The next thirty years of Namath's life are presented in far fewer, less involved, pages. I am not sure if the author simply tired of his subject or if there is literally nothing left of Namath to write about. Tiring of the alcoholic, dysfunctional, Namath would be understandable. The possibility that \\"Broadway Joe\\" simply became a bore after Super Bowl three very real too. So, either way one can not blame Kriegel.A good book overall but be prepared to learn just how Namath actually failed to live up to his potential because of the lifestyle led. The injuries were just a cop out."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"I grew up in California with Joe Namath as my idol. I read \\"I can't wait until tomorrow....\\" dozens of times. I still have his poster that hung on my bedroom wall from high school through college.This is not a book for fans (like me) of the Broadway Joe of our memories. It inconveniently/disappointingly describes the selfish, inconsiderate, flawed Namath which is natural for a human being but undesirable in idol worship. While I am glad I read the book, I will not read it again. The book is great if you want to know the real person of Joe Namath but not enjoyable for hardcore fans."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"I am a New York Jets fan, which means that my life on Sundays usually sucks. There have been a few exceptions, such as the Jets' charge to the AFC Championship game and the Monday Night Miracle against the Dolphins, both of which were led by the much-maligned Vinny Testaverde, but mostly my memory of Gang Green has been of Rich (f%!@$&*) Kotite and of Chad Pennington's rotator cuff. However, I have been constantly reminded of the days when the Jets whipped up on everyone and their quarterback was the mythical Broadway Joe Namath, when the overrated Balitmore Colts were embarassed by a guy who guaranteed he'd beat them. So when I saw \\"Namath\\" on the shelf, I had to buy it.I don't read many sports biographies, but in every regard \\"Namath\\" stands out as a compelling book that is shocking and emotionally jarring all at once. Mark Kriegel does much to wreck the mythical stature of Broadway Joe, but in doing so he presents a depiction of Ol' Joe Namath that most football fans have never considered. Above all, he impresses upon the reader that although Joe did not have jaw-dropping statistics as a quarterback, his impact on the NFL has been unparalleled - *nobody* influenced the entertainment machine that is the NFL more than Namath.I grew up in the era of Marino and Montana and all the god-like 80s quarterbacks (heck, I think to this day that even Bernie Kosar was a killer QB), so I heard little about Namath until I became a Jets fan. First I heard about the Guarantee (which, as Kriegel writes, didn't make many headlines at the time - Namath had said many things equally as shocking), then I heard about the Booze and Broads. Kriegel reminds us that Broadway Joe's nickname was no exaggeration - he was an integral part of the New York scene for a decade or so and was the biggest American-born celebrity in, well, the world. He famously stole Mick Jagger's girls and hung out with Mickey Mantle. Even John Wayne said Joe was his hero. I didn't realize the impact Joe (and his huge contract) had had on football.The early portions of the book concentrate on Joe's rough family life as a kid in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. He was a child of divorce and had older brothers that loved to beat him up, but Kriegel implies that this upbringing allowed him to survive atrocious hits in the NFL. His time at Alabama is also crucial to the story, especially Namath's father-son relationship with the tyrannical genius Bear Bryant. Of course the story of the Jets, the Super Bowl, and the New York parties are told, but many readers may be surprised by the path that the last fourth of the book follows as Joe goes from sports diety to has-been to father to divorcee to drunk. It's a rather depressing ending, but Joe Namath's story isn't over yet.\\"Namath\\" is exhaustively researched and reveals a Joe Namath that is much more than just the Guarantee, the girls, and the booze. Joe is shown to be a man to whom the most important things are always family, loyalty, liquor, - and nothing else. Joe's aloofness toward his former teammates and his unfortunate reliance on his money-mongering agent Jimmy Walsh are offset by the unparalleled beatings he took as the most hated quarterback in the NFL (which he always came back from) and the sad flight of his self-absorbed wife. Joe is, fortunately, shown to be a devoted father - yet he cannot shake his dependence on alcohol.Perhaps most significantly, this book describes the phenomenal athletic ability of Joe Namath that was ruined when his knees first began to betray him. One can only wonder what a healthy rookie Joe Namath would do today in the NFL. All that aside, \\"Namath\\" is a wonderful biography and deserves a look by any football fan (and especially Jets fans). You'll be awed by the heights to which Joe rose and to the depths to which he fell. But most of all, you'll be enthralled by the truth behind the legend of Broadway Joe."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"What I enjoyed the most about Namath by Mark Kriegel was the way the author wove not just the sports play by play aspects of the Namath story, just enough to give a real memory lane feel to the games, but also that sense of the 60s and 70s mood, the sports bars, the Fu Manchu, the swinging Upper Eastside, the competition with Frank Sinatra, the attempts to make it in show biz, and the strange marriage to a woman who seemed to change her first name with the seasons, and the whole alcoholic decline. There are so many stories to Namath and Kriegel moves them along in a fantastically readable way. I just could not put the book down. I ended up actually wishing each section had been much longer but at 441 pages with a significant footnote section obviously Kriegel could not have done more. This is a terrific book."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"This is a very interesting book and it takes you through Joe's entire life past his Suzy Kolber interview. Few sports biographies do that. Like Paul Hornung Joe serves as an alter ego for guys who wish they could have had Joe's life in their younger days. I wish that there would have been more pictures of Joe's serious girl friends (there were several), as only Susie Storm & his wife Deborah are pictured in the book. It would have been nice if they were some pictures of where Joe had lived.You always wonder how playboys will adapt to the married life, as they always get married. Paul & Joe lasted longer than most playboys. Joe said that he only wanted to get married once, and wanted to get his running around out of his system before he settled down. Although his drinking was a problem, he proved to be an otherwise excellent husband and outstanding father. His drinking wasn't what caused his divorce. Unfortunately in Deborah Joe married someone who wanted her own life and wanted to have some success in life. When you marry at 21, you haven't had that opportunity and that was a problem. Joe was so smitten with her that he couldn't see that in her personality before they were married. In retrospect it may have been better if Deborah never married or married much later in life after she had achieved some success in her chosen field. She also was in astrology. Deborah was probably too dominating and also wanted to remake or shape Joe's life and that's never good. That didn't seem to bother Joe and wasn't the cause of the divorce either, although it does give you some insight to Deborah's personality. Another interesting side note about Deborah's family is that her brother died or came up missing while he was suspected to be on a drug run.As the author pointed out Joe lived off his past but didn't want to live in his past. Joe was like Joe Dimaggio in that respect. Joe did very well financially in his post playing career."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Mark Kriegel has given the sports world a wonderful biography of a very interesting subject. He has also replayed an interesting time in our pop-culture history that made me a little nostolgic and at the same time, reminded me that the late sixties and early seventies were a little more complex than some of us care to remember.I mean to say that he shows Namath paying the price for every moment of hedonism and that Joe's easy swagger had a lot to do with intense over medication of all sorts. I always sensed that there was more to Joe than natural talent and charm and we see that in these pages. He was incredibly competitive and seen as a winner throughout his career. Yet the Jets he quarterbacked had only three winning seasons in twelve years.Some of the most telling passages come toward the end of the book, when Kriegel lists the number of times Joe was simply not there for his friends and when he, in effect, abandonned his Jet teamates. I truly felt compassion for a guy who wanted so badly to be a good family man and when Joe confesses to having embarrassed his daughters and the rest of his family, it seems heartfelt and you have to hurt for him a little.This is no fluff piece and Joe comes across at times as being the grown up example of every kid who has ever been told that being talented in sports is good enough and nothing else is required. Joe's high school coach takes a lot of credit for everything good that ever happened to him, but I wonder if he would be willing to accept a little responsibility for the pain that the guy has experienced in his life."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Former Daily News sports columnist Mark Kriegel has fashioned one of the better biographies on a sports legend in the past few years with Namath: A Biography. The book takes a look at the life of Broadway Joe from his days in the Lower End of Beaver Falls, PA to his greatest heights as the quarterback of the New York Jets. Mr. Kriegel describes how a generation of boys grew up idolizing Mr. Namath and he is clearly one of them. But Mr. Kriegel does a great job of walking that precarious line between being a fan and a reporter. The book provides you with all the highs and lows from Mr. Namath's life. From his dealings with purported mobsters to his problems with alcohol to his saving the AFL and forcing the AFL-NFL merger to his greatest triumph of winning Super Bowl III, Mr. Kriegel offers up it all up with sharp writing style. Like the hustler himself, he plays all the right angles to create a must read for fans of Joe Namath, the Jets and sports itself."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"\\"Namath\\" is an outstanding biography by Mark Kriegel, a former New York Daily News sportswriter. I read Mark Kriegel daily for many years beginning in the early 1990's; he later moved to a non-sports column. His background in sports and non-sports, along with the length afforded a book as opposed to a column, have enabled his true talents to shine in the most definitive biography to date of Joe Willie Namath and one of the best sports books in recent years.Kriegel starts off with Namath's Hungarian immigrant grandfather coming ashore at Ellis Island and his grandfather's and father's tough times working in the coal and steel industrial areas of Western Pennsylvania. Joe's close relationship to both his mother and father (they divorced when Joe was still young) is explored throughout the book. His many loves -- the girls he had crushes on to the many sports he excelled at -- also are examined. He was also a famous hustler whose \\"living on the edge\\" mentality --whether at a pool hall or going joyriding -- would explain his braggadocio attitude and The Guarantee during Super Bowl III.Namath's respect and admiration for Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant at Alabama had a profound effect on Joe. It was at Alabama that he first hurt the knee that would so negatively impact his playing career with the Jets. One has to see the pictures of Namath throwing airborne -- there are several in the book -- to remember that before he hurt his knee, he had exceptional mobility. He was not a scrambler in the mode of Joe Montana or Steve Young, but his ability to throw and jump gave him additional vision on the field. He missed that ability in the NFL.Joe Namath was taken by the Jets of the old American Football League (AFL). The New York Giants of the NFL secretly wanted him, but Wellington Mara (still running the Giants today) would not be seen bidding against the upstart league and his proxy, the St. Louis Cardinals, were unable to secure Namath. He went to the Jets, then controlled by Sonny Werblin, and signed an outrageous contract calling for $400,000. It saved the Jets. It saved the AFL. And it helped make the NFL the economic powerhouse it is today. The merger with the AFL and the jolt the Super Bowl was given in 1969 when the Jets upset the heavily favored Baltimore Colts are both directly attributable to Joe Namath.Joe Namath called his own plays at QB, as most players at that position did (Tom Landry of the Cowboys was one of the few coaches who did not allow his QB to call his own plays). Today, virtually all coaches or offensive coordinators call the plays for their team. One wonders how much better Namath might have been if he had a coach or coordinator to call the plays, toning down his talent, but allowing for a better overall game for the team. Namath had many 4 and 5 touchdown games -- but he also had games with 6 interceptions. Clearly, he tried to force passes and would have been better off taking what the defense allowed at certain timesThere are three recurrent themes throughout \\"Namath.\\" One, the drinking that Joe did, both before games as well as the off-season. Even for a professional athelete in severe pain (imagine having 5 inch needles inserted into your knees!), Namath's drinking was excessive. Second, knee problems plagued Namath almost from the time he joined the Jets and severely impacted his playing ability. His best season was 1967 when he passed for 4,007 years. It would be another decade before the NFL would change the pass-defense rules which ushered in the passing era of Dan Fouts and Air Coryell, Dan Marino, Joe Montana, etc.The third theme is the ever-present number of women that Joe Namath was seen with -- or NOT seen with, as he often preferred. Some of these women include rocker Suzie Storm, Randi Oakes (of TV's \\"CHiPs\\" fame), Raquel Welch, and Farrah Fawcett (a pair of famous TV commercials). But it would not be until Joe was past 40 that he would get married in the mid-1980's.The book is a retrospective for older football fans, particularly those familiar with New York sports in the 1960's and 1970's. Many references are made to Dave Anderson of The New York Times (Joe's favorite sportswriter), Paul \\"Dr. Z\\" Zimmerman (Joe's least favorite sportswriter) then of The New York Post but now with Sports Illustrated/CNNSI.com, the late Dick Young of The Daily News (an early supporter but one who got tired of Joe's constant demands for renegotiating his contract), and Sal Marchiano, a longtime local NY television sportscaster who once almost got busted with Joe for smoking a joint in an entranceway on a Manhattan street. Joe much preferred the TV guys who did less delving into his personal and lockeroom life. He disliked sportswriters in general, the beat reporters more so, and especially, those from the tabloids.Mark Kriegel has written an outstanding book. The early history of Namath's Hungarian forebears (real name: Nemet), his athletic and hustling prowess in the 1950's, his relationship with Bear Bryant, his role in saving the Jets and the AFL and helping to make the Super Bowl the definitive annual event in television -- Kriegel covers it all. His voluminous research, oral interviews with many of the characters, and detailed and objective analysis more than allow for a comprehensive look at Joe Namath, even without Joe's cooperation in writing the book. The book ends on a positive note for Namath fans, and Kriegel properly devotes more time and space to the early years than in the time since Namath's retirement.An outstanding book that will appeal to Jet fans, football fans, sports fans, and readers who want to know about it was like to be young, single, and rich in the 1960's and 1970's."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"If you are a Jets fan, you can probably skip this book . . . especially if you live in the New York area. Mr. Kriegel mostly recounts stories covered in detail in newspapers and Sports Illustrated . . . and what you've seen yourself on television. That's because the book is an unauthorized biography. An authorized biography would have cost a lot of money and would have been censored, so the author took the unauthorized route. That was probably the right choice.If you are a football fan who enjoyed following Joe Namath's career but didn't have access to the New York media, this book will be fun for you. It will fill in many gaps about his family and youth, his various mobster associations, and how all of those amazing contracts and spokesperson deals were developed. It's a fairly typical celebrity portrait.The best parts of the book come in where the author captures the psychology that Joe Namath often used on his football opponents and his adversaries in other parts of his life. You get a hefty dose of the hustling part of his ethic from this material. It's written in a gritty way that makes it appealing. You'll feel the emotions that he was trying to inspire as you read these stories -- particularly in regard to Super Bowl III.The book has two important flaws. First, Mr. Kriegel likes to simplify his story a little too much. The story line is that Joe was crushed by a dysfunctional family, and couldn't live in peace until he had a family of his own where he could dote on his daughters. Now he is saved. People are a little more complicated than that. Mr. Namath was a compulsive womanizer and alcoholic for decades, and still seems to have moments where he falls off the wagon (as occurred on national television recently as he asked his interviewer for a kiss). Second, the book doesn't have enough football in it . . . but has way too much about drinking, carousing and womanizing. The over emphasis on the bad habits gets to be more than a little repetitive. This book could have cut out 150 pages and been a much better read.The football analysis is almost nonexistent. For example, Broadway Joe threw a lot of interceptions. There's almost no discussion of the causes of that result. You just get a repetition of how much pain he was in, how bad his injuries were, and how he took responsibility with the media for the interceptions.As I read the book, I imagined how one could write a comparable biography about Madonna and how she has reinvented herself to continue to be a celebrity. That's the overall tone of the book.Mr. Kriegel is probably overly supportive of Joe Namath in the book. That's what makes this a fan's book. I think the book would have been better, however, if the focus had been less sympathetic and more like reporting and analysis.Stand for what's right!"},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"This book is a welcome gift, not only for those who love Nammath, but for those who have watched Kriegel's muscular talent mature. Neither a puff or a hatchet job, this nuanced portrait reveals a man and a time made for each other. The book is evocative without being sentimental, full of inside nuggets but never reeking of cheap gossip. A fun read and a rich one, too, as tightly wound as a spiral to Don Maynard."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Joe Namath-a man that conjures an image that few people in this world could ever match. Although this book tends to be a bit of a long read and gossipy at times, it provides some real insight into the life and legend of a hero to many and a bad influence to others. Mark Kriegel does a thorough job in helping us visualize the complexities of a man who always seems to live a life of extremes.Being in my early 40's and having grown up in Alabama as a Crimson Tide fan, I have always been enamored with the legend of Joe Namath playing for Coach Bryant. I also have some memories of him as a kid quarterbacking the Jets and seeing some of his commercials years ago as well as his appearances on television. I was probably more like one of the Ovaltine kids that Kriegel mentions.This book helped me to see the whole picture of the life of Joe Namath; a very private man living a very public life. I found myself sickened at times by his lifestyle and his mannerisms, yet the book has a way of making your dark side revel in it sometimes. All the while, I found myself uplifted by this never say quit attitude and his ability to fight through the pain. This book is well worth reading as it will stir the full range of your emotions.I doubt I will ever understand the complex life of Joe Namath, but I still love seeing him on the sidelines at Alabama games and hope that the rest of this life will be one of peace, reconciliation, and fulfillment."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"When it comes to the subject of Joe Namath, one event towers above all: Super Bowl 3 reigns supreme! That glorious afternoon of January 12, 1969 stood the sports world upside down. Those who can remember and still relish the New York Jets fabulous upset win over the arrogant Baltimore Colts will fully appreciate \\"Namath\\". Those who with no appreciation of that wonderful day probably will not. One might almost discourage those unfortunate folk from reading \\"N\\". Author Kriegel has touched all the bases in this well-researched biography. There are 50 pages of notes! \\"N\\" is no slap dash job, run off to beat a deadline. This is the complete Broadway Joe from childhood through middle age. Joe has done quite well for himself- and endured challenges on and off the field. Kriegel dutifully tracks ALL of it. Virtually every word rings true; the author obviously got to know his subject. Kriegel makes no effort to canonize Joe. The reader will get the full story, for better or worse, including generous doses of the selfish and often loutish behavior we Jet fans remember-and still tolerate. The story may be a tad too long but this is not a function of sloppy writing or the absence of a sharp-penciled editor. Kriegel set out to produce a thorough bio and has done so. Jets fans will scarcely object to the length! (On a personal note, this reviewer was in an Upper East Side bar, sometime after the 1967 season. My overcoat was draped over the next bar stool and who should sit on it but Joe! He apologized profusely (!) and moved away, marking him forever as a true gentleman.) The final word on \\"N\\" must be positive. Members of the aforementioned limited audience should subtract a star or two from the rating above. For we true believers (and long sufferers), let's hear it: J-E-T-S; JETS-JETS-JETS!!. 5 Green and White Stars!"},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Everybody knows Joe Namath (okay, most people have heard of him). Of our knowledge and recollections of Namath, most go back to about 40 years ago, when he was a young quarterback on fragile knees, had a shotgun arm, a team jelling around him that lead to The Guarantee, a Super Bowl win . . . and he was Joe Namath, The Swankiest Dude in NYC, ladies at his beck and call, llama rug, fur coat, bachelor lifestyle, etc. After that, it all kind of fades to memory: years of frustration, a year with the Rams and retirement. Once in a while you'd hear about him, starring in the theater of all places, but the memory goes back to when he was 26 and an American idol.Kriegel wrote a heck of a book, cutting through the cobwebs of our collective memories to give us a much different portrait of a man than the hype had provided to us: one who cared about family, one who respected the father figures of his life, one who cared deeply and was loyal to his friends - but one who reinvented himself at various times of his life and left his old friends behind. His reinvention of his life led to marriage and a family, where he wanted a stable, loving family around him - but didn't quite achieve that. Now, the reinvention goes on - new relationships, new family relations as his children got older, but the old life he lived has never quite been shaken off.This book was written without the direct help of Namath or through his lawyer, Jim Walsh. It appears that Namath's policy is that his personal life is nobody's business but his, and I respect that: he's had years in the spotlight and what he chooses to reveal to the world should be just that which he chooses. Walsh, a lawyer who has as his sole business that of Joe Namath, requested a huge sum of money for access to Namath and his story. That I have little respect for. I think that Kriegel's version without the help of Namath and Walsh give us a much better, more honest view of the man than if Namath had cooperated in the writing and editing. The result is a book that sheds a good deal of light on a much more complex man than we thought we knew."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Lots of pertinent insight on his early life and how it formed him as a young adult.I actually felt sorry for him, as the author revealed the hurts, fears, and sorrows that affected him in his life."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"If you love hard hitting intense football from days gone by you'll love this book.

Remember the Titans?Mark Kreigel has wrote an excellent sports biography and much much more.The book reads very well, almost like a fast paced exciting novel...so colorful. Nice B/W pictures too. I read the page burning, exciting, high descriptive 512 page book in 3 days, Couldn't put it down.WE are shown Joe Namath's ancestry, his family and young years,and his running around partying boyhood days. We see his athletic highs school days( he had big hands and superb athletic ability ( excellent in basketball and could dunk front and back, over .400 average in baseball and was offered several minor league contracts from MLB teams,and great in football. He was only a C student and scored low his on SATs. His mom wanted Joe to go to college and get a degree. His religious mom would love Joe to go to Notre Dame but Joe doesn't want to go there as its an all boys school...no girls to party and have fun with. Several major colleges were reluctant to give Joe a football scholarship but Alabama and couch Bear Bryant get him to go to their college. Bear Bryant is a disciplinarian and molds Joe and straightens him out. Joe needed a father figure. He sets records at Alabama and becomes a super star, but does not graduate to the chagrin of his mom. He gets the largest contract, over $400,000 plus and a Jets green Lincoln Continental. The largest contract at that time ever given to any beginning professional athlete.We all know the Jets won Superbowl 3, Namath had bad knees, played in extreme pain and the epic battle against the Colts with the mighty Johnny Unitas ( some say the greatest quarterback ever!). We see Joe's gambling, drinking, pot smoking and indirectly associating with known organized crime figures. Lots and lots of beautiful woman in his life. Joe says he loved them all. We see his many business deals, him being the pitch man for many products, his parts in some movies, The Joe Namath show, Monday Night Football and more. An incredible rich life.Finally Joe settles down with a girl named Debora and they have two beautiful daughters that Joe loves more than life itself. His whole world revolves around them. A super great Dad. Unfortunately Debora wants more than to be Mrs. Namath and wants to be an actress.She even legally changes her first name, takes lots of acting classes and eventually finds someone else... a boob Doctor. Joe and her divorce but we are shown him being crushed by Debora and his great love of his two girls. A friend wants to see Joe's trophy room in his home in Fl and Joe shows the girls school accomplishments on the refrigerator and says \\"that's my trophy room\\".Lots and lots more. I won't ruin any more of the many great stories for you or the great ending. A super excellent biography about Joe Namath and much more. A book even the non sports oriented will appreciate. 5 stars plus!"},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"The recent HBO special on Namath makes this book seem like old hat. Too bad the author didn't write it after the two young daughters had out of wedlock babies (one at 16) and an arrest. The HBO special glossed right over that. Namath loves his kids and grandkids, but the karmic overtone of a guy who went through women like chewing tobacco adds a touch of irony. Namath is still wildly popular amongst fans, sober and very rich. Just wish he'd quit dying his hair."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"It's good to see that someone has written a serious biography of Joe Namath. Namath was one of the most important players in pro football history, a man who more than any other player changed the image of the game. Instead of just coalminers' sons trying to hurt one another, football under Namath became a sport that was filled with glamor, strategy and sophistication without losing any of its old virtues of power and toughness. At the very least, Namath accelerated both the merger of the American Football League into the NFL and the debut of Monday Night Football. Pro football had been around for decades but Namath made it modern, fresh, and cool.Mark Kriegel's biography is unauthorized but not hostile. Namath didn't cooperate but he also didn't ask old friends and teammates to refuse to talk to Kriegel. The result is a book that has some gaps, but still includes an impressive amount of detail, especially about Namath's childhood and adolescence. Joe Namath is a rich subject for a biographer, with lots of good (he had great confidence and an easy charm, he stoically endured a great deal of pain, he was a loving father to his two daughters) and not-so-good (getting drunk was and perhaps still is a regular part of his life, he took full advantage of the perks and privileges available to star athletes). There's also a surprising take on Namath's famous guarantee of victory before Super Bowl III. It became famous, says Kriegel, only after the game; when it was made, most writers ignored it as a silly, alcohol-induced boast.There are some aspects of the book that will try a reader's patience. The book is strictly linear with no foreshadowing. Kriegel, for example, halts the story of Namath's life for a four page minibiography of Jimmy Walsh without first explaining Walsh's importance (Walsh would become Namath's longtime agent). At times, the narrative degenerates into a kind of street lingo, complete with profanity, that is designed, I guess, to convey the attitude of the participants but often leaves the reader confused about what was actually said or done.This book isn't perfect but it does advance the still fledgling field of the serious sports biography. Let's hope there's lots more to come."},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"My idol..meet him once (1972, yes bachelor's III)...I actually lived near Beaver Falls in the seventies and through my limited research, an excellant insight to my 'HERO'...have bought copies for friends"},{"Title":"Namath: A Biography","review":"Short and sweet this is one of the finest sports biographies of all time.

Compte-rendu des dommages et pertes en Pologne causes par la guerre durant les annees 1939-1945. (at head of title: Presidency of the Council of Ministers. War Indemnities Office.)","review":"Since this report was published before the Soviet puppet state had full control of postwar Poland, it is relatively free of obvious ideological contamination. For instance, it specifically mentions the Polish territories that had been, to use their words, ceded to the USSR. However, it makes no mention of either Soviet or Ukrainian crimes against Poles.There have at times, in recent years, been accusations against Polish policies, variously accusing them of ignoring Jewish deaths, hiding Jewish deaths among Polish ones, or implying that Polish Jews and Polish gentiles suffered equally. This work is yet another refutation of that canard. Jews are specifically identified as having even fewer rights under the Nazis than Poles (pp. 11-12), and subject to extermination. (p. 40). The 3.2 million murdered Polish Jews are explicitly identified as a separate component of the total of 6,028,000 murdered Polish citizens. (p. 32, 43). (Subsequent to this publication, lower figures have also been quoted in contrast to the 2.8 million Poles and 3.2 million Jews, with the latter reduced to perhaps 2.8 million.)The authors recognize the fact that, apart from the direct war-related losses and murders, Poles also perished as a result of passive genocidal policies enacted by the Germans. The rate of general mortality increased from 13 promil to 18 promil for adults and 26 promil for children. (p. 34). The daily food ration for Poles in German-occupied Poland was a meager 400-700 calories per day. (p. 28). Only the illegal black market averted mass starvation. 2.5 million Poles (largely of prime childbearing age) were deported to Germany for forced labor. (p. 28). Over 1,200,000 Poles were never born because of the deliberately oppressive living conditions. (p. 34, 44).The material and cultural losses of the Polish nation were staggering. (p. 40). Poland lost 43% of her cultural equipment, 60% of her livestock, 62% of her post and telecommunication, 70-80% of her scientific equipment (p. 19), and 84% of her railroads.All this was only the beginning. The authors recognize the fact that the destruction of the Polish people could not be accomplished in one fell swoop. It had to be done incrementally: \\"This fight was divided into several stages, namely: breaking of the national conscience [consciousness?], extermination of the intellectual class, economic destruction, and finally the biological extermination.\\" (p. 4)."},{"Title":"Art and the Reformation in Germany (Studies in the Reformation, V. 2)","review":"Christensen's portrait of the Reformation's effect on Christian Iconography is absolutely fascinating. He is incredibly thorough, examining in detail the pamphlets issued by figures like Zwingli and Karlstadt, and the profound effect that they had on the perception of art among the populace in Germany. He provides a great deal of statistics about the extent and form of damage by region, and examines in depth the reconstruction of a new and acceptable Protestant Iconography as it was concieved by Martin Luther and put in effect by Lucas Cranach the Elder. I wish it was still in print."},{"Title":"Metaphysical Bible Dictionary","review":"This book is an excellent resource if you want to know the deeper meaning of stories and characters in the Bible.

Thank you Steven Emmanuel."},{"Title":"The Children Star","review":"The Children Star is a far future tale about the ethical problems involved in extending human civilization. Like Slonczewski's earlier novels Still Forms on Foxfield, A Door into Ocean and Daughter of Elysium, she takes on such accepted science fictional tropes as terraforming and weather control, opting for adjusting human biology for the specific planet humans plan to settle. Unfortunately, this medical technology is still in its infancy and those best suited for the process are infants because their body chemistry adjusts most quickly to the conditioning. Thus, the arsenic-based planet Prokaryon has been settled by a small colony of refugee orphans established by an ancient Holy Order called the Spirit Callers. The orphans are cared for by Brother Rhodonite, once a professional soldier and two sentient robots, Reverend Mother Artemis, a nanoplastic nana with tentacles and multiple breasts and Brother Geode, a six limbed, multicolored tarantula-like farm and mining machine. The characterization is well developed and believable. The plot revolves around an attempt by a corporate conglomerate to uproot the colony and burn off the planet with a terraforming white hole. Fighting this project is a hardy band of environmentalists who want to protect the unique Prokaryon ecosystem which is based on prokaryotes, or Cheerio-shaped chromosomes. Will the researchers be able to prove their claims of planetary sentience before time runs out and the conglomerate is allowed to destroy the ecoysystem? The story is exciting and Slonczewski, a working microbiologist, has done an excellent job in developing the hard scientific basis for her worldbuilding. Highly recommended for science fiction readers and environmentalists."},{"Title":"The Children Star","review":"Wow! This book turned out to be quite a surprise. I generally don't like &quot;child-themed&quot; science fiction so had left this one on my reading stack for a while. When I finally did get into the first few chapters, I found out how my preconceptions from the book's title, and the blurb on the back cover were totally off base.The very depth of mathematics and biology that are explored, within the context of a most fascinating story, are both mind expanding and enlightening. There is quite a bit more here than first meets the eye. The plotting and storyline combined with the hard science make this a most memorable and worth while novel. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Children Star","review":"This is a landmark piece of science fiction. It introduces two new themes which are likely to sweep the world of science fiction, eventually becoming part of its stock in trade.The first of these is 'lifeshaping&quot; -- the author's felicitous alternative to terms like &quot;genetic engineering&quot; or &quot;biotech&quot;. The very term suggests the immense possibilities opening up as the result of current developments in microbiology. Joan Slonczewski, a professional microbiologist, very capably projects the good things we may be able to do, and makes them plausible. Her exploration of the moral and social implications is, in my estimation, much deeper than much of what commonly passes for &quot;bio-ethics&quot;.It's almost impossible to invent a theme that is entirely new to science fiction, and Slonczewski herself has written previously of &quot;lifeshaping&quot;. However, sometimes a theme that's been around explodes into prominence because of developments that catch the public fancy -- in this case, the cloning of &quot;Dolly&quot;. Cloning is (literally) a baby step towards lifeshaping, and may or may not be advisable in its own right, but it's important that the broader vision of lifeshaping figure into the discussion. &quot;The Children Star&quot; puts that vision forward eloquently.One subtheme which I find particularly important is that lifeshaping can serve as an alternative to &quot;terraforming&quot;. The latter is set up in this story as a straw man: inconceivably rough handling of a planet to make it human-habitable, in circumstances where the planet is more than a lifeless rock to start with. Personally, I anticipate that most planetary bodies will be found initially lifeless, and that we will have to use all the tricks at our command to establish a space frontier at all. Lifeshaping looks like a welcome addition to our toolbox, not a substitute for other aids.Sooner or later, too, it will occur to somebody that if we can &quot;lifeshape&quot; human beings to fit extraterrestrial environments, we may be able to lifeshape diverse forms of human beings to fit an evolving ecology here on Earth.I can't comment on the second landmark theme (yes, &quot;lifeshaping&quot; was just the first), because it's the surprise solution to a mystery which builds up throughout the story. Suffice it to say that it's more speculative than lifeshaping, but would justify the book all by itself."},{"Title":"The Children Star","review":"The Children Star is an example of thoughtful, hard SF at its very best. Full of wonderful scientific ideas, particularly in the areas of genetics and bacteriology; well-developed, engaging characters; interesting events; and a serious concern for such important issues as environmental and personal responsibility, it is one of my favorite SF novels of the last few years. Slonczewski writes science fiction for grown ups."},{"Title":"The Children Star","review":"The author is a biologist, but wasn't able to explain the science behind the story in a way that I could follow. That's not usually fatal, since I'm used to being left behind when the hard scientists start talking, but it certainly doesn't help. And I remain puzzled by her creatures who have only two genders although their DNA is a triple helix. She tried to explain the mating and reproduction, but it seemed forced and unneccessary. Her prose, at best is servicable. Again, it's not fatal (Asimov is no great sylist, either), but the combination of impenetrable science and clunky writing kept getting in the way of the story. The worst flaw is that her characters do not develop at all. Most of the time I found myself simply not caring what happened to them, particularly since they were pretty much either all good or all bad. And there was never any doubt in my mind that the goodies would prevail. The most interesting character--a six year old girl with a fantastic penchant for prime numbers--was introduced in the first sentence but soon was shuttled off to a mad scientist's lab and only appeared occasionally after that. One of the reasons I managed to get all the way to the end was that I kept hoping she'd reappear and take center stage. Not worth reading, IMHO."},{"Title":"The Children Star","review":"James blish wrote stories where people are altered to fit the environment way back in the 50's, but maybe there's more to &quot;lifeshaping&quot; than that.unusual mixture.

One occasionally stumbles upon a sentence so poorly constructed that it requires a struggle to understand the author's meaning, and one chapter is so disjointed and full of errors that it is very difficult to follow. This inattention to detail would make me leery of accepting the information on medieval customs as fact, and I would be careful to check any of the information from this novel against another source before using it (though some would say that's a good idea with any research).Aside from that caveat, I still highly recommend this book to beginning fantasy writers, as it may open your eyes to avenues of world and character creation you never considered before."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Writing Fantasy, Vol. 1: Alchemy with Words (The Compete Guide Series)","review":"Scanning this book, I found it to be a collection of useful and well-researched information.

Published by a small press and written by a collection of fantasy authors who haven't much collective experience or acclaim among them, the book has much to recommend it--and much not to.On the plus side, this is one of the most varied and complete offerings I've seen on the subject (and this is just volume one). Subjects include Roots of Fantasy, Characterization, Race Creation, World Building, Clich&eacute;s, Plot, Medieval Clothing and Food, Health and Medicine, Magic, Mythology, Religion, and Arms and Armor. Although a few chapters skim by with only basic info, many of them include insightful and detailed explanations of aspects of the genre that every author would be wise to heed. Of course, with only a chapter devoted to each subject, the book can't be considered definitive. But it offers an excellent jumping-off point into further research.Based on the quality of information alone, I consider the book worth reading. However, the production values offer some serious drawbacks. Aside from general poor editing and typesetting, the lack of professionalism displayed by the various authors--some to the point of out-and-out self-indulgence, in which the authors ramble about their own unpublished fantasy manuscripts or state their subjective pet peeves as if they were rules of the genre--is annoying at best and downright frustrating at worst.

One way is to start your own company and write books about writing. I can only think that is what must have happened here. Most of the articles are empty and self-indulgent. Certainly, there's little new here. If you already have any books on writing, you probably don't need these. All three volumes lack substance, and some of the writing is downright silly. For example, the bio for Tina Morgan in the back of Volume II starts with the line \\"At the age of four Tina Morgan's mother recorded her telling a story of an unfortunate princess.\\" So, if Tina was talking when her mother was four, just how old was Tina's mother when she had Tina?

Everything in the Bible has either happened, is happening now, or will happen, depending on the phrophesies.

Since each chapter is written by a different writer, the quality and helpfulness of the individual chapters are too varied for my taste. I do not have the time to go into an in-depth review right now, but I can point out the glaring omission that really miffed me: the \\"Arms and Armor\\" chapter had no description/explanation of bows and arrows or crossbows. Why? I really needed that, Tee! For this reason and the aforementioned general unevenness of the book, as well as one of the most pitiful indexes I've seen in a while, I give it a 3.

It brings together a variety of writers with different takes and views on how to write things. Most of the writers are entertaining and make you want to keep reading as you learn more about their ways of doing things.I only found fault with one chapter in the book, that by Milena Benini in which I felt she wrote in a condescending manner, contradicted other sources on her topic and included absolutely no source list for her chapter, basically informing the reader there was nothing in writing beyond her opinion. Fortunately her work was only used for one chapter of the book.The rest of the book is highly entertaining and each chapter included a source list giving you the option to both double check facts included and have more sources available to you if you wanted to go further in depth with researching a topic.What's great about the book is it's both a compendium on writing and a place to start for basic research on writing a fantasy novel set in medieval times. I especially liked the chapters on combat and the method of planning out fight scenes so that they're choreographed to seem more realistic.I learned many things about weapons, food, fighting styles, religions and various other topics in reading this book. It includes multiple methods on character creation and goes extremely in depth into world building.

The author employs such poetic elegance and vivid leading motifs that his narration can touch upon a huge range of topics without losing narrative unity and excitement. This causes STAR WAKA to resemble one of the most technically innovative as well as thematically relevant approaches of recent literature from Aotearoa New Zealand. It allows for deep insights into socio-cultural reality in the fashion of an appealing Odyssean voyage through Maori identity challenges within modern life. Thus, after his first promising steps and explorations into the realms of literature (Jazz Waiata 1990, Piki Ake! 1993 and Maui... 1996) Robert Sullivan finally interweaves in STAR WAKA supreme artistic creativity with bold intellectual range.

It was basically a follow up to &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot; which set the standard formula for apocolyptic prophecy. I re-read it today (2-16-98) and it is way off. Lindsey marches on about how communism is sweeping the planet, how the USA how become a 2nd rate power, and so on. All wrong. All corrected by historical events of the past 17 years. But as this was an amended version of TLGPE, he will surely come up with revisions on why the previous prophecies were errant. He will become extremely wealthy frightening people with history tied to Biblical prophecy. If he lives forever he can publish one of these every 5 or 10 years, and eventually, when it does happen, he can say &quot;There! I told ya so!&quot; The good parts: Lindsey lists what he considers to be prophetic/apocalyptic passages of the Bible. He does so without too much sermonizing, until the last few pages. The bad parts: All his completely WRONG forecasts of why we are in (as of 1981) the &quot;end times&quot;. Actually, I had some good laughs re-reading it and finding it so far off-base. There are several humorous errors, including listing of 7 empires predicted by Daniel, from his time through the end time. Lindsey omits major ones such as the Ottoman Empire, Nazi Germany, etc etc. But the magic number must be 7! Also, the European Economic Community was 10 (he says) when the book was published, which is prophesized, but is now up to 16 or 17. Comments, anyone? Not worth buying (sorry Amazon) but perhaps worth buying at a flea market for a dime as a reference book on how difficult it is to interpret Biblical prophecy."},{"Title":"The 1980's Countdown to Armageddon","review":"Thirty years later, so much of what Hal Lindsey predicted hasn't come close to coming true.What's equally sad is that he has divorced his first three wives, and is on \\"number four.\\" This from a man who studies and teaches the Bible?"},{"Title":"The 1980's Countdown to Armageddon","review":"I'll be sincere.I tried to read this trash-book, on an internet site.This book writen by a protestant draws a 1980s decade and a future absurd and senseless.Please, don't waste your time reading this garbage.I read just 10 pages of this garbage and was too much."},{"Title":"The 1980's Countdown to Armageddon","review":"A book on Biblical prophesies and how they will come true in the 1980\\"s.

Well-written formal poetry, complete with meter and rhyme, is like a swift breeze of invigorating air in a world that all too often scorns the riches of tradition.

I could name many favorites in this volume, but I will content myself with a few. \\"A Single Stone\\" inspires empathy for the often overlooked Martha; \\"Good Friday, 1987\\" shows how intellectual confusion can be happily consumed by childlike faith; and \\"The Signature\\" reminds us of the beautifully brutal way Christ sealed His contract with us. These are beautiful poems to read aloud, and this is the kind of collection that can bear repeated reading each year during Lent.

It insults our intelligence when businesses have there employees wear fake smiles and kiss the bottoms of overly rude and obnoxious customers. A rude customer at times deserves it in kind and there are not always two correct sides to every customer altercation.I'm sure the tactics put forward here work fine for companies but small business owners (2-4 employees) who treat their employees poorly and always take the side of the customer are sorely misguided. Small business owners would be better served to use the positive feedback of their dedicated employees over the cruel complaints of a disgruntled customer.Any small business owner using these strategies only cares about themselves and obviously is not concerned with keeping their employees happy. It's difficult to get good and loyal help if you don't stand by your staff at times."},{"Title":"A Complaint Is a Gift","review":"This book creates a new paradigm concerning customer dissatisfaction: The complaint is a major economic opportunity which can be systematically used to improve business processes, reduce errors, increase quality, strengthen bonds with customers, and create expanded growth and profitability. The reason: We normally see things from the company's view point, and miss many mistakes and opportunities by not empathizing enough with the customer's view point. A good related book is Moments of Truth (which I also reviewed), which looks at using this approach during the turnaround of SAS.The book is organized into three parts. The first one looks at the economic implications of complaints. Complaints are an opportunity to improve (the theory behind the gift paradigm), are cheap market research, present chances to win over customers, can establish a closer link to customers if we encourage them to complain, and are a great economic threat if we leave the enraged customer dissatisfied (as they tell everyone they can on television and the Internet). There are many useful examples and statistics to establish the size and importance of these economic connections.Part II explains how to implement a complaint-as-a-gift program in an individual circumstance of dealing with an unhappy customer. The key barrier here is that front-line employees feel the pain of the personal attacks they receive, and fight back. I thought the best part of the book was in the explanations about how the psychology of these interactions works in most cases, and can be improved. The book has many scripts and examples of how to make this less painful for the front-line people while delighting the customer.Part III looks at making a complaint-friendly enterprise, by implementing this concept as broadly and as deeply as possible in your organization. This requires making it easier to access your company (toll-free numbers and rapid replies to letters), having complaint-friendly policies, improving your culture to handle and enjoy complaints, extending the same approach to satisfying internal customers, and launching the changes in the right way as a permanent part of your way of doing business.Reading this book made me uncomfortable in one area: What can be done to treat employees well who bear the burden of the complaints? It seemed to me that the processes described here still leave the customer well ahead of the employee in emotional terms. I don't believe we can expect companies to perform well if customers get great treatment which includes being able to verbally, emotionally, and perhaps physically abuse employees. My feeling is that customers need to understand what the limits of reasonable behaviors are in complaining. Those who behave better should get great treatment, and those who behave poorly should get the benefit of the doubt. But no one should have to put up with what they would not tolerate from a guest in their own home.My proposal is that this system should be beefed up with marketing and promotional tools that encourage good behavior by the customers when they complain, and clear rules that customers and employees both understand about how much the employee is expected to take before protecting him- or herself.After you read and apply the ideas in this book (which are certainly sound as far as they go in defining many aspects of the opportunity), think about where else you would benefit from hearing more complaints. If your spouse and children don't complain, is it possible that you are avoiding hearing complaints at the cost of having a poorer relationship with them that cannot bear much honest communication? Who would you like to receive more complaints from? How can you encourage those complaints?"},{"Title":"A Complaint Is a Gift","review":"At a time where companies spend millions to attract new customers, this book offers low-cost methods for keeping the customers you already have.

They plug their company relentlessly.That is really the only good critique I have of the book. It would be a much stronger read if a times it didn't come across as self-serving.Now lowering my rating to 4 stars.Even so, treating complaints like free market research is something all companies should do.*********************I wrote this in 2000 -->I will agree that the scholarship in this book isn't the weightiest. It's a fairly light read. And it does act as a product plug for the authors shamelessly and repeatedly. And it does sort of repeat the same few points over and over again. However dismissing it as tripe misses the point.The book DOES NOT recommend kowtowing to or embracing rude customers. It DOES recommend listening to complaints and methodically engaging in a dialogue about them. This can allow you to diagnose systemic failures, discover new ways to offer value, and identify inefficent activities.It also doesn't recommend pitting employees against customers. What should a manager do if their employees complain to them? Should they follow the techniques recommended in this book and listen or turn a deaf ear?What's truly pathetic is that this understanding of the potential value of complaints should be standard policy in every company in the world. Industries spend vast sums every year on market research, trying to figure out what their customers want. Then they turn right around and often ignore customers who tell them.*********************I wrote this in 1998 -->This book is a fantastic discussion of an often ignored area of customer service: complaints. Standard policy at most businesses is to treat complaints as a necessary evil, and this book makes an overwhelming case that they should be viewed as a boon. Instead of dismissing them or tolerating them, they should be analzyed and recorded as vitally important feedback. After all, a complaint is simply a customer telling you how you can improve.In my own workplace I've used these concepts to great advantage. It has definitely improved my service. Recently I even got into an argument with my boss regarding one of our customers who constantly complains. He thinks she's a pest we should blow off, but over time I've grown to value her as an unfiltered source of honest feedback. When we screw up she tells us! Yowza! I even complimented her in a meeting one day because she complains so much. Many of our other customers smile and say nothing.When my boss heard that I had specifically asked for more complaints, he almost shot me. He thinks complaints should be \\"prevented\\" or \\"re-interpreted.\\" Anyway, after I started trying to embrace her complaints instead of dodging them, she not only became more understanding when we screwed up, but she became one of my biggest personal supporters!

It provides an excellent beginning in the studies of enthnomusicology, instrument development, musician history, as well as a multitude of other areas. While a bit disorganized and stream-of-consciousness-like at times, it still provides an insite into this complex man. While he is complex, he is so simple in his goals of peace, love and unity. I found out about many people I never knew existed and much more about people, like Woodie Guthrie, who shaped what we call 'folk' music today.I find I am highly indebted to Mr. Seeger for compiling and recording the many songs of so many cultures, and for putting names to them. 30 years later, much of this music has been lost, forgotten, or moved into the mainstream with little regard for it's origin.While originally a library book, I purchased this book to refer to and pass on to my children. They need to realize just how much history shapes music and music shapes history.

Enjoyable and a fast read in historical fiction. I especially admired the skillful way Irving Stone mixes fiction and fact to breath fresh life into long dead characters. The story is told through Rachel Jackson's narrative and we immediately find out about her first marriage to an abusive husband. The after effects of this tragic marriage have diastrous consequences for the future political career of Andrew Jackson. Love triumphs and the tender depictions of the couples enduring love and intimate moments make the book a very human and readable. I'm not a history buff, but the book is interesting and historically accurate. The descriptions of New Orleans were appreciated. Rachel proves to be a more than capable homesteader, managing a large property and horses in Jackson's absence. A good perspective showing Americian politics hasn't really changed much at all."},{"Title":"The president's lady: A novel about Rachel and Andrew Jackson","review":"To the Ends of the Earth: The Last Journey of Lewis & ClarkRachel Jackson was the kind of woman for whom the word \\"long-suffering\\" seems to have been invented. But as detailed in The President's Lady, the classic historical novel by Irving Stone, Rachel Jackson's true tragedy came when she met and married the love of her life, Andrew Jackson.Stone paints a complex and realistic portrait of the love and marriage of Rachel and Andrew Jackson, based on obviously deep historical research (though some of what is known of the Jacksons has changed since the book was first published in 1951). First thrown together in the aftermath of her painful split from her first husband, the young couple received word that Rachel's husband had divorced her. They became man and wife. Two years later, they learned that the divorce had never been finalized. They were forced to agree to finalize the divorce on the grounds of adultery (Rachel's cohabitation with Jackson), and were then married again in a second ceremony.This troubled time would haunt the Jacksons for the rest of their married life. Driven by a ravening ambition, Andrew would thrust himself into the spotlight, making powerful enemies through his brash behavior and mercurial personality. As Stone notes through Rachel's eyes, what happens to one spouse happens to the other. There were times when Rachel was Jackson's only, lonely supporter as he faced ruin. She helped him build again. And time and again, Andrew's enemies would attack him through Rachel, branding her an adulteress, a scarlet woman, even a prostitute.In The President's Lady, Stone does a masterful job with point-of-view. The entire book is told from Rachel's perspective, from her nightmarish divorce to her immersion in her farm and husband to her heartbreaking trials as his fame grew. The historical details are wonderful, and the powerful message about the corrosive power of gossip is as current as the latest Britney Spears debacle.But the true greatness of The President's Lady is the glimpse Stone gives us into the vulnerable soul of Rachel Jackson. From youth to the cusp of old age, we experience Rachel's love for Andrew and her forgiveness of his shortcomings, her grief and her joys, her outrage and her heartbreak. I'm not ashamed to say that I shed a few tears at Rachel's worn and ragged last journey, which came as her husband was at last elected President of the United States."},{"Title":"The president's lady: A novel about Rachel and Andrew Jackson","review":"I was assigned to read this book for a history assignment, but ended up not being able to put it down.

New York does not allow court action for a divorce, and in Virginia the legislature has to grant each divorce separately. To the best of my knowledge it is impossible for a woman to secure a divorce in this country. In fact, it is almost impossible for her to get into a law court at all, except as a spectator.\\" (John Overton, advisor to Pres. Jackson, page 61, speaking to Rachel Robards Jackson)In his own inimitable style (The Agony and the Ecstasy : A Biographical Novel of Michelangelo) and (Immortal Wife: The Biographical Novel of Jessie Benton Fremont), Irving Stone's story of Rachel and Andrew Jackson is enthralling. The prologue explains his plot is authentic and documents by years of intensive research.Irving Stone was born in San Francisco on July 14, 1903. He wrote several books in a genre that he coined the \\"biographical novel,\\" which recounted the lives of well-known historical figures. He died in 1989, but his works live on to be discovered by new readers and re-read again and again.The history of that 1790s period the author weaves into the story is fascinating: see page 34: \\"There was also the difficulty of knowing what kind of money was going to be legal tender. English sterling was still acceptable but it had almost disappeared from circulation; the Spanish gold florins which had found their way up the Natchez Trace from New Orleans were considered reliable, but the immediate need was for a standard form of money so that men could be paid for their services in hard cash instead of goods.\\"At 17, Rachel Donelson married Lewis Robards, of a prominent Mercer County, Kentucky, family. As shown in the book, Robards unreasoning jealousy and drinking made it impossible for Rachel to live with him; in 1790 they separated and she returned to her parents home. Later Rachel and her family members were told that Robards was filing a petition for divorce.She fell in love with a young lawyer, Andrew Jackson, and they married in 1791 in Louisiana - although no legal records have been found to prove it.Two years later, Andrew and Rachel learned to their dismay that Robards had not obtained a divorce, only permission to file for one. Next he brought suit on grounds of adultery, so he could re-marry. Rachel was unable to defend herself in the case.After the divorce was granted, the Jacksons quietly remarried in 1794. They had made an honest mistake, as friends well understood, but whispers of adultery and bigamy followed Rachel as Jackson's career advanced in both politics and war. For the rest of his life, Jackson was quick to take offense at and ready to avenge any criticism of Rachel.Stone ended the books with a 30 page bibliography that should be very helpful to anyone researching the Jacksons and the years after the revolution."},{"Title":"The president's lady: A novel about Rachel and Andrew Jackson","review":"The President's Lady was excellent! I was very pleased with the price and delivery of the book. The story is intriguing and helped me understand life on the frontier in the late 1700's and early 1800's. Rachel Jackson was hounded and persecuted for trying to have a decent life with a loving husband. Gossip is as old as human kind and I guess will remain a part of our makeup. We never learn----."},{"Title":"The president's lady: A novel about Rachel and Andrew Jackson","review":"I'm a sucker for Irving Stone's fictionalized historical biographies, a genre he pretty much invented and perfected from the 1930s-1980s. The best known areTHE AGONY AND THE ECSTASYabout Michelangelo andLust for Lifeabout Van Gogh. Stone tends to view his subjects through a heroic lens and recent research has corrected some original assumptions about them. But Stone's writing is so compassionate and engaging that faulting him for a bit of \\"poetic license\\" seems churlish.Stone really loves and idealizes women (and solid marriages). His admiration for women who led event-filled, challenging lives is conveyed in his books about Mary Todd Lincoln (Love Is Eternal), Jessie Benton Fremont (Immortal Wife), and Abigail and John Adams (Those Who Love). \\"The President's Lady\\" is a biography of Rachel Donelson Jackson, long-time wife of the hot-tempered Andrew Jackson, told through her point of view. It's good at conveying life on the Tennessee frontier, with isolated settlements subject to Indian attacks and pioneers alternately supporting each other and contending bitterly for land and position. It traces the scrappy Andrew's rise as a lawyer, military leader and presidential candidate and his tender relationship with the devoted Rachel.The book is good at depicting the ups and downs of their marriage and Andrew's career. It glosses over their slaveholding, however, making them seem like enlightened employers rather than slave drivers. \\"The President's Lady\\" was published in 1951 when Andrew Jackson was viewed as the tough, admirable, Indian-fighting \\"Old Hickory.\\" Recent scholarship, informed by Native and African American perceptions, has transformed him into \\"Bloody, Bloody Andrew Jackson.\\" This book can still be appreciated within the context of when it was written, and its depiction of Rachel's perspective and tragedy is heartfelt. I strongly encourage readers to explore recent books for a more complete understanding of Andrew Jackson's legacy."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a fellow cancer survivor, I really enjoyed Lance's book.

Parts of this journey are moving yet others in a way funny. The way in which Lance never gave up is somethinng the rest of us could all learn from and the way he fought back to the top an achievement worthy of any prize. But Lance already had his prize his life, his wife and son Luke.

While my sister did not survive the disease she left a gift for each of us who went through it beside her. Lance has given his readers the same gift. It is not something you can name but when you read the book you will recognize it. This is a must read for anyone who may ever encounter this horrifying disease in anyone they know.

To see a young man, an arrogant young man learn that he isn't indestructible is a learning experience not only for Lance but for the reader, because there are a lot of people out there who think that they are going to live forever.This book allows the reader to reflect on his/her life.

If you want to know what it was like to grow up and live as Lance Armstrong, the World Champion, Tour de France Winner, and Cancer Survivor, this is the book for you. You feel as though Lance is at the supper table telling you the story of his life over a home cooked meal his Mom made up. If you don't get goose-bumps, check your pulse."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The Lance Armstrong story is pretty well known by now. If you want to know the details of exactly what happened, and how he survived, then read this book. As everyone has mentioned it is not very well written, but that makes for a quick read. Lance's return from cancer is inspirational, and his cycling achievements since then remarkable. Thus, I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about Lance Armstrong.Lastly, I will mention that one reason I read the book was to see what kind of perspective on life Lance has after coming so close to death. It is nice to see that someone is talking about the life and death issues that we somehow neglect in our modern world, but I must admit that I was disappointed by his ultimate answers and conclusions.As a Christian, I cannot fathom keeping God from my life, especially when I need Him the most. Lance's belief that it was the miracle of medicine and his own willingness to fight that brought him back from cancer seems somewhat shallow. I hope and pray that he continues to search for the answers to life's great mysteries."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Say what you want about Lance Armstrong but if you read this book it's hard to consider him anything but an inspiration.Last summer I was in Austin, Texas during the end of the Tour de France attending the Texas Age Group Swimming Championships my younger brother was competing in. That city loves Lance and there wasn't a person in the streets who wasn't eager to talk about the Tour; yellow banners supporting him were more common than Texas flags, and anyone who knows Texas knows that that's saying a lot! Following that experience I knew I had to read this book and I wasn't disappointed in the least.Having read the book, I can't regard Lance Armstrong as anything less than a miracle. He didn't survive cancer - he conquered it. He proved that a cancer diagnosis doesn't have to mean an end to anything unless you allow it to. This book is a very blunt and unapologetic account of his life before, during, and after his diagnosis and treatment. He's not the nicest guy ever, he's not the humblest guy ever, he's just a guy (who may or may not be the greatest cyclist in the world, it's not my sport, someone else will debate that).If Lance Armstrong had never competed in another race again, his survival would still have been incredible. But he did compete, and he's sure to be a legend."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Pre-cancer, I didn't care much for Lance Armstrong. Although an excellent cyclist, he had an ego and arrogance that was far bigger than his tallent.Post-cancer, I saw a dramatic change in his personality (not to mention ability as a cyclist).This book gives a very good insight into what makes him tick. For instance, it was a little easier to understand his pre-cancer ego.The writing in this book is simple, as if he dictated it into a tape recorder. This is not distracting to the story, but is not as rewarding as other biographies I have read.Overall, this is a good read. It shows how one person with determination can overcome anything."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought and read this book because it was on my son's summer reading list. From page one I felt like Lance Armstrong was talking to me. Through his simplistic, descriptive style, I became a part of his life. I became entranced; I couldn't put it down. It made me laugh and it made me cry. I was on edge as if I were on the sidelines. It taught me about cycling, about cancer, about the life of a survivor. I had never thought about any of these things, and I became educated without trying. It's a fascinating book. If you admire people who are willing to work hard at what they do, you will love it. If you know someone who has had cancer and/or is a cancer survivor, you will learn more about that person, and you will love it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Ali. Jordan. Armstrong. There are a few names in athletics that define a sport, and, in a bigger sense, define all sports. Lance Armstrong, in what is a relatively small sport in America, has succeeded to be able to able his place among the greatest ever.Had Armstrong not had cancer, it would not have made him a lesser athlete. He might have more victories behind him. But with his struggle with cancer, he has been vaulted beyond being a great biker, winner of several Tour de France yellow jerseys. He has become a great man.As a biker, I know any Tour de France victory is extraordinary. These guys are as tough as any rugby player. To win it multiple times seem impossible, but Armstrong has the bragging rights. However, this book is not filled with self-congratulating phrases or business book mantras. It is a challenge to reach the top of your game.Furthermore, he has been unafraid to exercise his free speech. He has opinions, and does not cater to the media. Yet, unlike too many athletes, he has something to say. Armstrong has not let his victories be stained by drugs or crime. He is that quintessential All American Good Guy.If kids watch Armstrong, they can want to be like him. Parents will not be ashamed of him. High school kids can read this book (even nonbikers) and feel a sense of drive to press onward, to get the job done, to not lose hope no matter how dire things seem. Armstrong pressed on, and now, as I write, he is on his way to winning another yellow jersey.I fully recommend \\"It&#65533;s Not About the Bike\\" by Lance Armstrong.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When Lance Armstrong dies a pathologist will look inside his body...this book allows us to look inside his soul."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is one of the most inspirational books I have ever read. Even though I don't know a thing about Lance Armstrong nor cycling, it is certainly easy to get &quot;into&quot; the book. Lance Armstrong traced his childhood, how he became an athlete, how he was exposed to cycling and how he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. It was very amazing to me when he said at the beginning of the book that cancer was the best thing that ever happened to him. I couldn't believe that but as I continue reading his book, it seem unbelievably true.It was also interesting to read how cancer changed his perspective on life, his priorities and just getting a second chance to live again. His endurance, persistance to live and win the Tour De France was inspirational. I think what impresses me was no so much that he won the title but the way he fought to win it.I think Armstrong also accomplished an unintentional aim - that is to tell his readers that cycling is not as easy as it look. It takes a lot of patience, endurance and strategies to beat your competitors.In addition to that, it was very touching to see Armstrong's friends and family members stood by him and how their moral support helped him through the most difficult time of his life. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about survivorship."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Being an amateur cyclist myself, there was much I enjoyed about this book. The inside information into the cycling world was very interesting. Of course, the inspirational account of Lance's comeback was quite compelling. What I found somewhat disturbing about the book was Lance's liberal use of profanity. I didn't see any need for this to be included, at least not to the extent that is present. No one seemed excempt from this man's foul mouth. Whether it be nurses, friends or competitors, all were subject to it. Lance could have given us the accounts of his life with the same intensity without having to resort to including this. But, as I said, apart from this, it was an excellent read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Did you ever stay up late at night - just to finish a great book. ? Well ; that is what I did with Lance Armstrongs book. Truly a good book - well written and inspiring. Some biographies are not that great, as they describe people just leading their &quot;famous&quot; life, or just &quot;doing their job&quot;. But this book is different ; it is the hardship, real life experience,and the extra efforts by Lance that make his book special. You can relate to this guy and his experiences. When I was reading this book, the local Texas paper announced that the little girl (cancer patient and Lance friend) mentioned in the book had lost the battle with cancer. I did put the news article inside the book, to remind myself what really matters in life. Since the book was written Lance also won the 2000 Tour de France - so Lance we need an another book !!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The book gives an interesting view into the life of a professional roadracer and into Lance's own battle with cancer. His determination and will are most admirable. He gives hope to others, make that great hope to others and often hope is the only thing a cancer patient has. There were a couple of things about the book that were detractors. One was Lance's own self absorbtion which did not seem to change from his pre-cancer days and the other was the all to frequent use of the &quot;f&quot; word. I find it amusing that Lance found the porno magazines at the sperm bank offensive, but doesn't mind using crude sexual language in his own book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A page-turner like no other, once I started it, I couldn't stop. Without a doubt, Lance is one of kind athlete, but that's not the point. The early achievements, the cancer battle, the return to the sport - it's an amazing story of the resilience of the human spirit, both on the account of people around him, and Lance himself. It's a gem of a book and an inspirational read, it reminded me of what we are all capable off."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I picked this book with trepidity. Having read scores of biographies from succesful sportspersons, I did not expect this one to be any different. They struggle, they compete, they succeed. I started reading this purely based my wife's strongly recommended this.And it just did move me completely!Once I started reading, there was no looking back. This is gripping cover-covcer. I guess the cycle races are such. We get so involved in the sport. Whern Lance talks about Cancer, it is not in absurd medical terms or over-simplification. He did carry me long - thtough his journry. I could vicariusly experience being with him in the ward in Idianopolis or at the Finish line of Tour De France.A narrative style that takes the audience at a leisurely pace, keeping the reder hooked and attached to the strory.Truly inspirational. A day after I finished the book, today, I am shaving my head for a cause - cancer patients!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I had a meeting with VP in the company and as I got in his office you can sense he was a Lance fans. I'm not! Maybe for his way to act that he so well describe in his book! As an ex-athlete my self I could not hide my opinion about Lance. It was a nice and healthy conversation. Few weeks later I had another meeting with the same VP and as I walk in to his office he gave me this book as a present, knowing I'm an avid reader.I read it during the long flight back home! Great inspiring book! Never did read a sportsman biography but this one is worth each single word.You learn something new every day! I guess I learn something more about a great individual and athlete!PS - I have a colleague that is fighting a similar battle and I gave the book to him because sometime other peoples words are better then your."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A story of courage, transformation, inspiration, love, failure, success, it has absolutely every element of the most thrilling book you have ever read. Get this book if you want to laugh, cry, scream, shout and jump for joy. Lance's triumph over his bought with cancer will leave you feeling grateful, in awe, and thoroughly filled with life-affirming happiness."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Both my wife and I are currently cancer patients. The book gave us the courage to believe that we can beat cancer. Lance's book is a must read for anyone who has cancer or if you have anyone in your family going through cancer treatements. It is a great mix of athletics and the will to survive and what it takes to accomplish both. Get it and read it!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Quite good. The compelling part of the book is to hear Lance tell how he overcame advanced-stage prostate cancer, with treatments that fully debilitated him. Only then did he come back to win the Tour de France for the first time! (And the only time in this book.) He is frank about the rougher sides of his personality, but does go beyond his illness to learn how to be a better person. You are cheering for him all the way. Although written with a ghost writer, it is his voice that comes through loudly and clearly. The book ends with him quite in love with his wife and first child, projecting a family life into the future. Sadly, as we know, it was not to be, nor did he stick it out with Sheryl Crow who had yet to appear in his story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"One of my \\"wow\\" moments while reading this beautiful book was when he described his thoughts, once he was diagnosed with cancer, \\"Basically, I can endure more physical stress than most people can, and I don't get as tired while I'm doing it. So I figure maybe that helped me live. I was lucky -- I was born with an above-average capacity for breathing. But even so, I was in a desperate, sick fog much of the time.My illness was humbling and starkly revealing, and it forced me to survey my life with an unforgiving eye. There are some shameful episodes in it: instances of meanness, unfinished tasks, weaknesses, and regrets. I had to ask myself, 'If I live, who is it that I intend to be?' I found that I had a lot of growing to do as a man.\\"And, yet, as I read this book, I kept saying to myself, \\"Man. He would be a demanding kind of guy in a good and a bad way - depending upon how you feel about yourself, while you are around him.\\"In my humble opinion, Lance Armstrong is a type A man who in this book really reveal what I can't imagine him revealing in person with others, with the exception of his mother.There are many life lessons in \\"It's Not About the Bike.\\"And, on a lighter side, every time I drive my car, and the traffic light has just turned yellow, I laugh at how in \\"It's Not About the Bike,\\" Lance Armstrong describes how this is his chance to speed up, not slow down and prepare to stop.This biography has a conversational and strongly visual tone. I also learned many things about bicycling being a team sport, rather than an individualized activity as I had always thought of it as being."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book initally because of Lance's accomplishments. However, I soon realized it was as the title states more \\"than about the bike\\". It is a book about hope, preserverence, belief in one's self and survival when all odds are stacked against you. My husband was going through Chemo for Leukemia when he read the book for the second time, it helped him believe that he was going to make it. If Lance could do it so could he. This book touches you where you least expect it, in your soul. It will give you hope and strength. Now every time we have a friend that has been diagnosed with Cancer we send them this book as well as the Livestrong Survivorship Binder from the Livestrong Foundation. This book is not just about cancer, bike racing or survival, it is about hope, whether it's surviving cancer or winning the Tour de France. One feels they can accomplish anything after completion of the book. I cannot recommend it highly enough and feel everyone should read it from 13 to 90."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The definition of a page turner: I read this book in one day! I've also had many of my sophomore HS students choose it as an indpendent read and they've all loved it. A must read!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is an excellent and easy to read book about Lance Armstrongs life and struggle with cancer written in plan, easy to understand English. It tells how he battled back from a 3% chance of living to win the Tour de France bicycle race. I was unable to put this book down after starting to read it because its written in a very positive and uplifting way. I feel as though I almost know the guy now."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have always been a fan of professional cycling overall, and Lance Armstrong personally. When I was called upon to choose a book to read for independant reading in high school, I chose this one. Not only was I satisified with my purchase, but I couldn't put it down. I finished it at two thirty that night.Lance Armstrong not only had a story to tell, but he told it in a fantastic way. He didn't hold back on any of the details, and this sets him aside from all other sports autobiographies. At 2:30 am, I wanted to go biking or just give my parents a hug. That was of course not possible at that moment, but all the same, this book is a great read and I highly recommend it to all."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is an incredible story about an incredible person and his fight to beat overwhelming obstacles. It's much, much more than a book about a bicyclist and Lance's story will inspire all who read it!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I had heard good things about this book and picked it up to keep me company on an airplane. I knew nothing about cycling, and a little bit about Lance Armstrong, cancer survivor, TdF winner, etc. I didn't expect much. WOW. This book blew away my expectations. His story is incredible and an inspiration. Last year, we lost my fiancee's daughter to cancer and are familiar with the roller coaster cancer will put you on. The thing that kept this book so entertaining was the tone of it. This book could have been a conversation with Lance about what he'd been up to the past few years. It's a very light read given the heaviness of the subjects (cancer, chemo, childbirth). I have given this book (in audio) as a gift to my dad. That's how much I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"There are a lot of reviews of this book already on amazon.com, so I'll keep it brief and just say that this is one of the best books I've read in a long time. If you have any interest in reading about cycling, cancer or the story of an exceptional person's life, then you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This true story of a young champion cyclist's struggle in the sport of professional cycling and his struggle with cancer which had spread to his brain and lungs from his testes is totally gripping on every level.It is eye-watering in its honesty and frankness.It is a tribute to the single mother amongst other tributes.Friendship,the medical fraternity and their dedication, the psychology of serious illness as well as the physical effects are all vividly described . The shocking truth that even if you have a positive nature,you don't necessarily beat cancer makes one realise life is truly a lottery.How he rode that bike in between bouts of chemo I will never know.The best bio I have read,ever.(I read it in one day.)"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"So,admit it-how many of you were weeping and laughing and cheering when Lance crushed the field and powered to the top of Hautecaum (sp?) in stage 10 this year?!!! I read the book after this year's Tour and found it riveting. Lance's self-centeredness, arrogance, and crudity are front and center with his courage, determination and heroism. It's very honest and direct, and I wanted to read more. Fortunately the story goes on."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A very good book if you can get by the profanity. It never ceases to amaze me how a perfectly good book can be degraded by a limited vocabulary. I would have rated this book a 5 star if it were not for the language used. Overall an excellent book. Easy to read and very inspirational story of a true hero who beat the odds."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"No matter what you struggle with in your life, Lance Armstrong's story will inspire you to persevere. As an amateur cyclist in Dallas, and someone who made it big at an early age in a business endeavor, I can certainly relate to his early life. But what strikes me as most incredible is his determination (with the help and motivation from friends and family) to get back on the bike and &quot;move&quot;, as he puts it - continue on, and win the Tour, in the face of innumerable odds, after beating Cancer. Whether he wants to be or not, Lance Armstrong is a true American hero.Thanks for the story and powerful inspiration, Lance. Thanks to your words, I'm cycling again daily and will race again soon. Your life will inspire others in unimaginable ways."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"You know, I've always cheered for Armstrong in the races. I've always thought that he was a decent guy. Until I read this book. Lance Armstrong is a very, very cocky guy that seems to have some kind of anger deep inside that he keeps pinned up until he explodes. His comeback was amazing, his careeer is amazing, his cycling is amazing, but I don't care if he has won the Tour 5 times, he is still to arrogant for my liking."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Sorry but I agree with Badger Bob. This is a \\"I love Lance\\" book written by Lance. And a recurring problem in autobios by unexperienced writers. I have read many auto bios and I was half expecting this to be one of those greats. The Book should NOT have been titled as such. Mr. Armstrong, it took 159 pages of patience for you to crack a smile of humility, you had a chance to make this an inspirational book like \\"Born to Run\\" (some great moments). I thought It's Not About The Bike meant you ride with spirit with a certain grace. I half expected to admire cycling more as I'm an avid road cyclist. But it became repetitive. This may have to do with the fact you probably haven't read much great literature, Athlete's are busy, and rarely focus on matters of self discovery and spirituality. I hope in many years when the fame fades away and you discover yourself, THE great Lance Armstrong, who is not a cyclist but like you said, Cancer survivor, human being, and father figure, you can share words of wisdom when u finally get back on that bike at 50 yrs old and although it hurts you ride everyday like a child on his first trainer with a free spirit."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An absolute must read for anyone who needs a little inspiration.

This book will help you to ground yourself and recenter your life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"My wife and children bought me this book for Fathersday and I finished the book last night. It was one of the few books I have encountered in a great while that grabbed me in such a way that I literally could not put it down.The book is written so that anyone can relate and understand what makes such an incredible man tick. Adversity combined with the will and desire to succeed and never quit, regardless of the situation is a lesson often lost in today's society.Lance gives a brutally honest account of his life and conveyed it in a way that I found to be inspiring. Every time I think I personally have it bad or am being challenged in a way that I can't handle, I will remember this book and what it teaches us about life and the true meaning of sacrifice.This book should be required reading among our youth. Lance Armstrong is a true hero and someone to be looked up to and learned from."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Whether you like bicycling or not this is a book to be read and reread.

This book is very encouraging and I think especially cancer patients will find in it tremendous comfort and even hope. Healthy folks will love to read this book too, and they'll come away thanking God for their health. Another book that I found extremely encouraging and uplifting is Dietmar Scherf's &quot;I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression.&quot;"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"great item, such a good story of his life and how he came from nothing and gave his all and put in the time and effort and hard work to win as a teen with a single mom. very motivational for teen kids to read to get off the couch and get moving toward a goal."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I red this book now, because I am sure that the new one will come out very soon and wanted to see how was he thinking and presenting himself at the beginning of his career.Love the book.

I had surgery the next day, and having no idea what to expect, bought this book. Before the Oprah confessional, I read this book hoping to gain some insight.By the second chapter, I determined it isn't about the bike. Rather, this book is about a super ego. This narcissistic autobiography must have made Lance feel better, but it does little more than stoke his own ego.He isn't a good guy. It comes through in his book- we did not need Oprah to bring this into the light of day. He does that on his own.The book title must be truncated: \\"It isn't about the the bike, it's about me!\\""},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Even though he lies through the entie book about his drug use the story of what he went through with cancer and how he trained is amazing. I bike but even a none biker would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought this book back in December, and even then I was ambivalent. It seemed to me that even if he did use drugs, the fact that he was able to overcome cancer and race in the Tour de France is inspirational. The book was indeed well-written and was a good story. He came across as a rather unlikeable guy, but still inspiring due to his drive to survive and come back. Now that he's made his confession, you'd really have to read a lot of this with a grain of salt. My recommendation (and my plan) is to find a good biography about him instead. My next order will be for &#34;Seven Deadly Sins: My Pursuit of Lance Armstrong&#34; by David Walsh."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When I got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, I received several gift copies of Lance's book. I found it very intimidating. Do I need to be like Lance Armstrong to beat cancer? I found it hard to relate to. So I wrote \\"I'm Not Lance!\\" for ordinary patients and their supporters. It's earning rave reviews from readers on amazon and also from professional critics. Many ordinary people fighting cancer feels it speaks to them.

I thought that I would be uplifted and inspired, but, well, it actually made me like Lance Armstrong a little less. I know this won't be a popular opinion, but, according to the book, he wasn't really very nice to the people around him as he went through his ordeals, and he doesn't waste much time thanking anyone. And did he really get the owner of Oakley to force an insurance company to cover the costs of his cancer treatment? Great for him, but all he did was pass the cost of his treatment on to other policyholders who made sure that their premiums were paid. I wish I would have like this book, but I can't say that I did."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read Lance Armstrong and Sally Jenkins other book \\"Every Second Counts\\" about three years ago and finally got around to reading this book, which was their first collaboration. I enjoyed both but gained more insights into Lance the human being as opposed to the super athelete in this book. Lance comes across as a bit of a jerk at times. I was thinking at times what an a hole. The story itself, his foundation etc. is a story for the ages but I couldn't help but see the man behind the glass. I remember attending the first Ride For Roses bike event and participating and seeing Miguel Indurain and Lance with his then new or soon to be wife Kik and thinking, what a magical story. After reading this book and seeing his attitude about that ride and other insights into his personality I came away a bit turned off to Lance. Previous to reading this book I was a big Lance fan; I still am but not to the same degree. I still think he is a miraculous athelete but his halo has been tarnished. I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone. As a cyclist and the son of a cancer survivor this book really hit home. It really is a touching story, in spite of Lance coming across as a bit of a jerk. Read this book to see what makes Lance tick and see what you think about him. Is he an over inflated egotistical driven machine or a caring warm human being who just happens to have been the best rider on the planet? Probably a little of both. Anyway, check it out , you be the judge, the ride will not be dull, it is a good read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I picked up this book in the juice store in San Jose on a trip. Someone I knew had given a moving speech on Lance, and I love inspiring stories. I have read a few. None, and I mean none so damn well written. The words, the descriptions, and the story, is so deep, and so well-written, that it was incredibly hard to put down. You start to get to know a real person, and all his defeats, his hardship, his anger, and his emergence as a real winner in face of it all. It is the best read in all of my carefully selected dozen books in the last few months. I highly recommend it!!! I love you Lance Armstrong! You are amazing!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance is one person that gave me a great deal of inspiration in this book. How he overcame is struggles is an inspiration to so many people. So what if he has personal \\"love life\\" things to deal with? That is not the foundation of this book. The foundation is the human spirit that overcomes so much, and he is an incredible inspiration to so many people.Don't pay attention to the judgment of reviewers that seem to balk about his intimate personal life. This book, and the messages in it are what matter most, not his dating life.This is a must read book if you are looking to overcome a lot of adversity. Lance is a tremendous inspiration, and this book is a great read!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The most inspirational book I have ever read!

Lance Armstrong is such a strong athelete and I'm amazed by what he endured and accomplished after his treatments. This book is very real and I could feel his pain throughout his story. Loved this book! A good read for ANYONE."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Mine is a very personal story. By chance in 2002, I became hooked by cycling and so I naturally found my way to this book. Like many others, I found it inspiring. So when I found myself grinding up a hill, my legs and lungs screaming in unison for me to stop, I would think of Armstrong and all he had gone through in his fight against cancer and - more often than not - I would find the heart, somehow, to keep going.Then in June 2003 I was diagnosed with cancer and required an urgent operation to remove a large tumour from my leg. I was worried that I might never ride again, until I realised that I might never even walk straight again, as they needed to remove a good size piece from my leg.When I went in for my operation, I tore a large photo of Armstrong from a magazine and I stuck it by my hospital bed. I looked at that photo when it hurt. And I looked at it some more, when I slid out of bed and tried to walk. If he could do it, so too could I.So, what price can one place on this book, despite its imperfections? His story gave me courage to fight back, as it has given courage to tens of thousands of other people. You don't need to have cancer or be a cycling fan to appreciate the courage and strength of character, which shines through, page after page.And my story also has a happy ending. My tumour was benign and I was back on the bike within a few weeks. But I still think of Armstrong when my body wants me to stop. And I keep going.What better recommendation could one give?"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book offers great insight into one of America's little known but emerging heros. Lance is a real man as we see in him a devotion to his family and friends, his sport, his battle against cancer and his continuing fight against the disease, all characteristics rarely seen in professional athletes these days. Most folks don't realize the effort that comes with a battle against cancer. I didn't, but this book opened my eyes. People outside of the cycling world know little about Lance Armstrong. That's too bad because he is an example we can all use these days. When sports are filled with steroid using, greedy role models who care for nothing more than themselves, Lance is a refreshing break from that norm. We can all learn a lesson from him. The book is good. Even if you don't ride, this book is, as it's title suggests, much more than a story about a cyclist. Cycling is secondary to the more important aspects of this book. Lance is only in his early 30's but has already fought and won several battles of a life time both in life and on two wheels. I can only wonder what lays ahead for him and when his next auto biography will be ready.Post Script Several years later: one divorce, hookin up with Cheryl Crow (but still devoted to his family), 7 TDF wins, pissin the French off etc. Still a good book.Post Script again a few more years later (Jan 2013). Well you know the rest. I'll have to re-read this book again and see if I still feel the same. We all kind of knew something was going on, but to the extent as to which was exposed, yikes. The problem with cycling is that it's not about who's the better cyclist, it's who as the better dope doctors. The TDF is basically equal in that all of them are using something (my opinion)."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life is a breath taking and inspirational book. I usually don't find autobiographies good, because I don't find peoples life interesting, but this made me keep on reading. What the story is about is how Lance Armstrong, a sensational bike rider got cancer in his early twenties. Right was he was 12 years old he had his dedication for a bike. He used to love triathlons and was competing in the highest level against twenty year olds. In school everyone would were polo shirts and talk after school, while he would be riding his bike for several hours. One day he didn't fell a hundred percent and finds out that he has testicular cancer. After about 1 year he got rid of the cancer, but he had lost all his muscle mass and his hair after going through chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a strong substance that either will kill the cancer or you first. It is a high risk procedure. The doctors for Lance said to Lance after he had got out of cancer that he had a ten percent chance of living, and that it was a miracle, yet it wasn't, because those doctors believed in him. Before other doctors said that he would never be able to bike, but his sponsors never gave up on him because they all believed in Lance Armstrong. After Chemotherapy he was riding again, but couldn't win a single race and was deciding to quite. Abruptly he won his first race after cancer and thought that he might win the Tour de France. He had remembered what someone had said to him a long time ago, \\"Lance your going to win the Tour de France one day.\\" He had trained for one year for the Tour de France and didn't compete in any other races; he just waited and waited for the Tour de France to draw nearer. I am not going to tell you the rest of the story but I really think you should read the inspirable book. One reason why I liked this book is because that it teaches you determination and the struggles that he had to go through, but he was confident that he was going to defeat the disease which he did. One thing that I liked about Lance Armstrong's writing is that it is really descriptive and it is a fast moving book, but that is just me. I also like books that are really inspirational and show nothing is impossible if you just put hard dedication into to it. I really think you should read this inspirational book that teaches you that nothing is impossible."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Several years ago a great mountaineer wrote that it any endurance athelete needs to be incredibly selfish to make it to the top of his or her game. To be the best, you must have no qualms about sucking the energy of the people who love you in order to feed your obsession. You can give them cars, homes, money, and your name, but your net worth to your family will always be diminished because you must love your sport more than you can love the people who love you.Mature atheletes acknowledge the human toll, either in the loneliness of trying to go it alone or in the broken people they often leave behind. Lance Armstrong has not reached point yet, so this book is just as interesting for what he leaves unsaid or misunderstood.We admire the strength, obsessiveness, and tenacity, the qualities Lance Armstrong personifies. Most readers can draw inspiration from his story and improve their lives by developing more strenght, obsessiveness, and tenacity. On the other hand, beware of trying to use this story as a model for living, unless you are willing to either pay the price or inflict it on others."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"There's truth in the title: it's not about the bike, not even about Lance, although he's the one generating the narrative, and a good one it is. Joseph Campbell spoke about the &quot;Hero's Journey&quot;, which is what this book outlines. Some come to enlightenment through study, others through life-altering experiences, most never get there at all. With feet of clay, and a pretty good-sized ego (necessary for world-class athletes), and help from more gods and humans than anyone has a right to expect, Lance arrived on that windswept peak that overlooks life in this world. I thank him for sharing that with us, as painful as it was, and for helping us understand that we all can rise to that peak, but we cannot do it alone.In the words of the Hollywood reviewers, &quot;I laughed, I cried, I was changed.&quot; If you read this and aren't, you're not human."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In the opening chapters we are introduced to an athlete driven by success. Someone with an inflated self-serving ego who was obstinate, insulting and ruthlessly competitive. His mouth had no gatekeeper to prevent the insolent, unkind remarks he hurled at others.Then came a diagnosis of cancer. It jolted him into a new reality; one where other people shared an importance that he held exclusively for himself. Reading about his cure and transformation were both encouraging and inspiring. After the cure he expressed his gratitude by serving others unselfishly and magnimously.On a different, more entertaining note, I really enjoyed reading about the Tour de France.At the book's conclusion, I felt Armstrong should be awarded an honorary degree in philosophy from a distinguished university. His learning experience, which he shares through his candid autobiography is anything but abstract. It is life altering.Lance Armstrong and Sally Jenkins have written a tour de force. I give it high marks for content and style. Reading each page felt like having a personal conversation, except my comments to Lance went unheard. I look forward to a sequel."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have always been a cycling fan. In college we would periodically ride 50+ miles on a Saturday and each week my bony backside reminded me of everyone one. Given that, and watching the Tour de France, I committed to read Lance's bio. In a word, I'm a fan; now, more than ever.Initially, what jumps out is Lance's scrappy writing style. It's refreshing; I loved that he was unafraid to identify the &quot;father figures&quot; in his life for what they were and were not. His devotion to his mom is pure and true. You can hear it in his narrative. His mom should think about writing a book about her own strength, tenacity, and dedication to being a great mom under very difficult circumstances.The second striking aspect is the man's amazing anatomy. His physiology and his tolerances for pain are unique. It doesn't hurt that he seemingly manufactures less lactic acid than the rest of us poor sods. However, I was struck by his quest for pain as a pure way to leave all the peripheral interruptions behind and to really focus on his job. That is the one aspect that has stayed with me. One can program one's thinking to see pain as focal point rather than a debilitating distraction. What a powerful and liberating feeling.His frank and story of the surgery and chemotherapy are gut wrenching (literally!) As well, the reader definitely wants the happy ending and is thus rewarded in this biography. His personal reflections of his emotional, physical and spiritual transformations after the cancer motivate this reader to cheer all the more. Good on ya Lance!

It is extremely well written, easy to read, and a &quot;can't-put-down&quot; kind of book! I found it had a great balance of technical details about bike racing (even though I'm no cyclist, it was easy to understand), but more importantly, Lance's emotions and feelings came through in EVERY chapter. His strength of character and will to live, and love of life was totally inspiring to me, as well as to my entire family who read this book (including 2 teenage sons who read very little!) We all loved it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book grabs you from the get-go and never lets go. It quickly pulls you into Lance's world, makes you feel the shock of learning about cancer, and makes you feel the struggle and pain of getting through it. Not for the squeamish, the descriptions get into gritty detail. The parts about racing really have you in the saddle--you can practically feel like you're straining up the mountain or screaming down the descent with Lance. A hard book to put down; great insight for fans of Lance as to his drive and personality, and an inspiration for everyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is the best book I've read in a long time.

It was a page turning book that never let you get bored. It wasn't just a book with no point it was a book with a moral. It taught me many different lessons and values. This book taught me that you can never give up and it made me think. When something in life happens, you can never give up whether it is a game or cancer. It didn't just teach me about Lance, it taught me about my inner strength and others inner strength(how you have to beleive in yourself and others and never let yourself or others quit). As I said this book is a great page turning book that taught me many great values and lessons needed to exceed and achieve anything you want in life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book to me showed pure determination on Lance's part.

But this story is not just about him, it's about every survivor who found the courage, determination and strength to battle death and disease... win or lose.It is not surprising that battling cancer changed his life. The fact that he boldly states that it was the best thing to happen to him, and then describes why, is the part of the book you'll appreciate most.After reading this book, I keep hoping that I can someday develop the perspective on life he has, without having to face death to do it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An inspiring publication.

I read your book in one sitting then went out and bought copies for my chidren and their children. Whether you ride bicycles or not, this book is an honest look at life through the eyes of a young man who has everything to live for and decided nothing, not even a life-threatening disease could keep him from his goals. He gives a lot of credit to his Mother, wife, friends and teammates. He never takes credit for having done it alone. Besides being inspirational, it was a facinating look into the world of bike racing, a subject I knew little about. Now I'm looking forward to being in Austin next year to watch the Ride of the Roses. Maybe I can't ride a bike anymore, but I'd love to be able to watch those who can and to help fund the Lance Armstrong Foundation. Put me on your mailing list."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Let me be the first one to admit that I know very little of the cycling world. I had heard of Lance Armstrong and I knew that he won the Tour de France. So I was a bit leery reading a book, much less a biography who normally would never even hit my radar screen, but I have learned my lesson. This book just blew me away, it capitivated me in a way that only a good book can. It moved me, made me think, and made me feel grateful. If only for that short time I felt I really knew Lance and I was right there with him -- pulling for him the whole time. He was open, outright and honest in this book and it was was written in a respectful and responsible manner. For readers like myself, I feel thankful that Lance chose to share his story with us. It was touching and I'd truly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book that means something and can teach you something too."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you think you're not the &quot;autobiography&quot; type -- think again! As the title states, it's not just about the bike. As a rider however; I thought it was neat to get the athlete's perspective on the Tour, as well as the type of training Lance endured. It's an easy read and would make a great gift book for anyone who is living with/has survived cancer, come from a single parent home or loves riding."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The odds are part of the result, not the direct indicator; Lance Armstrong -- fellow Austinite -- proves that.

A great story of survival about one of the greatest athletes of our time."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"At first I thought &quot;what a cocky person, with attitude&quot; but as I discovered later in the book, that without that attitude, as he battles cancer, Lance would be dead today. I wish I had this book eight years ago before my dad died of cancer, Lance would have made me ask more questions and demand more answers from the doctors that my family thought we could trust. Lance is remarkable and I pray that his inspiration spreads across the world."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Very interesting book and well written, I read it from cover to back and must say that normally I am not too interested in biographies as a whole, but this one was exceptional. Though the book takes you through the life of Lance, from his immature, spoiled and manic upbringing to his overall success in the 1999 Tour de France; it really isn't about Lance at all, but about survivorship against cancer. You come away with the distinct feeling that this event in his life changed him forever as a person to where he stopped thinking about himself to where he has started to think about others...i.e. his cancer foundation. I never thought I would read a story about cancer and its effects on people until I picked this one up. Unfortunately, the only reason I did was because I am myself a cyclist and have watched Lance's career as well as other's in cycling blossom in the US in the last decade. Don't make that your reason for reading this book. EXCELLENT, kudos to the writer...!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Before reading this book I didn't know who Lance Armstrong was, except by name. Lance very candidly tells the story of his struggles with testicular and brain cancer. He is a man of true respect and honor. His writing is simple, compelling, and motivating. By one Doctor's estimate, Lance had less than a 3% chance in surving cancer, yet he did just that. His personal battles and in depth writing about his testicular cancer is informative and much needed. Lance is a true champion. It is apparent more through the words he speaks/writes, than the races he has won. I would recommend this to anyone and I feel very fortunate to have greater insight into truly a remarkable man and American. The challenge now to me, and the other readers, is to live our lives with as much passion as Lance Armstrong. Read this book! God Bless him and his family. It would be an honor to count someone such as he, a friend.RK Powers"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's attempt to share his psychological and physical battles with professional cycling and cancer is very interesting and emotional. I found him to be honest and insightful. He allows you to see his many sides: brash, bold, cocky, vulnerable, sensitive, frightened, invincible. I think that this book is quite valuable because Mr. Armstong emphasizes the hardest part of his battle with cancer: being a survivor. I would recommend this book to anyone who hopes to better understand the emotions associated with having cancer or anyone who simply wants to know how Lance Armstrong achieved his impossible accomplishments."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As increadible as Lance Armstrong's third consecutive Tour De France victory is, it pales in comparison to his victory over cancer. Lance himself has said on numerous occasions that the Tour is much easier than the horrific cancer treatments he was forced to endure, and when you read this book, you'll believe him. &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot; is a truly enjoyable read. It is the type of book you can sit down and blaze through in an afternoon, or, if you want a more leisurly pace, over the course of three or four evenings. It gives a brief account of Armstrong's rise to success as well as some insider information into some of his more impressive early victories. Then it descendes into the painful world of a cancer patient. As impressive as Armstrong's cycling victories are, you almost begin to forget that part of his life as you learn about what the cancer treatments put him through. By the time the cancer victory has been achieved, the Tour De France win seems more like icing on the cake than the real achievement. Lance Armstrong is an increadibly interesting personality that the general public knows almost nothing about. As an athlete, what he is doing on the pavement is almost unprecidented. He is starting to have the apperance of, not just a Tour winner, but one of the great men. It seems he has the potential to go after the record 5th or even 6th tour win (a feat no other racer has achieved). In Lance's book you see what it takes, both on the physical and mental side of the equation. Like all endurance athletes, Lance had, before cancer, displayed an awesome ability to fight off infection. He simply has a body that can take a tremendous amount of abuse and come through strong. But you get the sense as you read, that what cancer did for Lance was further temper an already iron will. He learned a level of discipline that almost goes on human potential and he learned it because he had to to survive. Although he undoubtably has always had the body to be a tour winner, cancer strengthened his will to the point where he is now almost unbeatable. It is a shame that the American media pays so little attention to the Tour De France. The race is bar none the most difficult sporting event in the world. Many of the top professional athletes in the world are unable to finish not because of injury but simply because they can't physically go on. This is not something you see in any other event. Armstrong's victories are a testament to iron will and meticulous preperation. The argument could be made that he is the greatest athlete America has ever produced. A three-peat in the tour puts him in an elite group of only a handful of racers that have participated in an event that has been going on for a hundred years. Combine this with the fact that Armstrong battled back against horrific cancer treatments that often totaly destroy the body of the patient, and you have a story that is simply miraculous. There is no greater example of the human spirit, or the American spirit than Lance Armstrong. It is simply a sin that he is not spoken of with the same godlike reverence that accompanies Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods. If you want to make up for this in some small way, take it upon yourself to learn about the man yourself. This is a story that every American should know."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I would have never bought this book, simply because I am not a cyclist. A friend had it on their coffee table, and once I opened it, I could not put it down. I usually was an Oprah book club reader occasionally, and always bored by the monotony of non-fiction I could not relate to. But, I am a fellow Austinite and I hear all about Lance and his trials - from Texas Monthly magazine's article and newspapers statewide to coffee shop talk. We all know about him. Nothing really prepared me for the dynamics of Lance Armstrong. By reading this book, I was able to get inside the head of this incredible athlete. He drew pictures of his struggles and his rags-to-riches life so simply. He really is a great writer! More importantly, this book is not about cycling essentially - it is about his cancer and how it changed his life - everything. I find it to be an awesome page-turner, and I recommend it to all my friends. Go Lance!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is Lance Armstrong's story through the first Tour De France victory.I admit, cycling does (did) not particularly interest me. That confessed, I have followed the Tour De France from the days of Greg LeMond enough to know who wins.Armstrong's story of growing up with a single parent, surviving cancer, falling in love, winning the Tour De France and having a child is detailed in \\"It's Not about the Bike\\" and is riveting in its frankness. Armstrong does not attempt to be politically correct and his humanity touches the reader.I have had this book sitting unread on my bookshelf for several years. That is regrettable.I was slightly amused and then saddened when reading passages in the book about Kristen, Lance's love, wife and mother of his three children.

I don't know why I got the illness, but it did wonders for me, and I wouldn't want to walk away from it. Why would I want to change, even for a day, the most important and shaping event in my life?\\"This single quote could summarize this most remarkable book, by an equally remarkable man. After reading this book, (in which I stayed up until it was finished), I am just totally amazed at Lance's guts, determination and strength in fighting testicular cancer, which should have, according to the poor odds against him (less than 3%), killed him. Lance, instead of becoming a victim, chose instead to be survivor!Here a story of inspiration that will bring tears to your eyes, tears of compassion, joy and triumph. This is one man's story of incredible challenge of digging down deep for inner resources in managing and conquering cancer. Lance refused to become a statistic and instead rallied and became cancer's worst enemy. He refused to give in and chose to fight the disease with all that he had. I admire his love and admiration for his mother, who continues to be one of his strengths in his life. He was fortunate, as well, to have loving friends support him throughout his entire ordeal.\\"The one thing the illness has convinced me of beyond all doubt - more than any experience I've had as an athlete - is that we are much better than we know. We have unrealized capacities that sometime only emerge in crisis. So, if there is a purpose to the suffering that is cancer, I think it must be this: it's meant to improve us.\\"The book chronicles the emotional and physical changes Lance undergoes as he triumphs over cancer as well as his emotional coping both during and after. This is a book of true courage and determination. Lance set up a foundation to help other cancer patients manage and survive their cancer. Lance lives his mother's inspiration of \\"make every obstacle an opportunity.\\"Lance proves that the power of the mind, combined with taking control of one's disease, seeking different opinions and doctors, and becoming an expert on the topic can help one overcome and conquer cancer.This is book is an excellent, poignant and emotional testimony to one man's faith and determination. Finishing this book, I have nothing short of admiration for Lance Armstrong. Thanks Lance for being an inspiration to everyone and with your work with cancer patients. The world needs more role models like yourself!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The basic story here is awfully familiar : healthy, cocky, young athlete is stricken with cancer and faces a fight for his life. But what's truly remarkable is how differently the story ends than those we've become used to over the years. Just thirty years ago, in Brian's Song, the story revolved around the courage and grace with which Brian Piccolo, a 26 year old football player for the Chicago Bears, struggled against certain doom, and how he touched the lives of those around him. Today, not only did Lance Armstrong survive testicular cancer--the same cancer that killed Piccolo--he was actually able to return to championship bike racing and win that Tour de France thing. Nor is this a rarity, there are numerous other pro athletes who have survived cancer and returned to compete at a level at least equal to where they were prior to their illness. In fact, it is almost tempting to become blas&eacute; about such stories.So the great service that Armstrong provides here is to detail just how frightening it still is to face such a disease, no matter the survival rate. In particular, the rather gory detail he goes into about the manifestations of the cancer, and the treatment process, serves as a helpful reminder of the psychological, as well as physical, costs that survivors pay even as they return to health. Modern medicine is capable of some amazing things, but it still requires a healthy dose of the human spirit to overcome illness. Lance Armstrong is nothing if not spirited.The book may not turn you into a cycling fan--it didn't me. But it will more than likely get you to root for Lance Armstrong, and the other brave folks who have fought back, successfully, against cancer.GRADE : B"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A story of an incredibly egocentric, arrogant, selfish and immature man, who manages to haul himself up to the emotional level of a late-adolescent.

I only wish I'd read this book sooner."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is outstanding, and while I retain very little respect for Lance Armstrong on a personal level, after watching his interview with Opera, I still highly recommend this book, as it is outstanding."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Q: How do you write a book to tell a story when everybody already knows most all of the story? A: LIKE THIS! People know about the bike, people know about the cancer, what people don't know is the how and the why. With this brutally honest, sometimes excruciatingly explicit (in the chemo stories) story of who Lance Armstrong really is.Lance the survivor and bike racer is known and admired for all that he has overcome, and for the amazing person that he has become. This book shows how he became such an amazing person. It's not all pretty -- not even most of it is pretty -- but it is HONEST. Lance is not shy about addressing his own mistakes and weaknesses, while trying to show what (and how) he learned from them. In wonderful style, he shows that it really ISN'T about the bike, by spending more time discussing his failures, his losses, and his mistakes, than his victories -- because that's what he could learn from. Lance is even more of a hero and a role model for the world because of this book, because he was not afraid to say &quot;I was wrong&quot;, and was willing to grow and learn through the experiences."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As good as it gets in a biography. Fiction could not have been written any better: teen single mom raises her baby to never quit or take the easy way out.Bike racing cancer victim Armstrong seems to hold nothing back in this inspiring probe into his life, where he states that he would rather claim the title of cancer survivor over race victor, and that having cancer was the best thing that happened to him. Giving his mother's care and never give up example and his &quot;stud&quot; life partner of a wife all the credit, Armstrong's story filled me with tears at times, a belly laugh at others, and most of all the encouragement to look at obstacles as opportunites instead of stumbling blocks. Outstanding!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"It's not about the bike\\", like the title said, is not only about racing, but also about life generally .In the book you are going to read about fear, courage, support, friendship, love and victory. You'll find all of the feelings that anyone always meets in your life, makes Lance a human being like everyone. In this book, he's sending us a message about how life can be full of challenges and if we make up our mind we can be surprised about what we can do. You'll find a lot of great quotations like \\"make every obstacle an opportunity\\" etc. which can be very instructive in your life.This book was my first autobiography and I'm glad that I read it, because immediately after you finished reading your life is going to be very inspired.I also like the style of the writing because everybody can read without any difficulties. The messages are very strong and frank. I didn't know anything about Lance, now it's like I always knew him. This year I wish he'd win the Tour de France, but this time I'm going to follow all the stages of the race."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I just finished the audio cassette version. Having recently gone through a cancer fight with my mother-in-law, I can relate to Mr. Armstrong's incredible struggle against the odds. His experiences with surgery, chemo, blood marker counts, all sounded so familiar. No one would blame him for giving up racing, but to come back and actually WIN the Tour De France...Lance is an inspiration to all cancer patients and their families, to never give up hope. Very well done, Mr. Armstrong."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's journey back to life is indeed incredible. I was expecting a sob story where a cancer patient recounts his life, blah, blah, blah. Instead, this book offered a fine balance between the melancholy and the actual fight he put up. I am amazed by his determination. This just reinforces the fact that with determination, everything is possible. This is especially so in the part where he described how he was determined not to be sick and even went cycling when he was undergoing chemo! How many people can do that?!This is a very touching book and I highly recommend it to all readers."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book has shown me what tough is all about. Lance was able to express what he went through so well. It is a book that will really put comfort in your soul and yet give you a feeling of reality. It explains the joy, pain, and suffering that his life endured. It is a keeper on my bookshelf. When I read this book, I couldn't put it down. I read it in a matter of a few days. Mr. Armstrong shows us what life is like for cancer patients all over the world in this book. It is a \\"must get\\" book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was diagnosed with Testicular cancer in December 2001. I am still going through the treatment right now. I was given this book as a gift from some thoughtful friends. I gobbled it up.Sadly, the Medical community provides little information about coping and dealing with this disease. Lance's book helped me to understand the disease from a survivors perspective and helped to comfort and motivate me during a time of great personal concern. In addition his website dedicated to the disease is extremely helpful and informative.Although having testicular cancer has made this book particularly personal, I found it to be an excellent read from a human interest perspective and would gladly recommend it to others (who could care less about the cancer aspect) just for the entertainment value of learning about this incredible person and his incredible life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong and Sally Jenkins hold nothing back in telling this story about cancer survival. This is also a compelling story about an athlete who had his life transformed by an illness. Armstrong is outside the religious mainstream and tells the story of his return to cycling with admirable candor. Armstrong is a role model for taking control and achieving your destiny."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you think life is rough then read this book. This book will help you put life in an order of importance. Charish every person, every day, every moment. I came away with not a better knowledge of cycling but a strong focus on my life and what I want to accomplish. Remain focused and be strong. Dont be a quitter."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book helps put life in a healthy perspective. Actually, I picked up this book while I was in the midst of reading &quot;The Survivor Personality.&quot; While the latter book is good, &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot; masterfully shows what it's like to be not only a survivor...but a thriver. It helped me change my attitude about some challenges that really amounted to nothing more than &quot;mole hills.&quot; The book tells more about what it has taken for Armstrong to succeed than some reviews have indicated. Yes, he has natural physiological advantages. But so do all professional athletes. Lance does not have physiological advantages over all of his competitors. The book shows that he has learned to plan, execute his plan...and work his butt off. Does this mean that Armstong has the personality that many people wish he had? No. And the rest of us have personality flaws, too. I much prefer to read about people--especially sports stars and other celebrities--as they are, not as we would like to idealize them. This makes the book's message (about what it takes to become a survivor) much more relevant to me. Most everyone will love this book. You don't have to be a bicycle rider or sports fan. Riding with Armstong down Alps road on a bike at 70 miles per hour...with only a few feet of visibility...moves you into a differernt world. Readers who are offended by occasional expletives are the only ones who should steer clear of this terrific book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Exceptional story! I'm not a cycling enthusiast, in fact I never followed the Tour de France prior to reading this book, but I now follow it just to cheer on Lance. I purchased this book when it was first released in 2001 and to this day (Feb '03), the story of Lance Armstrong's inspirational journey is fresh in my mind."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Couldn't put it down ! Fascinating story toldat right level of detail for busy people."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A very interesting book about one of the greatest modern Americans. If you're a fan of cycling or Lance, you have to read it!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Having heard about Lance Armstrong and some of the history of his racing and that he had survived cancer, this book caught my interest. Once I picked it up I read it all the way through in two days and really enjoyed hearing his story in his words. One voice among many that have hard times in life, a real encouragement to perservere everything that comes along in life and keep your dreams alive. I gave this book 5 stars and I would read it again. I hope to see him along the road this year in the Tour de France! Go Lance!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you want to know what people with cancer go through, this is the book for you. Two thums up for Lance Armstrong for sharing his personal experinces dealing with cancer. Detailed, honest, and informative! Really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Hello All,What can I say about this book?! If I had just one word to sum it all up,.....HEAVY! What an inspirational story! I can't tell you how many times I had tears in my eyes while reading this.(Yes, even men cry) Truly, this is one story worth your time to read.I've dealt with cancer in my family so, this book really hits home with me. Do yourself or someone you love a favor, BUY them this book!!.....They / you won't regret it.Ciao!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I just could not lay this book down. I was reading it in the train, in the bathroom and even at work (sorry boss). My mother had cancer and I knew what it takes to overcome such a setback, but Lance Armstrong turned his life around and never gave up what he enjoyed doing. I have a new love for cycling and if Lance Armstrong can win the Tour de France after cancer, I can quit being lazy and do something in my life too. Thanks Lance."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is a three-time winner of the Tour de France, an achievement that in itself is extremely praiseworthy. But what is amazing about Armstrong's victories is that he achieved them after recovering from cancer - at one stage the doctors had believed his chances of recovery were less than 20%. It's Not About the Bike is the story of Armstrong's life - his growing up, his riding, his becoming a father. Most of all, it is about his battle with cancer, and how it changed him for the better.Don't fear - this is not some airy-fairy new-age hope story. Armstrong is very down to earth about the whole process that he went through, and is not afraid to share details (gory, icky details). This book achieves a lot that other autobiographies miss - he drops some pretty big names and doesn't shy away from comparing himself from the greats in cycling, yet you never feel he is boasting. You get a lot of detail - what goes into chemo treatments; a run through of his 1999 ride of the Tour de France - but it never feels boring or superfluous. Rather, Armstrong comes across as a guy that manages to be amazing and reassuringly normal at the same time - he likes to kick back and drink beer, he loves his Mother, he is proud of being a Dad. He just happens to be one of the greatest sports people competing today, and after reading this book you realise how hard he works to be so good.You don't need to be a cyclist to enjoy this book - while there are sections on his riding, nothing is too technical, and all cycling terms used are explained. As the title says - it's not about the bike. It is about an amazing man that went to hell and back, and made the best of the second chance he was given. I guarantee this book will manage to make you laugh, make you think and inspire you all in the same reading. And there's not much more you can ask from in a book than that."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is the a Tour D France champion. Lance Armstrong is a cancer survivor. Between those two headlines is a very courageous and complicated American hero. The first person narrative takes you from boyhood to today with emphasis on his struggle to survive and his subsequent struggle in a comeback. What makes this book special is the self-awareness and spriritual perspective he shares from his experience. I was inspired and tearful as he won his third Tour, knowing his road to Paris was a greater challenge than most spectators imagined."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I started reading this book for an english project... but I loved the book. It was inspirational, and illustrated that anything is possible. He is an excellent writer, and because of the detailed descriptions given for all of the influencial people in his life I feel like I knew them myself. I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Make no mistake, this book is about cancer and how Lance Armstrong survived it; he describes some races, and includes details about his life, but they are minimal in comparison (the discussion of his son's birth covers only about ten pages). His determination and will are admirable, but his bravado and arrogance are repulsive. At one point in the book, just before he is to have brain surgery, he relates the story of how he began to contemplate his existence and his life. His conclusion? Basically that if he did not survive, he would look God in the eye and say &quot;if I wasn't good enough, then fine, do whatever you've got to do.&quot; He does explain his agnosticism to an extent: a bad experience with his adoptive stepfather who was a professing Christian. His wife, however, is Catholic, and he tells a story in the book about how he bought a crucifix for himself and a friend of his who had cancer also. On the topic of religion, like virtually everything else, including cycling, Armstrong comes off as a person who thinks he can do whatever he wants and not have to answer to anyone. In this way, he is little more than a misguided rebel. That having been said, however, he does display some redeeming qualities in addition to his stubborn will to beat cancer: his efforts in founding a charitable foundation are commendable, and his understanding of his &quot;duty&quot; as a survivor of cancer to others who struggle with the disease, as well as the families of those who have fallen victim to it, are both praiseworthy and insightful. I cannot help but come away with the impression that Armstrong is still very much in the process of self-discovery, and that this book is just his journey so far."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said. A fantastic book about an interesting character that has little to do with sports and more to do with the human spirit. This book details Lance's early life as he addresses his cocky, immature nature that quickly goes out the window when he begins his cancer battle. Lance is alive because his is famous. His cancer was so aggressive and mature that IMO what saved him is the unsolicited email from the doctor at Vanderbilt that eventually led him to the doctors at Indiana University. I like sports and would never have read a book just about cancer survival but this book was so highly recommended and for good reason.The book finishes with Lance mentally battling to get back on the bike and on to greater glory. There is much to learn here also but the one downer would be listening to him describing his ideal marriage when of course it has already broken up.I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK HIGHER. You will not be disappointed. And yes, you will start following the Tour de France."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Cancer survivor, two-time Tour De France Winner, world-class athlete. I guess I was expecting more from the book. I came away sorely disappointed. Armstrong came across as an arrogant, insensitive, unsympathetic jerk. 275 pages of him bitching and complaining about one thing or another. Spoiled, rich, good looks...and zero personality. His story should be a compelling read but I found it entirely too self-indulgent. He has no faith. He has incredible wealth. He, unlike a lot of people, could afford the best cancer doctor money could buy. He was damn lucky to survive. BTW, I'm a theraputic foster parent, adoptive parent, and plain old parent. My wife and I currently have seven children at home. The children who cross our doorstep have been abused, neglected, and abandoned. We fight a daily struggle to keep these kids on an even keel. Their story is a thousand times more compelling than Armstrong's. According to Lance, no one is as great as Lance. No one, that is, except the millions of abused and neglected foster children in the Unites States, who fight a daily battle for survival and the hope of a &quot;normal&quot; childhood. Lance, as an American, I was proud of your personal and professional accomplishments. Your book did not make me less proud, but did give me an insight into the bitter person you are. I'm sorry for you and all of those you come in touch with."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'll admit it; I am in awe of Lance Armstrong and his athletic achievements. Like many great athletes however, it seemed to me like he had sacrificed part of being a regular guy in his pursuit of greatness. Lance had sometime appeared aloof and singularly focused. Having read this book you see a decidedly different portrait of the athlete as a human being growing up, starting a career, starting a family and probably most importantly fighting and winning his battle against cancer.Particularly poignant to me was his detailed account of his early life growing up with a single mom. I admire his honesty and openness in recounting the outsider mentality that sometimes gets applied to those whose family picture does not fit the description. Being a cycling fan, his story of success in the sport was very intriguing giving a good glimpse of his abnormal gifts of strength and determination. Many define Lance's battle with cancer as heroic. After reading the book its obvious he saw it as purely a battle for his life. Like everyone, Lance had a lot to live for and fought as hard as he could to keep it. His depiction of the disease and the treatment really expose the raw wound of illness that most of us turn away from. Lance's story reminds us that people suffer greatly each day just trying to stay alive. If anything, it gets you to feel some compassion that you may not have felt without stopping to hear the stories. Lance's heroism comes in his courage to tell his story honestly and continual work to use his celebrity to raise funds in support of cancer patients."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Excellent, well written book.I didn't want to put this book down! Lance Armstrong is amazing the things that he has lived through! Absolutely must read!! highly recommended"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life is one of the best and only books I have read. This book is a fantastic book and definitely a must read. Lance is not arrogant and self-centered, like other review writers have said he did lose to the best in the world. This story starts out with him being a child and like me his sport is disrespected by other high school students. Then he becomes one of the best bikers in the world, but soon after his rise to fame, he gets cancer. This story is extremely inspirational and intense. Even though you know he is going to win the Tour De France. He obviously overcomes his Testicular cancer and wins six, yes six Tour De Frances. He will not make it to seven because he is not mentally focused. He is thinking about retiring. Lance is a great preson for people to admire. He maybe one of the most inspirational people alive today. You may know the story, but not like he depicts it. He gives you lots of details like the chemicals they used in his Chemo (chp. 6). If you have not read this book then your life is not complete."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Read this book in a few hours during a trip to Europe this summer. Lance is a competitor and it comes through loud and clear through his book. I especially enjoyed reading about his training regimens and how much time he has to put in to win races. The majority of this book however, focused on how Lance battled and beat Cancer. I think Lance is very inspirational and causes everyone to not live like they have no tomorrow. This book is entertaining, inspiring, and a great portrayal of the greatest cyclist in history. Thanks Lance!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When I picked this book up I knew the same amount about his form of cancer and international bike racing - that is to say nothing. I became interested in him after he recently won his 4th Tour de France. I was thinking the book would be one of those super positive books that came close to a self-help text. I was wrong, the book was very interesting and detailed his problems without the sticky sweet self-help overlay. I did not expect the detail though on all his medical procedures, all I can say is that I hope I never have half of this done to me. I really enjoyed the detail he goes into on the training and all the pain that he goes through. He also very down to earth, I wonder just how raw the book would have been if not for professional writer he hired.I also thought that his real personality comes through, that is the hard charger that is very sure of him self. I guess one would either have to be or being at the top of your profession makes you that way. This ego, for lack of a better word, was the only real negative I found with the book. Overall it was a very interesting and uplifting book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a good book. As an athlete and a person, I appreciated the inspirational qualities of Lance's story. The descriptions of his battle w/cancer are harrowing, but important for understanding the devestation of illness. I was disappointed, however, with Armstrong's attitude. His arrogance quickly became old. I pity the people who were the brunt of his wrath."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong, so very ill with cancer, survived it. An amazing and very personal story of his struggle with the disease and with his upbringing. Yeah for his mom, his friends and his wife, who were/are great supporters! The book, hard to put down, describes how he rediscovers his life through a trememdous ordeal. Very inspiring -- he just doesn't give up!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a cyclist, I followed the tragedy of cancer and the triumph in the Tour de France of Lance Armstrong closely. Fortunately, this book has so much more detail of the true struggle he, his friends, and family faced during the days, weeks, months and years following his diagnosis with testicular cancer. The openness about his fears and how he overcame them make this book a volume of encouragement to anyone facing severe illness. Cancer definitely &quot;picked the wrong body to live in&quot; and Lance's own words will show you why. The book has just enough cycling jargon for the non-cyclist to understand what he is talking about, but not so much that it reads like a technical guide to cycling. An exceptional book, easy to read and hard to put down. I read mine in 3 days."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"By the end of the book the reader feels as if he has walked a mile in a cancer patients shoes. Obviously, the struggle a cancer patient faces is greater than most of us will ever experience. However the author does an excellent job to realistically describe the daily regimen of a cancer patient. This is an uplifting book that stirs the empowering thoughts we all have within us. The only disappointment I have is that Mr. Armstrong went to great length to describe in detail how reckless he can be while riding his bicycle. I only hope that the younger readers will disregard Mr. Armstong's tendancies to speed through intersections with caution thrown to the wind. I also am hopeful that Mr. Armstrong has now realized just how precious life is and that he will change his behavior."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Things may change fast in your life as this book shows. But you are what you think you are and you become what you think you become. Lance shows that it is true. If you think your life leads nowhere or you are bored by it, then read this book. It will remind you of what is important and what not."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"So I'm reviewer 187. You'll probably never meet Lance in your life, so this is the next best thing. You'll get to know Lance and the courageous mother behind (ahead of?) him. Lance will inspire you. I'd like to meet his mother as well as him. Take a weekend to read this book. Work was annoying, while reading it, even eating was inconvenient. Lance is the American story and shed light on the America I like to hear about: that there are some people out there that do their darndest to be the best at what they do and are willing to pay that price. Made me look at myself and wonder how I was doing with my life. Not a page wasted!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I just went through with my grandmother 3 months of radiation. And to a certain extent i understand how Lance Armstrong felt. His book is heartwarming and made me feel like i was with him every part of his chemo treatments. I was even interested in how he dealt with his having to bank semen if he ever wanted children. He made everything very matter of fact and not to be ashamed of. This fact above everything else in this book is what people should come out with. Nothing is wrong with the human body. Yes it is true that a person shouldn't shout out from the roof top how they bank semen, but by Lance telling his story it levels the playing field. I think how matter of fact he tells his story will help others not feel so superior and help other ppl goign through cancer see that their is hope. Thank you,Shani Apter"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I quite honestly felt the book dragged a little bit in the early stages -- kinda like a bike race. However, the more I read the more I couldn't put it down. This is truly a moving story. If you never believed in miracles, Lance Armstrong story will change your mind. The title is perfect, It's Not About the Bike -- the trails this book takes you has the reader breaking at every curve. How much can one man take? I am amazed that Lance has managed to keep his sanity. What an inspiration -- GREAT BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Before you crack this book, you must make a pact with yourself to put it down after each chapter unless you are a quick read and have the time. There will be times that you fight against this notion, and there are times that you will lose and end up reading multiple chapters.You Are There because the voice is &quot;real&quot;, the details of Lance's life are open, and believable.If you know someone with cancer, this is a good read for both you and your acquaintance."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I finished this book easily in two days. It's very easy to ready, and flows very well.The only thing I didn't like about the book is that Lance sometimes uses phrases that make him seem like a teen-ager."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a kid, Lance had issues. He grew up on the wrong side of the Dallas tracks with a mother who coddled him. He played catch with flamming tennis balls, and terrorized the streets in his Camaro IROC. He nursed his grudges. But along the way he discovered a world class talent in endurance sports,(his VO2 rates are still the highest ever recorded at the Cooper Clinic)and began successfully competing in triathalons and bike races. Focusing his angry energy and prodigious talent on cycling, he became a world class champion. Then the cancer struck and Lance had a whole new battle to fight. It's Not About the Bike interested me because along with the great sports story, Lance reveals a lively intelligence and some real humility. He knows that fate played just as big a role in his life as his indomitable will. His book reads well and has a nice flow to it. I gave it four stars because while it is not a classic, it is certainly one of the better sports autobiographies around."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"For the last two years Lance Armstrong has captured victory at the Tour de France. In It's Not About The Bike, he captures the heart and soul of his readers. Rarely has an athlete's depiction of his struggles been more moving. Rarely has an athlete's depiction of his ultimate victory been more compelling. Armstrong's focus is his victory (physically, psycologically and spiritually)over life-threatenting cancer. His oddessy to beat this deadly disease is well crafted, easy to consume, and rewarding to complete. Oh and by the way, he wins a big race too."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"do you think you can relate? a must read...."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's journey from being diagnosed with cancer to winning the Tour de France 5 years in a row. His remarkable story will influence thousands. His autobiography is simply remarkable in its reality and realistic features that affect people's everyday lives.Being raised by a single mom for many years, his growing up in poverty influenced his mother to succeed in business and in parenthood."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A true inspiration for any jock with a major medical set- back and thinking their life is over. Armstrong beat the odds and the book really gives you insight of one's determination to defeat the deadly disease and get back on his feet again. I have never seen a finer example of self determination."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After reading this book I felt motivated. Motivated to do anything. The feeling of the previous reviews also shed the same light as I felt. I would recommend this book to anyone over 15. It has some language and parts that may not be suitable for children. I learned a lot about life, death, bikes, racing, and even childbirth. I also learned much about Lance. I had an unrealistic opinion about him, but after reading the book, I realized that Lance is only human. Lance, I am praying for you!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance personifies a typical Texan. He tells a great story while not leaving out the details. Highly recommended. All I can say is How about them apples!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book demystified Lance Armstrong for me. I always thought of him as super-human, whose career was a result of incredibly fortunate DNA. While he is DNA gifted, he is also extremely dedicated to his sport, and very much human. Inspirational without being corny, and a fast read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"My parents actually advised that I read this book when I was really not understanding certain essential parts of life. Reading was never something I did before this, but since completing this book, I read a book almost every week. You don't have to know anything about cycling at all to understand this book - it's not what it's about. It's about an incredible story where an astounding athlete is torn apart by cancer, and how he picks himself up off his feet. I strongly advise you read this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Not since I read To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee when I was in middle school have I been emotionally transformed by a piece of literature. I knew nothing of Lance Armstrong (wasn't he some guy who rode a bike?) nor his ordeal with cancer until I read It's Not About the Bike. I will forever be changed by this book.

I am not sure where to start with It's Not About The Bike-I could not put it down. It is written with such passion. You cheer at Lance's victories and cry at his struggles. He is an amazing athlete, loving father and grateful cancer survivor. There are so many inspirational words in his book. Whether you are an athlete like myself or a cancer patient, mother, father, daughter, brother...it doesn't matter. I guarantee you'll find something relatable in his book. I have read Every Second Counts and can't wait for Lance's story/documentary to come out. I can not get enough of this super human. Start by reading this book and you'll feel the same way.

I was so afraid that I could speak with no one about my illness. Someone gave me Lance Armstrong's It's Not About The Bike in which I found my first stirrings of hope. If he could survive testicular and brain cancer then maybe I had a chance too. I read it many times during my illness and was always inspired by his will to fight and his courage. The book kept me up, gave me hope, helped me to be strong and got me through 2 terrible years.

Armstrong comes across as a multifaceted and a complex person notwithstanding the overwhelming focus and singularity of purpose needed survive cancer and go on to win the Tour, not once, but as it turns out, seven times.It's Not About the Bike provides insight into his greatness and inspiration for other survivors. It's also well written, and makes for an engaging read.Few memoirs are as compelling. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was eager to read this book, I saw Lance on several t.v. shows, his battle with cancer interested me because my mom also had cancer at an early age (29), so I bought the book with the hope of learning what made him strong, wondering: how can he inspire others? Well, the first half was pretty good, I was amazed at how much the cancer took over his body and the grueling recovery. I was in awe of Kik and how she stood by him, along thinking he was a humble,family man. I was wrong. The latter part of the book indeed was \\"all about the bike\\" going on and on about all the prep for the upcoming races, the TDF (the biggest, most prestigous bike race), the move to Europe (for the bike) and all the proper cycling terms...ho hum. I almost left that part unread, but I hate doing that, so I trudged on. I was sad to find out later after having read the book, that he no longer was with Kik and his children, but doing just spendidly peddling away and loving his singlehood.I think in writing this book I only learned that for Lance it IS about the bike (and himself). He seems cold, egotistical and unappreciative of those who sacrificed for him. Is that what it takes to get to the top??"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book has been one of the most inspirational books that I have ever read. Now whenever I'm at the gym I just say to myself, come on mike if Lance can do it so can you. I raced bicycles myself when I was younger and after breaking my collarbone at sixteen years old I thought biking was over for me; If only I realized at that age a broken bone was nothing compared to Lance. Thank you Lance Armstrong."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am absolutely floored by how well-written this book is. Once I picked it up I just couldn't put it down. I read the whole book in an evening. As in all great writing, the story just unfolds completely naturally, told in a way that seems effortless. Tears welled up in my eyes as I came to the end of this book. I can't remember the last time a book had this effect on me. Definitely read this book! It will change how you live your life. I'm so glad I picked up this book at a used book store on a whim.I can't believe how realistic his descriptions are of everything, especially his inner monologues as he is racing. Every race is packed with detail--it made me feel as if I was there listening in on his communications during races. I also have a newfound appreciation for cycling.Cancer survivors say things like \\"Getting cancer was the best thing that ever happened to me.\\" I could never fathom how someone could truly mean that. I still can't say I understand it, but, after reading this book, I can get a sense of what it might feel like to say that."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have to say this is one of the better autobios I've read. Lance lets you into his head and helps you to understand what it is like to bike a hundred and some miles a day, as well as how he dealt with cancer and the side effects he went through. After reading this, I have a growing respect for the man as well as the athlete named Lance Armstrong."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Firstly let me start this off by saying that the spin class at my local gym terrifies me - so in no way do I qualify as someone who has ever had anything to do with bike riding. In fact, on my copy of this book it said that Lance had won the Tour de France three times - which I thought was pretty cool not knowing he'd kept it up 1999 - 2005. So, my point is that obviously my cycling knowledge isn't the best but that's one of the amazing things about this book. It didn't need to be. I was never bored with the cycling regime Lance had to go through, I was constantly uplifted by the descriptions of the races and I was even fascinated by his diet. I picked up this book not because I had a love of cycling or even a sparse knowledge, I honestly picked it up because I was having a bad week and I wanted to read about someone who had gone through something infinitely worse and survived... no triumphed. I read this book in 2 days the last day involving me shutting out everything and curling up in my bean bag reading like a crazy woman - I was captivated at every stage of the way. It's written in a down to earth style, for real people wanting an amazing insight into a phenomenal journey. If you can't take away lessons from this book to incorporate into your own life you're not reading the same book I was.Advance to Go, Collect $1 Million"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"First, a disclaimer. I am a huge fan of Lance Armstrong. I think he is one of the best athletes that America has produced, and a real 'rags to riches' man. Like many such men, he has his faults and issues.About the book . . .Its an extremely inspiring story of a driven athelete, his close brush with death, and return to life. It's a life-changing book.It's Not About the Bike is particularly useful for anyone recovering from a severe illness and then moving beyond thier disease to excel at atheletics. After 2 or 3 critical illnesses in the past three years, I credit my general good fitness to keeping me out of the grave, and this book gave me the inspiration to achieve that fitness, even when I wanted to quit.Others have found it similarly inspiring, so much so I bought extra copies and hand them out as needed."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have read books autobiography's and the closest this one comes to was one on Arnonld Schwarzenegger and this one reminds me of that.

He sounds pompus and spoiled and of course from what I heard he is not well spoken either. He maybe a champion in others eyes but not in my book. Grow up Lance lets talk in 10 years."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"People who can't write a book on their own should not write one at all. Let's just be frank about the writers of this book: A moron with a \\"Professional\\" writer. This book is not even inspirational. It is a 200+ page self-loving, repetitive, and masturbatory look at an individual who is not amazing. So you can ride a bike and swim. Who gives a hoot? There is no spirit, no humility, and no substance to this book. Morons who buy into this guy's story are just perpetuating another generation of Americans more concerned about celebrity all-stars and professional athletes than their status as citizens of the greatest country on Earth.I was forced to read this garbage as a summer reading book when I was in high school. It's a great message to send to young developing minds: I am awesome because I have mutant lungs. Let's forget about the great American heroes like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, and FDR. The fact that this crap gets published sickens me to the core. If you want to inspire people, give them an inspiring story: perhaps one of a great American like Washington, or one of Francis of Assisi, Marcus Tullius Cicero, or Churchill.A biography of Stalin would be more inspirational than this."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Before reading this book i felt as though Lance Armstrong was an amazing man-overcoming cancer, wining the tour de france 6 times. As i began the book i still symapthised for him, but as i read further it came apparent to me at how conceited mr amrstong is. Anytime he lost it was alywas to \\"the best in the world\\" and \\"he had given his absolute best and there was nothing he could do\\". It seems as tohught he cant admit his faults.

After reading his book, I can honestly say I dont think I've heard of a more arrogant, self centered, childish jerk. Ever. He's a hothead, and has no concept of how to treat other human beings. Although he may not be involved in any sexual assaults or homicides(like other athletes in the news), he exhibits zero class, much less maturity. I know this not from some unauthorized biography or news account, but from HIS book, his OWN words. Considering what he's been thru, it's truly shocking. And he's completely oblivious.As for the structure of the book. It's good. It's a quick read. One may get somewhat beaten down by the lengthy details of his cancer treatments. Not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but after all that is the subject of the book. Needless to say, his recovery was remarkable.I enjoyed learning of his early riding experiences and his meteoric rise to international stardom in such a short period. However, now I'll never be able to look at him the same again...or cheer for him. He is not a good man. Although Lance will tell you otherwise.

I don't know all of the facts surrounding his personal life, but my wife did go through in-vetro fertilization. It is an incredibly uncomfortable and invasive procedure for women.

But when I saw &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot; in the bookstore, something told me I had to read it. And am I ever glad that I did!This book is probably one of *the most* inspirational stories that I have ever read. It is a book about hopes, dreams, challenges, defeats, determination, and triumphs.Lance and co-author, Sally Jenkins, do a masterful job in describing how Lance grew up. You get a very clear idea of how his childhood and teenage years were spent -- what he liked to do; what he did not like to do; his interests; etc.You follow Lance as he comes a world-class cyclist in his early 20s. Then, in his mid-20s, cancer strikes him. As a cancer survivor, I feel that Lance's description of the disease -- how he felt at the time of diagnosis; during treatment; and in the years that have followed -- is the most vivid and accurate that I have ever seen.Following the battle for his life (and his career), you then follow Lance as he experiences his greatest victories yet, both professionally and personally. Thanks to terrific writing, you will &quot;live&quot; these victories with Lance. And when you are done, you will be as excited as if they had been your own victories!&quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot; touched me deeply.

I have followed cycling for many years going back to the success of Greg LeMond, but Lance Armstrong has definitely stood out. He admittedly was arrogant, rude, and stubborn, but almost losing his life to cancer completely changed him. It should be impressive to anyone to realize how dramatic it is for someone so close to death and so damaged by cancer therapy to dominate the most grueling sporting event in the world, the Tour de France. Lance should inspire many to fight against devastating diseases and circumstances, not only from this book but also from his cancer charity and his pure success. I admire him for revealing his weaknesses and troubled past to show how human he is and how genuine he is now with his life. His story is very touching, and I am glad that he and his wife have been able to have children together in spite of the cancer treatments. This book is a must read for anyone wanting to see just how strong the human spirit of endurance and survival is and the change it can bring to someone's life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A good telling of a great story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Not what I expected at all!

But my husband kept insisting, \\"You gotta read this book!\\" Finally, I picked it up and was hooked at once. Certainly, the story of cancer survivorship was very compelling, but I was surprised to find myself interested even in the sports aspects of the book. It was fascinating to read about an athlete's relationship with his body, or to learn that even super-star athletes sometimes look upon going to work as just another job that has to be done.

In fact, there are few professional athletes that I care to understanding outside of their sports realm as they are usually arrogant. Though it is their arrogance that makes them such great athletes. That was until a friend recommended I read his book. Wow! His story of survival is truly an inspiration to us all. Forget about the 3 tour victories.

Pity poor Lance--he has to sell his Porsche! At one point, he moans that a sponsor is \\"only offering $180,000 a year\\"--and this not to do anything, but simply as a gift while he trains. His wife, she's the real kicker here: she must ...Lance's sexism (he refers to his wife as \\"a skirt\\"), his wife's vanity, all conspire to undermine the essentially valiant story of a man beating cancer and winning the hardest race on earth.I think his story deserved a biography; as autobiography, I simply found his persona too icky to root for. Maybe I am not \\"stud\\"."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When I first read this book a year ago, I said &quot;Wow&quot;. I mean, here's someone who beat a bad disease and did something tremendous. And the credit he gives to his wife for helping re-build the person after his sickness is inspiring.Until...Until you read that all of the sudden he's dumped his wife (oh, the woman in the book who &quot;is a stud&quot;). Just like that. And running around with Sheryl Crow. That sucks. I've lost faith in this man. I think the book is just a story now, not what he really thinks or the way he really is. I am depressed and dissappointed, as someone who I used to think was inspirational is really just an egomaniac who gets a lot of press.It's not about the bike, but if it's about a life, at least make it a true life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am not a fan of cycling but I am a fan of humanity so when I was given this book I thought I'd give it a try. I always was truly inspired by Lance's story so I was quite suprised that the book truly changed my feelings about him. To start off with his ego which is as big as the Pyrnees he conquered, truly stands ot on almost every page. If I highlighted every instance where he tells you how great and wonderful he is my pen would have run out of ink halfway through. There is a point where his wife basically asks him what he is going to do with his life after he beat the cancer and has done nothing but golf everyday. She says &quot; I'm so bored so tell me so I Know if I should get a job or not&quot; He is quoted as thinking &quot;Normally nobody talks to me like that&quot; HUH? You mean nobody speaks their mind to him because he's a complete control freak. That's just one instance of many people tiptoing around him.This is just another story of some overprivileged athlete.The only thing different is that he survived cancer with oh by the way instances of favoritism by docters and Oakley strongarming their health insurance company to pick up his coverage. Hate to tell you but you or I would have died given the same prognosis.Oh if you think this review is garbage than tell me why Lance went Hollywood, dumped his wife and kids and now dates Cheryl Crow and Sandra Bullock. The same wife he pledged his love to over and over and over in this book. He's a piece of garbage and I hope he loses the next tour."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Quick arrival at a great price.

It Starts with Lance as a child in Texas developing a love for cycling and endurance sports, his career as a cyclist, finding out about his cancer, the treatment, the start of his family, and finally ends with the Tour. The section about Chemo was informative and inspiring. He focuses on beating the cancer just like one achieves any other goal. It really shows what the human spirit can overcome. It doesn't get too far into Biology of cancer, but that makes it more appealing to the average reader. I could really relate to the book being a runner because there's a similar mentality between cycling and running. You don't have to be a cancer survivor to be inspired by the book. almost anyone can take the \\"never give up\\" mentality and apply it to their own life. The title is a bit misleading because there is a lot of cycling talk. Overall though it's a real page turner and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The book was in great shape and there was No damage.

I loved the comeback. This is real hero stuff.Enjoy."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I thought it was an awsome book"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I disagree that this book is primarily about glorifying Lance Armstrong. Lance Armstrong describes himself in his younger days as a tragedy waiting to happen, an extraordinarily gifted young man who literally amused himself by playing with fire. He was full of bravado and, he admits, full of fear. He was long on attitude and raw talent, but short on introspection. He was a diamond and he knew it, with the kind of strength that cannot be taught. But looking back, he describes a very rough diamond, one that could not have reached anything like its potential without extravagant patience and help from others. He could have been such a sad case.As I read it, this is not a book about how important Lance Armstrong is because he succeeded in becoming a famous professional athlete. It is about how important it is to become you. How important you are if you are a parent. How important you are if you are a spouse. How important you are if you are a doctor, a nurse, an ultrasound tech. How important you are if you are a coach. How important you are if you are a loyal friend, or even a decent stranger. How important you are if you have a business that gives back and sticks to putting people first.This book teems with gratitude. It is possible to read this and internalize what Lance did for himself, without seeing him pointing to the difference between those who did everything for him and those who did nothing, or worse. If you miss this, you have missed one of the main points of the story. Although this book would be inspiring to anyone battling cancer, not many of those who read this will become another Lance Armstrong. Most will find themselves every day in the position of his mother, his doctors, his nurses, his mentors, his friends. Your everyday choices make such an enormous difference. Don't wait to get cancer to realize that.Another main point is that success isn't in bouncing out of bed every day with a go-getter attitude. It is not even about always knowing what your goals are-you have to search, sometimes. It is about slogging through when the attitude isn't there, about getting up after failure, about making negatives into opportunities-an attitude he learned from his mother, whom he rightly adores. He writes, \\"Some of it is not easy to tell or comfortable to hear... I've read that I flew up the hills and mountains of France. But you don't fly up a hill. You struggle slowly and painfully up a hill, and maybe, if you work very hard, you get to the top ahead of everybody else.\\" His book makes it very clear that he did not, could not, get up those hills alone.The unspoken prologue, of which we all are too aware, is that his marriage with Kristen did not last. Here is a man who was raised with no father he would give the title, whose mother was thrice divorced, from a country where 50% of us don't manage to stay married. He is an exceptionally independent man who had no track record of stable long-term relationships before marriage. Kristen is an independent, self-possessed woman. Their marriage had to be navigated through the waters of fame, the medical ordeal of becoming parents, and the rigors of a professional bicycling career. This was one time when Lance Armstrong didn't manage to beat the odds, even for the sake of his children. Until he or Kristen asks us to feel sorry for them, I would be embarrassed to raise the sentiment for their marriage. Both strike me as people who are far past needing the pity of strangers.Read the book. Your life is not about what you think about Lance Armstrong. It is about what you're going to do about you."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"By now all of Europe and the Americas know of Lance Armstrong, the Texan who beat cancer and went on to win the leader's jersey of the Tour de France three consecutive years in a row - something never accomplished by an American riding in the European peloton.In part one of his book Armstrong presents a biographical tour of his life from childhood, the relationships which shaped him and the natural abilities as an athlete. He is honest about himself, his character and subsequent flaws. He places a lot of emphasis on the deep and meaningful relationship with his mother.In part two the book deals with the discovery, diagnosis, battle and remission of cancer. Armstrong is once again very open and honest in sharing his emotional state with the reader. He writes in detail about the disease, the process of chemotherapy, and the many professionals, friends and family who supported him through very dark and uncertain times.The third and final part of Armstrong's book is actually too good to be true. In it he describes his recovery or remission, if you will, the fact that he also gets the girl and goes on to prove the entire cycling establishment wrong by winning the 1999 Tour de France as a member of the USPS team. Of course none of the pages are sugar coated. Lance describes in detail what it feels like to be dropped by sponsors, to struggle back into racing shape, and how to cycle arguably the most grueling race in the world.Anyone can clearly profit from reading the book and perhaps even receive an education in sheer courage and determination.Of of the finest quote from his book is this: &quot;If you ever get a second chance in life for something, you've got to go all the way.&quot; Lance Armstrong certainly did."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book chronicles the life of Lance Armstrong through a fatherless youth, a promising adolescence, a devastating disease, his 1st Tour win, and the birth of his son. It is well written and should be easily understandable even to someone that doesn't care at all about riding a bike. Probably the only criticism I have for this book (and this is true about most autobiographies) is that Lance seems to take particular joy in striking back at everyone he feels has wronged him in his life. So we are treated to stories of incompetent father figures, sponsors that gave him up for dead, and even revenge at high school classmates that dressed differently.Overall it's an incredible story and well worth reading. Despite the title of the book, I found that most of the story did revolve around Armstrong's cycling career (after all, who would read this book if Lance had survived cancer but given up cycling). It is an inspiring story that anyone can relate to, no matter what the hills are in your life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This may be an unpopular opinion but I felt a bit lukewarm on the book. Lance sounds very real and as a marathon athlete myself I truly admire his determination and drive as a champion and cancer survivor but the references he made to his father (ie: DNA donor, opportunist)and stepfather left a bad taste in my mouth. I am by no means implying that he needs to love or be involved with them however I don't believe someone who is at peace would belabor those references in the book. For what purpose? To hurt them? I felt stabs when I read them I can only imagine how they felt. Even IF they were the worst people on earth, I would much rather Lance focused on all the positive he has to offer and 2 wrongs do not make a right so why advertise bitterness? Tell your story and let the reader draw their own conclusion on some things. One would think looking death in the eye and beating it would bring about an epiphany and more perspective---perhaps forgiveness, or at the very least, peace? Lance seems to me as if he still needs work in letting go of his bitterness there, for his own sake. Here's to continued cancer free for him though...!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Unlike Lance Armstrong, I never have had cancer, and I had both of my parents, so in a certain sense I have been &quot;luckier&quot; than he was. And do I ever feel lucky that there is a guy like this in the world and that he chose to share this incredible story with us. For all of us who feel that life is giving us a &quot;bad deal&quot; or when we're just having a bad day, remembering this book and Lance's story is enough to keep me going. And yes, he got me back on my bike, too! Read this book, you will be richer for it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have never been as inspired as I was after finishing Lance's book. Lance shows us what it is like to thrive in life. I truly feel that his determination is what cured his cancer. He shows us that attitude is everything. Anyone who is serious about life and making the most of your life should read this book. Lance's story is PURE INSPIRATION."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Plain and simple, this book is inspiring! It's Not About the Bike : My Journey Back to Life not only makes you appreciate Lance Armstrong's personal achievement but can be an inspirational push forward for each of us. Thank you Lance for sharing the naked truth of your struggles. You have provided me with the inspiration needed to take the next step in my life!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I picked up this book and couldn't put it down until I finished. A great read, not about the bike, as the title states. It's about a strong, courageous and stubborn man who, although quite human and with many of the same weaknesses of the &quot;ordinary&quot; person, achieves that which only the the &quot;extraordinary&quot; person can achieve. Well written, this book does a great job in taking the reader through the changes in Armstrong's life, and the evolution of his attitude. A definite inspirational read!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It is now clear that most everything Armstrong says is a lie. Most of this book is based on lies and readers should consider a class action law suit against Armstrong, Jenkins and the publisher Berkley to get our money back for the book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I picked this up as I climbed late into bed last night. Two hours later, as dawn was creeping over the sky, I folded over the first page and slept for just 5 hours. I picked it up and continued reading until I folded over the second page and made a coffee and toast while the bath ran. Must confess I stayed in the bath until it was finished less than 10 hours (and three bath refills) after I had initially picked the book up.Its like listening to your best friend telling you all the things that have happened to them, with all the quirky and peppery details you would expect, whether amusing, moving, amazing or interesting to them. Its just that I dont have a best friend who has been through the kind of wringer Lance Armstrong has been through and come out the other side.I had a problem with the photos in the middle. When I got to them, I only looked at the ones that been covered by the story to that point. I then carefully read the book to the end and then went back to pour over the remaining photos to go with the rest of the story.What is the book to me. I guess if I had to put my finger on it, it is an example to me of how I could live life. Abosolutely not a trace of self pity or ego in this book.Diamond."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone wanting to read about successful people, what drives their passion and why they succeeded when others did not, this is a frank story of an athlete with fantastic credentials and terrific accomplishments but for me it was not a story of heroism. The book did not dampen my admiration of the feat accomplished, but it did surprise me, living with that much bitterness inside, it was as though his physical cancer was healed but the mental cancer was growing. Here was a man born with a natural physiological advantage, a hardworking mother and supportive mother, numerous people who gave him free equipment, money, support and indulged his personality, friends and family who stuck by him through every challenge in his life, opportunities to travel and see the world at a very young age, but still, he is angry with the world because everything did not come automatically to him. A privilege is anything that sets you apart from the rest of the world and he had countless privileges, but for him the only one that seemed to matter was money and since he was not born into it he hated the world. The endless bashing of anyone who denied him an indulgence he felt entitled to changed what could have been an insipiring story into a spite-fest. This continues after the book, since there is a review on the Amazon page by the co-author who unprofessionally indulges in even more public spite towards anyone who did not like her book. It seemed that humble beginnings did not inspire him towards sympathy for the truly underprivileged but simply gave him the desire to become privileged as fast as he can. Again anyone can desire to be privileged but not everyone has the means, he was born with the means, most people are not.Certain stories particularly bothered me - he was a multi-millionaire, earning millions even while lying in bed fighting cancer, his mother still could not afford to miss a couple of weeks of work; he expected corporate america to subsize his life but despised the people who make up corporate america, those very plano-ites he hated so much go into their offices day after day and the money they make allows a life different from theirs, he did not aspire to a tract house near a strip mall failed to grasp that those homeowners were funding his passions; a millionaire panicking about health insurance, what about the people without the millions or health insurance or a porsche to sell; he had support from millions of unknown people, his family and friends,his knowledge of the treatment that saved his life came from a stranger interested in him and lending him support, what about the lonely, poor people who sit alone in their homes with their cancer; his friend dies of cancer inside three months, hers is incurable, so was his curable all along; he asks for sympathy for his wife alone in France, nothing to do but explore, learn the language, furnish the new house, for many women working in offices to pay Lance his millions, and then rushing home to take care of their families, I think that would be their dreams come true.I do not know the Armstrongs and I do not know how accurately this represents them, this is just my review of a book and the story it told. FOr me this was just a story, a good one and one I enjoyed reading, it was human because it said that successful people were not necessarily great and wonderful human beings, they can be arrogant, spoiled, nasty, oblivious to the rest of the world and still succeed, sort of gives hope to the rest of us, doesn't it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"It's not about the bike... it's about the dope.\\" What a joke. I want the $$ back I paid for this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book offers so much brutal honesty that you will not be able to put it down (I finished it within 8 hours of starting it). I never much cared for Armstrong (and his over confidence) early on in his career, but I have to count myself among his many admirers now. His climb from cancer to to the top of the podium in Paris is remarkable, but that is a nearly insignificant portion of the story. If you are a fan of his work, though, you will granted some very candid and enlightening views into the maturing and development of a world class athlete.In a time when superstar athletes get away with murder and have no appreciation for their good fortune, Armstrong sings a very different song. You may or may not become a fan of cycling after you read this book, but you can't help being a fan of the man. You might think, as I did, that this book was simply a well spun public relations event, but when you read the intimate and graphic accounts of his chemo treatments and the various medical procedures that were performed you quickly realize that this was not done to put the guy on a pedestal. It was done to show the devastating, human side of cancer. And yet despite all of that the message that prevails is that we, even in our worst times, still need to have hope and that we have so much to be thankful for. You will never look at this man or the disease in the same way again."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"[T]his is one of the best books I have ever read. I could not set it down. I would like to thank Lance for writing it. It has inspired me to never give up and always keep trying. Congradulations Lance"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Once I began to read this book, I could not put it down. Everyone knows of Lance Armstrong's against-all-odds win at the Tour de France. Equally interesting is his description of how he grew into the man who accomplished that feat. His descriptions of growing up in a single parent household in Texas and his love of all things daring grab your attention and never let go. He is so truthful and open that you can imagine knowing him. His rise among the ranks of racing, the behind the scenes politics are unbelievable. His unflinching description of the discovery of cancer and how it invades, and changes life are unsparing. I finally understood what my own mother had tried to tell me about how chemo had altered her ability to eat when I read his explanation of his struggle. It is a story of cancer and of survival. Its greatest strength is it deals with facing what comes our way and learning to live with it. This is a marvelous wonder of a book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's not about the bike. It's about the dope, dope! It's well-known that Lance doped his way to the Tour de France podiums. But the book says he didn't dope. His co-author has finally accepted that he did dope, though she justifies it. (Check her column this week in the Washington Post.) I wonder whether she and Lance will revise this book? If you want an inspirational story, find it elsewhere."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was diagnosed with breast cancer at 33 and read this book in the hospital while recovering from my mastectomy. I found it incredibly inspirational and it encouraged me to take an active participation with my treatments and recovery. I was shocked to learn of his lying and bullying. We don't know what caused his cancer, but doping, could have potentially contributed. Cancer prevention is just as important as cancer cures. What he should have done was confessed when he was diagnosed and used himself as an example of the serious side effects of doping. He could have still started Livestrong. He may not have become as famous, but then he would have been a hero instead of a fraud."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is not a profound book, and it is not great literature. It's not even an objective account of Lance Armstrong's life and career. But what it is is more important than all that: the book is an inspiration with few peers. I have read it more than once, and each time I read the last page I close the cover, put the volume aside and think: I can do anything I set my mind to doing.As the title says, the story is not (only) about the bike, as its lessons of hope and perseverance are relevant to anyone facing adversity. But it is probably best enjoyed by those familiar with cycling, since it also offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of someone who does what he does better than anyone else.If there is anyone who doesn't already know the general outline of Lance Armstrong's history, he overcame a deadly battle with cancer to win the Tour de France, considered by some the most grueling and difficult endurance test in the world. And it's a story that is still current: Lance won the tour twice more after the book was published and will be vying for a record-tying fifth title this summer.As I wrote at the beginning, don't buy this book if you want a philosophical tome about overcoming a life-threatening illness, or a spin-free look at the complex life of an athlete who is probably still under appreciated in his home country and at once admired and resented in Europe, where he spends most of his time. But if you want an easy-to-read real-life story to inspire you and illustrate what is possible -- and what could be more important than that? -- this is the book you want."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Having never really been interested in cycling I bought this book since I wanted to know about Lance's fight with testicular cancer which killed my best friend three years ago in his early 30s. I was not just positively surprised but literally stunned and finished the book in two days.Lance's life from his upbringing to early achievements, his fight with cancer to becoming the King of the Tour de France are written honestly and interestingly. Reading the book took me along the entire emotional spectrum and I enjoyed every minute of it. With a less than 3% chance to survive I am convinced that contrary to the title, his survival is about the bike. It tought him to fight, to personalize the challenge and to give it everything he has got.Being German, I wanted Jan Ullrich to win the tour this year but having read what Lance has overcome and seeing him on the crucial day after falling due to spectator involvement, I now hope that he will win his sixth (and final?) Tour in 2004 to take his rightful place as the best rider who ever lived.I felt compelled to write this review since I read some of the other reviews. While I understand some of the comments about him being egoistic, that is part of him too. He is not claiming to be perfect, far from it, and I do not judge the man but simply recommend his book as an uplifting and interesting read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In light of the wall of evidence suggesting Lance's aggressive use of doping materials to gain his competitive advantage, this book's central thesis of winning through dedication does not account for the incredible investment in dishonesty and deception that made these wins and his spotless image possible. Don't buy this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Most biographies of athletes tend to focus on their achievements on the playing field, highlighting the records they've broken, the awards they've won, the heights they've reached. But Lance Armstrong's greatest achievements have occurred away from any race course, outside of any competition. He has dealt with and surmounted more challenges in his 29 years than many encounter in a lifetime. Oh, and he happens to be one of the greatest cyclists ever, but that comes in second to what he has achieved as a human being, because as he says, it's not about the bike.Armstrong's voice is clear and honest, yet humorous and poignant as well. He tells his story in a very straightforward manner, not mincing words as he describes the brashness and cockiness of his youth and the devastating, sometimes humiliating lows of his bout with testicular cancer. His current condition makes it hard to believe that Lance Armstrong could have ever been anything other than the healthy, consummate sportsman and gentleman that he is, but his story tells us otherwise, describing a cancer that left him with an extremely low probability for survival, and nearly ended his cycling career, not to mention his ability to have children. But Armstrong has overcome all of those obstacles. Not only did he recover from the cancer (which eventually spread to his lungs and brain), he returned to cycling. And not only did he return to cycling, he won the Tour de France, the most difficult sporting event on the planet. And he did this three years in a row.This book was recommended to me by my father, an avid cyclist and cycling fan. He read it not only because Armstrong casts such an imposing presence upon the world of cycling today, but because of what he has learned about life, both on and off of the bike. You don't have to be a cycling fan to appreciate this book--it is a very human story about a very human person."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance tells us he loves speed, and the story he has to tell (and what a story it is!) moves along fast, like Lance on a bike! Every cancer survivor has a story and his is particularly harrowing, but his telling of it it makes irresistible reading because of his personal insight and total absence of self pity. Cycling fans will levitate during his chapter on the Tour."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is a very detailed novel of Lance Armstrongs childhood, cancer survivorship and his life after cancer. I thought this book was excellent and it gives a new perspective on life. The way this book was written, it made me feel like I was really close to Lance Armstrong and I could almost relate to his feelings and emotions through the whole story, even though I have never had cancer. After I had read the book, I felt like I wanted to read more about Lances life. I would recomend this book for someone that likes true stories, or someone who would like a new perspective on life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"For all you who read biographies, this should be on the top of your list. And for you who don't read biographies, this should also be on the top of your list. I have not had cancer, and I am not a cyclist, but this book certainly kept me interested. The book goes through his life from when he was a kid, to when he had cancer, all the way to being a father. Lance Armstrong had gone through chemo for cancer, and one would think his career as an athlete would be over. But he struggled through training and fought hard. It all paid off when he passed the finish line at the Tour de France as the winner. This is a book of true inspiration, and for one man, a journey back to life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is an outstanding book, wonderfully moving and uplifting. Lance goes full tilt in everything and in this book he doesn't hold back - you live his journey and it is a harrowing, steadfast, intense, remarkable story. It is beautifully written -personal, honest, full of laughter and tears. I could not put it down and was astonished at his strength of spirit, intelligence, determination, and sheer chutzpah! He gives you such a sense of how to cope when the worst you can imagine happens and of the indomitability of the human spirit. I loved it - don't miss it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong was a very strong and intelligent guy. He was also a bicycle rider. He never gave up for anything, even though he got sick, and he stood to fight the disease. His cancer drove him crazy, and Lance beat it in his body. He was a cancer survivor, and he had a lot of energy to fight with it. Even though he hnew it was a strong disease, he wasn't scared of it, and he believed someday he will be healthy again, ride the bicycle, and do activities he did before."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I can say many good things about this book, and write a list of reasons why you must read it, but I'm pretty sure that it's better if you find your own reasons. You won't be sorry to invest your time in it, you'll just enjoy it. What I can tell you about my personal experience reading Lance's narration &quot;He's inspiration&quot;. He's a sample of human potential, how far a human being can go if he or she wants. Also he can teach you that waiting for things is not going to help you in life. He made me think not only what I'm doing for me as well as what I'm doing for others . Like him I want to change the world from my inside and I hope , I won't experience the same suffering that he did."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm a student from NYC Technical College. I study English as a second language and in this semester our teacher picked this book. &lt; It's not about the bike&gt; By: Lance Armstrong. I think she made a good choice for the class because some times we read together, we shared ideas, and we enjoyed reading this book. My opinion about Lance is that he is a perfect example for others with any obstacles in their lives. Lance fought against his cancer and emerged with victory. He won his dreams because he won the Tour de France. He had a second chance in his life and he was approaching this opportunity. I want to see him racing his bike again in a competition. Maybe I will read his second book if he writes another and follow his new life with his wife and his son. I encourage others to read this book based on real life and how he won the fight: &quot; Lance vs cancer &quot;."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I sat down to read this book in the afternoon and stood back up at 11pm. I plowed strait through it! As a cyclist, I found it a fascinating read, but as a person his message regarding life and the lessons that cancer and &quot;growing up&quot; taught him were very valuable. A must have!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you are expecting to find the answers to life's questions, you might be disappointed. If you want a damn good read, to be inspired by bravery and a story of personal growth, better understand professional cycling and cyclists and not put the book down for a day or two, you'll enjoy this very much as I did."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"My husband read this book out loud to me in a day and a half. Once he started, I wouldn't let him stop reading. I cannot think of a better book to encourage teenagers to read. There is a true American Hero alive and well today - his name is Lance Armstrong. He embodies everything good about the human spirit, and he wrote a great book, too!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I love a good inspirational story, and this is among the best. It takes a while to build sympathy for Armstrong, however, as he comes across with a brash, in-your-face storytelling style at first; it took me a while to warm to it. His account of learning he has cancer and the brutal treatment is dramatic and sobering, and you share in his pain. More importantly, you share in his strength and you are convinced he would return to cycling despite his protestations. Like Greg LeMond, who survived a hunting accident and went on to win the Tour de France, Armstrong's story is moving and the satisfaction is ultimate when he takes the &quot;maillot jaune&quot; (the leader's jersey in the Tour) for good. Probably the best athlete autobiography I've ever read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As someone dealing with a cancer diagnosis myself, my motivation in reading this book is obvious. I wasn't disappointed. Lance, as a cancer survivor, delivers a story which inspires both admiration and emulation.From his first descriptions of his tenacious and spirited mother to the account of the birth of his son Luke, Armstrong provides the requisite insight into the aspects of his character which drove him to become one of the world's most impressive and honorable athletes. Central to the climactic winning of the 1999 Tour de France (and the followup encore of 2000) is his battle with testicular cancer, his recovery, the loss and eventual recovery of love of his sport, his indefatigable will to win, and the amazing loyalty of his friends and family.His survival story, like his early wins of the Tour de France, is as much about the team surrounding him as the intensity of his own personal efforts.If there is anything about the book which bothered me at all, it was the nagging curiosity about the role of his co-writer, Sally Jenkins. When I read autobiography, I assume the imagery, metaphors, plot development, and narrative structure come directly from the author, not the co-author or ghost writer. I couldn't help but wonder how much of what I was reading was the product of Sally Jenkin's creativity and how much was owing directly to Lance.But whatever the answer to that question might be, this book remains one of the best choices available for anyone whose life has been touched by cancer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"How would you like to be stuck in a hospital bed, vomiting for three months? Lace Armstrong led a normal life as a kid. He never knew his real birth father, he just knew his name. His mother remarried twice, becoming single in the end. Her first husband, was mean to Lance for the worst reasons. If Lance left a sock hanging out of his drawer, he would meet the paddle. From elementry to middle school Lance was not athletic. He never excelled in any of the sports that involve a ball. In high school he finnally discovered swimming. He wasn't very good, but he hired a coach that made him the best in the state. There was a running race at school. His Mom gave him a silver dollar for good luck, and told him he was racing the clock, not the people. Lance won first place in that. There was a bike shop on his block, where he got his first bike. Amazingly, he was a natural. When other kids challenged him for a race, he wouldn't just beat them, he would whoop them. Later on, he decided to enter a triathlon. He won against people in their 30's, he was in high school. Lance entered in Triathlons all around the state, he was soon the best........After he was diagnosed with cancer, he went to three hospitals. He decided to take kemo at the Valpo University Hospital in Indiana. They were the only people who changed the operation so he could get back on the bike. The cancer had spread from his lungs to his brain. First they preformed surgery on his brain, removing the non-spreading tumors. Then through a period of 3 months he under-went massive kemo. When it was over he married a woman named Kristen (Kik). After that he proceeded to France where he entered in a bike race to make a come-back. Very soon he dropped out of the race not sure if he really wanted to cycle for the rest of his life. After lots of encouragement, and training, he finnaly entered in the Tour de France. He obviously won with flying colors. Not soon after, Kik was pregnant with their first child Luke. After he was born, Lance entered in yet another Tour de France, winning again. He now decided to train for the olympics. Unfortunately, while training he broke his neck. While it was healing he still trained, but he wasn't strong enough to win the Olympics...he took home the bronze. This was an educational, entertaining, and inspiring book to read, and I would reccomend it to anyone.This book had a lot of action in it. Lance was training so intensly, that sometimes it was more action filled to read about him training than it was to read about him in the race. During his second Tour de France there was a man that called himself \\"Pirate\\" that was allways hot on Lance's tail. On one race to the finish line (for a stage) Lance said that he would let him beat him, but the man thought he said something else. They ended up sprinting to the finish, each insulting the other horably. When Lance was a young rider, he wasn't very polite. During races, you would read about him cussing people out then zipping past him. Actually, that happened in all of his young races.This book also made me worry a lot. I worried about if Lance would make it, or if he'd die. One time during the Tour de France, a spectator stepped out, Lance barely missed him almost costing him a few seconds. Or when Lance broke his neck, not many people live after breaking their neck.This book was also fun to read. As I said before Lance did a lot of cussing before he had cancer. Like in the Tour of the Mediteranean, Lance cussed out a greatly known Italian biker Moreno Argentin. It was fun to read about the times when the doctor came in to say \\"Our last ex-ray shows there is no more cancer left in your body.\\" Or when Lance finnaly got back on his bike after surbviving cancer. He went through a trama after cancer, and he wanted to retire, but when he went on a bike ride one day and realized that he loved biking it was very cool.I enjoyed this book so much, it was funny, I learned things from it, and it made me want to do things I never thought I would or could do.A.Lindemann"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I just finished reading the book as the Tour de France entered its final stages this week and Lance Armstrong is pursuing his fifth consecutive victory. Needless to say, I have never been a cycling fan until now. I have never cared much about the examples celebrity athletes provide until now. And I am not one to put athletes on a pedestal...until now. More than his words or his cycling accomplishments, his story of surviving cancer would set anyone apart and make them worthy of such attention.Lance Armstrong, through Sally Jenkins, successfully brings together the best in autobiographical writing, motivational writing, insights into the world of competitive cycling, and gives the reader much to think about in the end.I have read a few books on the power of positive thinking and healing to know that Lance has put it all together here. Thanks Lance and Sally."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was diagnosed with prostate cancer at the age of 49. My father died of cancer at the age of 52. I was beyond stunned or numb. Catatonic would have been a relief. An attending Doctor and bicycling enthusiast, recommended this book to me at the time of my greatest fears and doubts. As I read what this other Texan went through when dealing with a most undesireable period of his life, I found myself getting stronger and more determined to find a way to beat this temporary diversion. Lance Armstrong's epiphany moment with the doctors in Bloomington Indiana, has become the touchstone for everything I now encounter. My Doctor friend echoed this same theory from the book: Anyone, regardless of their position, education or authority, who is not positively contributing to your overall success; fire em'! Life is about what you determine to make it, and what you can make it for others. We don't have time to waste on pithy, trivial \\"what if's\\" or \\"maybes\\" or \\"but I might fail\\". We may not have control over everything that happens to us in our lives, but we don't have to simply lay down and take it either!I am now 51 years old and recovering quite well from my cancer experience. I now believe that a cancer diagnosis is not a death sentence, but negative or limited thinking can be. Lance Armstrong has my most profound gratitude for having the guts to speak his mind on a subject few people even want to acknowledge; the value of every day in this life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When Lance Armstrong was an up and coming rider, I always thought he had such a cocky attitude (some is good, too much is bad). But this book puts alot ot that in perspective and helps me to understand how a man can overcome adversity, change his life, succeed when no one thinks he can, and become a change person. Lance Armstrong is not a saint, and some of the critiscsms from earlier reviews are unnecessary, but neither are many of us and that's why the book is so good."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong certainly is an inspiration to us all I found this book very profound. Lance Armstrong shows us his journey. He deals with his entire life like a champion. He shows his human side, that he is not always perfect, and that things are not always easy. The one thing he show us the best is that he never gives up no matter how much he may want to. He takes each day as it comes and does his best not to get ahead of himself.Another book I really enjoyed is &quot;Working on Yourself Doesn't Work&quot; by Ariel &amp; Shya Kane It is about living in the moment and I found it simply delightful."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance's story is a great inspiration. The story is more about surviving cancer than biking. Some of the detail on cancer treatment may be a little much for some people. But this is one of those books that makes you stop and think how fortunate you are and inspires you to think about those less fortunate. I just wish he had included contact information for his foundation."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you can read this book without becoming caught up in Armstrong's struggle and inspiration, you're a pretty tough nut--if I can use that expression in this context. Huge kudos to Sally Jenkins for telling Lance's story without diluting any of his true voice and character. The book is extremely well-written and riveting from the first words. Whether you are an avid cycling fan or not, this a story of human drama that transcends the pro sport aspect and becomes simply a tale told beautifully--no holds barred."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Great book. Of course, I am a huge fan of Bicycle Road Racing, and Lance in general, so I am hugely biased. It is an excellent book, and well written. Even the non-cyclist can appreciate the story. It is tremendously uplifting and positive."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I couldn't put this book down after I started reading it. I applaud Lance's mother for the courage she displayed from the beginning. I can see why Lance had the ability to overcome the cancer, because his mother raised him to be a winner. For a 17 year old girl to become the mom to a champion doesn't just happen! Mom's a stud! I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to believe in miracles!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is the most enjoyable I ever read because it's about a famous biker and I never knew about him until I read it. He is a strong guy and when he was a boy he was adventurous with his training. And he is fighting cancer.So it's a very interesting story. You must read this book and you will learn more about the winner of the Tour de France."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book.This book was interesting because Lance's life was like a race. He won many races When he was young, but the enemy, which is Cancer changed his life when he started fighting against it.At that time,the time his life was slower and also his thought towards life changed.Lance saw life in a different way after he won the race against Cancer.Finally he devoted himself to his community.The foundation&quot;Ride for the Roses&quot; is a special foundation to help people with Cancer.I think Lance followed one of the ten commandments&quot; Love your neighbor like you love yourself.&quot;I recommend this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I finished Lance's book &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot;. Lance has to tell us two sides of his life. One is the sports-man and another is the fighter-man. As cancer survivor he had to fight that illness, while he tries to race again. This illness affected him and he made changes in his life. But after he fought it, he turned into a man with a great family. -Life is beautiful, specialty when you have this things: parents, a fiance and children- you became part of human life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When I started to read this book.I didn't believe a person who had brain surgery recovered like Lance Armstrong,but after I read this book,I'm convinced this will happen.I like his relationship with his mother.I think all we do with love can be positive like Lance's mother did.She gives courage and she never leave him alone,when he needs her support,she suffered but she never showed him.In my opinion the cancer was devasting to Lance but the cancer changed his life too.Also I like what Lance does to help other people who suffer like he suffered.I think he gives hope and good life lessons."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book can show you how a disease can change somebody's life, in this case Lance Armstrong's. You can see how he changed from a non-sweet and non-caring person to a sweet, caring and kind person. He changed his view of life, the way of looking at people around him, and the way that he coped with the chemo. You can see his passion for cycling and how he struggled with it after the chemo. You will laugh, cry and you will live and feel with him every single memory that he is giving you. He is a symbol that inspires COURAGE to keep going and not to quit. This is Lance Armstrong, the man who did consider himself as a &quot;Wave&quot; before, but now he considers himself as a &quot;part of the ocean&quot;(&quot;We are no waves, we are part of the ocean&quot; it is a aphorism form the book &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;. It touched me a lot because it means that we are not by ourselves or alone in this life. We are part of the humanity that during our lives we need someone beside us)."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I loved this book and learned some about how terrible cancer is, how hard bicycling is, and how to create his miracle baby, Luke with IVF. It was an inspiring book for me. Especially \\"Carpe diem\\"(p.174), \\"Make every obstacle an opportunity.\\" and \\"I don't check my mother at the door.\\"(p.64) which I will remember as long as I can. And did you see him on TV? He looks healthier, Doesn't he?. Toast Lance!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Us cyclists often spend our free time out riding, but spend a few hours going through Lance's book and you'll be well inspired. Excellent reading"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'll start by noting that I am not a cyclist. That said, I highly recommend Armstrong and Jenkins work. They paint a gripping picture of Armstrong's battle with cancer and chemo while giving the reader great insight into the doubts and fears he had during that time. They also show the critical role his medical team, mother, &quot;stud&quot; wife, and friends played in his recovery. I was captivated by his story and made to truly empathize with his plight as I read. And I'll cheer for him now as he chases a third Tour de France title. I also found the text on his post-cancer training regime to be extremely informative and it convinced this reader, for one, that he is winning the right way. Perhaps the French press ought to give this book a read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Speaking as the parent of a young man fighting cancer, this book is a powerful weapon that Lance has given those who face cancer. He does not sugercoat the rigors of treatment, nor recovery. He tells how he overcame the same obstacles facing every cancer survivor. His words shout &quot;hope&quot;. Our culture is still stuck in the belief that a diagnosis of cancer means death, or at the least, permanent disability. But Lance Armstrong shakes off that belief and tells how he climbs back on his bike and back into his life. The gift of hope that he provides with his story is well worth the price of the book for anyone fighting to climb out of the black hole of cancer treatment."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I value Lance Armstrong's story, he is a driven and talented athlete who has had to battle through a life threatening illness. The story is incredible but you wish that Lance wouldn't be so in love with his own story!Humility is the virtue that Lance needs most. Maybe that could be his next focus. I'm sure if he put his mind to it, he could tone down his ego. He accomplishes every thing he puts his mind too..... maybe improve his writing as well...."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I agree with some of the reviewers here that Armstrong comes across as very headstrong at times, and is not exactly modest about his achievements. But I'm sure that's exactly the reason why he came back from cancer to win seven Tours De France. If nothing else, this autobiography demonstrates the incredible self-belief, confidence, and downright pig-headedness that are necessary to succeed as an elite athlete.There are basically three parts to the book: the first and third dealing with cycling, and the second a more personal study of his cancer and his then-wife Kik's attempts to conceive via IVF.The most interesting parts of the cycling sections are the discussion of tactics and the hierarchical structure of each team. Every person in team cycling has a specific role, and Armstrong goes into some detail describing the various strategies that each team, and each individual within the team, employs. Armstrong portrays himself as someone who started riding purely out of anger and boredom, and it is only gradually that he develops the experience, focus, and discipline to become a truly great rider, culminating in his Tour de France wins. Another interesting aspect is the almost gentlemanly traditions of the European classics, such as not winning too many stages yourself, allowing other riders to win their home Stage, or not attacking when the leader is making a \\"pit stop\\".The second part of the book deals with his cancer, treatment and recovery. And here, we see Armstrong's bull-headedness work against him; the symptoms of testicular cancer with brain/lung mets were there for a while, but it was only when his swollen testicles affected his riding that he admitted something was wrong. His descriptions of the side-effects of chemo, the helpless frustration of remission, and his aborted first attempt at a comeback are very affecting . Another eye-opening part of the book deals with he and his then-wife Kik's attempts to conceive via IVF; it's certainly not a simple process, and what Kik goes through in the way of injections and examinations is quite disturbing. To be honest, I think it's pretty poor that Lance (by now back cycling) couldn't be around more to support her, given her support for him during his remission.Armstrong is certainly no shrinking violet, and you can call his enormous self-confidence and belief \\"arrogance\\" if you want. But \`Not About The Bike' puts a human face on Armstrong's machine-like determination, and presents quite a well-rounded picture of the man. He's certainly not perfect, but he is interesting, and that's all that counts."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I picked this book up 9 years after the copyright date. Worth the read? Absolutely. Not because it is a well-written book; it is not particularly. Not because Armstrong's attitudes and resentments make for a warm and fuzzy story; they are, though, the bedrock of his success. The book will give you perspective about what can happen in the decade plus beyond a serious cancer diagnosis. Even if you are not a big cyclist fan, you can follow the 2009 Tour De France carrying with you with at least one version of the back story. It makes it infinitely more interesting.I particularly recommend this book for those who love someone at any stage of cancer diagnosis, treatment, or survivorship. Armstrong's response to cancer are the words of every man's and every woman's journey through this disease. Sometimes verbatim. I have just seen an extremely close friend through a cancer diagnosis and treatment and, like most of us, know far too many people who are coping with this disease. I have underlined every phrase spoken in the book that my friend has also spoken. My book is heavily underlined. Armstrong may have more lung capacity, but their drive to kick cancer is equal. This is an extremely important message to those facing cancer and for those who love them."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After finishing this book, I sure had mixed emotions about this famous cyclist who has won the Tour de France seven times. This autobiography finishes with him winning his first Tour. A decent chunk of the book deals with his bout with cancer.In a nutshell, I came away from this book with an even-greater appreciation of the guts, dedication and talent - and honesty (he tells us exactly how he feels about things) of this famous athlete. I also came away with a lower opinion of him as a personality. He comes across as an immature, hot-tempered, selfish mama's boy.He seems to be a guy with plenty of friends and plenty of enemies, which is one reason he's such an interesting guy.....and the book is a good read. Props to him for making a very readable book. This was hard to put down, although parts of his descriptions of the chemotherapy treatments and such are horrifying and will haunt me for years.I still don't quite know what to think of Armstrong. He's a very complex man. Hopefully, one day he'll discover there's a He, not just a he (as in himself). Lance appears to be the kind of guy you love one minute, hate the next. A bunch of his ex-girlfriends can attest to that!One thing: that kind of guy makes for a fun read, so this book is highly-recommended, and not just for cycling fans. I'm not; I just like good autobiographies."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The book begins: \\"I want to die at a hundred years old with an American flag on my back and the star of Texas on my helmet, after screaming down an Alpine descent on a bicycle at 75 miles per hour.\\" When I first read those words, I found the book impossible to put down.I purchased my first copy ofIt's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Liferight here four days after it was released in the spring of 2000, and read it immediately. I read many chapters of it to my youngest son over the following years, and we discussed its message even in his early grade school years. Lance Armstrong became a personal hero to him, as he has been to me.Have given this book as a gift, sometimes in itspaperback formand other times as a hardbound, and only once have I given it to a fellow cyclist -- it's often been to friends who have gone through a battle with cancer, either themselves or with someone close to them. And now I see that it's available here in aKindle Edition, so I'm sure that I'll be giving it again... and if I ever get my own Kindle, it's going to be the first book that I get in that media.I'm a cyclist of the mountain/trail bike variety, but as the title of the book says, \\"It's Not About the Bike.\\" I've never had cancer, but have had numerous close family members and friends who have been victims of this most dreaded disease, including my mother and my oldest son's mother. This is perhaps why I find Lance's story so inspirational. It's more than a story of his amazing athletic achievements and cancer recovery, this is a true story about the triumph of the inner self.Since the book was originally published, 'Maillot Jaune' (Lance's nickname in French for 'Yellow Jersey') has gone on to break so many cycling records. In his final tour before retirement in 2005, he crossed the finishing line on the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es on July 24th to win his 7th consecutive Tour de France title. Since his retirement, he has focused his efforts on the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which provides support for people affected by cancer. And yes, I'm one of those who wears a yellowLIVESTRONG wristbandon a daily basis in support of his efforts.Lance has also written a moving and insightful follow-up to this book,Every Second Countswhich offers another facet to this inspirational athlete who is both motivated and motivating. And now we hear that Lance Armstrong, at age 37, will be making his pro-cycling comeback, and he's already in training, and put in 20-24 hours a week on the bike throughout October. He's pledged to continue with his national call to action on cancer prevention and survivorship program.If you're looking for a book about cycling, this isn't it. Read the title and that will tell you that. I found his message of optimism to be quite stirring, and hope that you will as well."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Whether or not you are a fan of Lance Armstrong, this book is incredibly helpful. Helpful for getting a grip on the implication of testicular cancer diagnosis and treatment. Also helpful for tackling the mental battle that comes with this disease. It is full of hope, and an important read for those diagnosed with Testicular cancer,and their significant others."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Don't get me wrong, this book is GREAT. But reading it in 2008 will give you the feeling the end is missing in this book. No Sheryl Crow and no seven tour victories. This book covers Lance's dealings with cancer and his bike up until his second tour victory.What I really admire about this book is the way it has been written. No subjects are pushed to the back and the man Armstrong really comes forward. His battle with testicular cancer has been known throughout the world, but when you read about it in great detail you can actually grasp his battle for the first time.This book can be a great gift. Ever catch a person whining about something trivial? Then make him humble by reading this book."}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],q={key:0},x={key:1};function R(n,e,s,u,r,i){const y=f("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",L,[(t(!0),a(b,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),w(y,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",x,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",q,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const W=c(S,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-d7b3740f"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/39.md","filePath":"people/39.md"}'),C={name:"people/39.md"},j=Object.assign(C,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{E as __pageData,j as default};
