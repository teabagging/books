Even those requiring large print or some other specialty can find it to their liking alongside other works.However, the story itself is excellent. \\"Family\\" is notable in anticipating much of later Tolstoy with its female protagonist and focus on women's and other domestic issues. It is on one level a comedy of manners showing how upper class courtship worked in mid-nineteenth century Russia. The characterization is so strong and the story so well-told that it would be engaging even on this level, but there is far more. Most immediately and perhaps importantly, it vividly portrays universal emotions familiar to anyone who has fallen in love, dramatizing everything from initial euphoric excitement to last-minute doubt. However, it quickly turns darker, showing the disappointment and bitterness that often sadly result. This is all the more remarkable in being shown through a woman by a male writer - distinctly unusual then and still noteworthy. Tolstoy's knowledge of and sensitivity to women and their concerns is truly incredible; he pulls off the difficult narrative voice with as much verisimilitude as in more famous works. Some may find the ending too pat, and it is certainly not politically correct by our standards, even seeming to fall back on Victorian stereotypes about women's proper role. However, the important thing to pick up on is the glorification of traditional Russian family life, specifically its redemptive power. Tolstoy eventually had almost the opposite view, and it is very interesting to see how well and convincingly he argued for this early in his career.Anyone interested in Tolstoy should read this, whether here or elsewhere."},{"Title":"Wireless Java for Symbian Devices","review":"The credentials of the lead author are top notch.

One act of kindness begets another and soon Paulus has unknowingly started a family and a story of a family home to reach through the centuries.

She disposes of the well-travelled lie that Picasso admitted that his work was all a blague, a trick played on the public. In fact, as she shows, the alleged conversation was drawn from Il Libro Nero, a collection of fictitious interviews written by Giovanni Papini.Utley shows how \`a strategy elaborated at the highest levels of the American government' presented the art of the New York School as a living manifestation of democracy as opposed to communism. The US state promoted Abstract Expressionism, to make New York supersede Paris as the capital of Western art. It promoted the notion of the Nietzschean artist, the individualistic, introspective genius in his ivory tower, free from all social and political concerns, casting Picasso as the \`anti-artist', compromised because committed.Yet this is a deeply anti-communist account of a good communist. Utley sneers at what she calls the communists' \`illusory goal of bridging the gap between art and the people', and at \`the inadequacies of the artistic policies and aspirations of the French Communist party'. It is clearly beyond the comprehension of the author, an American academic based at New York University, that Picasso was a loyal and active Party member for the rest of his long life - which says more about the author's limits than the subject's!Her stale caricature of \`repressive Party' and \`servile member' fails completely to explain how people of the calibre of Picasso and his friends Paul Robeson, Pablo Neruda, Louis Aragon and Paul Eluard could be Party members. Were they all dupes? Unlike, say, an American academic, who cannot imagine how anyone cannot trust the US state?"},{"Title":"Pablo Picasso: The Communist Years","review":"As a working politician over the past sixty years in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, I experienced first-hand the sinister and underhanded role of Communists as putative allies and ultimate enemies. From the American Student Union in the 30's (&quot;The Yanks are not Coming!) to the subversion of the McGovern campaign in 1972, American Communists, as disciplined and treacherous as their counterparts in Russia, sought violent Revolution as their doctrinaire goal under cover of a liberal &quot;alliance&quot; both here and more importantly in the unstable Fourth Republic. Gertje Utley's book, &quot;Picasso, The Communist Years&quot; shows bit by closely honed and researched bit, how Picasso lent his name and prestige to this debilitating process in France. With neither the background nor the political intellect to comprehend the logical consequences of his support for a repressive and hypocritical dictatorship, Picasso became the willing dupe of his Communist masters draining support for liberal political leaders and causes in France and elsewhere during the critical years of Communist dominance over the peoples of Eastern Europe. Utley connects Picasso's art and personality during this period with political views which were naive and egotistical in their origin and mischievous in their application. It is difficult to think of a greater challenge to an art historian than to attempt to describe the aberrational behavior of a great artist and the tangential effect of that behavior on his or her art. Utley's book is a readable and fascinating description of the macabre process by which Picasso was drawn into a realpolitik which aimed to destroy the very basis of his own artistic liberty."},{"Title":"The Breaking Point","review":"It is obvious that Ms. Billings' passion is for the family union and loyal friendship. Applause to her poignant story of the Brickman family, their struggles that filter from one generation to another, and their determination to overcome misgivings and misunderstandings from previous and present mistakes -- true-to-life issues so often many of us take for granted, but need to examine within ourselves and those we love. The reader is drawn right into the family, laughing at their shannigans, annoyed with some of their decisions or rooting them on. The Brickmans are certainly people we can relate within our own household or people we know. Most importantly spiritual enlightenment played an important role in their lives no matter how hard they tried to handle matters on their own. Definitely an inspirational read."},{"Title":"Great High Priest","review":"This book bridges the gap between Judaism and Christianity and refutes alot of preconceived ideas that Hellenistic Platonic ideas embellished what began as a simple Jewish Messianic movement. Barker claims that the rituals of the Orthodox Church go back to a more ancient form of Judaism based on the First Temple which was suppressed in the 7th century BC by King Josiah and later Ezra who rewrote the Old Testament which we now have. However, the beliefs of this form of First Temple Judaism were still prevalent in Jesus' day and were revered by groups such as the community responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Jewish Apocryphal literature. After 70AD this form of Judaism survived in Christianity.Some of these ideas are found sporadically in the Old Testament ie Ezekiel's vision of the Chariot Throne, Isaiah's visions in the Holy of Holies, and the seventh chapter of Daniel's &quot;Son of Man&quot;. However, the emphasis on the Melchizedek Priesthood, Enoch, and Heavenly ascents which are found in the New Testament, especially Hebrews and Revelation, are all but absent in the Old Testament.First Temple Judaism stressed the idea that certain mortals achieved a divine status and ascended to Heaven while they were still alive, that Yahweh, the Lord of Israel was the Son of God and that Wisdom was his mother. The emphasis and revered status of Wisdom was replaced by the Law by Jewish reformers returning from Babylon.Jesus saw himself as the incarnation of the Lord of Israel, the preexistant Son of God. The vision he had of Heaven opening during his baptism, of the entire world when he was in the wilderness, and his transfiguration were all part of a belief system which can only be found in the New Testament and Jewish apocryphal literature, particularly the books of Enoch, The Ascension of Isaiah, and the Odes of Solomon.Barker defends Philo's premise that Plato was more influenced by Judaism than the other way around. Pythagorus, who influenced Plato, received his religious ideas in Palestine and Syria during the time of Ezekiel and before the reform of Judaism.The Eucharist, which is the most important sacrament beside baptism, is the continuation of the Day of Atonement ritual in which Jesus took the roles of the High Priest as well as the sacrifice. Orthodox churches still perform the ritual in a separate area of the church which corresponds to the Holy of Holies in the First Temple which represents Heaven on Earth.Many of the rituals of the primitive church to include the liturgy, signing with the cross, praying toward the east, were passed down from Jesus and the disciples in secret and were not committed to writing because the deeper meanings of these rituals could only be understood by a few. Some of the earliest fathers attested to this to include, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Ignatius of Antioch, and Basil of Caesarea.The Orthodox liturgy is a reenactment of the events portrayed in the book of Ezekiel and Revelation. The deeper meanings of these two books can only be understood as such and not turned into ridiculous modern day science fiction.Barker spends alot of time discussing the significance of the ancient Holy of Holies which contained the ark and the throne of the Lord and how ancient kings, beginning with Solomon were anointed with divine status there and how prophets received revelations there. The figure of Wisdom, the feminine aspect of God the Father, was described in The Gospel of the Hebrews as Jesus' mother, not unlike Philo writing about Wisdom giving birth to the Logos. The Trinity doctrine and the veneration of Mary were not Hellenistic additions to Christianity but sprang from the very Judaism which Jesus and his followers belonged to which was suppressed and all but destroyed by both Christians and Jews later on.I'm glad I ordered the paperback version of this book when I did. It should definitely be brought back."},{"Title":"Great High Priest","review":"Margaret Barker taps into the Temple ceremonies of Israel and the Early Christian Church to show a pattern of supression among the leaders in both.

Most humbly we implore You, Almighty God, bid these offerings to be brought by the hands of Your Holy Angel to Your sublime altar, before the face of Your Divine Majesty.\\"The book explains that what the priest does during the Mass cames from what the ancient high priests of the first Temple did when in the Holy of the Holies.More: this amazing book also gives a key to better understand the first Christian literature: many themes that no other books succeeded to explain now are very clear."},{"Title":"When You Least Expect It: What Not to Say to a Single Woman in the 21st Century","review":"it was only a few hours ago that i even laid eyes on this book for the first time. shortly after i leafed through it, i found myself in a room of several other single girls almost to tears in giggles. in between fits of laughter, exclaimations of \\"that's totally happened to me,\\" we read aloud the pages of this witty and SO true-to-life book.

Many of the puzzles have more than one solution, and when this is the case, the author uses asterisks and footnotes listing possible alternative solutions.I suppose this book could have been better if there were brief discussions of the solutions, but in all fairness to the author, that's not a realistic expecation for a chess puzzle book -- especially for a book with 200 puzzles (if you like that type of didactic commentary, read chess manuals with plenty of examples).modified Descriptive (English) notation.

While Hoover is credited as the author, some sources say that the book was ghost-written by Agent Fern Stukenbroeker, an FBI researcher on subversive groups employed in the Crime Records Division. While the organization and function of most subversive movements, Left and Right, are patterned after techniques honed to a sharp edge in the Soviet Union, the information in this book applies to more than merely Communism. Many of these same techniques were/are used yet today by the CIA/FBI/NSA, as well as radical progressive and ultra-conservative organizations in domestic and international disinformation and subversion campaigns.Consider this book a primer into an education in the operation/administration of covert operations, concerning all facets of the political spectrum, and an insight into how attempts are made daily through the media to influence your thoughts and actions - in ways you would never expect, or otherwise recognize."},{"Title":"Masters of Deceit","review":"I finally decided to read this book in light of current political events, particularly the fact that many anti-war protests are organized and funded by communist/marxist groups.I was surprised by the relevance of this book given the nearly sixty years since the first printing. Had I read this in 1995, I might have been more inclined to pass it off as a ranting voice from the distant past, but the current love affair with Che Guevara in particular and marxist ideas in general at US colleges proves several of Hoover's main points.However, Hoover spends more time exploring/explaining the tactics used by communists as they attempt to make socialism acceptable to Americans. He highlights the constant drone by the socialists/communists on the \\"evils\\" of capitalism. Moreover, Hoover points to the loss of personal responsibility and accountability as fundamental to accepting an ever more powerful central government that dictates and controls more of our daily lives.Communists speak of \\"freedom from...\\" but never \\"freedom to...\\", and this is one of the most dehumanising elements in socialist societies.The fact that communism/marxism is taught today at colleges and universities as a benign, more enlightened form of government without any reference to the horrors they brought on humanity should serve as a warning on just how masterly deceived many Americans have become."},{"Title":"Masters of Deceit","review":"John Edgar Hoover (1895-1972) was, of course, the first Director of the FBI, appointed in 1924.

She suggests that you start by getting to know yourself again in a retirement perspective. From there you can branch out to altruistic opportunities, traveling, spiritual growth, hobbies, and passions. She ends the book with a section on dealing with practical matters of retirement such as paying for it and decluttering your life. Viewing retirement not as an end of your working years but the birth of another stage of your life including new opportunities makes Looking Forward a recommended read."},{"Title":"Looking Forward: An Optimist's Guide to Retirement","review":"This book is terrific. It offers excellent advice to new retirees or those thinking of retiring. Ellen Freudenheim has written a book that goes far beyond the standard ABC's of retirement. The author assumes that you want a 'real' life after you leave your primary job. Each section of the book offers good advice to those who want more. I loved the \\"Anchor Activities\\" section Growing, Doing and Just Being. Readers are encouraged to continue growing spiritually, to do what they have wanted to do, and to continue being who they are, but much more so. Sound advice is given concerning the retirees awareness of his or her new financial situation; and how to move on mentally and physically.As one who has recently retired, I read this book from beginning to end and found information that I have already begun to use. Freudenheim provides little windows into the lives of some people who have retired and are happy with their decision to do so. Some of those profiled continued doing more of what they enjoy, some made changes so drastic it boggles the mind. Might I suggest that this book is not just for those thinking of retirement? It will be useful to those who wonder with a fair amount of trepidation what they would do if they did retire.This book has the right title, Looking Forward: An Optimist's Guide to Retirement. The key words here are \\"Looking Forward\\".Vannie(~.~)Work & Family @ BellaOnline.comhttp://www.bellaonline.com/Site/workandfamily"},{"Title":"Looking Forward: An Optimist's Guide to Retirement","review":"Thinking about retiring in the near future? Ellen Freudenheim has written the book for you - LOOKING FORWARD An Optimist's Guide to Retirement. Now you might have attended a retirement seminar or two, and so have I, but in my opinion this book is the best resource I've found in a while. I have been researching the subject because at age 62 I am in the \`Retirement Zone' as Freudenheim refers to it. She covers all the areas I have been exploring for retirement activity such as travel, theater, gardening and athletics, and volunteer work, as well as continuing to do what you are doing, i.e. work.If you want to continue to work, you might consider changing careers as my husband did. After retiring from AT&T; (he was downsized or \\"rightsized\\" as they called it in the corporate world in the 1980s), he he took his \\"buyout\\" money and attended graduate school where he obtained a degree in Employee Relations Counseling which he did professionally for 10 years before he was forced out of the market by the competition (he filed an EEO complaint because he suspected age, race and/or sex discrimination were issues and was proved correct). After the government disbanded the office he worked in (contracted out), he then took up work as a Patent Examiner so as to complete his government retirement - not as you might expect in his field of Electrical Engineering which he learned on the job with AT&T; - but the field of personal computers which he taught himself by building several of them for me and the grand kids. Today, retired with two pensions, he plays tennis four days a week and complains about being bored. However, when he heard me speak of Freudenheim's book he said, \\"I want to read that when you' re through with it.\\"According to Freudenheim, my husband and I are merely examples of what the statistics have been showing. She combines many life histories along with statistics from reputable sources to explore the truth of the retirement zone from overall and individual perspectives. The truth is, large numbers of people are in the retirement zone (and not just because of the baby boom as we so often hear, but also owing to increased immigration beginning 40 years ago as well as increased life expectancy among the older population). Many potential retirees continue to work (women more so than men, as the immediate cohorts of women stayed home with the kids back in the \\"old\\" days, and they have not yet put in enough years for retirement benefits). And, depending on your profession, the pressure to quit working is enormous after you reach a certain age, because those younger workers breathing down your neck have spent their lives in much larger cohorts of the baby boom (just wait until those kids born in 1957-1961 hit retirement ages!!). However, other types of employment may be available to you. Sometimes you just need to look around. Freudenheim suggests there are choices to be made.Should you leave work altogether - which my 75-year old husband finally did, Freudenheim has tons of suggestions (I hope he really does read her book!!). She provides the reader with all sorts of alternatives for occupying your time fruitfully - paid and unpaid, or if you really don't want to work she has other suggestions. Her book is a comprehensive resource with hundreds of sources - books, websites, and ideas gleaned from others who have tackled the Retirement Zone.Will I retire soon? Who knows. Right now, I am just living one day at a time. It's comforting to know, however, that I do have alternatives, and that I am not alone."},{"Title":"Looking Forward: An Optimist's Guide to Retirement","review":"This is just what I should have been reading 5-10 years before I retired.

It makes the golden years sound wonderfuly attractive and chock-full of things you can't wait to do. Best of all, you'll feel as if nothing about senior living is daunting.

Humorous but insightful."},{"Title":"Looking Forward: An Optimist's Guide to Retirement","review":"It's hard being old and set out to pasture. Some folks just give in and accept their lot of being pushed into a corner to live out some twenty or more years doing nothing, just existing. Why retire when you are not ready? There is no set age now for retirement. Keep on doing what you enjoy and make that money as long as you can! You will have time to enjoy it when you are ready!If you haven't had any social life or spiritual training before the age of 65, it's a little late to start now. Oh, it is good to go to dances and church, but alone -- that is as bad as not going at all. Who wants an old, decrepit man to take you places and to tell you what to do? No one needs that!If you don't know yourself by now, it's just plain too late to start finding your inner self through workbook studies or seminars telling you how you should think and live. No one can live your life for you. Only the losers go to Florida! Stay where you know the terrain and enjoy being yourself. Now is the time! With the white or gray hair, you are invisible to most of the populace anyway, so get out there and have fun! Raise a little hell! You will find that finally after all these years, you CAN be yourself. Perhaps young, inexperienced males will look on you as 'over the hill,' but hey! what do they really know -- they haven't been there yet and cannot judge the elderly. Their time will come sooner than they wish and they, too, will be invisible and on their own in a hostile world.Don't hide away and wither! And, for God's sake, don't waste time volunteering. We have only a limited time to enjoy being who we are and who God created, a unique individual. If you like traveling and have the money, by all means, do so. It is never too late to learn. What we see will be temporary as there will be no one to share the experience with, so why buy postcards. That is a waste of money. Take your own pictures!Hobbies are time-consuming and who has the time now. Get out and live. And the world will be rosier and you will be happier and more fulfilled for the day when you go to the Great Beyond. There are no 'caregivers' especially family, as they tend to desert and abandon you when you are a drag on them. So, don't be a drag! Be independent. Go places, and be yourself, warts and all. No one really cares about the old unless you have a fortune to leave them. Don't be so stupid. Spend it on enjoying life, as they will not thank you after you are dead.Move where you want to when you want to. You have to suvive where you find yourself and if the place is bad and a prison to you, move on. Save a little money to pay the young men to move your things and life will go on as normal, more or less. It is always a challenge to move from one town to another, but it can be done. Just be sure you know someone there, or the town itself so that you won't feel lost and alone. You are never alone as long as you have God in your heart. No one can harm you when your spirit is strong. Don't let someone make you feel weak when you're not.Retirement is a drag. It is a retirement from life not work. Don't ever give up. Always keep your chin up and look forward. Every cloud has a silver lining, and you can find your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, if you just believe."},{"Title":"Phased Array Antenna Handbook (Artech House Antenna Library)","review":"Contrary to the previous reviewer's belief, this text has nothing to do with &quot;installation&quot; of &quot;satellite dishes&quot;...

The \\"Phased Array Antenna Handbook, 2nd Edition\\" by Robert Mailloux, is an excellent book on theory and architectures of phased arrays. It is up-to-date, well written and contains a balanced mix of text, equations, figures and references. It also provides a good overview and thorough discussion of phased array architectures, refraining from using a case study approach.The book contains eight chapters:1. Phased Arrays in Radar and Communication Systems2. Pattern Characteristics of Linear and Planar Arrays3. Pattern Synthesis for Linear and Planar Arrays4. Patterns of Non-planar Arrays5. Elements for Phased Arrays6. Summary of Element Pattern and Mutual Impedance Effects7. Array Error Effects8.

The Heat's On is something of an exception. Oh, there's more than enough mayhem and what with a giant albino junkie, a hunchback dwarf, a pony-sized attack dog, a faith healer, and various and sundry other folk about, there's certainly adequate local color.But when, first, the detectives are suspended for treating the dwarf a tad too roughly (for instance, he dies in custody) and then Digger is shot and reported killed, Cotton Ed lets his slip show a little. He becomes a frenzied dynamo of barely contained brutality as he tears a steaming hot Harlem apart searching for the cache of heroin that led to the whole mess. This is a terrific entry in the series and is particularly interesting for Himes's fearsome hostility towards the drug traffic which was blighting the inner-city even then. His attitude makes for an interesting contrast with the permissive modern attitude of many black leaders, who decry harsh prison sentences for drug dealers.

In addition to being a highly entertaining work of crime fiction, this novel, like others that Himes wrote, sheds light on racial relations and tensions in the United States in the murky decades of the 1940s through the 60s. In this book Himes takes the reader into the heart of Black America; it's akin to exploring an entirely different world, far from that of mainstream white America.

This book from start to finish goes into extreme detail on how she creates these stunning creations. Blue and white fabric is the media of the day with her and she highly recommends only using those cool colors - leaving the brights for other creations. Just from reading the book carefully and doing one of her pattern snowflakes at the end you can get a good idea of the design process. Be warned though - this is a quilt for the intermediate or advance quilter who likes precise involved work. This is not a stack and whack kind of thing. Or for that matter, a quilt you can do in a day. One snowflake could easily take you 20-40 hours to get just the way you want it. But every one is a unique piece of art that really stands alone. When you put them into your own set they become simply breath taking. Your finish product will have all your friends saying - How in the world did you do that?? I recently spent 5 days with Paula learning the technique and getting to know her. She's a wonderful woman - creative AND gracious. I would highly recommend this technique for any quilter who wants to fall in love with snow again - just like when you were a kid. Be careful though - its VERY addicting so you might want to throw some extra meals in the freezer just in case!!"},{"Title":"Snowflakes & Quilts","review":"Paula Nadelstern in her latest book takes the kaleidoscope concept a step further with her stunning representations of snowflakes in fabric. When you first open this book, you will ooh and ahh at the beautiful images. Then, as you look a bit closer, the oohs may turn to small groans as you realize just how detailed these snowflakes are. But, don't let yourself become too intimidated by this detail and the multitude of tiny scraps of fabric that she puts together. She does a wonderful and complete job explaining every step of the process and with careful reading, patience, and perseverance an intermediate quilter can create a blizzard of their own.The first section of the book deals with the technical issues - there is a list of tools, an introduction to the geometric principles of hexagon construction, a primer on fabric choices, and a very informative and valuable discussion of template creation. She points out several different ways to simplify the creation process and while she rightfully stresses the importance of precision, she also explains *why* that precision is so important with examples of what can go wrong.Once the hard stuff is out of the way, you can begin to explore the creative aspect of designing snowflakes. Paula's designs are based on actual photomicrographs of snowflakes taken around the turn of the century and she includes a number of these images in this chapter and explains the different types of crystal formations and how these can be translated into fabric. In this section there is also an extensive discussion of colors and pattern textures and the role they play in the various parts of the snowflake. The image library is especially helpful to quilters not familiar with kaleidoscope designs and how to recognize elements that work well with the mirror imaging.Even though the vital information has been presented in the previous chapters, rather than abandoning the reader at this point, Nadelstern concludes with a workbook section with examples of four snowflake designs. The first example includes step by step instructions for creating the snowflake from drafting to sewing the pieces together. The other three designs do not have the same instructional section but do include a fabric palette, a complete template diagram, and a close up of the finished snowflake.If you are sweltering in the heat like I am, pick up this book and cool off a little. Even if you decide the blocks are out of your league, the pictures are truly worth looking at."},{"Title":"Snowflakes & Quilts","review":"This book showcases intricately pieced quilts that at a distance appear to be amazingly accurately rendered snowflakes, but upon closer inspections prove to be composed of thousands of carefully chosen bits of fabric cleverly arranged for maximum effect. Each snowflake is actually 6 identical 60 degree triangles, that are each composed of hundreds of tiny slivers of fabric. Paula Nadelstern is an artist extraordinary, who painstakingly will you step you though the time consuming process of pattern drafting, fabric selection, and piecing strategies. It is a tribute to her excellent instructions, that despite the daunting amount of work involved, the look is achievable by a very determined, intermediate quilter. Nadelstern does provide a couple of basic patterns, but it is clear that she really wants you to draft your own, and that is the thrust of the book. This book is recommended for quilters who are comfortable with the basics, ready to make a truly stunning piece and are willing to invest the time and effort to make it happen. It can also be appreciated by someone who just wants to be wowed by one of the big names in quilting and is interested in gaining insight into her artistic process. For those of you who already own her previous book on Kaleidoscopes, you will recognize this book is the same subject material, except it only covers blue six-side kaleidoscopes and goes into great detail on how to make it look like a snowflake. The core set of techniques for drafting and construction are essentially the same so if you are not wild about making snowflakes, you won't find much new. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Snowflakes & Quilts","review":"The description does not tell you this is a print on demand issue. This is not printed like the original on glossy paper highlighting the beautiful images.

Huge disappointment."},{"Title":"Snowflakes & Quilts","review":"I'm a big Paula Nadelstern fan, so when I was given the opportunity to review this book, I was flying high! Add that to being a big snowflake fan and a snow fan in general, well, you can just imagine how much fun this has been.I have a few of her other books on Kaleidoscope Quilts (another thing I love - Kaleidoscopes), so I was thinking this book probably wasn't that different in scope and subject. Oh my, was I wrong!Yes, many of the same techniques apply, such as making templates the \`Paula' way in order to secure a successful hexagon, but I learned so much about snowflakes, I was enthralled. I don't sit down and read many quilting books. I look at the pictures, and thumb through the directions and then put it on the shelf for when I want to make a quilt like that. However, I found myself reading this book as if it was a novel and I couldn't wait to turn the page!Paula talks about the science of how snowflakes form and at first glance that seems \`oh so boring' but not when Paula writes about it! She might as well have been sitting here in my sewing room with me, just telling me about snowflakes. Again - enthralled.She readily admits up front that she's not that good at sewing, which is so hard to believe, but I guess she would know.She gives good advice for when our hexagons turn out wonky. She's had a few wonky hexagons in her life, I'm glad to know I'm not the only one!As you already know, her quilts are beautiful and the photo's in this book do not disappoint. But along with photos of her quilts, she includes photomicrographs of the real thing. We all know No Two Snowflakes Are Alike. This is not a fanciful saying, it's been scientifically proven by the Snowflake Man (also known as Wilson Alwyn Bentley) in 1885. He started studying snowflakes at the age of 19 and continued studying and photomicrographing them for the next 47 years!In seeing the actual photo's of real snowflakes we can see two things - no two are alike, and while they are hexagonal and symmetrical, they are not perfectly so. Thus, relieving you of the burden of sewing a perfect snowflake. The imperfect nature of the snowflake can easily be assimilated into our quilts, simply by sewing as we do, not being robots sewing the perfect seam.Paula tells us there are certain parts of the snowflakes that must be perfect (and she tells us how to achieve this) but there are other parts, such as the extensions that don't need to be perfect. That in fact, the very imperfections will bring life to our quilt.Well, my fingers were itching to make a snowflake, I couldn't just read all about them, and not make one! Searching my stash for the perfect fabrics, I pulled out a few pieces of fabric, probably less than I should. But to make one snowflake, I wasn't going to buy all new fabric. If it turns out and I love it, then I'll buy all new fabric.

I read this book before I read Angelwalk, and had to go back and look at it again. The irony of Jesus having a guardian angel who believed at one time Satan was unfairly punished was just amazing.This book also made Jesus a little more human to me. Sometimes, we think of the God in Jesus so much that we forget that he went through the human experience as well.

It was very interesting to see what being a guarding angel for Jesus would be like. To be able to be so close to Jesus. It gave a different perspective of the life of Jesus Christ. The most interesting thing that the book brought to me was the fight between the fallen and the unfallen angels. With God letting the angels grow in their own way. Just like God today lets us decide what path we take. Even when we walk down the wrong path God is willing to take us back. That is ofcoarse if we are willing to walk that path. Many people say that want to be with God, but they head in the wrong direction. I guess many people just don't know how to read maps."},{"Title":"Darien: Guardian Angel of Jesus","review":"I really enjoyed this book.The story as seen by Darien is a differnt in-site into what might of really happened as Jesus Chirst walked the road to our salvation.I encourage all people to read this book."},{"Title":"Darien: Guardian Angel of Jesus","review":"Amazing book!

Consequently the thought of Christ having his own is a fascinating yet believable premise. Since the Bible says Jesus took our human nature, it wouldn't surprise me if his Father has given him one to accompany him on his human voyage. However, the part that turned me off to the point that I could not finish the book, I compromised by reading the last 2 pages, was the right wing Christian viewpoint. This viewpoint was represented by the author's chararacterization of two fallen angels selected to spread evil by abortion and homosexuality. I nearly vomited. As a devote Christian, feminist and human right supporter, I do not believe God is anti-choice or homophobic. Just as God told Darien (and gave him a human body) as he was at his lowest ebb and mourning beside the dead body of Jesus to &quot;remove the stone!&quot; I would say to the author &quot;remove the stone from your heart and mind&quot;; God loves all of his/her children.

The chapter of wolf and coyote coursing alone is worth the price of the book. Read of the man who caught wolves and coyotes with his bare hands (ok he wore a glove). The hunts for sheep and goats in the Rocky Mts. as well as the chase of the deer in th badlands are all brought to life. Roosevelt was a keen sportsman and naturalist, he provides us a look at the American west at the turn of the century. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to know what hunting in the old west was like."},{"Title":"Outdoor Pastimes of an American Hunter","review":"This book is definitely worthwhile for anyone interested in hunting, conservation, or just American history. Roosevelt was an astute observer of animal habits and habitat. He was concerned with wildlife conservation long before it was popular. You get a real sense of what a hunting trip was like back in the late 1890s.What's more, he's not a half-bad writer. Unlike all of the modern politicians who &quot;write&quot; books--but actually just give some notes to a ghost writer who then does all of the real writing--Teddy actually wrote this book himself."},{"Title":"Outdoor Pastimes of an American Hunter","review":"Came in short time period and was in exactly the shape as reported beforehand. Price was very goo, too."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I got this book yesterday and have already finished it. I read it in one long sitting and enjoyed it immensely. The funnest part of this installment was the role reversal of Eve and Roarke. Eve spent most of the book trying to take care of Roarke and was markedly more demonstrative in her feelings for him. I loved the scenes where she gave him comfort in front of other people on the job and their fights as always were great. Funniest scene - Eve makes Roarke sit down and thinks about pouring a soother down his throat, what a kick. Also liked the progression of Peabody and McNab's relationship. Only wish for next book - a little more background on Eve, I really look forward to uncovering a little more of her history. As always, I eagerly await another installment and thoroughly enjoyed this one."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"This latest in the &quot;In Death&quot; series does not disappoint. Eve Dallas as the NY cop, in futuristic 2059, is tough as ever and satisfies all those who enjoy women who can hold their own in a man's domain. Roarke is as sexy as ever (and still a billionaire) and in this latest book Eve gets the chance to pay back to Roarke some of the tender loving care he always gives to her. Each installment of this series adds a new dimension to the relationship between Roarke and Eve as they come up on their first year of marriage. The budding relationship between McNab and Peabody gets more interesting and while there's more heat going on there, Eve and Feeney (McNab's boss), do everything they can to ignore it. The main focus of the story, of course, is the case. Eve is tracking a contract killer that even the FBI hasn't been able to catch for 25 years. All the in's and out's of the case, Roarke trying to help with his 'unregistered' computer equipment, and a visit from one of Roarke's boyhood friends from Dublin, make &quot;Betrayal in Death&quot; as good, if not better, then all the previous books in this series."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"A killer that doesn't mind having his face caught on security cameras is either super confident, or super stupid. Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the NYPSD, in the year 2059, goes for the former assumption. The hotel where the maid is killed belongs to just about the richest man around, on or off planet. He happens to be there for a charity event that very night with his wife. It's handy that his Eve is a cop at times like this.Mining the resources of her colleagues and Roarke's untraceable sources, Eve quickly discovers that the killer is a hit man for hire, and not cheap either. So why would he bother with a woman who seems to have bothered no one at all in her young life? Looking for reasons for the killing brings Eve full circle - back to Roarke. As she knew he would, Roarke he takes the killing of a employee very personally. The self made zillionaire has a lot on the go at the moment on and off planet so it's not a good time for distractions. Who is the real target?Twelve novels down and J.D. Robb still manages to keep the relationship between her hero and heroine sharp, despite the amount of time they spend together, and much of that annoying each other. It brings its own failures in that every novel of this series now is all to do about the same issues - someone always after Roarke, the kills always tied to him in some manner. Time for some new directions, despite how much page time is gratefully granted to such a terrific character (and let's not forget the marital sex scenes, always tastefully done).Crime wise \\"Betrayal in Death\\" falls a little flat, and seems to be riding on the established strengths of a very popular series. More crime time required! Still, a solid entry in a great series that remains in an as yet undefined category all of its own."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"When I think of husband/wife sleuths I recall Dashiell Hammett's Nick and Nora Charles (The Thin Man) and television's Hart's- Hart to Hart (Robert Wagner and Stephanie Powers), and Rock Hudson and Susan St. James (MacMillian and Wife). Now come J D Robb's Dallas and Roarke in Betrayal in Death. Forgive me for comparing Robb's wonderful book to three TV programs (The Thin Man later became a TV series) my point is we all seem to love the husband and wife teams.Husband/wife tandems offer us something that no other duo can offer us. A rich back-story based on an intimate relationship. Robb gives us this simmering and growing charismatic relationship both in this and in her previous stories featuring these characters.No need for me to repeat the premise of J D Robb's Betrayal in Death. Preceding reviewers have sufficiently covered that ground. For me the true story is in the relationship between Dallas and Roarke just as it was for Nick and Nora, Hart and Hart, and etc. Has your marriage been a little boring lately? Then escape into the exhilarating world of Dallas and Roarke and read Betrayal of Death. (By the way this is the only marital advice that I am going to offer so please don't email me with any questions regarding your love life.)"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"As I have said before, Nora Roberts aka JD Robb continues to produce one of the highest quality and entertaining series! This police drama/mystery/science fiction/romance story continues to evolve with its 13th installment.Roarke shows his vunerable side in this tale and Eve Dallas develops as a nurturing wife -- the story is very touching at times, still has the gritty police background, endless humor, and the steamy romance.Roarke finds himself and his employees as targets for a hired killer. Of course, Eve is the primary investigator and has to stand for the dead -- and for Roarke. There were several parts that actually brought me to tears, just because of the compassion and love Eve displays towards Roarke.It's refreshing to see characters truly grow and develop like this. I am hooked for life as a JD Robb fan. I don't want to see an end to Eve &amp; Roarke...I cannot wait until September 2001 for the next installment."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I couldn't wait for this latest book to come out, and I was not disappointed! Roarke and Eve are HOT!!! Roarke's character just keeps getting better and better. There's this new side of him that's vulnerable and especially in this book, you can see how Roarke needs Eve just as much as she needs him. It's such a special relationship. What did disappoint me, but added something to the book was the relationship between Peabody and McNab. Hopefully, we can see things resolved between the two. I'm already looking for to the next book &quot;Seduction in Death&quot; to come out. I don't think I can wait another 6 months!!!!"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"If it were possible, I would read twenty four hours a day. The 'In Death' series is by far the best! Keep it going, Nora! I even have my husband hooked on the series after I convinced him they were much more than romances. Their isn't a character in the series that isn't likable. Eve, Roarke, Mavis, Dr. Mira, Treena, even Summerset seem so real. Wouldn't this make a great mini-series? And wouldn't Nancy McKeon be the perfect Eve? I can hardly wait for the next in September!"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"Wow! \\"Betrayal in Death\\" is the BEST book in this series yet. The mystery is exciting and full of twists and turns and the relationship between Eve and Roarke has reached a whole new level.In this instalment, Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the NYPSD is investigating the murder of a maid at one of Roarke's hotels. The killer is identified as a hit man for the elite, which doesn't solve the crime at all. It becomes apparent that the real target may be Roarke, and it's up to our favourite feisty Lieutenant to find out who is pulling the strings.What I really loved about this book is how Eve and Roarke's marriage no longer seems one-sided. For a long time Roarke has been Eve's rock, comforting her and receiving little in return. But in this book, as the murders that occur upset Roarke, Eve comes to his side, and really shows how much she has grown as a person. Eve and Roarke's relationship really blooms in this novel. Their love scenes are even more passionate and heart-warming than before, and are guaranteed to leave readers satisfied. The mystery is first-rate: suspenseful, and well thought out. \\"Betrayal in Death\\" is a wonderful addition to this fantastic series - so don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"The bad guy in this book is one scary dude. The crimes he commits are a bit troubling to read about, but adds to the suspense, the urgency, of this tale. As with all of the 'in Death' books, the plot is masterful.The characters are outstanding and continue to evolve and grow and entertain. An old friend is introduced in this segment and is quite charming.This series is additive! This is the fourth time I've read Betrayal and I still love it.If you haven't read the 'in Death' series, you're denying yourself hours of entertainment and pleasure. Take the advice I was given, though, and read them in order so you meet the main cast members as they come into play and develop into first-rate characters.Thank you Ms. Robb!Shelley Dawn, author of,Sweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"The quote above refers to the main two characters in this series, Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke, and it depicts well what has been a trend in this series lately. Roarke has become more and more involved in Eve's cases and has been the target of attacks by criminals in numerous occasions. Even though this does not bother me in extreme, I would like Robb to start mixing it up a little more. One of the things that I enjoy most about this series is the development of the characters throughout the different installments, but I do not think it is necessary for Roarke to be so involved in Eve's cases in order for him to be part of the plot of this series.When the book starts we find ourselves in the spring of 2059, in a world that looks pretty much like ours in several aspects but that also shows both pros and cons when compared to our society. There is still crime and drug abuse as we see nowadays. But there are considerable advances in medicine that make Eve's world better. And also significant difficulties in getting some products, like real coffee, that make it worse. But one thing that remains the same is that criminals never rest, and Eve is faced with a killer that strangled a maid in one of Roarke's hotels after raping her. On the same night in which the murder takes place, Roarke and Eve were in the hotel hosting a party for an actress who has decided to sell the possessions she accumulated throughout her career and start the Magda Lane Foundation of the Performing Arts.The killer did not care about being caught on the security cameras and is quickly identified as Sylvester Yost, an expensive gun for hire. When another of Roarke's employees is found dead, victim of the same man, it is clear that this is personal. Concurrently, the billionaire receives the surprising visit of an old friend from Ireland, Mick, who Roarke believed to be dead. Right from the start Eve suspects Mick is involved with the killings, but Roarke believes that even though he is a thief and a liar, Mick is not a murderer. It is very interesting to see who was right!As Robb has done in the previous novels, she provides us with further information on Eve's and Roarke's past, especially on the latter, since Mick is there to refresh the man's memory. There are also development in the relationship between Eve's aide, Peabody, and her \\"boyfriend\\", McNabb. Peabody has become one of my favorite characters in this series due to her sense of humor and candor. These elements together with the usual fast-paced action and high suspense level make this book another very good read."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"Betrayal in DeathReviewed by Ann & posted at Under The Covers Book BlogA trained killer is on the loose. He is attacking people who work for Roarke and has been having his merry way with them. He beats then, rapes them and then finishes them off with his trademark weapon, a silver piece of wire. This guy is a slick criminal, both intelligent and cunning as a cat. He manages to always slip out of Eve's grasp like water.But Eve Dallas still won't give up this fight because this case hits a little closer to home. Roarke is now feeling responsible for these deaths because of their involvement with them. He believes that they wouldn't have been targeted if they didn't work for him. His grief is palpable and shadowing and it was nice to see how the tables turned in this one. Usually, it's Eve who feels the weight of the grief and horror of her job, but in this book Roarke shows another side of him that I wasn't expecting. Robb continues to enhance her characters in a way that makes me love them more. She is able to portray both the light and dark times of their lives in a way that you feel like you can relate to them.A couple of twists and turns are evident in this book, making this one an easy one to devour. I also really loved reading from Yost's POV because it offered a look into a killer's mind. You can see his plans, see how his mind works and in comparison to Eve's mind, it was a refreshing glance at two sides of a coin.There's some trouble in paradise between Peabody and McNab. Their casual relationship is now strained because it seems that McNab has an different idea of their relationship. My fingers are crossed that things work out for them, but for now, the ride is a little rough as they try to work out their differences.In the end, I found that BETRAYAL IN DEATH was one of my favorites of the series. I find it harder to choose the best one since all of them are equally great. I still don't know how Robb manages to keep things fresh without repeating the same notions over and over again.

In this book, we are taken to May in New York, the year is 2059. Tonight, NYPSD Lieutenant Eve Dallas is dressed in silk and diamonds, attending a party with her sinfully rich and handsome husband Roarke. Eve still hasn't gotten used to the idea that so much has changed since her marriage to the man that goes by only one name, Roarke. No matter what name he goes by, he is her lover and protector. While in the hotel ballroom of THE ROARKE PALACE HOTEL, champagne is served and millions of dollars worth of jewelry and art are on display for the Magda Lane auction - no one is aware that in room 4602 a horrific rape and murder is taking place. When Eve is notified of the death, she jumps into action. She knows what it's like to be beaten and broken, and above all helpless. The victims of murder have a name, face and a voice. It's her duty to speak for the dead. She calls in her team - Peabody, Feeney, McNab, and Dr. Mira. She needs to know why housekeeper Darlene French was killed. When they find out who the murderer is, more questions need answers. He's a killing machine named Sylvester Yost, and his 'services' weren't cheap. He didn't care why he was paid to kill Darlene, he just accepted the contract, fulfilled it, and took the money [along with a souvenir from his victim]. This was just the beginning... He strikes again. This time the brutal rape and murder of Jonah Talbot is caught on a security disc."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I wait impatiently for each new release of the &quot;..in Death&quot; series, and this one is one of the best yet! Even knowing who the murderer is from the beginning didn't eliminate the anxiety of who would be next. Like with any good mystery (and this is one of them), I tried to figure out who started it all. I had two choices, and both of them were wrong! My only disappointment in the storyline was Agent Jacoby. His actions did not add anything except distraction to the story as a whole. I would have liked to have his character fleshed out a little more than it was. I had nothing but cheers for Sommerset as well. Who'd have thought that he could do what he did! I am curious as to when Dallas and Roarke are going to start thinking about enlarging their family. Hopefuly, it won't be for another two or three books yet. Kudos for Nora Roberts as J.D.

I especially liked the fact that we had a little role reversal this time around.

This series of books is totally enjoyable because of the lively mysteries, cleverly drawn characters and humor that makes the pages fly by. A super read!"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I have enjoyed one or two of the books from this series and had been anticipating this one. It never grabbed me. The murder at the beginning was much too graphic. Then getting into the mind of such a sadistic killer was more than I want from a book. I read for relaxation and entertainment, not to be reminded of the depravity in the world. The tension and competition between Eve and Roarke is getting tiresome. I have to admit that I didn't finish this book and maybe it improved. I preferred to toss it and go on to something else. Time is too precious. Take a look at Barbara Parker's series."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"This was a very good read, especially as regards the building of characters and relationships. There are NO surprises, as you'll have this thing figured out quickly. But the author does well in leading one along enthusiastically to see exactly HOW she comes to the conclusion you expect.Mystery/crime-novel fans should also like this novel (and presumably the series), but anyone attracted by the &quot;futuristic&quot; setting will get a good laugh. This is the most unsophisticated treatment of a future 50 years from now that one could imagine...or rather not imagine.The author obviously set the timeline ahead 50 years simply to relieve disbelief of this Irish criminal/Donald Trump/Bill Gates mishmash named Roarke, who owns practically everything and everyone, and is an exceedingly handsome computer genius to boot. Totally ridiculous character, so lets just jump ahead 50 years! You'll still come to like the character and also that of Eve Dallas, of course. What the sophisticated will not like is the general abandonment and lack of attention that this futuristic setting receives from thereon.But again, she has the romance/mystery bit down, plus entertaining characters who like to...err...enjoy each others' company almost every other page."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I have so enjoyed this series and eagerly await the next installment. The plot here, gives you more information about Eve's husband Roarke and builds on your understanding of their developing relationship. It's nice to read about married people who have great sex and are working at a continually evolving relationship. I don't know how Nora Roberts does it but I hope she keeps it up."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"Betrayal is a violation of trust. Betrayal is a violation of love. Betrayal is a violation of friendship. Betrayal is a violation. J.D. Robb aka Nora Roberts teaches us about the word and the various circumstances which define it. She is ice. She blows us away. On the journey we learn more about Roarke and Eve. We feel viscerally what they mean to each other and what that committment of love means. We learn what &quot;standing for someone&quot; means.The double mystery to solve, makes this a very fast read. Now once again, I am waiting. Somehow she needs to write books that take more than 2 1/2 minutes to read.(:-) Get it. You won't regret. I am on to my 3rd read!!"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I love this J.D. Robb series, and this is a very good selection. I just wish that the reader hadn't changed Peabody's voice so much. Everything else is great. A good story line, and characters are true to form."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I dearly love the In Death series by J.D. Robb (aka Nora Roberts) and hearing them performed by Susan Erikson makes them even better as she has developed such distinctive voices for the characters. When she first began performing these books she hadn't developed most of the voices, especially Peabody's. This CD is a totally redone performance of the book with all the familiar accents and tones. In the original you can't tell Peabody's voice from Eve's. Now you can! I loved it.Also, normally an unabridged CD version of a book comes on a bunch of discs and costs a bundle. This is a new format, though. The complete book comes on just one disc and, with shipping, cost me only about $20. Hardback books cost more than that and you don't get to hear Roarke's sexy Irish voice in your ear or Peabody's saucy comebacks.You do have to have a stereo that will play the MP3CD format, so that can be a problem for some but I suspect all new players will do it. It will play in the computer so there's always that method of listening to it. I haven't tried copying it to my MP3 player but I imagine one can do that as well.My only complaint about the format is that I can't seem to rewind or fast forward in small amounts like I can with a regular CD. I can jump by chapters, but that's the smallest increment I can make it do. However, for the price and convenience of having it all on just one disc, I'm willing to accept the limitations. Hopefully they will fix them soon."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"Nora Roberts Rocks! Lt. Eve Dallas makes the best protagonist and it's like a ongoing series so there is always a new story!"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"Great book! J.D. Robb did a terrific job on this book. It really holds your interest. If you her previous In Death books, this one will not disappoint you."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"The 12th installment of the IN DEATH series delivers!Eve Dallas tackles her greatest challenge to date when it is discovered that the murderer she's chasing has targeted none other than her husband, Roarke. She must balance heart and head, managing to keep both in check, if this murderous rampage is to be stopped before her husband falls victim.The suspense is perfectly-written. It feels very natural. It feels very real and lifelike. Occasionally, writers grow stale and their stories lose something. In this installment, Nora Roberts (writing as J.D. Robb) has not lost a step! I loved this book."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"\\"Betrayal in death\\" is the 13th book in the \\"In death\\" series, and a wonderful addition to it. This book is a perfect mix of whodunit, some romance and a futuristic cop series. But then, you probably know that, if you have read the other books in the series. If that is not the case, please do first things first, and start by the beginning, reading the series in order. Even though all the books in the \\"In death\\" series can be read independently, it is only when you read them in their correct order that you will fully enjoy the series, as you will appreciate the interrelation between the characters and how they grow.In this case, Lieutenant Eve Dallas has to face crime again. She finds herself as the primary in the gruesome murder of a maid that happened in one of the hotels of her husband, Roarke, just as Eve was attending a charity party there with him. Thanks to the security cameras, Eve discovers that the murderer is nobody else than Sylvester Yost, a gun for hire for the elite, that has been in the FBI's most searched list for more than 20 years. However, one thing is to know who he is, and another one is to find him. Only a very confident assassin does not mind showing his face.As if that were not enough, soon afterwards another murder is committed by Yost, and in this case the victim is a young friend of Roarke. All seems to point out to the fact that someone ordered Yost to mess with Roarke, and ultimately who knows, maybe kill him. But why? And is Eve in danger too?.Of course, there is much more than that in this book. An old friend of Roarke, Mick Connelly, reappears, and Eve cannot help but think he might be linked to the murders, despite Roarke's trust in Mick. Also, there is trouble in paradise for Peabody and McNabb, and more than some squabbles between Eve and some FBI's officers that are also trying to catch Yost.On the whole, the points mentioned above help to make this a very engaging book, for those who like a good thriller with lots of action. I would like to point out, however, that the murders in this book are specially grim, so take that into account when deciding whether to buy this book. That having been said, I recommend \\"Betrayal in death\\" to you.Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"nora roberts is the best author i have read her in death series is gripping and you can imagine your self there in the story it is that vivid. i have read most of the series my newly aquired is that of visions in death. i try to get most from my library but it is very hard as she is a poular read with most people."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"Nora Roberts aka J. D. Robb delivers again. From the first &quot;Naked In Death&quot; to this issue, she gives one hell of a read. Witty banter, which I love, fairly good crime scenes, Eve and Roarke are great to watch grow as well as all the other recurring characters (and some of them are doozies). Eve tears at my heart with her courage and guts. Thank heavens, she has Roarke who understands her. Read them in order. It won't take you long. They are keepers!"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"Wow this book was awesome! Eve Dallas is such a great character. The novel went by so quick and the scences were perfectely detailed. I found Yost, the murderer, to be a very interesting character. The background to the murder was just a little complicated but understandable in the end. Overall it was a good suspenseful novel."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"After what I thought of as a very poor showing in &quot;Judgement in Death,&quot; I was so glad to see Eve back in full force in this one. The mystery was well-plotted, and ran smoothly throughout the book, and my favorite part, Eve and Roarke's relationship, really went somewhere in this one. Eve's concern for her husband's life, and her reaction to the loss of his people showed significant growth in her role as a wife, not just &quot;Roarke's cop.&quot; Slowly, over twelve books, the two of them have manged to meld themsleves into a unit, seperate and distinct entities, but still a cohesive team.Now that the two of them can work together, I expect great things of their detective work! With Roarke's gift with the shadier side, and Eve's dogged pursuit of law and order, they can stand for the living, and the dead.Fabulous book, even if you haven't read the other eleven (Didn't that review say TWELVE? Well, they must be counting the novella in &quot;Silent Night&quot;) books. I can't wait for the next &quot;Seduction in Death,&quot; due out in September."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I love the In Death series, and this book didn't disappoint me. It's terribly hard to put any of the books down once I begin them, and this one was no exception.

Reading them in order is always the best way! ^^"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"Murder is once again stalking the streets of New York, and Eve Dallas is hot on its trail. An old friend from Roarke's past, a celebrity auction and a killer with class throw twists and turns throughout the story. Betrayal in Death takes readers back to a future New York, and back to a cast of characters that never fail to delight as Eve, with Roarke's help, stands for the dead."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"This was my first J.D. Robb book and I am here to tell you that I wasn't all that impressed by it. Maybe this story just wasn't for me. I am going to read another one of her books just for the benefit of the doubt. I did like her main character, Eve. She is a hard nosed, strong willed woman and I admire and respect that. I think that was the only reason I had any desire to finish the book. From reading her recent book reviews, I know that she is a talented author and this may be one of the lower ends of her spectrum in writing."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I LOVE THE JD ROBB SERIES. I HATE HAVING TO WAIT 6 MONTHS FOR THE NEXT SERIES. ALTHOUGH EVERY SERIES ABOUT ROARKE AND EVE TAKES PLACE IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THEIR MARRIAGE , I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A SERIES TAKE PLACE A FEW YEARS LATER AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN MARRIED TWO OR THREE YEARS. I THINK IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEIR MARRIAGE AND HER JOB ARE AFFECTING THEIR LIVES A FEW YEARS INTO THE MARRIAGE. I THINK IT WOULD ALSO BE WONDERFUL TO HAVE THEM START PLANNING A FAMILY AND SEE HOW THAT AFFECTS THEIR LIVES AND JOB. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE SERIES GO ON FOR YEARS I ONLY WISH THAT THE BOOKS WOULD COME OUT FASTER."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I really enjoy the In Death series, so I was surprised when the conclusion of this one left a bad taste. The story was engrossing because we already know who the killer is right from the beginning, and therefore the story was more focused on the investigation as Eve pieced together how to get him. However, I can't explain why the book disappointed me without spoiling......SPOILER: I enjoy the satisfaction that comes when Eve catches the killer and he/she gets what they deserve. So, I felt cheated when the killer offed himself in the end to avoid jail. Considering how he killed his victims, it seemed wrong that he got off so easy. Some might say, that's realistic. But, come on, these books aren't realistic--Eve solves every case! Unfortunately, this isn't the first one of these novels to end this way, nor is it likely to be the last. I'm hopeful it remains a rarity, though. Recommended to fans of the series who just have to read every book, but I wish I had skipped this one."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I really love her books, and the characters in this series are wonderful. So don't get me wrong, I'm usually a big fan of this series. But. . . the ending was a big let down. The bad guy was horrible. Really deserved to get it big time. And then when he was caught so easily in the end, I thought, oh no! Just wait, he'll get away and come back after Eve and Roarke and all hell is going to break loose! But no. He was just caught. The end. And the whole story thread with Roarke being his target was completely dropped. I thought that Roarke would tear him apart when he tried for him. Or Eve would. But Eve and Roarke never even knew that he was a target. And Dr. Mira's grand-child. I thought that Eve would have some sort of thoughts about children in regard to herself. Even if the thoughts were &quot;no flippin way!&quot; But it was never mentioned again. I was pretty disappointed over all."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"A mystery novel like no other.You have to read it if you are a mystery fan.It is absolutely excellent!"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"This book is fantastic--as is the whole series! Robb/Roberts keeps getting better and better. Check out my reviews of Naked in Death and/or Glory in Death for more info..."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I bought this book as a fairly random choice based on its good reviews. The plot is clever enough and the police procedures are reasonably knowledgeable but......! Aren't there supposed to be proof-readers and editors whose job it is to make sure that an author doesn't make embarrassing errors? I'm an Irishman and I can promise you that the image of Dublin exemplified by one of the main characters just doesn't ring true. Roarke's background would have been difficult enough to justify if he had been born in the 60's or 70's but he's supposed to be from the early 21st century for heaven's sake and he talks about Dublin as if he had come from a huge slum! The dialogue he comes out with is just totally incredible and I use that word in its literal form. His phrases and attitudes are not the stuff of an ex-gangland boss from Ireland. But then the dialogue of the entire book is sadly embarrassing. On the last page, one of the two main characters refers to an enemy as &quot;him and his ... son&quot;. A half dozen lines later, exactly the same dialogue comes out of the mouth of his wife! And again, earlier in the book.... &quot;People ask me why I'm doing this, why I'm giving so much of it up. Do you know what I say?&quot; You have to turn the page to get the answer from the hard-bitten female cop and the delay adds to the leaden disappointment of what she says.....&quot;No, what?&quot; !!! (Even if she had said, &quot;No, but I suppose you're going to tell me.&quot;) Having said all of that, I finished the book to see the end so it &quot;held&quot; me in that sense. I do think that Nora needs to get herself some honest proof-readers and/or editor, then her imaginative plots might have a bit more literary and realistic merit."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"This latest in the &quot;In Death&quot; series sure does not disappoint fans! Eve Dallas, is tough as ever and satisfies all those who enjoy women with attitude and style. Roarke is as sexy and clever as ever and in this latest installment Eve gets the chance to be that loving wife with tenderness to Roarke.Each book in this series adds a new degree to the relationship between Roarke and Eve as they come up on their first year of marriage. The relationship Eve hates between McNab and Peabody gets more interesting and while there's more heat going on there, Eve ignores it mostly but does let Peabody cry on her shoulder with a lot of ice cream and tearsThe main plot of the story, is the case in which Eve is tracking a contract killer that even the FBI hasn't been able to catch for over 25 years. Roarke still is of help with his computer equipment. There is a visit from one of Roarke's boyhood friends from Dublin. You learn more of Roarke's past and even a new side to him.The ending was surprising and touching. &quot;Betrayal in Death&quot; is absolutely the best in this series yet!"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"It had to happen, and it is a mark of how good Nora Roberts is that she recognized the need for some role reversal. In this book, for the first time, we see Eve as the nurturer, and the giver, while Roarke is the vulnerable one. However, even the softest moments have the edge that this series is famous for, and the reader is always more inclined to laugh than to cry, and to fall in love instead of in a depression. In this installation, Roarke is the target of a hitman who wants him to lose people he cares for before he dies. However, Eve is not the one in risk, and the book remains interesting, with some unnerving twists. For avid followers of the series, it is fascinating to see Roarke lash out under tension, and become the one who uses his tongue to hurt the person he loves. The book overall takes us forward into the marriage between two such different people, and naturally, into the problems as well as the love that Eve and Roarke have to learn to deal with."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"In May 2059, New York Police Department Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her spouse wealthy billionaire Roarke take a rest between cases. Since Roarke worked both sides of the law, he has enemies from his past wanting him dead as well as some new foes who also prefer he no longer breathes. Thus, he is not surprised when a paid assassin brutalizes, rapes, and kills an employee in one of his hotels, but he personalizes the ugly incident.Eve is assigned as primary investigator on the case. When a second homicide occurs with the victim being a close friend of Roarke's, he and Eve conclude that someone wants to hurt and distract the businessman. The police know the identity of the killer, but have no earthly idea where the hitman is hiding. However, the dynamic duo knows the main event is coming soon.Not since the &quot;silver age&quot; of Neal Adam's Green Lantern and Green Arrow has a crime duo won the hearts of readers as Eve and Roarke have. The current tale contains a well-executed mystery with many puzzle pieces that need placing together to obtain the full picture of the plot. Although the who-done-it remains the primary story line, the love story subplot between the lead protagonists provides cross genre appeal to romantic suspense fans. The audience will find this exciting novel impossible to put down until all the questions are answered.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"Lieutenant Eve Dallas is pulled from a party at her husband's Palace Hotel when one of the maids, Darlene French, is brutally beaten, raped, and subsequently strangled with a slender wire of silver. It doesn't take her long to find the hired assassin who made only a half-hearted attempt to disguise himself. A hammer for hire, Sylvester &quot;Sly&quot; Yost has made a career of killing and after four successful decades, he's got it down to an art form. What Dallas soon comes to realize is that behind the hammer lies the purpose behind the seemingly senseless death of a young maid. When another assassination is perpetrated on someone closer to Roarke, Dallas comes to realize that the target has been her husband all along. Finding Yost is hard enough, taking him down proves to be even more difficult, and finding his client seems next to impossible with two FBI Agents usurping her authority and a boyhood friend of Roarke's who has come to pay an unexpected visit.J.D. Robb has written another brilliant suspense story featuring Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke, a truly dynamic duo whose incredible relationship is put mildly to the test when his old friend Mick shows up and begins reminiscing about old times. Roarke finds himself torn between the loyalty he owes his friend who saw him through hard times and his wife who tries, despite her profession, to see him through everything. As Eve tries to come to terms with more of Roarke's past, she is also uncovering a surprising web of conspiracy to which Yost just might be the key and dealing with the aggravating &quot;Feebs&quot;. And if that wasn't enough, she finds herself providing a shoulder for the usually sturdy Peabody whose relationship with McNab hits a surprising snag. This is a fantastic installment of Robb's In Death series, which reveals more about the enigmatic Roarke and allows Eve to explore her role as a wife and as a friend without minimizing her role as a cop."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I follow a great many mystery/suspense/legal/thriller writers and as a consequence always have quite a few books waiting in the wings for my attention. No matter how long the queue, a new JD Robb always moves to the front of the line. She has yet to disappoint me.Roarke and Dallas move to new levels in Betrayal. Dallas is finding out what it means to be friend, lover and wife. (If you want some fun, try reading her out loud - my dog loves Eve, especially when she's on a rant.) Who will ever forget the ice-cream-commiseration with poor Peabody? And, by the by, Peabody and McNab are getting to be pretty hot, too.I really loved the storyline - one thing about the villians in these stories, you really want them to get theirs in the end. Seeing Roarke as the one all wound up this time was a nice change, and it's nice to see Eve's learning to manage him. My only disappointment in this book - and it's been said before - was that Mr. Yost didn't meet a more fitting end, like making some new friends in prison! I would hope we could see more of Agent Stowe in the future. She seems to be a promising contact in the Bureau, and she's smart enough to work her way into Eve's circle of friends with Nadine, Dr Mira and Mavis.Keep 'em coming, Ms Roberts! Always a pleasure!"},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"Anyone who has followed this series since the beginning probably will agree that Eve and Roarke are the couple of the century. She is the rough edge cop who still can't believe someone could love her for herself and he is that sexy billionaire, who has found his soul mate, even if he constantly has to keep reminding her of that.In Betrayal in Death, Eve is on the trail of assassin who has been in business for a good quarter of a century. This man is so good that no one has been able to capture him. This time, he has made his first mistake. His victims are people that Roarke cares about. No one and I mean no one, threatens Eve's man and gets away with it. To add insult to injury, the FBI decides Eve and her force of NYPD's finest aren't capable of catching this killer. Big mistake on their part. Eve sets out to bring down the killer and protect her man (who we all know doesn't need protecting) while beating the FBI at their own game.This book has a lot of things going for it. Old friends from past books either make appearances or are heard from, though not enough in my opinion. Two secondary characters become more fully developed and get their own little story line. Roarke's past once again comes into play as we learn more about him and see his protective instincts kick in full force. However, for some reason, this book started off slowly for me. Don't get me wrong, it's good. For some reason, I don't think it's the same caliber of the other books in the series. But you know what? It sure didn't stop me from enjoying the book or eagerly anticipating the next one.."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"The only bad thing about starting a J. D. Robb book is knowing it will end all too soon. There is some consolation in that the next in this fabulous series is due out in September. There is not a sexier, more dynamic couple than Roarke and Eve, and guess what? They're married! An important point about this series is that it is not just a romance. Ms. Roberts (aka. J. D.

What a treat."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"Her &quot;In Death&quot; books keep getting better and better. I find it hard to believe that I have to wait another 6 months for the next book in the series to be released. Once again this book takes place in New York in the future. Lt.

A serial killer is on the loose and his first murder takes place in one of Roarkes hotels. Lt. Dallas is the primary on the case but she is bumping heads with the FBI. The story is well told and you will lose yourself in these characters. The familiarity of the main characters makes these books all the better.

If you are not familiar with this series, I suggest you begin with the first one.This book was probably the funniest of the series and only those that are familiar with the characters and previous plotlines will understand and fully appreciate all the insider jokes. For instance the candy thief struck again (any opinions on who he/she is? I'm thinking Eve's trustworthy aide - any takes?).Roarke has always been just a little too good to be true - always cool and unflappable. In this book however, we get to see him really shaken and Eve gets to take care of him for a change. There weren't many tense moments or surprises in this book but I believe however that has more to do with my familiarity with the characters and the author's style than a lack in the story itself - hence the five stars.Oh well, back to waiting for the next one. Hopefully Eve will catch the candy thief..."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"and no, I'm not a big fan of romance novels. Generally I am more interested in suspense or police procedurals. Nora Roberts, (writing as JDR) gives us all 3 in her Eve Dallas series, with her 12th book. In the series, she takes a look at the police department of the future, and combines its strong Lieutenant with an interesting and wealthy husband, Roarke. None of Eve's adversaries are common criminals; the series focuses on brutal crime. All of the surrounding characters, whether ongoing (Peabody, Feeney, Summerset, McNab) or one-time visitors, (Mick, Roarke's boyhood friend) are well-drawn. The humor is light and welcome, the scenes between Roarke/Eve and McNab/Peabody are erotic.Like the rest of the series, I read the book in one sitting and really enjoyed myself. One critique is that I would have liked to see more characterization and a better ending for the villain, Yost, who had future potential for the series.

Robb.\\"I'm no prude, but more and more lately, I am SO happy that N.R. does NOT push the romance over into hard-core porn as some writers do now. {\\"Raw\\" is the term my great uncle (94-years old) used to explain to me, shaking his head, when I was picking him up from the X-rated movie he had just seen. \\"It's no fun any more because they don't leave anything to the imagination!\\"} Rita Herron, may be the writer that floats your boat if you like this form of writing. People will get a little funky behind closed doors, but it takes all the mystery and fun out of it for me if it's rubbed right up into your face.I love the futuristic/mystery aspect of Robert's books. Yes, I think I own ALL but three of her J.D. Robb books, that's how attached I am to her writing style for her books and for Eve Dallas, her protagonist. I picture myself more as her bright, spunky, heavier partner Peabody, who, like all the women in the book, has the goo-goo eyes for the brilliant Roarke--Eve's gazillionaire husband. This particular book does not have the delicious mind-blowing twists at the end that characterize, for example, Montana Sky, but the writing style is wry, serious, and sometimes will just leave you chuckling so loud that people will ask what you're reading. (In the world of perfect mystery head-poppers, Montana Sky has got to be a 10 out of 10.)For the mystery portion of this book, I would have to give it a big Ebert 8--maybe even a 9.This book gave me happy, warm fuzzies without totally creepin' me out, so for the total, I gave it a 10. Especially when Peabody comes close to dying in the first 33 pages. It is especially relevant in today's time because cops/cop's administrators don't want to cross the blue line when they find out about other DIRTY cops. This is a pie-in-the-sky book about how good wins out over bad. *sigh* {Anyone who votes for a prosecutor because of their \\"win\\" record (has obviously never been the innocent in a suit) is an everlovin' idjit.}Now, if you still read this, thanks!

The JD Robb series is very different from all Nora Roberts books I have read, and while I will pass on a Nora Roberts book, I actively anticipate the next installment in the JD Robb series. After 12 novels (and 1 short story) about these main characters, they continue to fascinate us all.

I put too much faith in the &quot;clue&quot; she gave us with the quote at the intro page of the book (about honor and thieves)and because of this, i was totally engrossed in finding out who the true betrayer was. My favorite books so far are Glory (great surprise ending), Witness (who can forget Eve's surprise dinner for Roarke!), and definitely now Betrayal.

He is always the one standing for her; here she stands for him. Also I was devastated to see Peabody and McNab squabbling again. I hope the next book finds them on the road to some sort of reconciliation. The mystery was very absorbing, and as usual, I didn't figure it out too soon.

However, this outing, the 12th in the series, was less. Lt. Dallas is still one of the best cops in procedural-land, and her relationship with Roarke is still one of the best in mystery-land. But this time, the story line didn't have the punch the previous 11 did. There is an assasin loose in New York City, and when he begins assasinating people tied to Roarke, Dallas takes it personally. She is about to close in on the killer, but is thwarted by federal interference and so must begin the search all over as the assasin dives for cover. Who is the assasin's real target? Roarke? Dallas? Or someone as close to them - Mavis? Sommerset? From the story line, this should be a humdinger. But the writing isn't as tight, as punchy. If memory serves, this is the longest of the series, and the padding doesn't add much to the mystery. There's no doubt that I will read the next book (due in September), but if it fails to reach the standards set by the first 11 books, my interest will wain. There are just too many good mysteries on the market today to waste time with a series gone bad."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"A great book that follows along the lines of the other \\"In Death\\" series written."},{"Title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"I realize this is an old title of hers, but J D Robb is just a magnificant writer.

It is a great read."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"When Sylvia Plath stuck her head in an oven in 1963, she left behind a series of uniquely vicious, angry, cathartic poetry. One bundle was written between her separation from her husband Ted Hughes and her death in February 1963. The poems were entitled \\"Ariel\\" and she stopped working on them around November 1963. She wrote some more poems, the last ones days before her death, but they were not included in the original \\"Ariel\\" manuscript. After her death, Ted Hughes rearranged Ariel, taking out some of the original poems and inserting some of her last poems. Now, for the first time, we have the original Ariel manuscript, with all the excised poems reinserted and all the inserted poems excised.The differences between the two \\"Ariels\\" are a study in psychology. Hughes' editted \\"Ariel\\" is tragic: the last poem, \\"Edge\\", was also the last poem Plath ever wrote, and is obviously a poem about death:The woman is perfected.Her deadBody wears the smile of accomplishment,The illusion of a Greek necessityFlows in the scrolls of her toga,Her bareFeet seem to be saying:We have come so far, it is over.For Hughes, \\"Ariel\\" was a tragedy, with an angry and perhaps unbalanced woman fighting her internal demons until they ate her up \\"like air,\\" as Plath would say in one of her most famous poems, \\"Lady Lazarus.\\" Hughes' Ariel ends with Plath's figurative suicide. The guilt Hughes felt about his wife's death (he had an affair, and that set her off on her final manic depressive tailspin) was something he apparently never got over according to his family and friends. Before his death, he published a series of poems devoted to Plath called \\"Birthday Letters,\\" and they are very touching -- a man facing death, still longing for a woman who died over 30 years ago. In \\"The Offers,\\" (not in Birthday Letters), Hughes, Aeneas-like, meets Plath in the otherworld, and she sternly tells him, \\"This time, don't fail me.\\"Plath's \\"Ariel,\\" however, is quite different. Yes, \\"Daddy\\" is there, as is \\"Lady Lazarus,\\" and now also a scathing poem called \\"The Rabbit Catcher\\" in which Plath describes her bond with Hughes thus:And we, too, had a relationship --Tight wires between us,Pegs too deep to unroot, and a mind like a ringSliding shut on some quick thingThe constriction killing me also.Not exactly \\"feel good\\" poetry. However, Plath's \\"Ariel\\" is far from a poetic suicide note -- it is angry, it is vicious, but it is cathartic. The first word in the series of poems is \\"Love\\" and the final word is \\"spring.\\" Reading Plath's \\"Ariel,\\" one senses a woman excising her personal demons with words, stamping out her enemies (her husband, father, mother, romantic rivals) with poetic vitriol. The final poem included in Plath's manuscript is called \\"Wintering,\\" but ends with the upbeat, life-affirming line: \\"The bees are flying. They taste the spring.\\"This edition of \\"Ariel\\" has a foreward by Plaths daughter, Frieda Hughes, in which she tries both to defend her father against his critics and to understand her mother's inner demons. She sums it up like this: \\"Representing my mother's vision and experience at a particular time in her life during great emotional turmoil, these Ariel poems -- this harnessing of her own inner forces by my mother herself -- speak for themselves.\\" There's also replicas of Plath's original typewritten Ariel poems, and an interview with Hughes at the end of the book.Hughes' \\"Ariel\\" is about a woman whose fury and anguish drives her to her grave. It perhaps reflects his own grief and guilt. Plath's \\"Ariel\\" is about a woman (perhaps Lady Lazarus) eviscerating her enemies, Medea-like, and then ready to live life again. That she ultimately failed to conquer her own demons does not diminish the revelation that is Plath's \\"Ariel.\\" All her poems are collected chronologically in \\"Collected Poems\\". But this \\"Ariel\\" is a must for anyone interested in Sylvia Plath, her life, and most of all, her poetry."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"Now at long last, we get the \\"Ariel\\" we deserve. Plath's admirers have been waiting a long time, since at least the early 1980s when Ted Hughes first revealed that he had changed the order of the poems in his wife's final manuscript. He had added some poems--the final, freezingly depressing ones--and then re-arranaged the bulk of the book to leave an impression of a woman gone over the brink into a chilling fugue state. Now Frieda Hughes, Plath's daughter, 2 when her mother killed herself, has performed a ritual act of atonement to her mother's memory, and given us the original, \\"happy\\" (relatively speaking) ARIEL which we have never been able to see.At $24,95, the book's a little expensive, but it feels as though money had been spent on its planning and execution, so you don't feel rooked. In one section, the gray paper on which the facsimile materials are printed is easy on the eyes, aiding the eye as it struggles with Plath's numerous emendations. We get the notes Plath wrote for her own use when she had to do that reading at the BBC towards the end, the more-British-than-thou reading we have grown to love and hate at the same time. Frieda Hughes contributes an interesting and contextualizing introduction in which she seeks to reconcile the differing viewpoints of her mother and father--a challenging task, but she's up to it. The book ends up with four of the bee-keeping poems--and another in the appendix, \\"The Swarm,\\" which Sylvia kept changing her mind about including. Should she leave it in? Take it out? The title is in brackets. Thus the book ends with a hopeful note, with the freshness of Devon instead of the bleak London winter. It ends, pleasantly enough, with the words, \\"They taste the spring.\\""},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"Ariel is a collection of the last poems Sylvia Plath ever wrote. Furthermore, the poems were written during the last months of her life, which were very bleak months indeed. Plath's husband, Ted Hughes, had just left her for another woman, and she was left to watch over her two young children in the middle of a freezing cold winter in a small apartment that was not heated. Because of these circumstances, a lot of the poems included in &quot;Ariel&quot; are depressing; however, the poems are also strikingly beautiful. They show the human condition at its absolute lowest point: hopeless, stark, terrifying.Plath eventually ends her life by commiting suicide in a dramatic way: sticking her head in an oven and leaving it there. It was her third suicide attempt, and the other two were pretty dramatic as well. Plath addresses these suicide attempts, and how it felt to survive the other two, in one of her most famous poems from Ariel, &quot;Lady Lazarus&quot;: &quot;I have done it again./ One year in every ten/ I manage it-/ A sort of walking miracle/ my skin Bright as a Nazi lampshade.../ And I a smiling woman/ am only thirty./ And like the cat I have nine times to die./ This is Number Three./ What a trash/ To annihilate each decade.../ Dying Is an art,/ like everything else/I do it exceptionally well./ Herr God, Herr Lucifer Beware/ Beware./ Out of the ash/ I rise with my red hair/ And I eat men like air.&quot;The Nazi theme continues in Plath's poem &quot;Daddy&quot;, in which she accuses her father of being similar to Hitler, and compares her husband to her father as well, writing about how they both had negative influences in her life. &quot;I have always been sacred of you,/ With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo./ And your neat mustache/ And your Aryan eye, bright blue./ Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You-/ Not God but a swastika/ So black no sky could squeak through./ Every woman adores a Fascist,/ The boot in the face, the brute/ Brute heart of a brute like you..../ I was ten when they buried you./ At twenty I tried to die/ And get back, back, back to you./ I thought even the bones would do./ But they pulled me out of the sack, And they stuck me together with glue./ And then I knew what to do./ I made a model of you, A man in black with a Meinkampf look/ And a love of the rack and the screw./ And I said I do, I do./ So daddy, I'm finally through./ If I've killed one man, I've killed two-/ The vampire who said he was you/ And drank my blood for a year,/ Seven years, if you want to know./ Daddy, you can lie back now.&quot;These are two of the most well-known examples of the bleakness but truthfulness in Plath's poetry. They reach toward the human emotions everyone knows- pain, sorrow, bitterness, lonliness. However, Plath also wrote some humourous and sweet poems which are included in Ariel, including poems about her children and good memories. These poems add a lightness to the book which is otherwise dark and dreary. Although the reader is tempted to hate a book filled with such depressing poetry, no one can resist loving it. This book is, in my opinion, one of the best poetry volumes of Twentieth Century American Literature, and it will find a place in your heart. If you have not read Ariel, I greatly recommend it. Through the autobiographical poems found within it you will connect with Plath's disillusionment and also come to know a great deal about the poetic genius' troubled life and last days."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"These poems are scathing and beautiful. It is not a long work, but it requires multiple readings to break into its core. A greatly UNDERrated work that should have won the Pulitzer, I think &quot;Ariel&quot; stands alone much stronger than her Collected Poems, which actually DID win the Pulitzer. The emotions are huge and fiery, and the language is second to none. Plath has an ear for music in language, and shows it wonderfully in &quot;Lady Lazarus,&quot; &quot;Daddy,&quot; &quot;Fever 103,&quot; and &quot;Ariel,&quot; where she rides her horse into &quot;the red eye, the cauldren of morning.&quot; Brilliant work by a sometimes misinterpreted and mis-categorized writer. Don't read it to wallow in depression-- read it to hear a unique and truly gifted voice. Brava, Sylvia Plath! Your time came too soon."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"\\"I am writing the best poems of my life... They will make my name.\\" --Sylvia Plath, on the Ariel poemsIt is a pity that Sylvia Plath is so underestimated--most people I know have never heard of her, and those who have dismiss her as an angry feminist who committed suicide. It is a sacrilege to sum up her person so: Plath is one of the most important poets of our century, and Ariel her most important work.In it one can find the famous poems \\"Daddy\\", in which Plath shakes loose her restraints on her resentment for her father, who died when she was young: \\"At twenty I tried to die/ And get back, back, back to you... But they pulled me out of the sack / And they stuck me together with glue.\\" ; \\"Lady Lazarus\\", a commentary of death and disappointment, which reflects her situation with terrible lyricism; and \\"Fever 103\\", which, to me, is almost mocking; and \\"Ariel\\", after which the collection is named.Ariel is fascinating--her skill with words, her wit, her self-control (for she obviously reigns herself in from being too emotional, too confessional, and yet one feels the pain and torment all the same, perhaps even more sharply), her ability to find Just the Right Words, is vivid and brilliant. When I finished Ariel, I was left with a feeling of vulnerability, pain, and enlightenment, as though I had seen what I had been missing all along and felt the absence of self-delusion deeply.I have always been disturbed by the idea that Plath's creative energy seemed to stream from the destructive void that she felt inside of her soul and shared with the world, with skill and admirable lyricism... and yet I think that this is what made her such a *different*, unique poet. \\"Dying / Is an art, like everything else.\\" She did it exceptionally well. -- K. Rivera"},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"To say that ARIEL is a stunning book of poetry does not seem adequate. Reading ARIEL is like opening a Pandora's box of strange beauties, nightmares, furies, sorrows, and surreal sweetnesses, as in &quot;Morning Song&quot;, in which the poet whispers to her sleeping child: &quot;All night your moth-breath/Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:/A far sea moves in my ear.&quot; Unlike Pandora's box, there is no hope at the end of Ariel, only &quot;fixed stars&quot; and the moon &quot;staring from her hood of bone&quot;.In ARIEL, Plath seemed to almost shamanistically reach into realities just beneath the surface of everyday life, hauling them to consciousness with a skill almost unequaled in contemporary poetry. ARIEL stands as an unrivaled poetic achievement, written in a mesmerising and indelibly haunting voice."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"One day, in the middle of my honors English class, I saw the cover of my friend's poetry book. I remembered to find this title in the library. I happened to be visiting it that day, and I also happened to be doing a poetry project.

When I opened it up, I could see her. I saw who and what Sylvia Plath was.\\"Ariel\\" is my first Plath exposure. I am planning on reading her diary entries and, hopefully, the movie that is based on her life with her husband, Ted Hughes. I cannot wait. I am anxious for one reason: I have never been more affected by a collection of poems than this book. Every line was dripping in her emotion, in her feeling. I was shocked. I was blown away at her passionate hate towards one thing and complete adoration for another. It was beautiful, but sad at the same time.One poem that stood out to me was \\"Daddy.\\" In this she expresses her anger towards her father, comparing him to the Nazis. \\"I thought every German was you.\\" I could just sense her passionate dissapointment and dislike. She really showed us all through this work that she really is one of the classics of this century. Other poems that stood out to me include \\"Tuilips\\", \\"Death & Co.\\" and \\"Poppies In July.\\"Bottom Line: By far my favorite poet and this is of course my favorite collection of poetry in existance.

When I was in my teens and a &quot;would-be&quot; poet, I had a copy of Ariel that I rarely let out of my sight. She is the queen of angst. I greedily drank the concoction she distilled out of her anger, disillusionment and loathing. I felt the same way towards my parents as she did towards hers. Those who try to soft-pedal these poems and claim they're somehow life-affirming are deluding themselves. These are poems of despair, anguish and hopelesness, probably the most evocative expressions of those sentiments ever recorded. They will not put you in a good mood. These come from the dark night of utter isolation, written by a young, beautiful wife and mother who will soon stick her head in an oven and turn on the gas. They are about as pretty as Auschwitz. If you are looking for poetry that is morally uplifting, look elsewhere. If the paintings of Bosch and Breughel hold some fascination for you and you don't flinch from visions of the damned, then this work will appeal to you. For some reason, I think of Sylvia Plath and Diane Arbus as artistic sisters. Both show us things we probably didn't really want to see, but it's impossible to look away when confronted with the images they depicted. Art is sometimes disturbing. This is one unsettling volume of poetry."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"as the publisher's weekly blurb states, these are not new poems, so don't get swept up in the \\"what plath fans have all been waiting for...\\". all of the poems shown here were published in the 1981 edition of Plath's Collected Poems by the devilish Ted Hughes.So, why this edition? It's interesting to see someone's own manuscripts -- but interesting to whom? Plath fans. people mildly interested in Plath or new to her may feel a strain in deciding which version to read much like a confused customer i helped at a book store once displayed when I tried to explain that there are multiple versions of Leaves of Grass...But which one should a reader new to Plath read? her version or Hughes's version? A purist (like me) would argue that her version is what to read. But someone interested in Ariel in an academic setting would be best served picking up the Hughes' version.It is important for readers (academic or not) to realize that editors have often been the unseen geniuses (and villains) behind great works. I'm not calling Hughes a genius -- I'm just suggesting that perhaps both versions can teach us something about Plath -- regardless of our interest level."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"Sylvia Plath is one of those poets who seems to loom large as an iconic figure in popular and literary culture. This may be as much due to the details of her life as to her work. But putting the \\"legend\\" of Plath aside, I found her book \\"Ariel\\" to be quite an intriguing collection of poems.There are many mentions of death in general and suicide in particular throughout \\"Ariel.\\" The dark, cutting nature of many of the poems make them feel like glimpses of Plath's inner torment; also, a number of the poems seem to challenge conventions regarding traditional female roles in society. Structurally, many of the poems have an engaging musicality and demonstrate a witty use of rhyme and other effects.Many of the poems have a grimly playful quality. Plath uses a strange, unsettling constellation of images and allusions: \\"Mein Kampf,\\" the Ku Klux Klan, rubber breasts, carbon monoxide, schizophrenia, the Vatican, etc. There are some really arresting turns of phrase.Some of the most striking poems include the following: \\"The Applicant,\\" a disturbing satire of marriage; \\"Lady Lazarus,\\" in which she writes \\"Dying / Is an art\\"; \\"Tulips,\\" a horrific vision told by a hospitalized woman (this one is reminiscent of Charlotte Perkins Gilmans' classic story \\"The Yellow Wall-paper\\"); \\"Lesbos,\\" a glimpse into the unfulfilling lives of two mothers; \\"Daddy,\\" a frightening hate-letter from the speaker to her father; and \\"Balloons,\\" a playful but edgy poem about balloons.In the poem \\"Kindness,\\" Plath writes, \\"The blood jet is poetry, / There is no stopping it.\\" So many decades after Plath's death, it appears there is no stopping her poetic voice."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"This is a compilation that must be read, ideally several times in different moods and in different places. Its genius is undeniable; Plath's pain is hard to witness even 40 years after her death.Despite the fact that Ariel isn't truly a pure collection of her last works, it is close enough so that one can watch her attachment to life ebb even as her mad genius soars out of the human realm. I particularly appreciate \\"Lady Lazarus\\" and \\"Elm\\" though there are plenty of other gems in this book. Plath's brutal honesty, her stark and terse mastery of the language, her raw and untamed emotional extremes, all coalesce into a beautiful and haunting poetry that is beyond my ability to describe in a way that does it justice. Ariel is a must-read for those with any interest in poetry, 20th century literature destined to be someday be counted among the \\"classics,\\" the artist suffering from bipolar disorder or severe depression, feminist literature, or the rapid development of genius in the relatively young."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"I first encountered one of Sylvia Plath's poems in my English course at college.

I just believe Plath's ability to churn out poems in her state of ultimate depression is quite remarkable. As we read each poem, we can \\"see\\" the depression. But if we continue futher and closely read, the depression lifts into a manic frenzy, a celebration of the near divinity of poetic transformation. And only Plath is capable of that, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"I knew about this book for a long time before I read it, because I knew it's a classic but I had no idea how truly amazingly brilliant unique &amp; visionary a poetic work this is. Her music here is completely melodious &amp; unfaltering. Her metaphors are staggeringly incisive. Her themes &amp; subjects are so expansive, so complex! Someone once told me she didn't like Sylvia Plath since Sylvia Plath was just a victim of herself, but that's not the reason for her fame, just another facet of the intensity of her mind. This book is absolutely incredible poetry."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"instead of the heavy hand of Ted Hughes changing the arrangement of Plath's greatest collection of poems.I truly enjoyed Freida Hughes' introduction.Ariel is a book of poetry written by a woman gone mad, yet very much in control of her writing and full of messages, albeit mainly morbid.Plath was a great Poet of the 20th Century -- I get so tired of her being referred to as the greatest FEMALE poet. OK, she is female and Whitman was male.But you seldom hear of Whitman being referred to as the greatest MALE poet.....Double standards still exist!Fantastic read! A must-have!"},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"I haven't finished her book of Ariel yet. I did watch her life and times on a netflix cd movie ,\\"Sylvia\\". (Must watch!) Her writing reminds me a lot of Edgar Allan Poe.He was't sinister, he used a lot of unfamiliar vocabulary that makes one wonder his and hers being and mind-set; if you compare.The movie was very moving, touching and soulful in the sense that she had a curtain of darkness about her, her entire life, and when she finally thought she got a break, the man she was so deeply in love with broke her like a piece of china. Already fragile and exposed like a blossom in a hail storm. It's a writers nightmare, \\"Will I have to die to be recognized?\\""},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"How different it was almost two decades ago to be an exceptional talent isolated in a foreign country, separated from the literary and academic communities in which you thrived by virtue of motherhood, marooned by tight budgets, no car, bad weather in a suffocating island without peers to appreciate your accomplishments, while attempting to do the best for the children you adored. It's heartbreaking to think that when this remarkable volume by an incredible talent was first published, the author was criticized for the anger, longing, loneliness and guilt expressed in her poems. They were acknowledged more for their craft than the validity of the emotions they expressed.It's a clichee by now to bemoan how different Plath's life would be with the inroads of feminism and availibility of antidepressents in the '90s. But it's important to see how this unique voice can give incredible meaning to concerns that echo throughout the ages.This wonderful volume of groundbreaking poetry is a must for any bookshelf."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"As a writer, I don't know what people are thinking... It's the author's right to organize their own work. Someone else does (Ted) not make a better version! Only she knows what she was trying to create.

The novel changed my life. Oddly, although that book was not terribly encouraging as Plath's autobiographical work about a struggling female artist (let alone one with alleged serious psychiatric problems) - I realized for the first time that women could write the truth and actually get away with it. Sounds very old fashioned now but not necessarily - if you look at \\"Ariel: The Restored Edition.\\" Of course, the content in reinstating Plath's original selection & arrangment is a watershed in English Literature; but it tragically reminds many female artists today of the fight yet to be won who are still attempting to survive (mentally, physically & artistically) a still-largely-patriarchal world. Thank goodness Plath's daughter, Frieda Hughes, made sure that her mother's last poetic words will never again be anything but the truth, or ever forgotten as among the greatest works of poetry penned by anyone, at any time."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"It may seem like an exaggeration, but I think Ariel really is all about death and its various aspects: physical, emotional, spiritual. The poems are written in a broad, mythic sense that is larger than the author, as if she is speaking from a collective conciousness. They are also poems that can evolve with the reader; they can be outlets for angst or bitterness, they can be read for their viewpoints (such as the title poem, where the speaker seems to be a disembodied spirit) or a facinating and somewhat horrifying portrait of a woman on the brink of suicide. They show the beauty in the darkness of things, and, in my opinion, belong on every poet or poetry-lover's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"Sylvia Plath is, by far, one of my very favorite poets of the twentieth century. In &quot;Ariel,&quot; Plath combines mythology, biblical stories and her own private demons in a rare concoction of an art that can never be emulated. One can read her poems at many levels and still find breakthrough significance in them. Many critics have recently disclosed that Plath may have suffered from enhanced symptoms of PMS, which would have caused her roller coaster mood swings so apparent in her poems. &quot;Ariel&quot; is especially interesting to read in correlation to &quot;Letters Home.&quot; It is a great work."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"Sylvia Plath's original sequencing for this last work makes for more insightful reading. I would recommend it for all personal librairies"},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"This is one of my favorite books of poetry, and certainly the best of Plath's. Mostly because poems she wrote previous to this period still found her seeming to imitate other poets, unable to find her own voice even though she'd been at it for so many years. Only glimpses before Ariel, brief surfacings of the truth of who and what she was. And always too short, too infrequent.But some cog slipped into place here, the whole poetic works finally clicked. For whatever reason. These are real poems obviously heartfelt and imitating no previous one and all written with passion, and all as deeply loved as children. Or at least as deeply felt. They don't sound like Hughes anymore, or Auden, or anyone else, but someone totally unique that we never really heard from before until then.The tone is almost wholly original. It's direct, even confrontational, and very harsh. Terse, well-worded explosions of sense and sound, lines that slap and punch and kick and bite. You feel these poems, and you appreciate the finally sure hand behind them. A quality artist at the very top of her form.It's been said that these poems are too personal to be universal, and so don't reach the rarified air other books of the time inhabit, but I disagree. As emotion itself is universal, these poems, emotional brutality, devasting to read, are universal. The last poem in the book, for example, has sentiments that I won't ever forget, lines that will haunt me forever.As to this edition, it's interesting to see the original manuscript, yes, but that's all. Not too impressed. I'm convinced that the first published version of Ariel is not stubstantively different than what we have here. The inclusion of one or two poems in the restored edition that weren't in the 60's version? I don't think changes much, especially as those poems can be found elsewhere anyway. And it must be considered that had Plath lived, she likely would have continued to make changes to Ariel, so that this version would also not be the one we would have at this point in time ..."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"As I understand it the 'Ariel' originally edited by Ted Hughes aimed to give an impression of a totally depressed Sylvia Plath. The present edition includes poems of a happier mood and spirit. The restored edition edited by their daughter Frieda in a way tries to understand both her father and her mother at this difficult time of her life. The two poems perhaps most well- known in 'Ariel' are 'Daddy' and 'Lady Lazarus'. Both display a for powerful biting satiric language and painful personal confession. They are extreme poems which search to present the most extreme images of violent feeling possible. Many have questioned her use of concentration- camp analogies, of her seeming identification of herself with Jewish victims of her seeing her oppressors including her father, and perhaps too her husband as Nazis. However objectionable this extremism seems there is no doubting the wrenching metaphoric brilliance of the language. These poems were written at a crisis time of her life, after her separation from her husband and before her suicide. And in their desperation and extreme feeling they make a memorable poetry, what many believe, to be her greatest work."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"This is a wonderful collection of poems published two years after Plath's suicide. This edition is from a 1999 reprinting.If you are looking to acquire a copy of Ariel, I do recommend this edition with this binding. The poems are unedited, everything is exactly written as it was in the first publication. The nice thing is that this edition does have very good binding, and one tends to wear out copies of good poetry very quickly with successive readings.The content is nothing short of sheer brilliance. The poems are beautiful and the reader gets a sense of staring into the heart and soul of a tortured poet. This is not the lighthearted fluff from yore, this is raw and powerful and often vulgar (in a good way!). I would not recommend diving into Plath as the first poet one should read... rather I recommend learning to swim in the shallow end before jumping off the diving board.But for those who enjoy poetry and Plath this is a nice collection. I also picked up a copy of The Bell Jar and was not disappointed. I know many folks forget that she also wrote a novel somewhere in between writing all of that brilliant poetry."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"\\"Ariel,\\" a volume of poems composed mostly before Plath decided to end her own ecstatically troubled life, is an offering that teems with the playfulness of language, bitter cynicism, and ultimately refigures mundane experience into a near-religious profundity.Perhaps this is the aim is all poetry - to reorient the way that we see things, the way that we absorb and incorporate experience. But even the clich&eacute; can do this. But none of Plath's poems in this book, not even the worst among them, are that. In \\"Getting There,\\" the motion of the train is seen as an infinite edacity: \\"What do wheels eat, these wheels / Fixed to their arcs like gods, / The silver leash of the will - / Inexorable.\\" Later in the poem, we learn that the train is carrying the body of a dead woman and her funeral procession. But this death - \\"I shall bury the wounded like pupas\\" - is really nothing but a transmogrifying rebirth. \\"And I, stepping from this skin / Of old bandages, boredoms, old faces / Step to you from the black car of Lethe, / Pure as a baby.\\"\\"Daddy,\\" the poem with which most readers will be familiar even if they have not read the rest of the poems, begins as a threnody in memory of her father, but grows into a caustic, brooding indictment utilizing the extended poetic conceit of the Holocaust. In this poem, Plato deals with the betrayal of her father by constructing her poem around the oppressor/oppressed dichotomy. It also references \\"The vampire who said he was you / And drank my blood for a year, / Seven years, if you want to know\\" in a none-too-ambiguous reference to her relationship with her husband, fellow poet Ted Hughes.As with many other poems in \\"Ariel,\\" the effect of poetry that is so troubled and biographical - so confessional - is nothing less than revelatory, hieratic in its insistence that we should rethink ideas of violence and love."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"I bought this book in 2005, I loved the wonderful ride, examination of the human condition/examination of women's role in society. Plath uses a mind blowing spectrum of images that dance in your head and stay forever and filter your view of the world and all it's nuances and heart ache."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"one girl had written that plath became famous, heralded because she committed suicide, acting as a kind of anti-heroine, or the patron saint of teenage girl depression. well, to sum her and her life's work up that way is unfair. if you trace her work from its inception to ariel you will see a marked progression -- real growth of an artist. ariel's poems are unlike any that she had ever written before. previous poems may have contained suggestions of the pathos inside, but she covered it up fairly well with strict meters and almost cloying attention to form. these poems in ariel are a true revelation. they plunge into the deepest, darkest parts of consciousness and subconsciousness and rarely come up for air. they are harried, hurried, feverish. they are honest, devastatingly so. while you may not appreciate her \\"style\\", i think it would be hard to deny these poems of raw emotion -- and to me that kind of uncontained feeling that conveys itself so strongly to its readers speaks, no, screams, of genius."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"Sylvia Plath, though at times seems more famous for her death than her work, is one of our greatest poets. She helped usher in a new ages of poetry, of personal poetry. She is the author of \\"Daddy\\" which is on my list of top ten poems, and found in this collection. When she died, she had this manuscript on her desk. Ted Hughes published it, but with some major changes. Her daughter Frieda Hughes (also a poet) has published the restored version, the last version Plath herself had created. And this is a very different book, not as dark, since some of her last poems, her darkest, were not in this collection originally (though Ted Hughes put them in his version). It's true we don't know exactly what the final version Plath would have published, since she was constantly revising the book, but this is a valuable book to have. And not just because of the poetry. It also contains facsimilies of the manuscript of the the poem \\"Ariel\\" and you can see genius at work. This is a valuable book and even if you have her Collected Poems (and you should), you should still pick up this book."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"It seems every morbid well read teenage girl would carry a Sylvia Plath book around school, and I was one of them (I can't speak for the current Extreme Makeover, American Idol, online porn generation) Although I struck the Plath pose in high school, in all honesty I didn't really understand and appreciate her until my late thirties after I was married and had children. As a stay at home mother I know all too well the feeling of inadaquacy I must endure from those that deem me unworthy of anything too serious or intellectual. When I read Ariel and The Bell Jar years later it was more poignant. As a 39 year old mother of a small child I now understand what chauvanism and gender condecension really is, and it has allowed to read Plath with more empathy."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"This is actually the third version of the landmark Ariel, the second being the noteworthy British edition which differs in some significant aspects from the American. The new book is of course a radical difference -- based on Plath's last intention insofar as it can be documented, in accordance with now generally accepted rules for scholarly editions.This text is therefore closed some months before Plath's death, and does not contain the late batch of very tough edged poems where the topic of suicide comes frankly into the open. How she might have collected these is left to guess; they were apparently not intended for Ariel, based on any surviving evidence. Rather, the restored Ariel ends with Plath's remarkable cycle of bee-keeping poems, which provide a deep naturalistic metaphor for personal transformation and survival amongst tough circumstances. Taking on Ted Hughes on his own chosen turf of nature poetry, she gives him a real run for the money in these memorable bee verses, which also harken back to her girlhood and her father's avocation. It does not take a Plath partisan to see the accomplishment of the bee verses as ahead of Hughes at this stage of their commingled development, by more than a photo finish. It leaves the last, more overtly confessional stage of her final months a discreet new phase of experimentation -- which may, or may not be the \\"Ariel voice\\" as some call it. That tag now needs be seriously rethought.The whole subject of Plath and Ariel is open to all kinds of questions and controversies, and here her daughter Frieda weighs in with some commentary appended to this edition. It is refreshing not only for being a new personal perspective, but especially because of her ability to be objectively distanced on the whole subject nonetheless. Simply, Frieda is a new generation and poetic voice in her own right, having already turned in sound, tersely paced work in her Waxworks. Her commentaries on Ariel will not be summarized here; they are worth a new book in their own right and anyone who has followed the Plath/Hughes saga should just sit down and read them straight. This material plus the generous reproduction of actual typescript and examples of Plath's editing add the fifth star to the rating.The volume as now published is a reminder of the dimensionality of Plath's talent that legend and controversy have obscured. Rage -- harnessed like a racehorse breaking at the bit -- and suicidal illness -- frankly and memorably front and center in the best tradition of the confessional poets -- were there, as important aspects. But there was also sheer poetic inventiveness, suppleness, and a density of imagination that found objective correlatives for the inner world in the outer worlds of nature and human society. The very late, untitled set now cut loose from Ariel was not of course a retrogression, but it can now be seen as a sort of conscious minimalist experiment where certain things are at least temporarily set aside. On its own, the new Ariel brings to mind two earlier, now obscure posthumous collections put together by Hughes -- Crossing the Water and Winter Trees -- major poems after her breakout The Colossus, but pre-Ariel. These too have strong echos of the natural world, the life-cycles of death and rebirth, to which the bee poems now stand as the fully flowered end product -- and intentionally so -- not the accident of posthumous editing."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"Some of the poems are difficult to understand the first time, others are like a window where you can watch life. But in the end, all of them come to an understanding of simple things, like a finger cut, and complex ones, like dying. The intensity that run free from the pages, the fire that try to burn your fingertips with every word, and the truth that pierce your hearth, is what it makes this book a jewel."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"\\"Dyingis an art, like everything else.I do it exceptionally well.\\"If any poet has laid his or her soul bare for the world to see, it has been Sylvia Plath. In this cycle of verses, we see the poet's soul wander and cry and crumble. It's all very intense and often frightening, and if Plath were still alive her readers would be very, very worried about her mental health. As it is she worked right up until her death, and gave us a radiant first hand account of the descent."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"The poems of Sylvia Plath cannot be taken lightly; they are of a sacred and secret dance within the mind. This collection of poems seethes with an unending restlessness, the sense of a woman soul-searching and confronting what lies buried within her mind. The poems form a shell that must be pared down layer by layer, revealing a quiet intensity underneath. Ariel serves as a dramatic discourse with the self for Plath, whose poems are as much about image as they are about personal history. Part eulogy and part celebration, this collection draws upon the strength of Plath's lush description and visual memoirs. A sample of her languid grasp of words is illustrated in the poem &quot;Morning Song&quot;, where she writes,&quot; All night your moth-breath / Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen: / A far sea moves in my ear.&quot; Within poems like Lady Lazarus and the title poem Ariel, Plath paints herself into immaculate dramas of pain and passion, constantly discovering new feeling and associating herself with mythical fables. Sometimes her words seem to speak of madness, while in other moments the language shifts into the dreamiest of visions. She creates a sensation of terror alongside joy, and takes the reader into her delicate confessional world. Her words disturb while seeping a beauty that is a constant in Plath's poems. In &quot;Elm&quot; she speaks of the darkness within the soul, writing, &quot;Clouds pass and disperse. / Are those faces of love, those pale irretrievables? / Is it for such that I agitate my heart?&quot; The poems &quot;Daddy&quot; and &quot;A Birthday Present&quot; address lingering memories of the past that are potent and traumatic, as Plath blends the horror of her anger with elaborate imagery and detail. Plath's poems conjure angels and demons, and her words become reflections of the ways emotions sometimes disguise themselves as both. Ariel stands out as a remarkable visit into Plath's inner dreams and fears. It's not something you can read in one night, for the depth of her words will mesmerize and perplex. Ariel is not merely a collection of poems, for it reads like a haunting diary that unravels more as you read, and it takes time to understand its marvelous secrets."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"Plath wrote madly before committing suicide. The result is this book of poems. This is the first book I ever read by Plath. The ongoing theme throughout the book (translated to me was melancholy with little bouts of happiness) drew me in. Of all my books, this is the one I hold in the highest regard. Everything touches base in reality. My favourite poem is \\"Lesbos\\" because it's so spiteful. Some of the wording can get a bit muddled, but when you read it enough times to memorize it, it all makes sense. All clicking together. I highly recommend this book to not just fans of Plath but fans of original poetry as well."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"There are two adjectives commonly applied to this book by people who haven't read it: it is often said to be a \\"feminist\\" book, and a \\"depressing\\" one. I think these two not-quite-accurate labels arise so frequently because Sylvia Plath is, unfortunately, better-known to the general public for being female and psychologically troubled than for being an accomplished poet.This is not an agenda-driven book, it is not a book aimed at only a select audience, and it is, above all, not a depressing book. \\"Ariel\\" contains poems of awe (\\"Morning Song\\"), poems of biting irony (\\"The Applicant\\"), and poems of exhilaration so intense that it blurs the line between wanting to live and wanting to die (\\"Ariel\\"), but in all of these poems Plath's fighting spirit is evident. The anger, the rage, the *bite* of the poems about her reaction to her husband's adultery seem to me to be the mark of someone who is fighting so hard to reclaim her life because she so desperately wants to live. These are *not* the poems of someone who has turned her face to the wall and resigned herself to defeat. \\"I am too pure for you or anyone,\\" she asserts (with a defiant head-toss, perhaps) in one poem. In another poem, one that tells of a swarm of bees that kamikaze-attacked a man (to punish him for his \\"lies,\\" it would seem), she says, \\"They thought death was worth it, but I/Have a self to recover, a queen.\\" This \\"queen\\" of the bees is transparently a symbol for Plath's inner self, which had hitherto been lain dormant beneath the weighty tarps of depression, and it is described in language that is harrowingly alive, evoking metaphors of healing and resurrection: \\"Now she is flying/More terrible than she ever was, red/Scar in the sky, red comet/Over the engine that killed her--/The mausoleum, the wax house.\\" In short, these are forcefully galloping, life-affirming poems. Just as some people lose their battles against cancer or other diseases, Plath ultimately lost her battle against depression, but these poems suggest that it wasn't for lack of trying. The final poem in this restored edition speaks of how the battle was a close one, whose outcome was still in question up until the very end: \\"This is the time of hanging on.... Will the hive survive, will the gladiolas/Succeed in banking their fires/To enter another year?/What will they taste of, the Christmas roses?/The bees are flying. They taste the spring.\\""},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"So dark yet beautiful, a must have for every women. I was left speechless with it's intensity and shocked by the passion.I ordered Ted Hughes, Birthday Letters, at the same time and read it after reading Ariel. Then I started reading them together one of his and then one of hers. I was moved to tears and spent an evening in near exhaustation, I'm left speechless.Call me silly, but I can't help but see a very tragic modern day Romeo and Juliet with these two books. The expression of pain, hurt and love in these two poets is beyond comparsion and seldom seen. They touched the soul and will be remembered.Thank you Sylvia and Thank you Ted."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"I first read Ariel at the age of 13, when the anger and blackness was a perfect outlet for my teenage angst. I memorised the vicious but gorgeous poems Lady Lazarus and Daddy and walked around holding these words as a kind of talisman against all of the nameless terror of growing up. Twenty years later, long since past the angst of my youth, I thought it would be fun to revisit this poetry which was so important to my generation, thinking perhaps I had outgrown it. However, like Lazarus, Plath rises from the ashes of her own depression to reveal a linguistic beauty which is, at times, astonishing. There is, of course, terrible bleakness. In Death &amp; Co, for example, &quot;I do not stir. The frost makes a flower, The dew makes a star, The dead bell. The dead bell. Somebody's done for.&quot; still leaves me shivering and feeling terribly cold and alone. Lady Lazarus, Cut and Getting There come to mind immediately as touching the very edge of death. However, there were also some light and lovely surprises, as with Morning Song, where the wonder at the miracle of a child hit a familiar note with me (having had my first child recently), in the moment the child wakes and its &quot;clear vowels rise like balloons&quot;. It has been a long time since I've read poetry of such power, anguish or beauty. Often hard and painful, with moments of vulnerability, tenderness and even a strange kind of joy, there is something timeless and permanent in this work. Worth a re-read."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"It's a shame that Sylvia Plath never got to experience the international success and recognition that she received (and still receives four decades later) through her posthumous collection of poetry called \\"Ariel\\". These poems are deserving of every word of praise. They possess a fearless candor, a dramatic flair, and haunting imagery and metaphorical language. Plath has been deemed part of the \\"confessional\\" school of poetry, more so by critics than her own admittance. True, there is a cathartic element to many of the poems: the two most famous \\"Daddy\\" and \\"Lady Lazarus\\", where she tackles her father complex and her fascination with death, respectively. Her vampiric relationship with her mother is the subject of \\"Medusa\\" and you can hear the fondness with which she addresses her newborn baby in \\"Morning Song\\". But, just as many of the poems are more ambiguous and more opaque in subject matter. They seem to be simultaneously about Plath and about something bigger than herself. Like Robert Lowell states in his introduction, she becomes \\"herself, something imaginary, newly, wildly, and subtly created\\". These poems have a mythological quality to them. Plath transcends her earthly limitations to become a poetic goddess of honesty and courage: the one who \\"eats men like air\\" in \\"Lady Lazarus\\", who floats to paradise in \\"Fever 103\\" and becomes an \\"arrow\\" that greets the emerging day in \\"Ariel\\". Yes, a confessional tone remains, but Plath dramatizes reality to startling effect, becoming a woman larger than life. It's no wonder she has become such a mythical figure in the world of poetry. Not only are these poems stunning, captivating, and sometimes a bit disturbing, but they are also written with an impressive skill and sense of control. This is some of the best poetry I've ever read. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"This is a book women give to other women.

Is it because the book was not published by Faber and Faber?

It's a matter of communication between you and the artist, not you and the buffos.Art, piece by piece, bit by bit, is a subjective matter, a communication, and you alone must decide if you like or dislike an artist's creations.--- Joe Psarto"},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"I'm not going to review Ariel.If you've come this far, you've already read the poems, either on-line, or in a paperback edition. There is nothing I could say about one of the greatest poetic works of the 20th century.I will review this edition, however. It's just right. Not to fancy (Ariel somehow wouldn't work in a gilded leather bound edition), certainly not cheap. It's well bound, well put together, and the original manuscript works are here, in an easy to read format.It's over twenty bucks, and that's a lot of money for such a small book--but you'll keep it forever."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"As a fan of Sylvia Plath this book is monumental, in the development of her prose and in the timing. This book written shortly before her death, released her from the use of the thesaurus, she recognized that these were her masterpiece poems, this was her final blaze. I read through this book with a hunger, until I was done with the very last page, I couldn't help myself, I was in awe of every new passage. Afterwards it's depths weighed on me (and it still does), I wore the mask painted by words that had been manipulated by Sylvia for the reader to wear. Her words relayed so much more than the every day word, the way in which she strung her words together in this book, defied simple definition. You could actually feel the sensations wrap around you and strike deep into the pit of your stomach. Compared to her earlier works, this book is an epiphany. She had become so advanced that she lost the need for her previous elaborate stanzas. These prose are short, quick, sharp and exact. This is her Plath at her best. This is Plath with her heart, wide open."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"I will go out on a limb here and say that most of us understand a little about depression. We understand that it is a disease, like cancer or AIDS or the common cold, and we understand that modern medicine can treat this disease, so that the the depressive, like the diabetic, can live a normal life. Untreated, depression can become worse, or may go into remission on its own, much as any other disease.Ariel is an exploration of depression before it was a disease, and before it was treatable. Like tuberculosis, depression defined a generation of writers: Lowell, Berryman, Jarrell, Roethke. It was fashionable to be an eccentric poet, to be mad. Plath does not hold it a fashion, though. Ariel is about how bad she feels, because depression is about feeling bad. That seems simplistic; imagine the worst you've ever felt, then imagine that feeling getting worse, through days, weeks, months, years. Everything one says to you is a blow, everything you value, love, trust becomes meaningless. Nothing is important enough to get you out of bed in the morning.Yet, the irony is that feeling was not appropriate to poetry of this time. Emotion had to be objectified, displaced. Eliot, Pound and the modernists left this legacy to Sylvia Plath and her generation; they took up the restriction, and created poetry that is more painful for being more objective. The depth of despair permeates Ariel, but Plath does not allow it to come to the surface. She does not moan at us, or wallow in jealousy. Instead, she creates a figure like Lady Lazarus, who personifies this jealousy and rage.In Prozac Nation, Elizabeth Wurtzel warns against believing depression leads to some kind of intense creativity. Most of the time, people who are depressed cannot do anything. Ariel is a moment when Sylvia Plath could write, and she took full advantage of it, knowing that it would not last."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"I've read all the comments before writing my own, and there seems to be much bickering back and forth regarding Plath being a worthy artist because she committed suicide shortly after writing the Ariel poems. I agree that she was so desperately in pain during her last (planned?) moments that she was seeking some form of release. To say death is an art is a clich&eacute;, and in what context Ms. Plath used that concept we will never know since she had many emotional problems. All aside, she was a great artist and writer, and the book contains some wonderful poetry that every Sylvia Plath admirer should own. My favorites are \\"The Hanging Man\\", \\"Ariel\\", \\"The Applicant\\", and many more. These poems are flamboyant and brilliant. I disagree with the review from the \\"Though Critic\\" who had to make a point hat because she's a fifteen-year old \\"white\\" female (I don't see why race plays into this) from some hard to get into art school, says Plath's poetry was lousy. If it was that terrible, why was it published in Harper's Magazine, The New Yorker, Atlantic Monthly Magazine, Encounter Magazine, Poetry Magazine, and Critical Quarterly Magazine in England? Get this book and enjoy."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"Ariel by Sylvia Plath is my favorite volume of poetry, so when I heard Frieda Hughes was editing a restored edition of her mother's second full-length collection, I was thrilled. However, upon reading the book in Plath's own layout, I was not as enraptured with the work. As much as it pains me to admit it, Ted Hughes did an excellent job in editing the version of Ariel that was published in 1965.In the 1965 version, the heart of the manuscript was--as literary critics have called--\\"The Bee Sequence.\\" Originally, Plath chose to end her manuscript with the sequence, leaving out the poem \\"The Swarm,\\" which leaves the sequence less developed. While Plath ended with the Bee Poems, Hughes ended the book with the more forceful poems \\"Contusion,\\" \\"Edge,\\" and \\"Words.\\"Also, one of Plath's more overlooked poems \\"The Munich Mannequins\\" was also left out in Plath's original layout. Considering that one of the driving forces of the book is the World War II allusions, Hughes's choice in including it in the 1965 edition was sound.In addition to the less developed and complex version of Ariel, Frieda Hughes does include a facsimile of the original manuscript, which is really what saves this edition. Any Plath enthusiast would be happy with this book, if only for the facsimile. But then Frieda Hughes couldn't have made the book as thick as it was; therefore, she would make less money.To be honest, it is really only a book for people who are already Plath fans. If you're interested in her work, check out the 1965 edition."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"This book poems from the final, anguished months of Sylvia Plath's life is exquisite. Each of the poems has a manic honesty and power enough to break your heart. By far the best of Plath's poetic output, these poems will haunt you as if they themselves are Plath's ghost."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"The poetry in Ariel is unavoidably sensual. Even when the reader experiences the poems without the image of &quot;Mad Sylvia&quot; as a kind of fog over the poems, they are immediate and fateful. The voice is in the process of fading, as if between spirit and flesh and she speaks from that perspective. Lines like, &quot;At nightfall there is the beauty of drowned fields.&quot; And &quot;Let us eat it like Plato's afterbirth,/ Let us eat it like Christ.&quot; are longing finger holds of the imagination on the worlds which she cannot choose between. Ariel is a small book, but a reader goes away feeling as if they spent time in a dense society and have developed muscles from the new gravity. Consider these poems as gifts."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"What can I say? I have only had time to read the introduction by Plath's daughter, the poet Freida Hughes, and review 3 or 4 poems, but make no mistake, this book is indispensible to anyone who cares about Plath's work. To see her original type written poems, to assess her original intentions (12 poems have been restored, 12 deleted--the changes made by her husband, the poet Ted Hughes, however well intended, have been undone at last)... This is essential reading.Plath changed the way we write poetry, and the way we conceive of women with talent, and women's wounds and rage. Though she was a people-pleasing \\"pretty girl\\" and a self-destroying \\"victim\\" she is a crucial figure in both the evolution of feminism / women's culture, the evolution of poetry, and the evolution of the concept of woman as artist."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"After Sylvia Plath's suicide, her last book, Ariel and Other Poems received critical acclaim and brought her worldwide fame. This new edition, forty years later returns more closely to her original thoughts on how the book would be.The original edition was changed somewhat by her husband, Ted Hughes who removed some poems and added others to protect some people who might have been harmed by the nature of the poems, and to better reflect some of her later work that was not included in her original thoughts.The new edition has a foreword by her daughter, Frieda Hughes who can better explain her father's actions and at the same time revert to the original thoughts of her mother. In addition, there is a facsimile of Plath's original Manuscript, complete with the editing notes she was making before she took her own life. Finally there is a series of versions of the title poem, Ariel, written in Plath's own hand showing how she developed a poem.This book is a destined to become a classic, the definitive collection of Sylvia Plath's Ariel."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"This is the much heralded Plath collection that everyone should read if you're into poetry, Plath, or heck, even good work. At a time of internal angst and turmoil, Mrs. Hughes cranked this out in a distinct voice and the greatest poems of her work are here: Lady Lazarus, Daddy, etc etc...It's a genuine treasure of poetry. If you can, get the voice recordings of Sylvia reading her own work. She has a soulful, determined, almost English (huh, wonder WHERE she got that from) intonation that makes you want to kiss her red mouth (that she was known for) and bless her for this beautiful, painful, stubbornly gorgeous poetry. Bravo, Plath!"},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"I was disappointed that the subject of this book was not Ariel Motorcycles like I had been led to believe.I would recommend all motorcyclists to purchase Roy Bacon's \\"Ariel, the post war years\\" or the \\"The book of the Ariel\\" by Peter Hartley. The latter has been recently reprinted by the AOMCC and is available via the club. We of course awaitthe definitive book on Ariels at present being written by amongst others, John Bradshaw.As to Ms Plath's offering, I found it little more than a masturbatory suicide note best suited to mopping up oil leaks. It was not insightful to the human condition other than to see what an awfully state of matrimony existed between the author and Hughes who could not bear to have his poor wife's work published in the order she wished but was still happy to reap the profits of her misery.If you wish for an unhappy and haunted future of introspection I suggest you purchase this book.If you want some fun buy a Red Hunter Motorcycle."},{"Title":"Ariel","review":"First off, I think in order to be fair, I should give a little background information on myself to validate my opinions.I am a 16 yeard old white female. I attend an Art's School for students who are gifted in music, dance, theatre, creative writing, or visual arts. The students selected are interviewed for about 30 minutes to 3 hours, depending on the core area. The odds of getting ito the school are about 1 out of 450. I attend the school for creative writing and not only do I have to write an abundant amount of work, I must also study both contemporary and classic literature. No, I am not trying to flatter myself or brag, but I think this information is necessary in order to understand my viewpoints on Plath's work.Also, like Plath, I have been committed to psychiatric hospitals and had to stay at one for 3 full years. Though I have never known Plath's diagnosis, it is probable that it is the same as mine: manic-depressive psychosis due to her severe depression, rage, and the amount of work she created right before her suicide.Reading the following information, it would seem I would be a perfect, die-hard, Plath fan. But, alas, I am not.Plath's work, in my opinion, is definitely not a work of \\"genius.\\" Some of her poems come close, but are still lacking in their astonishment that so many describe. The poems that touch on the border of \\"genius\\" are \\"Elm\\" (\\"I know the bottom, she says. I know it with my great tap root:/It is what you fear./I do not fear it: I have been there.\\" and \\"I am terrified by this dark thing/That sleeps in me;/All day I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity.\\"), \\"Widow\\" (Widow. The dead syllable, with its shadow/Of an echo, exposes the panel in the wall/Behind which the secret passages lies--stale air,/Fusty remembrances, the coiled-spring stair/That opens at the top onto nothing at all..../), \\"Poppies in July\\" (\\"Little poppies, little hell flames,/Do you do no harm?//You flicker. I cannot touch you./I put my hands among the flames. Nothing burns.//And it exhausts me to watch you/Flickering like that, wrinkly and clear red, like the skin of a mouth.//A mouth just bloodied.\\"), \\"Crossing the Water\\" (\\"The spirit of blackness is in us, it is in the fishes./A snag is lifting a valedictory, pale hand;//Stars open among the lilies./Are you not blinded by such expressionless sirens?/This is the silence of astounded souls.\\"), \\"Lady Lazarus\\" (\\"Dying/Is an art, like everything else./I do it exceptionally well.\\"), and a few other lines from some other poems that I don't think are worth mentioning at this point.Plath became famous because of her \\"suffering artist\\" personality that she displayed. Yes, she did stay in London with her young children in a freezing winter where she wrote her \\"Ariel\\" poems, but she wasn't the only one, and I'm sure much others had it worse.But, the most obvious reason she became famous was because of her suicide. This is why whiny, depressed, angst-ridden teenagers are drawn to Plath. They do not love her because of her dazzling poetry, but because she chose to kill her herself. Many teenagers, especially females, model themselves after Plath. They attempt suicide to live more \\"deeply\\" and write horrible Plath-like poetry that isn't even near the realm of Plath's work. They feel that Plath created this poetry just for them and that they are the only ones who truly understand how Plath felt, and no one else in the world (or their school) feels this way. They don't bother to understand the poetry. Instead they read it a few times, over analyze it, and decide that they also feel the same way and that they should also write poetry and attempt suicide.Die-hard, teenage Plath fans also tend to be incredibly close minded to any other poetry, expect for Plath and other suicidal poets (i.e. Anne Sexton). These people are just ignorant and think that they are \\"TRULY\\" unique, and that their poetry should be published so others can know that they suffer.I have had to read poetry by these types of people, and I tell you, they are very inadequate to the writing they CAN do, because many of them are very talented, but are narrow minded and only write about their so-called \\"sufferings.\\" I can tell by their thought processes that they have talent, but refuse to expand into different realms of poetry.Of course, when you write about suffering, it isn't always pathetic. Just don't make it the topic of your whole book of poetry. There is more to life then death.And, not just teenage Plath fans, but teenagers who write poetry in general usually don't edit and rewrite their work because they feel as though it takes the \\"soul\\" out of their work. They want to leave it \\"raw\\" and \\"unpolished.\\" They want people to feel what they were feeling in that exact moment. And this is why much of their poetry horrible: they don't believe in editing their work.Plath did edit her work. She was considered a professional. While standing in the bookstore and reading this book (I did not bother to purchase it) I read her original manuscripts. Obviously, the published ones were better. The most disappointing thing about this volume was that they only provided a few of her original manuscripts. What they should've done (or should do) instead is make a whole book dedicated to her original manuscripts so others can see her creative process and the value of editing and rewriting. Put the manuscripts first, and then the final poem. I think this would make out for a nice book....it might be worth $25.Those who feel that this book is worth the money are either the die-hard Plath fans, or educators of some sort, who for some bizarre reason need to purchase this book.Overall, I'm not a fan of Plath, so I cannot give a good rating to this book. The Collected Poems I would give 3 stars, only because you can see how much she progressed (for the better) in her poetry and it includes her all her published (and some previously unpublished) works.If you want to read good poetry, I suggest Emily Dickinson, or, if you want to stick to more contemporary poetry, Louise Gluck (\\"The Wild Iris\\" won a Pulitzer), or find some good translations for Rainer Maria Rilke, Anna Akhmatova, and Marina Tseteyeva. Plath just doesn't live up to the hype. If you suffer for your art, at least make sure it's \\"good\\" art."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"Excellent novel about a black man (Lucas Beauchamp) falsely accused of murdering a white man and the boy who believes him and sets out to prove his innocence. On the one hand, it's about sticking to your guns when you know a man is being wronged (&quot;Some things you must always be unable to bear. Some things you must never stop refusing to bear. Injustice and outrage and dishonor and shame. No matter how young you are or how old you have got. Not for kudos and not for cash: your picture in the paper nor money in the bank either. Just refuse to bear them&quot; (p201)). On the other hand, Faulkner goes off a bit at the end about the Civil War (no surprise here) and says that the North stuck to its guns too severely -- that most Southerners believed slavery was wrong but just needed the time to work it all out, not the strongarming into a position weren't ready to assume: &quot;. . .and you [the North] say At least we perish in the name of humanity and we [the South] reply When all is stricken but that nominative pronoun and that verb what price Lucas' humanity then?&quot;(p. 212). God, I love that man. This is a good one to start with if you're a Faulkner rookie -- it's pretty short and doesn't do any flipping around in time.As for all the comments about how bad Faulkner's grammar is (run-on sentences, no punctuation, etc. etc. ad nauseum), you guys are all forgetting that there are only rules governing these things when you're writing a paper for English Comp. In the real world, manipulating the language is what makes writers great. Say you don't like it, but don't say it's garbage just because it doesn't live up to Strunk and White. Being a critic is cool, being a criticaster is not."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"This is a story about a post-Civil War pre-civil rights southern town that almost gets up the gumption to lynch a falsely accused black man. This is also the coming-of-age story of one Chick Mallison, I think his last name is, who takes the initiative to prove the accused innocent. This is a platform for Faulkner to vent some political views through Chick's uncle, a successful southern lawyer who defends the prisoner. There's nothing really new about any of these themes.Really and truly what makes this book one to be remembered is that somehow Faulkner managed to write in such a way that he captured the way time and thought bend, expand and contract around each other. It would be impossible to give you a taste of this without inserting a quote that's two pages long, but once you get caught up in his long dream-like stream-of-consciousness flows, you almost find yourself jerking back to reality along with Chick when he is moving in and out of a sleep state over his breakfast after a long night of digging up graves and eluding murderers.Faulkner also manages to capture the ambiguous emotions that we all have around the powerful events and people in our lives. No human emotion or action is ever purely black or white; in Chick's case we get to hear all of the inner voices--need for love and approval, order and security; shame, anger, pity, wonder, fear, love--really I could go on and on, but the point is that they are mixed and presented on the page in the way that our emotions are--a constant flow of thoughts and voices, sometimes linked, sometimes random, sometimes contradictory, and often below the surface of our conscious mind.In truth, I have never really read anybody else who writes like this. I read the Sound and the Fury in my early twenties and found it a bit daunting, but now having read As I Lay Dying and Intruder in the Dust (at the age of 34) I think I'd like to give it another read, along with the rest of his works. By the way, for those of you who are struggling with any of Faulkner's works, try picking up a literary bio that explains the order in which he wrote them, where he was in his life, and what he was experimenting with (and I don't mean drugs). I have found all of that info to be enormously helpful and a spur to further reading. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"While not one of Faulkner's classics, this book is a fine introduction to the writer, his myth, his style and his story telling. While it appears on the surface to be a mystery, the book is deeply involved with southern consciousness attempting to deal with its own racial identity and the perceived impossibility of resolving it. Chick Mallison's quote regarding Pickett's Charge is the core of this work. \\"For every Southern boy fourteen years old, not once but whenever he wants it, there is the instant when it's still not yet two o'clock on that July afternoon in 1863...\\" Seems to me that there are still a lot of folks trying to work that out.Faulkner is never easy to read. It is dangerous art, and requires work on the part of the reader. If that is not your cup of tea, stay away. Ignore the one-star reviews written by the impatient people who seem to think that literature should be as easy to read, approachable and safe. If you are willing to do the work, there is great treasure in Yoknapatawpha County.In regards to the one-star review by the gentleman who intercepted the book because his fourteen year old had been asked to read it as a class assignment: yes, there are rules, but the dangerous artists know how to break them and in doing so transcend normal story-telling."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"I had to choose a novel for an independent reading assignment, so of course, being the striver I am, I had to choose an obscure Faulkner novel. I thought the book was excellent. Faulkner's rich prose helped to develop his deeply southern charachters. The culture of the South and it's deeply imbedded morals were brought out through Faulkner's lengthy sentences and gothic elements such as suspense and enhanced senses. The coming of age story of Chick Mallison and several subplots gave the novel many layers with which to envelop the reader. Overall, the novel turned out to be a tough read that was well worth the time."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"Stream of consciousness is not an easy form to read, but it is well worth the effort. This book is actually a mystery, so the ambiguities of the form are appropriate to the story. The language is poetic, very Southern. It reads like a murmur, a drawl. I tried to say it in my Brooklyn accent, and it doesn't work. It takes place in Mississippi in 1948, at the beginning of the civil rights movements in this country and addresses some of the questions raised by the sentiments in Congress at the time, in a very literary way. The characters are three-dimensional and paint a picture of the town: rednecks and middle class, farmers and townspeople, boys and old gentlewomen, deputy sheriffs and lawyers, blacks and whites. You may not agree with Faulkner's musings about the American character and the American destiny, but his thoughts are well worth reading."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"This is not my favorite Faulkner book, but it's not painful. However, it is a really interesting read for anyone familiar with To Kill a Mockingbird as it becomes exceedingly clear that Harper Lee ripped off an enormous amount from this book. Ok, I know, good writers borrow, great writers steal, but beyond the general plot similarity: black man accused of a crime he didn't commit told from a child's point of view saved by a goodly lawyer pillar of the community, there are some unbelievable details as well.For one, there is are two references to the shooting of a mad dog in Intruder, an event used to establish a character in an offhand way. That scene is extended memorably in Mockingbird. Another clincher for me is the closing of chapter X in Intruder where the sheriff is complaining about the racket made by, and I'm not kidding, a mockingbird. The fate of the mockingbird is left undetermined in a singularly Faulkner manner, but the intent to kill is clearly there. Twenty years later, we can assume that the bird is still alive because Harper has taught us it is a sin . . .I'm surprised I don't hear this shouted from the rooftops. It's not exactly Dark Side of the Moon and Oz, but you can't chalk this up to coincidence."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"&#34;Intruder in the Dust&#34; is another of the many faces (or facets) of William Faulkner. It's a fascinating tale of the efforts of two boys (one white, one black) to save the life of a Mississippi black man accused of shooting a white man in the back. The writing includes some of Faulkner's interesting---and to some readers, maddening---techniques of writing, including motives, thoughts, scenes described in the negative (what they are not) and the use of multiple nearly synonymous verbs side by side, as if he couldn't make up his mind which to use. While that may be true, I prefer to see it as his attempt to find the most precise nuance to given actions in which a single word doesn't quite &#34;get it.&#34;"},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"Panned by critics and written strictly to make money, I still find the story compelling and Faulkner's treatment of it excellent."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"Although not one of his major novels, Faulkner proves his worth in this unrelenting account of social conditions in the deep South.

Contains some of the most memorable imagery by Faulkner"},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"This book had incredible potential right from the beginning and in many ways, this potential was fulfilled. However, as Faulkner got further entrenched in his stream of consciousness technique and he continued to reiterate the significance of the events on what essentailly is a 24-36 hour period, I began to come to the conclusion that this must have started off as a short story and was extended strictly to satisfy elements of style and to send a message to the rest of the country (let The South solve its own Civil Rights problem). I have previously successfully navigated the stream of consciousness style in such books as Absalom Absalom! and found that in the retelling of a 50 year saga it was very effective. Here however, it seems to get in the way and serves only to extend a basic (but interesting) storyline from an evening read, to an extended read. I recommend it for the Faulkner fan since it was one of his rare commercial successes, but the Faulkner novice may be better off with easier books such as The Unvanquished or even for that matter Light in August."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"This novel is, in form, a thriller with a classic thriller plot- the fight to prove the innocence of a man accused of a crime he did not commit. (Alfred Hitchcock used this plot in a number of his films, and \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" was itself made into a very good film by Clarence Brown in 1949, only a year after its publication). Faulkner takes this basic plot and uses it to explore the problem of racism in America's Deep South; Harper Lee was later to take a similar plot, and use it for a similar purpose, in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".The book is set in Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County and its capital, Jefferson, based upon the real Lafayette County and Faulkner's own home town of Oxford. The innocent man wrongly accused is Lucas Beauchamp, an elderly, widowed black farmer. Although Beauchamp is honest and respectable, he is resented by many whites because he refuses to \\"behave like a nigger\\", that is to say behave in a servile manner. When a white man named Vinson Gowrie is shot dead, Beauchamp is accused of the crime. Gowrie was from Beat Four, a wild, hilly district of the county, whose white inhabitants are noted for their lawless ways and their ingrained prejudices against blacks. A mob, mostly members of Gowrie's extended family, gathers in Jefferson, threatening to break into the jail and lynch Beauchamp.The story is told through the eyes of Charles Mallison, the sixteen-year-old nephew of Gavin Stevens, the relatively liberal white lawyer who acts for Beauchamp. Charles, who regards himself as being in Beauchamp's debt ever since, four years earlier, the old man rescued him after he fell in a stream, sets out to prove that Beauchamp did not fire the fatal shot. Together with his black friend Aleck and Miss Habersham, an elderly spinster (did Faulkner derive her name from Dickens' Miss Havisham?) he makes the dangerous body to Beat Four to exhume the body of the murdered man- and makes a surprising discovery.Racial issues play an important part in Faulkner's work; indeed, it would probably be difficult for any Southern writer to avoid them altogether. His own views on the topic, however, seem to have been rather mixed. On the one hand he was an anti-racist, regarding the intolerant prejudice of many white Southerners as an affront to both decency and rationality. On the other hand, he was himself a proud Southerner, conscious of his family's Confederate heritage; his great-grandfather, Colonel William Falkner (thus spelt), had been a Confederate hero in the Civil War. In this novel Faulkner himself seems to adopt what might be called a neo-Confederate position, believing that, if the South could not be an independent, sovereign state it should at least form a culturally autonomous unit within the USA and have the right to deal with its own problems without interference from the North. He devotes several pages of the novel to his thesis that attempts by outsiders to combat racism in the south had actually been counter-productive and that black Southerners would never achieve equality until white Southerners were allowed to address the issue on their own terms.The novel was written in the late forties, before the rise of the Civil Rights movement, and I think that Faulkner was wrong about race. The large-scale exodus of rural Southern blacks to Northern industrial cities in the first half of the twentieth century meant that race relations could no longer (if indeed they ever could) be thought of as solely a Southern issue. Since 1948 race relations in America have seen an immense change for the better; as I write this in October 2008 it seems quite likely that next month Barack Obama will not only be elected America's first black President but will also carry several Southern states. This change would not have been possible without the Civil Rights movement and the active involvement of Northerners, both black and white, and of the institutions of the Federal government.Despite my disagreements with him, I nevertheless found Faulkner's analysis of the South's racial problems a stimulating and thought-provoking one. The characters are, for the most part, memorable and powerfully drawn. I did not, however, altogether enjoy this book, largely because of the eccentricities of the prose style that the author adopts here, a prose style characterised by long, rambling (and often syntactically disorganised) sentences, sometimes extending over several pages. He also has a weakness for obscure vocabulary items.Faulkner was, presumably, aiming at the sort of stream-of-consciousness style he had used to good effect in other, better, novels, such as \\"As I Lay Dying\\". This style can be a valuable tool for showing us the world through the eyes of a fictional character or, in the case of \\"As I Lay Dying\\" which uses first-person multiple-narrator technique, through the eyes of a string of different characters. When stream-of-consciousness is used to represent the writer's own authorial voice, it becomes much less effective. \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is a third-person narrative, and, although Charles is the central character, we are not always certain if it is his voice we are hearing, or the author's. The effect is less stream-of-consciousness than stream-of-confusion. As a result of this uncertainty, and of his often impenetrable syntax, the author's train of thought is in places difficult to follow, which means that, despite its interesting themes, \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is not as effective a book as it could have been."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"I had been looking for William Faulkner's \\"Intruder in the Dust\\", because I wanted to have Charlie Mallison's quote about Pickett's Charge on file.The copy sent to me was hard cover, 16th printing of the first edition, in excellent shape, and meets my requirements in every way.I am totally satisfied."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"he purposely made the sentences long like that for a reason. through his style, he was trying to show you the mindset of people in the South after World War 2.

It is not an easy romp through the pages, but with patience and the ability to watch for key nouns and verbs, you will enjoy this book with the layers of intrigue it offers. Kind of like peeling an onion to get to the core. Faulkner's style is unmistakable and takes some practice to enjoy and decipher. Few beginning readers should be turned loose on their own to cut their literary teeth on this author, however."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"We are in the South, in a rural city and area. A crime is committed, a white man is shot dead and an old black man is arrested for it on Saturday night, red-handed, because he was next to the dead shot body with a gun in his pocket. This black man has had a past of refusing samboism. He always behaved in a non standard way for a black man in the South. No question is asked. A lawyer is called by the black man and the lawyer does not ask questions and assumes the black man is guilty of the crime he is accused of committing. It will take a white teenager (16 and the lawyer's nephew), a black teenager (his friend) and a white older lady with a truck to accept to go and explore the grave of the dead man on the request of the black man. They find out the man in the grave is not the man it should be, but is another assassinated white man. And then the plot thickens tremendously because these three people plus the lawyer will manage to take over and convince the sheriff to go investigate this tomb with them. The father and two sons of the victim have been summoned by the sheriff. The two sons will dig out the grave and find it empty. Then they all manage to find the body the teenagers and the woman had found more or less carelessly hidden in some sand and the body of the first assassinated person in a patch of quicksand. The black man is definitely saved. The criminal will be found out to be a fourth son of the old man, a brother of the victim himself because the murdering brother was cheating some wood out of a forest patch that was being cut down and sawn into boards to be sold later on, at a profit of course, from the assassinated brother with an accomplice, the second man who was killed two days later and hidden in the assassinated brother's tomb. This murdering brother will be forced to commit suicide in jail for the white community not to have a trial, not to have to hang a white man for the killing of two white men while at first a black man had been accused and had by pure chance escaped a lynching. But the book is interesting for a lot more than this murder plot. It is no thriller because we nearly know from the very start that the lynching will not happen. The interest of the book is in the narrator who looks at the situation and events through the sole eyes of the lawyer's nephew that is always referred to as \\"he\\", third person singular, and never with a name. This awkward narration creates a distanciation in the fictional voyeurism of the book that kind of keeps us active and alert. The second interest is in the long speeches and explanations the lawyer delivers to his nephew in order to initiate him to adulthood. The discourse is a general speculation about racism, samboism, the liberation of black people or rather of the South from this samboism and racism, how it can only happen from inside and not from outside, the reaction of the whites in front of this accused black and the possibility or impossibility of a lynching, etc. It is a close examination of the racial conscience of the South, and not only the whites, but also the blacks. The third interest is in the initiation of this young teenager that goes far beyond only understanding the southern mind, the southern past and future, the southern race relations and how to free them from the heritage of slavery and the end of it imposed from outside. It has to do with physical growing and even the sexual or emotional levels of that growing, how some sexual emotion can appear in the strangest of all situations and distort the teenager's vision for a while. Finally it also depicts the complexity and beauty, contradictory confusion and clarity of their mentality and consciousness, or unconsciousness. Faulkner has it all wrong as for how the liberation of the blacks will come, but it does not matter : it represents the vision the whites had at a certain moment in history, in fact between the two world wars. He could not take into account the consequences of WW2 on the mental liberation of the black community and particularly the weight and power northern blacks will find in the war that will make them go down South, if necessary and with white people too eventually, to help their black brothers down South to get on the road to civil liberties. But it is this very historical limitation that makes the novel all the more interesting.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"Thanks to its stream-of-conscious narrative, this book leans more toward the incomprehensible side of Faulkner's canon, despite a simple plot that often feels as if it would have been suited to a short story and was dragged out to fit the necessary length for a full-length book.

HOW CAN I DO THIS IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK ITSELF?THIS BOOK IS SAID TO BE A GREAT PEICE OF AMERICAN LITERATURE BUT I DISAGREE COMPLETELY.I THINK IT'S REALLY BAD."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"\\"Intruder in the Dust\\" wraps a fine mystery around and through a story that could only happen in Faulkner country, yet is a timeless monument to man's stubbornness, stupidity and honor. Mr. Faulkner enfolds his prose around you like kudzu and makes you part of his world.In a small Mississippi town in 1948, black Lucas Beauchamp is wrongfully arrested for shooting white Vinson Cowrie in the back. Sixteen-year old Charles Mallison owes Lucas a debt of honor incurred four years ago. Lucas hires Charles' cynical uncle, Gavin Stevens, to defend him. The most pressing matter is not Lucas' guilt or innocence; it is keeping him from getting lynched before he is arraigned. Lucas is a nightmare of a client. He is stubborn, stiff necked and proud. He dresses like an old time plantation owner and neither owes nor accepts favors from anyone. Uncle Gavin is trying to save Lucas' neck while Charles is trying to clear him. Gavin laments that Lucas would be easier to keep alive if \\"he would just ACT like a n----r.\\" This Lucas refuses to do. There is body snatching, graveyards at night and some thoroughly frightening characters to liven up the journey.Another reviewer mentioned \\"drunk on his prose,\\" and it is a very apt description. It works best if read aloud; you will find Faulkner's rhythm and make it your own. The long sentences don't trouble if you just let his prose carry you along. Mr. Faulkner thinks any southern woman over 35 years old is a secret Amazon of quiet strength and fortitude, which makes for interesting characters, but is a little hard on credibility. There is long section on how \\"outsiders\\" (read \\"Northerners\\") have interfered and thereby delayed integration. However true or false this may be, it slowed the story down and seemed tacked on.\\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is not generally ranked with \\"premier\\" Faulkner (\\"Light in August,\\" \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\"), but it stands on its own as a fine read and certainly is one of his best post-WWII books.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"No it's not one of Faulkner's &quot;big four&quot; (the classics &quot;The Sound and the Fury,&quot; &quot;As I Lay Dying,&quot; &quot;Light in August&quot; and &quot;Absalom! Absalom!&quot;), but &quot;Intruder in the Dust&quot; is certainly in his next tier of top novels, and is the one book that can fly in the face of the &quot;he never wrote anything great after World War II&quot; way of thinking. I enjoyed this book immensely. Yes, the sentences tend to be extremely long and the book is slow to get going, but find Faulkner's rhythm and stick with the story; you'll be glad you did. As always, the highlight is Faulkner's beautiful use of language, which always towers over whatever story he's writing and whatever flaws you may stumble upon along the way. This story of a black man wrongly accused of murder doesn't always go where you think it will or even where you want it to, but somehow it works brilliantly. Faulkner throws in his take (apparently) on how the South should handle civil rights on its own -- not really necessary to include and a small flaw in the book, I think. But stick with it, get drunk on the prose and enjoy an underappreciated work from a master. This relatively short book will be over too soon."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"After twenty years of writing experimental fiction and Hollywood screenplays, Faulkner seemed destined to create a novel like \\"Intruder in the Dust\\"--a noir-ish mystery set in Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, that incorporates his signature prose style into a continuing commentary on race relations in the South. The premise of the accusation of a black man for the murder of a white man may seem too facile, but the novel does not rely solely or even primarily on plot-driven intrigue; it is the criminal aspect only as it relates to the prevalent social attitudes that generates interest.One day a local white man named Vinson Gowrie is found shot to death, and a black man named Lucas Beauchamp is arrested at the scene and charged with the murder. In this part of the country at this time in history, a black man who is even suspected of murdering a white man is in danger of being lynched, especially by people like Gowrie's relatives, who are from a particularly rough and bloodthirsty enclave living in an area called Beat Four.The story is told in the third person but from the viewpoint of a white boy named Charles \\"Chick\\" Mallison, who in the past has tried to befriend the solitary but kind Beauchamp and is convinced of his innocence. With the help of his uncle Gavin Stevens, a lawyer who decides to represent Beauchamp, his black friend Aleck Sander, and an elderly spinster named Miss Habersham, Chick investigates the matter and discovers, unsurprisingly, that there is more to the case than initially meets the eye.This sounds like generic pulp detective stuff, and indeed there is not much to say about the plot except that it involves a lumber scam, quicksand, a false grave, and a real culprit who is not too bright; but what makes this novel worth reading is the insight it gives about how easily in this milieu a black man can conveniently take the heat for a white man's crime, regardless of provability of guilt, and the ethical implications that arise from this situation. There is a particular manner in which the characters communicate with each other that reveals this information, conveying Faulkner's sublime sense of the range of personal moralities.Faulkner has several narrative modes at his disposal, and the one he chooses here is similar to that of \\"Absalom! Absalom!\\", employing impossibly long and syntactically deformed run-on sentences that compress copious visual detail into quickly moving scenic impressions. This technique could annoy many, but for those who know how to \\"read\\" Faulkner, it may be accepted as a characteristic part of the package. I'd place \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" somewhat below \\"Sanctuary\\" as an aesthetic achievement, but I still commend it as satisfying, like that tasty last bit of dessert after a full meal."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"This novel has a traditional detective story plot and a conventional attitude about race relations (although it was progressive for the South in the late 40s). After that, all bets are off. The style is like a thicket, but that's because Faulkner puts you into the head of a confused boy caught up in events beyond his control. Chick Mallison is white, and his friend Aleck Sander is black (Aleck Sander doesn't know his name isn't two words, because he can't read or write). The paired adult characters of equivalent race are Chick's uncle, Gavin Stevens, a lawyer, who defends Lucas Beauchamp (pronounced \\"Beecham\\"), a black tenant farmer accused of a murder he didn't commit by the people who did it. They know that in a prejudiced society, white people are likely to believe a black man is guilty, so they try to palm it off on him. Lucas is a rather severe character who often doesn't seem to appreciate the help he's getting (part of the plot involves trying to prevent the citizens from pulling him out of jail and lynching him), but he's a marvelous character and something of a father figure to Chick by the end of the book. Reading the book is a bit of a chore at first, but I got through it in high school years ago, and am reading it now for the third time. If you want some help getting into the book, you might try a \\"Masterplots\\" description of it or a reader's guide to Faulkner (there are several around). You might also look for the 1949 film based on the book, which was filmed in Faulkner's home town of Oxford, Mississippi, with local citizens as extras, and with the great Juano Hernandez playing Lucas."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"I am in 11th grade, and my hackles naturally went up upon reading the several reviews written by high schoolers on the subject of this novel. Do not be put off by such efforts to defile a masterpiece. This is one of the most profound and convincing novels I have ever read.Tolstoy once wrote that the success of any work of art depends ultimately upon the artist's maintaining an \\"independent moral relation\\" to his subject, and that he who does not bring to his work a fresh and enlightened view of the universe will invariably fail in attempting to create good art. Applying this criterion to Intruder in the Dust, Faulkner's novel stands as a paradigm of great art; for its moral scope and philosophical perspective are singularly awesome. Faulkner is simultaneously sympathetic toward and critical of that Southern society which serves as his subject, and yet he manages never to stoop to petty preaching or outright sermonizing. His work is a marvel of artistic delicacy and intensity. Bravo."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"Those who follow the AP Book of Rules for writing (i.e., subject, predicate, no commas, no decora) will have a tough time negotiating Faulkner's peregrinating sentences, but it's worth it. This book delivers several experiences at one time: a look at the Southern social codes, a textured appraisal of racial relations, an adolescent's step off into adult life, and an entertaining murder mystery. The lead characters are nicely drawn, with surprises; the action and crowd scenes are portrayed in easily visualized imagery. For all the Southern writing I've read, this added more information about the culture and people. I feel sorry for those who don't have the patience for Faulkner's style: a taste for it isn't that difficult to acquire and it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"This novel is not only a supervivid representation of the ugly and cowardly side of racism, but also one of the best coming of age stories I've ever read. Funny as well as emotional detail, and between the lines, Faulkner explores and displays in all their glory and infamy the connections between families, friends, strangers, and enemies, to a point further than others are brave enough to go."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"... the \\"owner\\" of which was a man who said \\"mister\\" to whites, but did not really mean it. The meal was served to 12 year old Charles Mallison, after he had fallen in an icy pond, and the server, who didn't mean mister, was Lucas Beauchamp. Four years later the \\"bill\\" for those collard greens would come due, and it would be Mallison's actions that would save Beauchamp's life. \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is one of Faulkner's later works, written just after World War II. The perennial themes of his works are exhibited: his examination of life in barely fictional Yoknapatawpha County, whose county seat is Jefferson, (Oxford, MS) and the continued fall-out from America's \\"original sin,\\" slavery. From Faulkner's majestically southern mansion of Rowan Oaks, he wrote in fear of the \\"white trash\\" that surrounded him, so often identified as the Snopes family, but in this novel they are transformed into the Gowries, from \\"Beat Four.\\" Faulkner's stream-of-consciousness style always challenges the reader to stay engaged, or a vital clue to the story will be missed. And like those slower internet connections, he \\"backs and fills\\" his pixels, slowly revealing the entire story. This is also an excellent \\"mystery\\" novel; the particular situations involving the grave seem \\"impossible,\\" but Faulkner makes it all so understandable, masterfully so, in the fullness of time. Faulkner is certainly not for the \\"fun read\\" crowd, nor, apparently, based on the reviews posted here, for sophomores in \\"Advanced Placement\\" English. I shutter at the thought of how many students have become confirmed non-readers of serious books for the rest of their lives as a result of such classes.I am an immense fan of Faulkner, and still hope to read or re-read all his works. This time it was a re-read, after 35 or so years, and fortunately, even the first time was not a dreaded school assignment. There remain the wonderful, original descriptive passages that contain nuggets like: \\"...and forlorn across the long peaceful creep of late afternoon, into the mauve windless dome of dusk...\\" and \\"...if there were only some way to efface the clumsy room-devouring carcasses which can be done but the memory which cannot.\\" But on the re-read I noticed Faulkner's \\"feet of clay.\\" In referring to a patched roof, how much meaning is conveyed by \\"insolent promptitude,\\" or a lathe's \\"ineluctable shaft,\\" or \\"incredulous disbelief\\"?But the real \\"feet of clay\\" are political, and there is a three page defense of the South's \\"go slow\\" policy for granting Blacks equal rights. The passage doesn't work in a literary sense, in that it plops, \\"cut and pasted,\\" interrupting the dramatic tension of an enthralling mystery. Consider: \\"...only we (meaning white Southerners) must do it, and we alone without help or interference or even (thank you) advice since only we can if Lucas's equality is to be anything more than its own prisoner inside an impregnable barricade of the direct heirs of the victory of 1861-1865...\\" James Baldwin, in \\"Nobody Knows My Name,\\" in his chapter entitled \\"Faulkner and Desegregation,\\" offers the seminal critique of such an attitude: \\"After more than two hundred years in slavery and ninety years of quasi-freedom, it is hard to think very highly of William Faulkner's advice to \`go slow.' \`They don't mean go slow,' Thurgood Marshall is reported to have said, \`they mean don't go.'\\"Upon the re-read I was also struck by how derivative Harper Lee's classic book,To Kill a Mockingbirdis, down to the two different men, both sitting in the doorway of the jailhouse, to prevent a lynching, as well as even the mockingbird! It is a point another reviewer made, but I had never realized it before, nor seen it in a critique of Lee's work.Faulkner may be most associated with black-white relations, but he also has something to say about male-female relations. Consider: \\"...just enough dirt to hide the body temporarily from sight with something of that frantic desperation of the wife flinging her peignoir over the lover's forgotten glove...\\" or \\"I am fifty-plus years old,' his uncle said. \`I spent the middle fifteen of them fumbling beneath skirts. My experience was that few of them were interested in love or sex either. They wanted to be married.'\\"It pains me to knock a star from a Nobel-prize winning \\"idol,\\" but the \\"feet of clay\\" are most certainly there."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"Probably one of the most intense books I've ever read -- well worth the effort. People complain about the way it's written, but although English is not my native language, I do not find this book particularly difficult to read.

Warning: the first part of the mystery is very hard to understand because we don't know what's going on, but towards the end it will reveal what happened. Another downfall of this book is the way Faulkner puts the narrator in third person, using &quot;he&quot; and of course there are other &quot;he's&quot; in the story which makes it very difficult to figure out who's talking; if this is his type of writing, he should've used at least a capital H to distinguish when &quot;he&quot; is the narrator and &quot;he&quot; is another person, and the other characters, even though the reader might be confused who they are at first, Faulkner will describe them more throughout the book. Warning: there are also flashbacks which are put in parentheses, and yes sometimes the parentheses will be about 1 page long, so be careful. Well in conclusion, this is a good book but is badly structured. Advice: since the sentences are extremely long, sometimes to 2 pages, you must read it out loud, like you're talking to someone, and must read it with feeling and criticism; another advice: don't read this book at night while lying on a bed, you will be wear out and become very sleepy and cannot concentrate; read it during daytime and sit on a chair and read, not on a bed.

The symbolism is OK if you're into that sort of thing.On the negative: He must have written this while out and out drunk and the editor, publisher and the adoring public make great allowance because this is \\"William Faulkner\\". The sentences are not just run-on, but change subjects midstream and simply make no sense. The dialogue is the same as the narrative except for the quotes surrounding it and thus since everyone talks the same, there is not much for characterization.

When it came to ordinary literature, he boldly repudiated. His goal in literature remains as obscure as his style of writing. And Intruder in the Dust is a perfect example of what Faulkner was made of.Rooted in the South - in his famous Yoknapatawpha County - Intruder in the Dust is the story of Lucas Beauchamp and the men who toil for his freedom. It's a story that, though complex, is touching and wonderful. A nonconformical work of art that is surreal in language and impressionistic in symbolism.This book will not keep you at the edge of your seat, but it will indeed make you think. There's, of course, some entertainment (for it's the major characteristic of any novel), but the novel is mostly made of stuff to make you think. And I guess that's all that really matters when one reads Faulkner: to think."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"As a sophomore in high school nearly 10 years ago, I had a terrible experience with this book. The plot was confusing and complicated by tough vocabulary and grammar. In the version I had borrowed from the school, the \\"long sentence\\" was (I'm pretty sure) around 7 pages (5x7 size pages).Recently, I tried to pick it up again, convinced by my wife, who had liked reading Faulkner. I found it only slightly easier, with no real improvement. I believe that the problem stems from something that Douglas Adams had once said: \\"I'm trying to be literate, not literary.\\" I get the feeling that Faulkner was trying to create literature as an artform, rather than try to convey his story to the masses.I can appreciate that many people love this story, and that it is a literary masterpiece, but I cannot say that I think it is good."},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"I have a Literature exam tomorrow - kind of a final- and this is one of the books included.

The sentences are extremely long and by the time you get to the end of one, you don't even know what you read. I think that Faulkner's &quot;stream of conciousness&quot; writing is very interesting - you need to read it as if you were having a conversation with Faulker and he's telling you the story and he's jumping all over the place. I SHOULD TAKE MY OWN ADVICE...BUT ANYWAY GIVE IT A CHANCE!"},{"Title":"Intruder in the Dust","review":"Reading this book was a tremendous pain in the ***. The mystery and plot could have been greatly enthralling if I hadn't spent so much time trying to unwind Faulkner's sentences. Not only were the sentences long and complex, there were so many rambling thoughts between the action that I missed the thought and the action.

It plays off of the co-editor Theo Dorgan's work with the earlier \\"Great Book of Ireland\\" in format and intent. This new Leabhar M&oacute;r commemorates 1500 years of cross-channel cultural connection between Scotland and Ireland. The 100 poems in the Irish and Scots Gaelic languages (here with translations) were nominated by poets (both as judges and contributors) and span from the 6th c CE to today. Fifty artists each from Ireland and Scotland were commissioned to use graphic media (calligraphy, typography, collage, photography, and all the varieties of ink, pen, brush, and paint) to enhance and play off the verses. The lines of the poems, in fact, are partially inscribed on each of the artworks: this alone links the hundred poems and representations to each other.The themes lament and celebrate. The work emerges from a period of hope with the peace in the North of Ireland symbolizing a reapproachment with the warring sides, each of whom in Ulster drew on Gaelic images and rhetoric in their territorial struggle. Also, such efforts as the Colmcille Project seek to re-orient the perspective of not so much British as Celtic isles and nations in the North Atlantic: this book carries such a mission into the realms of the aesthetic and the visual. The attention devoted to English, Scots Gaelic, and Irish, therefore, balances these three living sources of the words and ideas imagined here.Essays on the poetic traditions, the art, and capsule bios of the writers and artists enhance this handsome volume. The originals were displayed in exhibition before being bound on handmade paper. A website also shows a sample of the work; the BBC also gave radio and TV coverage to this millennial project celebrating Gaelic history and identity. The content rewards close study, often with a magnifying glass, as you'd view a medieval manuscript. The scope recalls such disparate monuments as the Apocalypse Spanish texts of Beatus of Liebana (themselves inspiration for Umberto Eco's \\"Name of the Rose\\"), the ancient portrait of a Roman matron, fashion shoots and gallery photography, iconography, and doubtless dozens more influences I lack the erudition to compare."},{"Title":"An Leabhar Mr - The Great Book of Gaelic","review":"Cho h-&agrave;lainn!

Also the impact of Alison Baker's wonderful opening sentences gets lost when a story is too long.It's 80 pages about a guy whose son has been killed and who has left his wife to live in the woods and commune with something or other. He does encounter a number of Alison Baker type people and animals (a homesick grizzly bear, an intrusive rooster, a bad cat, an elusive cougar, a runaway dog) but I thought the hand of Raymond Carver was heavy and there was too much fine writing like \\"soggy seedheads of last summer's fireweed and thistle\\" that uses botanical erudition to give a spurious air of exactitude.(Can you see that seedheads are soggy though a pair of binoculars?)"},{"Title":"When Life Throws You a Curveball.Hit It: Simple Wisdom for Life's Ups and Downs","review":"There are times when we need to stop groveling in our self pity and garner the courage to get up.

Doctor Thorne (third in the series) left me satisfied, and I can recommend it. It contains fewer of the engaging, and for me novel, nuances of 19th century Church of England politics. Instead it is a rustic tale, somewhat contrived, compensated by a set of plausible characters who held my interest. Ever since the author in the earlier \\"The Warden\\" effectively punctured my elevated opinion of C. Dickens, I've been contrasting the two contemporaries. Yes, Dickens remains one of my favorites. But, his caricatures are more exagerated than Trollope's; I can easily envision both the characters and dialogue as of the type that actually would occur, having known analogs in the rural area in which I was raised. No, it's not Great Expectations; but Doctor Thorne is good, and probably a better picture of 19th century England."},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL.

Not at all bad for a book which in its Penguin version has nearly 600 small-print pages. I worked on a military newspaper for a couple years where I did proofreading about two days a week, so I trust myself on this matter. Another reviewer suggests the Kindle edition has so many errors it had to be given up. Not so, though of course another Kindle edition may be in question. I'm talking about the one you can download for $0.00.The most confusing, and most amusing, error came about three quarters of the way through the book: \\"The horses were ordered on the next day for three, and, as two, Mr Gazebee came to the house.\\"That took me a minute to catch: \\"as two\\" should be \\"at two.\\"Once or twice I thought a sentence might have dropped out, but couldn't be sure. The book was quite readable, and of course it's a delightful part of the Barsetshire series.Most of the other Barsetshire novels have Penguin annotated Kindle versions available here for about ten dollars. I prefer those, but DOCTOR THORNE is available on Kindle only in bare bones versions. Fortunately Trollope writes so straightforwardly that missing annotations for one volume of the series is no great loss.Note, too, that for some reason the word \\"Penguin\\" must be typed in when asking for Kindle novels or none of the Penguin Kindles becomes visible to the online shopper. I don't know if this is eclumsiness or part of a war between Penguin and Amazon. The same is true for Oxford World's Classics Kindle editions.For what it's worth, the Penguin FRAMLEY PARSONAGE has eight or ten typos, almost as many as here, and the ones in the notes are worse than anything in DOCTOR THORNE, including two-line repeats on two separate occasions.

In neat, well-turned prose, he details the conflicts and resolutions of characters and situations like a good-humoured commentator describing the movement of pieces in a game of chess.Perhaps there are times when the chess pieces and their moves are not fascinating as they might be, and perhaps there are times when the commentary is not as sharp and concise as it might be. Such is the case you will find if you read \\"Doctor Thorne\\" after its preceding Barsetshire novels, \\"The Warden\\" and \\"Barchester Towers\\". Whereas they both presented cogent dilemmas, suspense and conflict, \\"Doctor Thorne\\" works only on the \\"Will A and B Overcome Obstacles to Their Marriage?\\" formula.Nevertheless, Anthony Trollope can still keep me reading this book happily for the third or fourth time.

Amazing how society has evolved, yes, editing mistakes - but it was FREE"},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL. SET.","review":"This is ostensibly a love story between headstrong young squire Frank Gresham and Mary Thorne, the illegitimate niece of the title character. As Trollope humorously points out at the beginning, Dr. Thorne will be seen to be the true hero, although being a middle-aged doctor he doesn't really fit the bill, so we'll have Frank and Mary's love story as well. This is typical of Trollope's humorous winks and asides to his reader, and part of the fun of entering his vanished world. Dr. Thorne and his outstanding character are really the centerpiece of this story, but the romantic struggles of the young couple illustrate the importance of blood, rank and money among the upper classes in Victorian England. The story is propelled forward and the real motives and makeup of the characters revealed as the stormy romance between Frank and Mary develops.I'm working my way through Trollope, since we never got to him in high school or college English Lit. I think that's a shame and I hope it's been rectified since I took those classes a LOOOOOONG time ago; I love his satirical eye and spot-on portraits of the pretensions of both the emerging middle-class and the declining yet still all-powerful aristocratic and gentry class. He peoples his novels with an amazing array of pompous, preening doctors, lawyers and clergymen and spouses with hilarious and apt names like \\"Dr. Fillgrave\\", \\"Bishop and Mrs. Proudie\\" and the law firm of \\"Messrs. Slow & Bideawhile\\", while affectionately yet expertly skewering their hypocrisy and very human foibles. He does the same for the aristocrats and their almighty reverance for the twin grails of \\"Blood & Rank\\" - to be honored at all costs, unless of course one becomes \\"embarrassed\\" by debt as Squire Gresham does here, and then it's perfectly acceptable to hold one's nose and sell off the eldest son and heir (Frank) to a wealthy scion of the appalling (yet necessary) merchant class - here, the hilarious Miss Dunstable, several years older than Frank and heiress to a fortune made from hawking a patent medicine called the \\"oil of Lebanon\\"."},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL.

He has married Lady Arabella DeCourcy, a Whig family, and so after the dissolution of Parliament, he fails to maintain his seat.There are many children, mostly girls, except for the eldest, another Frank. By 1854 the son has been educated at Harrow and is attending Cambridge. Dr. Thorne lives at Greshamsbury with his niece, Mary Thorne. Mary is educated with Lady Arabella's daughters, Augusta and Beatrice Gresham. She studies French, German, and music. The squire of Greshamsbury struggles with debt and poverty. Dr. Thorne arranges his loans for him with Sir Roger Scratcherd.Augusta accepts Mr. Moffat's offer of marriage. (This later comes to nothing.) Mary makes the DeCourcy cousins angry with her as Augusta's wedding is planned. Lady Amelia, his aunt, declares that Frank must marry money, (to save his patrimony). Nearly simultaneously Mary Thorne learns enough of her dubious beginnings to understand that she is duty-bound to discourage Frank's romantic leanings in her direction.As things develop, Mary is banned from visiting Gresham family members, and her uncle, in sympathy, decides to limit his involvement with the family to professional matters. Much of the plot is in the nature of a Cinderella or Romeo and Juliet story. I do not mean that Trollope needed models for his plots, just that in cases of matrimony, the issues of money and blood arose often.This is a smashing book."},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL. SET.","review":"Doctor Thorne is the third novel in the six set Barsetshire Novels. These delightful fictional masterpieces deal with life in the clerical world of Barset. Trollope completed this work on the way home from a postal inspection tour of Egypt in 1858. This novel is a little over 500 pages making it one of the \\"shorter\\" works of the series.The plot is simple. Doctor Thorne is the guardian of the beautiful Mary who is the illegitimate daughter of his deceased brother Henry. Mary is in love with Frank Gresham who comes from a local gentry family. Frank's family has fallen on hard times so his parents demand he marry a rich woman. The Greshams are related to the super rich De Courcey family who reside on an estate in Barsetshire. This side of the family is also against Frank's marrying Mary Thorne. Frank is tempted to fall in love with the wealthy and eccentric Miss Dunstable. She will, however, marry Dr. Thorne in a later novel in the series.As in all Trollope novels there are other characters. Mr. Oriel weds Beatrice who is one of Frank's sisters. Oriel is a clergyman and the couple are happy.Roger Scatchard is the man who killed Henry Thorne. Henry had fathered a child with Roger's sister named Mary. Mary's mother marries a man and moves to the United States. She never returns home to England. Scatcherd served six months in prison for the violent crime but then became a wealthy engineer. He dies an alcoholic as does his son Louis Phillipe Scatcherd. Trollope probably based the character of Roger Scatcherd on that of builder Sir Morton Peto or of railway millionaire George King.Mary inherits the Scatcherd fortune with Louis Phillipe dies of alcoholism. When Frank's mother learn of this she gives her approval to his wedding of the now affluent Mary. All ends well for the Greshams.The first name of Dr. Thorne is Thomas. This may be a reference to Trollope's brother Thomas who suggested the plot of the story to his novelist writing brother.Humorous scenes abound in the descriptions of the money loving De Courceys, a rural election and the rivalry existing between Dr. Thorne and local doctors such as the immortal Dr. Fillgrave.Anthony Trollope (1815-1882) is less heralded in America than his fellow Victorians Dickens, Thackery or Eliot but his characters are a realistic portrait of how real men and women of the middle and upper classes lived in Victorian Great Britain.I discovered the wonders of Trollope over forty years ago and have found him to be a wise, witty and wonderful companion throughout life. Dr. Thorne is a good first Trollope novel for readers not familiar with his voluminous work. Excellent and recommended!"},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL.

SET.","review":"(3.5 stars) The third in the Chronicles of Barsetshire, Dr. Thorne is not a satire like the mild satire of The Warden or the more pointed ecclesiastical satire of Barchester Towers. Instead, this novel is pure melodrama, the story of Mary Thorne, a girl of uncertain parentage. Mary, often in the company of the Gresham sisters, with whom she has been schooled, is attracted to their brother Frank.The Greshams, of a high social level, own a dilapidated estate, and their increasing debts have left them owing many wealthy landowners and lenders. Their only hope is that Frank, who will inherit the estate, marry a wealthy woman who will solve their cash-flow problems by trading her wealth for his family's status. Frank, however, is in love with Mary.As Mary is increasingly ostracized because of her lack of high birth, she and Frank become increasingly in love. Despite other attempts to introduce Frank to wealthy, older women who might marry him and solve the estate's financial problems, he remains true to Mary. When Sir Roger Scratcherd, in poor health, decides to redo his will to honor the oldest child of his absent sister Mary, the scene is set for a change of fortunes.Though the earlier Barsetshire novels are highly satiric, casting wry glances at the church and its behavior, this novel is more rooted in day to day activities, accurately depicting the class divisions in England at the time and emphasizing their absurdities. These divisions are so ingrained in society that there is little hope for any change and even less for any recognition that they might be morally wrong. Mary Thorne is the perfect little lady, despite her lack of family \\"background,\\" and she shows those more \\"elevated\\" than she that she is more a lady than they are. The novel follows standard plot lines, and there is little doubt, throughout, that the romantic complications will be resolved as the reader hopes. The good and honest characters of low birth are rewarded, and the snobs and their heirs are brought low.Though Trollope is as good as always with his dialogue and his pointed observations, this novel lacks the punch of his earlier satires. The action and melodrama are predictable, and the ending is completely expected. Adding to the complexity of life in Barchester, this novel provides some new characters for this community (and series), and suggests new complications for future novels of the Barset Chronicles. n Mary WhippleThe Warden, Book 1, Chronicles of Barsetshire, 1855Barchester Towers, Book 2, 1857Framley Parsonage, Book 4, 1861The Small House at Allington, Book 5, 1864.The Last Chronicle of Barset (Penguin Classics), 1867"},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL.

The unhappy Mary is banished forthwith, because the Gresham family fortunes are so depleted that Frank must marry money.Frank, however, is one of the few completely honorable young men in Trollope's novels and remains stubbornly true to his love. Well, he does propose to another woman, at the insistence of his mother, but only with the virtual certainty that he will be rejected--as indeed he is. The lady is Miss Dunstable, one of Trollope's most delightful characters, a fabulously wealthy thirtyish heiress of an ointment company. She is a bold, witty woman, not beautiful, but attractive in her way, whose wealth invites countless proposals.After the rather complicated plot unfolds, the tables are completely turned, and Mary is eagerly welcomed by Lady Arabella (who, of course, has always loved her) as the savior of the family.I concede that &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot; is the best of the Barsetshire novels, but I dearly love &quot;Dr. Thorne.&quot; The character of the doctor himself is strong and sympathetic. Frank, Mary, Miss Dunstable, Lady Arabella, Sir Roger Scatcherd, and such minor characters as Dr. Thorne's rival, Dr. Fillgrave (one of Trollope's punnily named characters), form a superb cast. And the outcome is thoroughly satisfying. I probably enjoyed reading this novel more than any of the others."},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL. SET.","review":"&quot;Dr. Thorne&quot; is the third in the series of Barsetshire novels by Anthony Trollope. But unlike the first two, this has little to do with the politics of the Church of England. It is the tale of two lovers from different classes, and their struggle to keep their love alive in spite of social pressures to go their own ways. Unlike the first two novels, the plot starts out very slowly, with long descriptions of the history and conditions of the fictional &quot;Greshamsbury&quot; estate. The author even apologizes about 30 pages in for trying the patience of his readers.While &quot;Dr. Thorne&quot; lacks the crispness and economy of the first two novels (&quot;The Warden&quot; and &quot;Barchester Towers&quot;), it builds to a satisfying conclusion, and the author paints his usual precise characterizations.If you are a fan of Anthony Trollope, be patient with this one. You will be rewarded."},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL. SET.","review":"It's impossible to imagine a novel more completely entertaining than DR THORNE. You know from almost the first page how the plot will conclude, but the getting there is delicious.It is not as economically told as THE WARDEN, not as discursive (or laugh-out-loud hilarious) as BARCHESTER TOWERS. Instead it has balance and energy and the characters fairly sparkle, especially the &quot;good&quot; romantic hero and heroine. We are used to allowing the novelist a boring romantic interest, as long as we're given other pleasures along the way; but Frank and Mary may just be the most fun personalities in their own story. No mean feat, as any reader knows, the creation of virtuous characters who are also sharp and amusing enough to carry their weight. Frank's quasi-courtship of Miss Dunstable, the delightful if ugly &quot;oil of Lebanon&quot; heiress, is a brilliant stroke, and the happy ending is (very carefully) not reached until Frank has proven himself worthy of it.You feel in such good hands with Trollope. Nothing too awful will happen to anyone, at least not without much warning, and all the deserving characters will get their heart's desire. It's like sitting down after a good dinner over brandy with a friend who is incomparably witty, candid, and good-natured. It might, literarily speaking, be fluff, after all; but it's fluff raised to an art form."},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL. SET.","review":"When we ask someone if they are engaged, we are asking if they have made with their partner an explicit and reciprocal promise to enter marriage. When Mary Thorne is asked the question, she takes it literally and means something wholly different.Mary Thorne is the niece and adopted daughter of the eponymous main character of the novel, Doctor Thorne. (If you'll permit an aside before proceeding, Trollope begins the novel by addressing the question of who is in fact the main character of his novel. He doesn't answer this question, rather he leaves the final verdict up to the reader.) Though a member of an ancient Barsetshire family, Doctor Thorne's material fortunes have fallen and he cannot hope to arrange a marriage of wealth for his niece. However, this hardly matters since the doctor wishes his niece happiness, not wealth, and when prospects of wealth do come her way, he is rather perplexed as to what he should do.Another important character, young Mr. Frank Gresham, is in a similar situation, though in his case his fortunes are falling rather than already fallen. As Doctor Thorne does for his niece, Frank cares for his happiness rather than his wealth. Alas, Frank's family has decided he must marry money. He objects and declares his love for Ms. Mary Thorne. She reciprocates Frank's feelings for her but in the face of his family's opposition, and their accusations of impropriety on her part, she cannot accept his proposal.And yet Mary declares herself engaged even when she's renounced her beloved. Her heart is engaged to his and she cannot move it. He may do as he pleases, he may follow the wishes of his family and marry another. It doesn't matter, her heart will be nonetheless engaged to his with no prospect of turning to another.It is this precise use of words and this detailed development of a plot turning on the quite literal nuances of an idiom which make Anthony Trollope's books a joy to read. This chapter of Trollope's Chronicles of Barsetshire, his \\"Com&eacute;die Humaine\\", is as satisfying as the previous two, and I warmly recommend it.Vincent Poirier, Dublin"},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL. SET.","review":"OK, I'm a Trollope fan, and I sometimes wonder why these novels about social interactions 150 years ago interest me so much when I know I would have suffocated in such a rigid society.First of all, Trollope describes human behaviour in a way I can understand better than any other novelist. I suffer from mild asperger syndrome, and am often baffled by peoples' behaviour in real life. I think I get some relief from this frustration by watching Trollope's characters while the author makes their motives clear and enables me to feel real compassion for them.His novels reflect his belief that English gentlemen had found something close to the ideal system of values, and they explore the effects of someone violating those values, or of difficulties arising as they try to fit special circumstances into them.In some of his other novels, he has been accused of antisemitism, and by modern standards there is some truth to this. I do not believe it was his intention to attack Jews, but in his efforts to plausibly create characters who did not behave like English gentlemen, he used the examples he saw of people who were raised in different cultures, but were to be found in London society. This issue does not arise in Dr. Thorne, partly because it is set in the country.Dr. Thorne contains one scene that (to me) perfectly exemplifies his virtues. Dr. Thorne asks the heroine if she would like to be rich. She mentions a trivial luxury she would buy if she were. He offers to buy it for her. I will not spoil your enjoyment of her reply, but it moved me deeply.I'm sure Trollope had no idea that this novel also illustrates why Britain later lost her world empire. It was written in 1858, twelve years before the Franco-Prussian war demonstrated that Germany was the rising power that must challenge England, thanks to the Prussian education system's emphasis on technical skills, but after Prussia had achieved a higher rate of economic growth than England.A very successful railway engineer-businessman (a Bill Gates?) is drinking himself to death, and Dr. Thorne asks why.'Oh my God! Have you not unbounded wealth? Can you not do anything you wish? anything you choose?''No' and the sick man shrieked with an energy that made him audible all throughout the house. 'I can do nothing that I would choose to do; be nothing that I would wish to be! What can I do? What can I be? What gratification can I have except the brandy bottle? If I go among gentlemen, can I talk to them? If they have anything to say about a railway, they will ask me a question: if they speak to me beyond that I must be dumb.'It is not clear to me that Trollope recognized that this describes a limitation in the English gentlemen, let alone that this limitation would ultimately doom the empire. The US is definitely treating Bill Gates better than this."},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL. SET.","review":"...which is what this lovely, gentle book feels like. Smaller in scope than its predecessor (the sprawling, boisterous \\"Barchester Towers\\"), \\"Doctor Thorne\\" is more of a character study; the story of a simple man facing difficult decisions. Not that it's in any way devoid of Trollope's incisive social insights or intuitive humor. If you're a fan of this particular writer, or the English comedy of manners in general, this will be an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL. SET.","review":"Making money and a good marriage: the bulwarks of solid middle-class society, and the theme of Trollope's third Barchester novel. The good Dr. Thorne has raised his brother's illegitimate daughter Mary, and she and Frank Gresham fall in love. Unfortunately for Frank his once well-off family is now in desperate straits, and he is implored to \\"marry money\\" - which pretty much rules Mary out. He goes off to seek his fortune with the rich Miss Dunstable, but cannot be untrue to Mary, and in a very humorous chapter, Miss Dunstable calls him out.Unknown to everyone except the reader and Dr. Thorne, however, Mary will inherit a great fortune if events go a certain way, and, of course, they do. The reader is, therefore, cheated out of the \\"surprise\\" waiting Mary at the end, but the scenes preceding this of Frank going through the motions of pleasing his family while he and Mary remain faithful to each other is worth that disappointment. The chapter in which Dr. Thorne stands up to Lady Arabella (Frank's mother) and defends Mary after she's been banished from the Gresham home after being seen as an obstacle to Frank's marrying money, is a highlight of the novel. Just as good, of course, is the scene near the end where Mary defends herself against Lady Arabella. Trollope didn't think much of this novel; in fact, he couldn't understand why it was so popular with the public, but he's been about the only one to feel that way. Perhaps not as good as BARCHESTER TOWERS, it's still one of Trollope's most enjoyable works."},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL. SET.","review":"Dr. Thorne, the third book in Anthony Trollope's six book series The Chronicles of Barsetshire, can easily be read as a stand-alone novel. The plot is deceptively simple; Mary Thorne, an illegitimate child, falls in love with the son of the local squire. The son, Frank Gresham, loves Mary, but is told he must marry wealth to save the estate. The entire five hundred page novel centers on this problem; some modern readers may find the story line a bit thin for their taste. In the next novel in the series, Framley Parsonage, the story line is similar, but with an expanded cast of characters and plot twists and turns - Framley Parsonage is a more satisfying novel, in my opinion.Even so, I recommend Dr. Thorne for these reasons: Trollope was a psychoanalyst who understood more about the inner life of human beings than some of those professionals who make their living by listening to people talk about their problems. We come to know and understand Mary Thorne from the inside out and we are better for this knowledge. Additionally, few novelists equal Trollope as an observer and chronicler of wealth and class in English society, and wealth and class are what Dr. Thorne is about. Mary is poor and illegitimate. Even though she is loved by all around her, illegitimacy and poverty appear to make it impossible for her to rise in station to become Frank's wife. Yet at the time Trollope was writing his novel, great wealth could overcome all obstacles. Will Mary Thorne become Cinderella and win her prince charming? Most readers will accurately guess the outcome of the story.Trollope enjoyed conversing directly with us his readers and he does so frequently in Dr. Thorne. Henry James might have found this novelistic technique artificial, but not me. I enjoyed Trollope's comments, not only about his characters, but also about life and living. He had great sensitivity to the plight of women in Victorian Society and treated his heroine Mary Thorne with loving care and sensitivity.While Dr. Thorne is not one of Trollope's finest novels, it is still better than almost anything the reader is likely to find on the current best seller list."},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL. SET.","review":"DOCTOR THORNE is the third installment of Anthony Trollope's Barchester Cycle, preceded by THE WARDEN (ISBN#0140432140) and BARCHESTER TOWERS (ISBN#0192834320). You don't have to read the first two installments in the cycle to enjoy DOCTOR THORNE, though they are highly recommended, and will give a good background as to the goings-on in Barchester at the time that the tale commences.Dr Thorne is the oldest son of a respected prebendary (some position in the Church of England), and elder brother to Henry Thorne, a notorious drunk and cad. The Thorne family can trace its noble roots to times before the Norman invasion of England, and they are very proud of it. (If you have read BARCHESTER TOWERS, you may recall Dr and Miss Thorne of Ullathorne - cousins of this Dr Thorne.) Though he is not heir to the estate of Ullathorne, Dr Thorne is still highly respected in Barchester as a doctor, and welcomed at his ancestral home.But then trouble. Henry Thorne has seduced, drugged, and impregnated a young seamstress, Mary Scatcherd. Her brother Roger, also a notorious toper, is furious, and kills his sister's seducer. Though Miss Scatchered has not been disgraced by the affair, she too must leave town, should she have any hope of a normal, happy life. Her fiance begs her to leave the child behind in England and emigrate to America to start over. Dr Thorne arranges for legal representation for his brother's murderer, sees that Roger gets a short prison term, and takes it upon himself to raise his brother's daughter. Dr Thorne leaves Barchester for Greshamsbury to start anew, after disowning his family at Ullathorne, and establishes himself with the Greshams of Greshamsbury, the wealthiest 'commoners' in the county. Or they used to be.Over the years, Frank Gresham, Sr. has mortgaged the estate to the hilt. He has been horrible at managing his funds, and with ten children and a wife who insists on spending as though they had all they wanted, he is broke. Worse for him htough, is that his only son, Frank, Jr., has come of age and is ready to find a wife.His mother and countess-aunt have agreed: if the estate is to be spared, Frank must marry a rich woman. They scheme and contrive to marry off the young heir, but to no use. Frank, ignorant as everyone else is of the story of her birth, is in love with Dr Thorne's niece: poor, illegitimate Mary Thorne. And then the novel begins.Trollope has created another masterpiece here: never have I endured so much suspense reading a what amounts to a romance novel (though, their is plenty of politics and legal scandal for those who enjoy that too.) There are perfectly orchestrated twists, cliffhanging moments that will have you on the edge of your seat, and plenty of dramatic irony. Of course, it all turns out alright in the end - it always does, but you won't believe it until the last page.They really need to put a warning label on Anthony Trollope's novels that reads 'Careful: Addictive, may cause sleepless nights becuase you can't put it down.' Great novel, extremely entertaining, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL. SET.","review":"Volume 3 in Trollope's Barchester series moves away from the intricacies of church politics and focuses on the English caste system in the mid 19th century.The novel is called after a man whom Trollope declares as his hero: a poor country doctor with professional competence and an admirable honest stubbornness, a bachelor who lives with a lovely niece, whom he treats like a daughter. Doc Thorne is a proud man, proud to be a poor man from a high family.The niece might be considered the real heroine. She is an illegitimate child of the Doc's late brother with a woman who emigrated with another man, leaving the girl behind. The girl's social status is that of a pariah, which begins to be relevant when men start seeing her as a woman.She is a proud and smart person, with a mind at war with itself. She fully accepts the social ranking system that condemns her to be an underdog. She knows that she is a superior person in all other respects.Trollope is overdoing his communication with the reader a little here. He insists on telling us that the real hero of the novel is young Frank Gresham, the local squire's only son. Frank is just growing up in the world and needs to find his way in questions of rank and preferences. He finds out that all is not well with the estate and that he better finds a way to marry money if he wants to keep up the life style that he has grown up expecting. Or are emotions more important? One has social duties as well!The ground is thus prepared for a plot with psychological and social depth, all wrapped in satirical fun poked at pretensions and stupidity. Maybe Trollope's most Austenian novel, at least among those that I know so far."},{"Title":"Faces of Ground Zero: Portraits of the Heroes of September 11, 2001","review":"This is hands down the most compelling and personal account of September 11th."},{"Title":"Faces of Ground Zero: Portraits of the Heroes of September 11, 2001","review":"When I first went through this book, I was moved by the deep emotion that could be seen in the calm faces of the firefighters, police, and all those who helped on that day or in the days after, as well as those who had managed to escape the destruction. Deep sorrow showed on many faces despite their calm demeanor, and cold anger abiding just under the surface on others who had lost good friends. As I read this book and looked at the portraits, especially of the firefighters and police, I was reminded of the photos of soldiers and sailors who have just come through battles, or are catching their breath between engagements. I understood why people said that on day and the days that followed, those people were on the front line of our war.There were one or two people whose presence I simply didn't understand, beyond perhaps, just perhaps they were in the book because they simply wanted to help or to encourage or comfort others, somehow.There was one smiling face, an office worker, and when I read the story of how she was rescued and how she and her rescuers survived the tower collapse, I could understand why she smiled."},{"Title":"Faces of Ground Zero: Portraits of the Heroes of September 11, 2001","review":"No matter how many years after 9/11, I always get emotionally when hearing/seeing/reading about 9/11.And this book certainly made me emotional.

I am so glad to see that not everyone sticks to the same formula as everyone else who writes. It is really refreshing to get the opportunity to read such a unique piece of work.I like this book because we all need to know that no matter what we do there is always hope for us if we find ourselves in a bad situation. So often, people feel that there is no outlet for their frustrations and this may lead to more deeds that are not condusive to healing. In Detatched, Jon comes around and realizes that no matter how bad his situation has become, there is hope for him to love himself again. African American gay males need this reassurance of hope since it seems on every turn we are constantly being knocked down either for being black, gay, or both.

All the conflict he faces seem to be resolved quite simply. Too bad in real life it's not that way. Being an African-American gay male is much more complicated than just going out, having fun and sleeping with different men. It is a constant struggle for acceptance in two worlds: the world of the African-American male and the world of the gay male. It seems to this reader that some of that was a bit too simple, and didn't bring enough issues to the table. But the book was engrossing and a constant read.

But when I started reading it, I was in for much more. It has history, fantasy, and romance blended altogether. The story begins in the year 1997.Mechi Jeanotte, 23, from Paris Texas, is a golf pro at St. Andrew's Golf Course near Aberdeen, Maryland. She loves horses and has great knowledge of history, Scottish history in particular. Foremost, she has a gift and passion for golf. History, golf and horses. All these provide supportive impact as she enmeshes with the other characters. That particular week hasn't been good. She tries hard to busy herself as she deals with her Dad's death and her boyfriend's betrayal. Then one late night, a strange-sounding woman who calls herself Liz Stewart, telephones her and insists on having a private early-morning lessons in golf.As Mechi waits for her, she is soon transported in another time and place - to the year 1561, in Aberdeen, Scotland. She wakes up with her head on the lap of the Viscount of Kintore, Lord Robbie Keith. A somewhat exciting fairy tale, huh. Will she find true love? But there's more. Mechi finds herself in the company of Mary, Queen of Scots, an avid golfer herself. Mechi and Mary become friends, only to discover that the Queen's fate is in her hands. Will she change history and rescue Queen Mary from being betrayed and beheaded? This book sure challenged my historical knowledge of Mary, Queen of Scots!

The author sadly really did lose her father when she was 12.I could identify with so much -- I felt the writing was excellent.I also really, really liked her book called &quot;Sailing&quot;.

It is a collection of six interconnected short stories that Ms. Kenney calls a novel. The chapters examine the memories and perceptions invoked by different circumstances and times in the protagonist's life. They all center on her father's death at an early age and the concepts of desertion and trust. They examine her mother's madness and her husband's illness and how death does not necessarily end life. Real life may well exist in one's memories.This book is so good that I can recall it now, 24 years after I read it, almost as well as if I had just finished it.

There's no instructor in these courses, just a study guide, so the textbooks have to be clear. Perspectives in Sociology is just that.Despite the confusing and overlapping nature of the subject matter, the authors do a great job in describing and dissecting each point of view. Special-use terms are clearly explained in boxes intermixed in the text. The chapters create a historical progression through the development of sociological theory, from founders Marx, Weber, and Durkheim, up through post-structuralists and synthesists.Each theorist is presented impartially and objectively. (Incuding those theorists who say objectivity is impossible because we're all prisoners of language, lol.) The main criticisms of each theory are also presented. So, frequently, I found myself thinking that a theory made a lot of sense -- and then on reading the criticism or on reading the next theorist, I underwent an oh-yeah reaction, realizing that the theory failed to explain major phenomena.In the book's final concluding chapter, the authors note that the term Perspectives is a bit obsolete. Their original intention was to present the varied points of view in sociological theory. Then came the poststructuralists and postmodernists who think the whole concept of sociological theory is incorrect. Nonetheless, I think Perspectives is still a good description of the subject matter.There is now a fifth edition available which is likely even more useful, though a used 4th edition is currently quite a bit cheaper.A sidenote: there are a number of neuroscience books now out that describe how much of human behavior and \\"thinking\\" is unconscious. This ties well into many sociological theories."},{"Title":"Perspectives in Sociology: Classical and Contemporary","review":"I would have to say that the book was really good. The item came quickly.

They have a humility that is refreshing in Christian books. Insightful and full of real-life examples that will help most readers understand how they can better understand their spouses."},{"Title":"The 5 Love Needs of Men and Women","review":"I have a problem with a portion of the semantics of this book. I realize that some people do not feel that the semantics are all that important, but I think they are. For example, the very first 'love need' of men and women talks about 'Unconditional Love.' The phrase invokes the idea that, no matter what, a husband and wife should support and love each other. Although 'Unconditional Love' sounds better, to me what they actually mean is that men and women are looking for 'Grace' from their partners.In my opinion this is a better term for what the Rosberg's are trying to say. The term involves the notion that we are forgiving of our partner's 'mistakes' and that we realize they are human beings. It means that we will not abandon them for their mistakes. It means that we will stick with our partner when problems arise and we will work through the difficulty and continue to offer love to our partner.I feel that people can be graceful, but to say that human beings can offer Unconditional Love in our romantic relationships is a false presumption. We are not God or Jesus. We cannot offer that. However, I think both parties can and should work in a graceful way, before and after marriage, to avoid getting to a state where we no longer offer our partner the love they need.My point is that the book's semantics are formulated to what sounds better. I think the world is full of books that do not say exactly what they mean, books that are written to sell and not communicate. I feel this is another one of those books. It does have some good material, but it could have been written much better."},{"Title":"Ernest Tubb: The Texas Troubadour","review":"Mr. Pugh's &quot;Ernest Tubb: The Texas Troubador&quot; offers a well balanced context of Tubb's life. The good times, hard times, his strengths, and weaknesses. My father, the late Vernon &quot;Toby&quot; Reese was one of the orignal members of Tubb's band in the 40's. I can recall his stories about Tubb when I was a child.

Although I never got to meet the man just knowing what I know of him and his family. I'am sure that he would be proud of this book."},{"Title":"Ernest Tubb: The Texas Troubadour","review":"This book provides an excellent picture of Ernest Tubb. It's filled with detail about his life and his importance to the music industry, and it's an objective and balanced biography. The only thing I found odd was the lack of family interviews. I don't know how one can write a complete biography without talking to surviving family members."},{"Title":"Ernest Tubb: The Texas Troubadour","review":"Ernest Tubb (1914-84) was born dirt poor in Crisp Texas. During the Depression the lad toiled digging ditches; picking cotton; selling beer and singing for a matress company! Tubb toiled in rowdy Texas honkey-tonks and on small wattage radio stations. Ernest worked hard and finally got a spot on the Grand Ole Opry in 1943. Ernest Tubb sold millions of records. The tall Texan helped countless entertainers in their career development. He assisted among others: Hank Snow, Hank Williams, Hank Thompson, Skeeter Davis, Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline, Cal Smith, Jack Greene and many others. He made over 4,000 on stage appearance, started and hosted the Ernest Tubb Record Shop Midnight Jamboree and recorded such classic country tunes as \\"Waltz Across Texas,\\"; \\"I'm Walking the Floor Over You,\\"\\"Thanks a Lot.\\" and countelss others. Tubb sold millions of records and was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame and was a wonderful ambassador of gaining country music respectability. Tubb's muscial idol was Jimmy Rodgers the singing breakman who died of TB in 1933. Tubb instituted the Jimmy Rodgers Festival in Meridian Mississippi; he was a friend of Mrs. Rodgers and was allowed to use Rodger's guitar on his gigs.The Texas Troubadour fathered eight children having two wives Elaine and Oleane. Both of these marriages ended in divorce. He had trouble with alcoholic binges, heavy smoking and could exhibit a terrible temper. He was no saint. Yet Ernest Tubb was basically a kind man who helped others throughout his long career. He was one of the first entertainers to call his music \\"country\\" instead of \\"hillbilly. Tubb perfomed everywhere from Carneige Hall in New York to Nashville's Grand Ole Opry to a famous tour of Korea along with Hank Snow.The author of this small print 323 page biography is Ronnie Pugh who is Head of Reference at the Country Music Foundation in Nashville. He has done a thorough job of researching Tubb's almost 50 year career through extensive interviews with musicians and family members who knew E.T. He also has provided the best discography available of all the thousands of Tubb songs on records. The book also contains rare phots of Ernest Tubb and his Texas Troubadours.This book is a sine qua non for the general public and country music scholars wanting to examine the life of Ernest Tubb. He is the man who brought the honky-tonk sound and electric guitar music to the Grand Ole Opry. A legend and a kind man was Ernest Dale Tubb!"},{"Title":"Ernest Tubb: The Texas Troubadour","review":"I highly recommend this book. Ronnie Pugh has the inside scoop on all things Nashville and he has written one fine book here. The book takes one from Ernest's humble beginnings through his desire to be a Jimmie Rodgers clone. His association with Carrie Rodgers, the widow of the singing brakeman is covered in this book.There is a personal glimpse inside Ernest's early days on radio and his struggle to be all that he could be in a hard scrabble world of country music.There are many humorous stories in the book about the long trips and the pranks the characters would play on one another just for entertainment.This book gives the reader a complete look at Ernest Tubb the Texas Troubadour from the beginning to the end. Too bad there was so much greed within the family concerning Ernest's personal items, but that is often the case when someone passes away.It is a known fact that Ernest helped many young stars to realize their potential and gain them the access to those that could further their careers. Ernest was never one to brag about helping others and did so because of the warm hearted person he truly was.Please give this book a try and I believe you will be glad you did."},{"Title":"Ernest Tubb: The Texas Troubadour","review":"Ronnie Pugh has done an excellent job of describing a Country music legend. He told many of the ways that Ernest Tubb helped the Country music industry, and gave what I think is a fair and accurate account of the man himself.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Ernest Tubb: The Texas Troubadour","review":"An exhaustively detailed biography, written by the head of the Country Music Foundation, which tracks ET from his early struggling years, onto his heyday as one of Decca's main cash cows, and through his decades of hard work and gradual decline. The writing is almost as dogged and linear as Tubb was during his years on the road -- not terribly elegant, literary or evocative, but the research is solid, including countless interviews with band members, industry movers, and Tubb relations. An authoritative resource for anyone who would like to find out how Tubb helped form the sound of hard country honkytonk in the early '40s, and how he later helped boost the careers of musicians such as Hank Snow, Hank Thompson and Loretta Lynn, and how Nashville eventually let him slide out of sight. Many of the details seems too depressing and tawdry to me, but it's still the story of a great man's life..."},{"Title":"Ernest Tubb: The Texas Troubadour","review":"Ronnie Pugh offers a thoroughly researched biography on the life and times of Ernest Tubb sure to delight both fans and students of Country music. A Nashville insider himself, Pugh talked to many of the people whose accounts supply the details here, and talked to many over a period of years. This is a very \\"straight\\" biography - there's no attempt to psychoanalyze the subject or make him represent some big idea. It's the kind of biography that results from hard work and a vast accumulation of detail. Notes are provided for every chapter, the work is indexed, of course, and it includes a valuable discography. Those who appreciate stories of wild times on the road will have to settle for a genteel admission that Tubb drank and gambled on occasion; Pugh states at the outset that he doesn't intend to indulge in salacious details. The book is honest though, and provides a fascinating account of a wonderful life. It's hard to imagine a more definitive work on the subject."},{"Title":"Ernest Tubb: The Texas Troubadour","review":"I ordered this book for my Mother.

There's no transcriptions from the live albums 'Atlantic' and 'Paris'. There's no transcriptions of the alternate takes from 'Volts'. And many of the outro solos are not tabbed, it merely says things like, \\"ad lib solo next 60 bars\\". Added, these Amsco books are badly engraved, poorly edited, and questionably transcribed.Now, let me paraphrase and then comment upon the the 'Editor's Note' found inside this book, which says, \\"Although most of the tunes that appear on... 'Bonfire' have appeared on previous studio albums... some of the... live performances... exhibit some subtle and spontaneous nuances not found in the studio versions. In addition, 'Bonfire' features more than one version of certain songs. In deciding which versions to include in the present folio, we spent a lot of time listening to the 'Bonfire' collection and comparing the live versions with their studio counterparts... the studio versions (are) tighter (and) more familiar. For this reason, for AC/DC tunes that exist in more than one version, we have based the transcriptions on the studio version.\\"So to comment, that 'Editor's Note' is baloney, because no consideration was given to 'Bonfire'. They released this book as a means to rehash the transcriptions from their previous book, 'Dirty Deeds: Best of AC/DC', since identical transcriptions appear in both.In closing, Scamsco should be strung up by the guitar community, for daring to reference this junk as 'Bonfire'. Even the back cover shows the four albums from 'Bonfire', yet only 40% of 'Bonfire' is actually transcribed (even less if you consider all the missing solos). So this book is just plain old lousy - one/half star."},{"Title":"AC/DC: Bonfire","review":"i honestly think the little mistakes but people get over it what do you want angus young to personally teach you it him self but their is mistakes like the first page it says that rcker whas written by bj ay my thats not right its bs ay my"},{"Title":"AC/DC: Bonfire","review":"I've played guitar my whole life and I just got into AC/DC, most of their songs are just chords, making it simple for beginners to play awesome songs like TNT, Back In Black, and You Shook Me...

But this is more than a compendium of the wonderful cuisine we have enjoyed there, more than the sum of welcome and ambiance (and WHAT a view from the deck overlooking the waters of Eastsound!). Christina knows how to write as well as to cook. The little essays about discovering food as she grew up in the Pacific Northwest bring the recipes to life. They also provide a capsule history of a generation: from the wheat fields of eastern Washington to the burgeoning restaurants of Portland, Oregon, to the lovely little island north of Seattle (Orcas) that is home to the gem she created as a single mom a couple of decades ago. Read the book. Go to the restaurant. Live some history!"},{"Title":"Christina's Cookbook: Recipes and Stories from a Northwest Island Kitchen","review":"We purchased this book during a visit to the most beautiful of the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington State, Orcas Island.

Before it was fashionable she began her restaurant committed to fresh local ingredients and seasonal recipes. We love her cookbook because it's designed that way with pages dedicated to tomatoes, apples or oysters and we love her stories about growing up in the Northwest and how that shaped her vision of food. The best thing is the percentage of recipes we'd make again - always our judge of a great cookbook. We love her crab fondue, her steamed clams with thyme and lemon vodka, her picnic chicken liver terrine, roasted vegetable salad with tomato caper vinegrette, hot and sour fish soup... and there's lots more. Makes your mouth water doesn't it!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Christina's Cookbook: Recipes and Stories from a Northwest Island Kitchen","review":"I was prepared to love this cookbook after reading the other reviews and knowing something of Christina's history. However, I am not sure how tested the recipes are. For instance, the Lamb Shanks, Flageolets and Root Vegetables (the cover). In the directions, it says to remove the shanks from the oven after 1 and 1/2 hours and add the beans. The next direction is to remove 1/2 hour BEFORE it's done to add the root vegetables. Now I'm something of a seasoned cook so I don't have any trouble determining when my beans are nearly done but a novice might get confused so it would be nice to at least estimate the length of time the beans should cook.For me the recipes are lovely and I am able to convert or adapt as needed in cooking for one or two people.

But if you can't do that, the second best thing is to broadcast your bias loud and clear.By going the second route, this book provides not only a historical account of the robber barons, but a pretty clear picture of the Marxist perspective on them in 1934.It's interesting at times to watch Josephson struggle for balance. On the one hand, he seems to almost admire the big capitalists when they're creating collectives by crushing the little capitalists. On the other hand, when they start tromping on the workers, they're clearly Very Naughty. And he addresses the rampant religious fervor of most of the barons, but never really figures out how to make it fit the picture other than by suggesting they're just enormously hypocritical.The story of railroad, steel and banking essentially taking over the country is here, nicely organized so that we can follow relevant threads without getting to caught up in chronology. Josephson sometimes lets his billowing prose and sweeping characterizations overwhelm detail and fact; his style is definitely not for all tastes.Ultimately it's a double history, not only of the Robber Barons themselves, but of the singular vantage point of the mid-thirties. Yes, Josephson is not the most objective of chroniclers, but his bias is so clearly stated and in evidence that it is easy to filter out, and his point of view becomes an interesting subject of this study in its own right."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"I found the Robber Barons an interesting book to read but I thought Matthew Josephson's book the Money Lords was better. It is a well written book as you would expect from Josephon. Robber Barons is a classic and a good general history of the pioneers of industry including Astor, Vanderbilt, Drew, Cooke, Gould, Fisk, Carnegie, Morgan, Rockefeller and Harriman of which I am sure most will find it interesting but it lacks the insight and wisdom of Money Lords. There are numerous interesting stories of all the above metioned men as they made their individual quests for success. Most of the men made a great deal of their fortunes through stocks on Wall Street which some of their stories are outlined here. Interesting enough is that over half made their fortunes in Rail Roads through ownership and stock manipulation. This is a good book giving the reader a general overview of some of the biggest fortunes made during the late 1800's."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"This 1934 book provides a history of the late 19th century that is missing from school history books. The author worked for a few years in Wall Street and learned about the \\"Men Who Rule America\\". Later he wrote a number of biographies for a magazine. These men were no match for the great capitalists who flourished in the late 19th century (the Gilded Age). He decided to write not just about their lives, manners and morals, but how they got their money. Their great wealth was unaffected by any income tax. These barons of industry were \\"agents of progress\\" in transforming an agrarian-mercantile society into a mass production economy. Josephson described their most ruthless actions, their plunders and conspiracies, and their lack of ethics. The system they created led to the Great Depression. Since then academic historians created a revisionist history that claimed those entrepreneurs were saviors of the country and not interested in looting and plundering the economy. This \\"history\\" is similar to the \\"truth factories\\" in George Orwell's \\"1984\\" [which is about Britain and the world of 1948]. Their family dynasties have survived, they established trusts that evaded the tax burdens of other wealthy families. [Other writers have pointed out that they sponsored universities to control teachers and thinking, and provide other benefits.] These dynasties seem permanent. The founders were hated by the American people in their lifetime. The farmers of Kansas first applied the name \\"Robber Barons\\" to the railroads that oppressed them.Jay Gould bought the \\"New York World\\" and the Associate Press to control the news to his advantage. Most newspapers then were independently owned, unlike today's corporate media. The Robber Barons used their control of transportation to levy tolls on all shipments. Today's versions are trying to privatize public highways and add new tolls to enrich themselves and impoverish the rest of us. Chapter 12 tells about the formations of pools and trusts. The use of legal shields, violence and sabotage set a precedent for latter-day organized crime. Bankers were enriched in 1873 when the Federal Government stopped silver currency. Debts contracted with cheap greenbacks had to be repaid with expensive gold (p.290). The \\"Railway Mania\\" of the Civil War era led to excessive railroad lines that lost money (p.292). Hundreds of millions of dollars were lost to bankruptcy and fraud. [Was this comparable to the High-Tech stock swindles of the late 1990s?] The Pennsylvania Railroad was the most powerful in business (p.295). Unregulated competition led to enormous waste and an impoverished society (p.297). The Morgan bank worked out a deal which evaded the law (p.299). [The decision of the US Supreme Court suggests they were touched like other politicians (p.306).]\\"Nature's Noblemen\\" were at their height of power and reputation in the 1880s. They were in control of government (police, army, navy, courts), the schools, the press, the church, and fashionable society (as ever a \\"kept class\\" attached to the ruling class). They were true believers in the God that rewarded them with riches and powers (pp.316-317). \\"God gave me my money\\" (p.318). [Divine right?] They donated millions to churches because it was good business (pp.320-321) They money was orthodox! Rockefeller's Chicago University argued to justify the trusts (p.324). They appointed and controlled Federal judges. The lives of the colossally rich showed their emptiness and vulgarity (p.337). Chapter 15 explains how laws were passed (pp.356-358). Their absolute powers were shown by their ruthless attacks on labor unions (p.361). The Sherman Anti-Trust Act was passed against the industrialists but was used against unions (p.367)!Chapter 16 explains how mismanagement led to the Panic of 1893, the worst depression of the 19th century. [Economic oppression and a lack of money cause depressions.] Depressions were used to eliminate small competitors (p.379). Price fixing swindled tax-payers (pp.385-386). \\"Pump and dump\\" schemes made millions (pp.387-388). Carnegie supplied low-quality armor for Navy ships (p.391). Chapter 17 tells how the House of Morgan used people's monies to control the people (p.409). Morgan saved railroads in order to destroy them (p.413). Morgan \\"saved the country\\" (p.414)! Chapter 18 tells how the US Steel Trust was created. $1,321 millions in stocks and bonds were sold to buy $681 millions of tangible assets (p.429)! Things began to change in 1901 with Teddy Roosevelt (p.445). Trusts exploited the public (p.447). Would plutocracy triumph over the people (p.448)? They continued to profit from plundering the people (p.451) They learned to use \\"public relations counselors\\" to present themselves to the public (p.452).The \`Bibliography' lists the books used for research. There is no mention of the attacks on the militia in those days. [Have we learned anything since then?]"},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"Matthew Josephson directly links the onset of the Civil War to the Industrial Revolution. Before Lincoln had served even a single day in office, the south was circling the wagons. America's transformation from the slave system to mass-production was a painful one. Determining the geopolitical model for the new territories was the central issue. Indeed, with Lincoln the south's national influence, already rapidly weakening, becomes all the clearer. Further, Lincoln's expertise as a lawyer was primarily litigating the competing interests of steamboats and railroads. The first railroad that bridged the Mississippi was in 1856. Just weeks later a steamboat crashes into it and the owner files suit. Abraham Lincoln represented the railroad company.For years a transcontinental railroad was sought, but could only proceed with public funds upon congressional approval. Not favoring the chosen route, southern representatives repeatedly blocked the measure. After secession, the bill passed and mass exploitation to begin. The political rhetoric was stopping the expansion of slavery, a moral facade and states rights, a constitutional pretense. Both hollow and neither realized. Conversely, the underlying interests ultimately served were those of the robber barons. Coincidence perhaps? For your consideration, Matthew Josephson:\\"When the abyss of the Civil War suddenly yawned before men's eyes it but registered a \\"lag\\" which had existed already during the whole of the preceding generation. Where England had officially recognized its economic transition peacefully by the repeal of the Corn Laws, America, through blood and iron, consecrated its own industrial revolution by the end of what had been comparatively free trade.\\" [pg 4]\\"The axis of trade had shifted away from the Mississippi by 1860, when 30,000 miles of railroad existed. ... He [the settler] found prosperity in free labor rather than in the routine effort of slaves. His spirit called for national unity, for freely circulating capital, and above all for a Pacific Railroad. The new political party clamored against the blockade of its future prosperity held by the south ... Its leader, a lawyer for western railroads, included a Pacific Railroad bill and a protective tariff for native industries in his platform. Such overwhelming economic needs, confronted with the alarmed passionate resistance of the agrarian, slave-owning, static south, must burst the dam at last in the inevitable social cataclysm of the Civil War.\\" [pg 30-31]\\"The young men who were to form the new nobility of industry and banking ... would take their posts in the economic revolution which rose to a climax in the war; and at the end of the war would see them masters of money, capitalists equipped to increase their capital. In the hour of danger and confusion it was as if they alone were prepared. It was as if the second American Revolution were fought for them.\\" [pg 32]\\"The rout of the first Union army spread gloom over the north ... The very reverses of the union armies, creating the need for government funds, for vast quantities of war material, clothing, uniform, shoes, munitions, transport, and for a total reorganization of the national economy, soon changed the humor of the civilians. The very collapse of the government credit, the menace of defeat, bringing debasement of the currency, was a good, since there soon developed a cycle of inflation with its pleasant picture of soaring prices for goods of all kinds ... Behind the army lines there were lucrative tasks to be done in short order.\\" [pg 51]\\"Under Lincoln, after the Homestead Act, began the distribution of the public domain, which the federal government owned, in favor of its citizenry of free farmers and artisans ... In a hurried partition, for nominal sums or by cession, this benevolent government handed over to its friends or to astute first comers, the most daring undertakers, all those treasures of coal and oil, of copper and gold and iron, the land grants, the terminal sites, the perpetual rights of way--an act of largesse which is still one of the wonders of the world.\\"[Footnote]: \\"For had not the Republican convention at Chicago in 1860, placed the measure for a Pacific Railroad Bill on its platform under the urgings of young men like Leland Stanford who came hurrying from California to the banner of Lincoln, though without the slightest interest in the freedom of slaves?\\"\\"To the new railroad enterprises in addition, great money subsidies totaling many hundreds of millions were given. The Tariff Act of 1864 was in itself a sheltering wall of subsidies; and to add further the new heavy industries and manufactures, an Immigration Act allowing contract labor to be imported freely was quickly enacted; a national banking system perfected. And finally, to preserve the new alignment of interests, the cabalistic \\"due process clause\\" was inserted into the Fourteenth Amendment, by which the ostensible defense of Negroes' rights, as Beards have pointed out, was made the eternal bulwark of great property rights.\\" [pg 52] \\"Was not Cooke a figure of the war machine behind the lines?\\" [Footnote] \\"Military historians have traced clearly the influence of tremendous political-financial pressure in Grant's disgraceful action at Cold Harbor...\\" [pg 58]Charges of corruption relating to war contracts forced Simon Cameron, Lincoln's first Secretary of War, to resign. From wikipedia: \\"Following the Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause prompted substantive due process interpretations to be urged on the Supreme Court as a limitation on state legislation. ... Because many of the first applications protected the rights of corporations and employers to be free of governmental regulation, it has been charged that substantive due process developed as a consequence of the Court's desire to accommodate 19th-century railroads and trusts.\\"Another issue Josephson would have the reader indulge is whether any man should have a stranglehold over the socio-economic interests of the masses. Then with the unveiling of the persona of many of the robber barons, it's a very frightening thought indeed."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"This book was first written in 1934 and remains the definite description of the Robber Barons. The author describes the Barons in the context of the political, social, and industrial trends of the time. It describes how they were shaped by the industries they were in, and by the competitive forces set in motion by each other. It is very well written, well researched, and the stories are simply fascinating.This book has a certain bias against the Barons and the laissez-faire system that created them, but it is not overwhelming. Keep in mind that it was written in the depths of the Great Depression, when many people questioned their faith in the free market system. While the author describes their many great accomplishments, he also spends plenty of time on their weaknesses and excesses, especially in the latter chapters. But remember, even the most admirable Barons also bribed politicians, abused their workers, and cheated ordinary investors by manipulating their own stock. Many of their actions would be illegal today.This book contains a lot of detail (though if you are like me, you will soon be wanting more). It is not a light book for a lazy Sunday afternoon. But if you are really interested, this is the place to start."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"I have no doubt that Matthew Josephson wrote this book to denounce &quot;unrestrained capitalism.&quot; Yet, when one reads this book critically, he'll find that most of the injustices of these times were caused, not by &quot;unrestrained capitalism,&quot; but by the government. The Central Pacific, Northern Pacific, and Union Pacific Railroad companies, for example, would not have been able to &quot;exploit the masses&quot; in the first place had they not been heavily subsidized by the very government which was later called in to &quot;bust&quot; their trusts.I believe one of the best evaluations of this book was offered by R. W. Grant, who wrote, &quot;In spite of his ill-concealed hostility to capitalism, Josephson continues to provide example after example of just where the real trouble lay: not with capitalism, but with government.&quot;Jim Powell is also right on target when he observes, &quot;[B]y author Matthew Josephson's own account, crooks like Jay Gould, Jim Fisk, and Daniel Drew thrived on government privileges and subsidies. By contrast, Josephson acknowledged that entrepreneurs such as Cornelius Vanderbilt provided valuable services and cut prices.&quot;It should also be noted that, unlike the typical Big Government &quot;liberal,&quot; Josephson at least *tries* to be fair (he doesn't quite succeed, but I applaud the effort). I was also surprised that it was Josephson, of all people, who explained how William H. Vanderbilt's famous quote--&quot;The public be damned!&quot;--was taken out of context by the leftists. Josephson also admits that the vulgar descriptions of unsanitary meat in Upton Sinclair's &quot;The Jungle&quot; was highly exaggerated and inaccurate. These are points that my &quot;moderate&quot; high school teachers would rather not acknowledge.Yes, Josephson probably did believe that the government was needed to &quot;restrain capitalism.&quot; But, to the perceptive reader, he shows that the government had ALREADY restrained capitalism when it chose to subsidize the favored industries, which it should not have done in the first place.By the way, James Jerome Hill built the Great Northern Railroad without any federal aid,and it was THIS railroad which ended up the most prosperous and honest."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"Judging by the attack \\"reviews\\" below there must be some right-wing campaign in progress to discredit Josephson. It's probably being organized by one of those propaganda machines they call \\"conservative think tanks\\".That nonsense aside, the book itself is a fabulous read as a tome on both history and grand business strategy for building a trust. Indeed I found it difficult to put down at night in order to go to sleep. Josephson brings the Robber Barons alive.For anyone interested in how men can amass such great fortunes the book provides plenty of clues by revealing the strategies used by the Robber Barons.One final point, a few of the attack reviews here are critical of Josephson for siding with labor in their disputes with the Robber Barons. They conveniently overlook the fact that most workers were treated as slaves back then working 12 hour days 6 times per week. If they dared complain about dangerous work conditions, the Andrew Carnegie types would simply send in battalions of Pinkerton goons to bust heads open and maybe even murder a few workers for good measure.There is no other history of the Robber Barons that comes close to this book."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"This chronicles the post civil war to early 1900s greed grab of some of the greatest scoundrels in American history. Vanderbilt, Astor, Rockefeller, Carnegie, J.P Morgan, Harriman, and the slithery Jay Gould. Immoral Capitalist pig scumbags who made money no matter what the cost (to others) through steel, oil, banking, coal and especially through the railroads. At that time if you controlled the railroads you 100% controlled all shipping and movement of goods so they got their cut even if it wasn't an industry that they had a controlling interest in. Some of these peoples descendents are currently at the top of the food chain of the criminal globalist network that currently controls the world.There was some but not enough in this about how they screwed over the working man and consumer but it was laugh out loud funny to see how they would backstab each other. In some cases they took great delight in completely destroying the very people who gave them their first break so they could get their feet in the door in the world of big business. It was funny to see how they would slander anybody who opposed them with the communist (never mind that these uber-capitalists had a huge hand in funding various communist revolutions themselves) slur, which worked well for these types well into the 1970s. Now the same types throw around terms like racist and terrorist in the same way at anybody that opposes them. Also it was not surprising to see how these same types then, as they do now, use immigration and the Christian church to their advantage. One thing I would liked to have seen in this book which wasn't even touched on is the belief many have that most of the Robber Barons were creations of and lackeys for banking houses based in Britain and Europe but overall this was an excellent book."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"This account of a critical aspect of American history is a classic, as shown by the fact that it is still being released in new editions 60 years after it was first written. Josephson has a very broad conception of how this phase began and developed, and communicates in a compelling way the social and political circumstances explaining the rise of the 19th c. monopolists.Incidentally, I would call Josephson neither a &quot;Marxist&quot; nor an &quot;Opportunist,&quot; as did a previous reviewer. The book never advocated socialist revolution or indeed any policy alternative, and therefore seems not particularly Marxist. Anyway, if Josephson harbored doubts about capitalism, he was hardly alone in his generation. Many Americans of his time shared such doubts, as seems understandable under the circumstances--the book was written during the 1930s, in the midst of one of the worst economic crises in world history, and before Keynes refuted a fear widely held amongst prominent economists that capitalism would inexorably produce more and more depressions as time went on.He also seems not particularly &quot;Opportunist&quot;; rather, he was a serious historian, who wrote a number of other historical works that were widely revered in his time and since (one of which, &quot;The Politicos,&quot; is every bit a classic of American history, as is &quot;The Robber Barrons&quot;). I'm not sure where the &quot;Opportunism&quot; comes in.A word of caution is that the book is written in a somewhat archaic style that to modern eyes might seem ostentatious and sometimes melodramatic, and might at times seem a tedious read. Still, if you want a good introduction to a classic account of this important phase of American history, the Robber Barons is an excellent resource."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"The Robber Barons by Matthew Josephson was written in 1934 - at the heart of the Great Depression when America was struggling financially. Matthew Josephson's view in 1934 of the great business titans who dominated between 1861 and 1901 is therefore biased, though he could have had this opinion of them even if the U.S. had been prosperous in the 1930s. Josephson was a socialist, so this definitely contributed to his feelings about the great titans of business. He has mostly a negative view of such industrialists and capitalists as Rockefeller, Morgan, Gould, Carnegie, Vanderbilt, Astor, and many others. That's totally fine. He obviously felt these men were super rich, greedy \\"robber barons.\\" The first person to really uncover the ruthless business practices of any titan of industry was Henry Demarest Lloyd in 1881, when he wrote about John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company in \\"The Story Of A Great Monopoly\\" in The Atlantic Monthly magazine. Investigative journalist or \\"muckraker\\" Ida Tarbell also had ill feelings about John D. Rockefeller during the progressive era, when she wrote a series of articles for McClure's Magazine that eventually became the book The History Of The Standard Oil Company (1904). This was during Teddy Roosevelt's administration (1901 - 1909) that the trusts were starting to be broken up during the so-called progressive era. One can't blame Tarbell for her ill feelings toward John D. Rockefeller at that time.A few years after Josephson's book, which was written during the heart of the Depression, Allan Nevins wrote a book called John D. Rockefeller: The Heroic Age Of American Enterprise (1940). This book was written on the eve of America's involvement in World War II. This book painted John D. Rockefeller as a great American, an \\"industrial statesmen\\" and a philanthropist who helped provide America with an important product needed to help build and expand the country in the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth century. His product, petroleum, helped fuel the machines that helped America win World War II, such as airplanes, tanks, etc. It's interesting how the great business titans have been viewed by people throughout history. What is currently happening in peoples' lives, such as historic events, can greatly mold a person's view of the business titans. Again, when it comes to Josephson, he wrote his book in 1934 during the Great Depression, when America was struggling and the great business titans were viewed as greedy men.So when it comes to this book, The Robber Barons, you can expect a negatively biased view of the great titans of the nineteenth century. Josephson basically takes no prisoners. His view is that of greedy, filthy rich, ruthless businessmen with shady and ruthless business practices to achieve great wealth and dominate their respective industries. Keep in mind, the period of time this book covers (1861 - 1901) was a period of time when there were no anti-trust laws in the U.S. It was a period of laissez-faire (limited government). It was a period of monopolies with no laws restricting them. It was the Age of Enterprise. It was the Gilded Age, a period when the vast majority of wealth in the U.S. was in the hands of a few people. I think you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"This book is good at introducing us to the premier capitalists of the nineteenth century, but the substance is superficial and biased in the extreme.

The fact that these men developed new ways to produce goods at a lower cost, and making them available to the masses, while at the same time making jobs available to thousands, is conveniently forgotten.

Pitts' review.The great trusts of the turn of the twentieth century were not the result of successful competition. Indeed, as Gabriel Kolko demonstrated in The Triumph of Conservatism, the trusts were getting their butts kicked by smaller and more competitive firms. It was only the anti-competitive regulations of the so-called &quot;Progressive&quot; Era that enabled most industries to stabilize on an oligopoly pattern.But the trusts, unsuccessful as they were, would not have been feasible even to attempt, without the massive state capitalist intervention of the Gilded Age. Without railroad subsidies and other &quot;internal improvements&quot; of the nineteenth century, which enabled the largest producers to externalize their distribution costs on the public, production on a national scale would not have even been cost-effective. According to Borsodi's law, productive economies of scale (which themselves peak at relatively modest levels) are offset by increased distribution costs at relatively low levels of output. And these national-scale firms could not have themselves formed trusts without the cartelizing effects of patents and tariffs (the mother of trusts). The fact that the combined effects of railroads, tariffs and patents were still insufficient to stabilize oligopoly markets without further regulatory intervention speaks volumes on the massive scale of government intervention that is necessary for big business as we know it to exist.As Mr. Pitts acknowledges, with a tip of the hat, a central theme of Josephson's account is the role of the state in the formation of the trusts. But having thus tipped his hat, he attempts to contrast the concentrated industry of today, as &quot;good guys,&quot; with its counterparts in the Gilded Age.But is this a valid contrast? Let's take Microsoft as a case study. First of all, consider the essential role of patent control in the consolidation of the Bell systems into AT&amp;T, and of government collusion in AT&amp;T's growth, in creating a centralized telecommunications system. Second, consider the role of government subsidized electronic R&amp;D during the Cold War (including government's role as the main early purchaser of large computer mainframes, without which the industry might never have been able to lower its costs sufficient to produce for the private sector). Third, consider the role of DARPA in creating the infrastructure for the worldwide web. And finally, consider the role of the government's &quot;intellectual property&quot; monopolies in the success of Windows. Without the ability to piggyback on all these things, it is doubtful Bill Gates would have had a fortune approaching even $100 million, let alone $100 billion."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"Not an easy book to get through, it is absolutely essential to an understanding of the rise of big business - and big businessmen - in America. Just as relevant today as when written in 1934."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"Originally published at the height of the Depression, Matthew Josephson's \\"The Robber Barons\\" marks the climax of academic and popular hostility toward the early industrialists. The fact that it still remains in print is testament to its profound influence and popularity. Indeed, the title of the book resurrected what was then an old and rather obscure term and elevated it into the mainstream American lexicon.Reading the book today, the reader will discover that many of Josephson's observations - such as his favorable comments on the then contemporary economic programs of Stalinist Russia - are risible in hindsight. But he does provide a broad overview of the major players and thoroughly chronicles the great evils attributed to them and their practices - at least from the perspective of a 1930s socialist.In short, this book, if it must be read at all, should be read to gain insight into the early twentieth century liberal bias against capitalism and its embrace of a socialist future, rather than a legitimate economic history of the United States in the post bellum period, which it most definitely is not."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"Oh - the confusion in political language! No, folks, the Robber Barons did not rise out of laissez-faire capitalism; they were not capitalists! The Robber Barons rose out of the State's ability to grant corporate status; they are children of the State. They rose out of Statism, NOT free enterprise. In fact, they are the antithesis of free enterprise as Paul H. Weaver so rudely discovered during his stint at Ford (see The Suicidal Corporation).That said, Josephson's book is not just a book on the history of corporatism in America; this book IS history just as Upton Sinclair's 'The Jungle' is a piece of Americana. By wrongly labelling the corporatist robber barons as \\"The Great American Capitalists\\", he unintentionally gave the corporatists the rhetoric of free enterprise with which to hide their statist anti-capitalist behavior. In other words, there was a huge difference between Andrew Carnegie, the partner,who payed the highest wages and charged the lowest prices, and J.P. Morgan's U.S. Steel, the corporation that charged the highest prices and ran to its parent - the State, for protective tariffs. Carnegie ran a laissez-faire business; Morgan's (who got started selling defective rifles to the government)U.S. Steel was a corporation - just as bureaucratic and inefficient as its parent, the State. (are you beginning to see that there's a difference?)The unfavorable portrait of the American businessman came about when Josephson could not distinguish between them and the corporatists: \\"This book attempts the history of a small class of men who arose at the time of our Civil War and suddenly swept into power\\". Yes, war is the health of the State. And corporations are creations of the State - extensions of the State. And statist elites are granted corporate status and privileges. Josephson doesn't quite grasp the difference between them and businessmen, but he can observe what these corporatists are doing: \\"These men more or less knowingly played the leading roles in . . . the renovation of our economic life proceeded relentlessly: large-scale production replaced the scattered, decentralized mode of production; industrial enterprises became more concentrated, more 'efficient' technically, and essentially 'cooperative', where they had been purely individualistic and lamentably wasteful.\\"Notice the difference here? The \\"lamentably wasteful\\" ways were the ways of laissez faire capitalism; the approaches perceived by Josephson to be more \\"efficient\\" were the corporate ways. Yet, Josephson is critical of corporations and their corporatism: \\"But all this revolutionizing effort is branded with the motive of private gain on the part of the new captains of industry. To organize and exploit the resources of a nation upon a gigantic scale, to regiment its farmers and workers into harmonious corps of producers, and to do this only in the name of an uncontrolled appetite for private profit - here surely is the great inherent contradiction whence so much disaster, outrage, and misery has flowed\\". Josephson sounds like he may have liked the Soviet version of industrialization while he criticizes the corporatist version. Yet both are statist approaches.Josephson also confused monopoly profits with market profits. All monopolies are created by the State; in a free market there are no monopolies. The statist corporations and their stifling of competition through the heavy hand of government gave rise to monopolies \\"whence so much disaster, outrage, and misery flowed\\". Yet, he correctly identified these Robber Barons as destroyers. But I'm pretty sure he did not know that it was laissez-faire capitalism that they were destroying.Today, corporations have been granted Constitutional rights by the State, who views them as \\"artificial persons\\". A country by the corporations, of the corporations, and for the corporations. Josephson would rightly be incensed, although he couldn't think of the correct words to say."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"This should have been required reading for advanced high schoolers and college undergrads. This near-objective view of our capitalist leaders thru the &quot;gilded age&quot; gives us the good and the bad. The book presents more facts and tales, and has less opinion and political rambling.It's treatment of politicians as more villainous than the worst of the &quot;Robber Barons&quot; is entirely believable. Josephson worked hard to recount a coherent tale of industrial struggle.The book helped popularize the phrase &quot;Robber Barons&quot; But in today's treatment of &quot;monopolies&quot; such as Microsoft and Intel and ATandT, it's informative to see what a REAL trust was. The trust may be put in negative light in this book, but study of America's incredible progress in this era, above all other countries in the world at this time, teaches us that trusts really don't hinder progress at all-- they actually result from the most intense of all competition and can only last until it is superceded by new technology-- just as AtandT would have met eventual ruinous competition from wireless, cable, and internet companies had the gov't not screwed the American people by breaking it into 7 regional &quot;GOVERNMENT-AUTHORIZED MOnopolies&quot;. No need for gov't interference in business-- period! Only when gov't gets its hands dirty in business is the monopoly harmful.

However, like other reviewers I found this book to be complicated and lacking a flow that the other works have. Josephson focuses mainly on the railroad barons leaving gaps about other important business people of the time. Additionally I was unable to determine what point of view Josephson has on the Barons...I found it hard to tell if he admired them or was writing in protest of what they did (although Charles Beard was cited throughout). One of the good qualities of this text is a large portion is dedicated to the Union Pacific gang (Stanford and Huntington) and Jay Gould...I've not been able to find a quality history of Jay Gould. In summation, if you are interested in reading a book about business people of the Gilded Age I advise you to read \\"Titan\\" or \\"The House of Morgan\\" by Chernow.P.S.

The Robber Barons is one of the better books I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"Of course this book is famous. Josephson coined the term 'Robber Baron'. What is fascinating and important about this book is;a) It confirms the paradox that many of the best writers of the history of business and capitalism are socialists or communists. Marx, Lenin, Hobsbawm, Dreiser, Galbraith, etc. Their writing is addictive. I have read Josephson's book multiple times for the sheer pleasure of his style as I have the books of Eric Hobsbawm. The irony is that these authors have probably done more to enthuse young and aspiring tycoons than discourage them. Much like Oliver Stone's shock at discovering that Gordon Geko became a hero to an entire generation of Wall Street traders.b) It, along with the books of the other gifted writers, was totally wrong. The reason why their predictions on the end of capitalism failed to materialize is because the 'facts' they base their forecasts on were not facts after all. What we now know, and much of this was known in Josephson's time, is that the crimes of the Gould's, Vanderbilt's, etc were pure fantasy or at best exaggerations. It simply did not happen that way. These men simply were not the 'robbers' of Josephson's imagination.c) Its wonderful writing style actually inspired a future generation of pro-capitalist authors to reach for the same level of writing excellence. Such is the irony of history and the law of unintended consequences."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"A book this durable probably deserves a decent rating just for being able to tough it through all these decades. Overall, Mr. Josephson's book has the features of Karl Marx's practical prescriptions for a capitalist economy, without much of Marx's considerable understanding about the creation of capital. Since Marx did make an outstanding analysis of the genesis and growth of capital in market economies (at least at that time), but faltered badly on the \\"prescription\\" part, Josephson's book clearly needs other features to recommend it.One of those is the smooth style in which \\"Robber Barons\\" is written. Josephson is interesting, although not reliably authoritative. Every good writer knows the value of including stories within nonfiction, and this author does a quite creditable job here. Stories glue nonfiction subsection together well, making the reading often less dry. Unlike most of my reviews, I shall excerpt some pieces from \\"Robber Barons\\" to show the book's heavy slant:On page 7, right off the bat, he speaks about the \\"sordid and practical materialism\\" of entrepreneurs.Entrepreneurs' \\"keen eyes\\" would swoop down and offer better rates and services (during the story of Cornelius Vanderbilt, p13).Smart business practice caused, \\"activity, volume, lower prices vs. honest, but limited services at higher tariffs,\\" p16. [Good grief!]Railroads were rich, but people were poor (during the later 19th century), p253.In a humorously odd twist, the author called WWI a period of peace for big businessmen; post-war saw the revival of domestic warfare again (p418). Remember the movie \\"Dr. Strangelove\\"? Near the end, the US president tells a scuffling military officer and the Soviet ambassador, \\"Gentlemen! You can't fight in the war room!\\" Same odd reversal.Unfortunately, the book consists mostly of similar points of view.Let's be fair. \\"Robber Barons\\" was written in the late Depression in the US. At that time, there was considerable radical frustration with the US economy. Much of that frustration came from persons like the author, who truly wished the FDR programs to work. Few ever did by any measure. Seen in this light, \\"Robber Barons\\" makes sense. Give the author a break."},{"Title":"The robber barons;: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901,","review":"This book is a classic of denegration based on ideology.

Kutler's expansive work makes this traumatic time in American history come alive. What stands out clearly for me after having consumed this book is the fact that Nixon became so obsessed with Watergate that he lost his ability to govern. His focus on enemies and public reaction to everything he did prevented him from being a president. Interestingly, nobody was killed or attacked in this scandal, and it probably would have all blown over had he just come clean as soon as he became aware of what happened. But Kutler makes wise observations regarding the power of the presidency, Congressional responsibility and many other constitutional factors that Watergate forced our country to confront. I wish my college textbooks resembled Kutler's work, as they'd have been much more engaging."},{"Title":"The Wars of Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon","review":"This book is truely well written.

It will also make you curious about the Pentagon Papers. All these books are written from a historical perpective by well know historians. Not journalist looking for a quick buck."},{"Title":"The Wars of Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon","review":"If your goal is to understand the depth of Richard Nixon's involvement in the Watergate scandal, Stanley Kutler's \`The Wars of Watergate' is the book for it. It's a great introduction to Watergate without that qualifying caveat, of course, but Kutler perches his narrative squarely on Nixon's shoulder. This book doesn't take extended side trips to the creation of the Plumbers, to that dirty trickster Donald Segretti, or the back desks in the Special Prosecutor's offices. The wars of Watergate, Kutler writes, are \\"rooted in the lifelong political personality of Richard Nixon,\\" a personality that is marked by political paranoia, a determination to wreak vengeance on his enemies, and an overweening concern with winning his own elections. For those who dismiss Watergate as a third-rate burglary, or a vague \`everyone else does it,' Kutler provides a substantial \\"discussion of the abuses of power that precede the burglary and the obstruction of justice that followed it.\\"Kutler sets the stage with brief chapters on the LBJ Administration, Vietnam, and a biographical sketch of Richard Nixon prior to the presidential election of 1968. We're taken closer to our subject with Kutler's next few chapters on Nixon's first term as president, where Nixon's relationship with the media (antagonistic,) and congress (disdainful,) as well as his executive style (obsessive micro-management) are surveyed. Providing as they do a context for the crimes of Richard Nixon, these prelude-to-war sections properly prepare us for the battles of Watergate.An American constitutional historian, Stanley Kutler is well qualified to guide us through the battleground that was the second term of Richard Nixon. The war analogy is apt. For Nixon the Wars of Watergate officially begins with the immediate Administration response to the break-in at the DNC headquarters by the Watergate burglars. The first phase may be called \\"The War of the Burglars' Silence,\\" a phase that is marked by Nixon's active participation in those acts that would lead to his resignation less that two years later.One gets the strong impression that \`The Wars of Watergate' is Kutler's response to future revisionist historians. The revisionist template was already being hammered out by Nixon, and others, when this book was published in 1990. If Kutler is forestalling an alternate interpretation, he does so with a well-coordinate, thoughtful, balanced, and overwhelmingly convincing presentation of facts. His interpretation - that Nixon was at the center of the Watergate cover-up from the beginning - is, with the evidence he provides to back it up, irrefutable.Although \`The Wars of Watergate' is not a complete history of the scandal, it's a good chunk of it - the heart of it, if you will. It would make a good introduction for the uninitiated. Even for Watergate wonks its expanded chapters on the Rodino chaired House Judiciary Committee, which considered impeachment, will provide fresh insights and a more complete story of an under-reported Watergate subject. This may not be the best single volume on Watergate, but if it isn't I haven't read its rival. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Wars of Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon","review":"The Watergate break-in and coverup scandal that toppled the presidential administration of Richard Nixon is, maybe arguably, one of American history's watershed events. Why is clearly explained by Richard Kutler in his historically rich book that is very probably the most comprehensive and easily understood publication on the subject. Kutler begins with the approval by the president's men of the break-in at the headquarters in the Watergate complex of the National Democratic Committee and, after the plot's five burglars are nabbed, the conspiracy to cover up the involvement of the White House in the break-in. Kutler is rightly clear in pressing the point that there has never been any evidence that Nixon himself approved the break-in (that was OKed by the president's operatives). But, just six days after the June 17, 1972, break-in, Nixon ordered the coverup in the now infamous smoking gun taped conversation with chief of staff H.R. Haldeman. From the apprehension of the break-in's participants, Kutler takes us to the Senate investigative committee that gradually chipped away to lead to the articles of impeachment that were being advanced but not forwarded to the House because of Nixon's resignation. The number of participants in the Watergate affair is sheer numbing, but Kutler does a tremendous job in not getting his reader too bogged down in trying to keep the cast straight. In the end, though, the historical value of Kutler's contribution is why Watergate essentially redefined the presidency, how it altered the American public's perception of the nation's highest office and why and how the built-in safeguards against a tyrannical presidency worked. As for Nixon, it goes without saying he was a truly tragic figures whose pettiness sabotaged what could likely have been one of the most effective presidential administrations in history. Kutler concludes with a tantalizing question: assuming that Nixon did, to some extent, rehabilitate his public image in the years before his death, was that rehabilitation due to the fallen president's changing his character's fatal flaws, or was it because he simply out-lived most of what he called his \\"enemies?\\" All this and more in one of the most compelling documents in the Watergate fiasco."},{"Title":"The Wars of Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon","review":"Finally, a book with an analysis of Watergate as a historical event. The problem with previous books about Watergate is that they were all written from the perspective of the author and his/her view of reality. Kutler writes as a historian. Attempting to set the stage for the event and detailing the issues with careful analysis. It is an amazing work really. Sunday historians or \\"picture-book\\" readers will lose patience with the work due to the painstaking detail of the book. Kutler starts with a careful analysis of Nixon's political past then moves on to the reasons (or lack thereof) for the arrogrant presumption that whatever the President does is OK (except perhaps for getting a BJ in the White House). Since the President is basically in charge of National Security issues, he cannot break the law in protecting those interests. Until reading Kutler's brilliant book, I was confused as to where this concept originated and how Nixon and his staff could be so stupid to justify the actions surrounding Watergate. Kutler puts it all into perspective. It can be a tough read, however, since Kutler assumes that the reader knows something about 20th Century American History as well as posessing a basic understanding of the american political system. If you are looking for a \\"light\\" read, pass this one by. If you are prepared to be engrossed in the Watergate saga through a well-written, intelligent, and researched book, then buy this one. You will be happy you did."},{"Title":"The Wars of Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon","review":"This is the clearest, most concise, most accesible book on Watergate I have ever come across. Its most important feature is providing the reader with a deepr understanding of Watergate beyond the mere surface aspects of the cover-up, but instead lets one understand the implications the Nixon Administartions activities had for the nation. At times, the book may seem too partisan, and the large &quot;cast of characters&quot; can be hard to juggle.

Stanley I. Cutler is one of the first to look at the scandal from a &quot;historical&quot; perspective. He does an excellent job of presenting the events in the proper historical context, removed as they now are from the political passions that bolied over at the time. Nixon then was a discraced figure with a core of ardent supporters. He managed to partly rehabilitate himself before his death by outlasting many of his enemies. This book shows, in all grim detail, why Nixon should never be allowed to complete his quest for rehabilitation. It shows clearly the dangers of electing a President willing and able to deliberately misuse his power."},{"Title":"The Wars of Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon","review":"There is no scholar better versed in the matters of Watergate than Stanley Kutler, and this is his definitive account of the subject.

I expected such an account to be dull; instead, I found it impossible to put down. No reader can walk away from this book - with its extensive evidence and clearly-reasoned arguments - and not have a deeper understanding of what Watergate was and how it effected the nation, both then and now."},{"Title":"The Wars of Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon","review":"This book goes into more detail than any others I've read. Putting Watergate into the wider context of an administration and President that is paranoid about secrecy, all the while taping his personal conversations. This book provides important details about all the major players in this drama from the powerful Haldeman, the petulant Gordon Liddy to the aspiring young attorney John Dean, there is an abundance of interesting drama in this tale, and you have to remind yourself that this actually happened. The new chapter of this book in hopefully a next edition will deal with the role played by \\"Deep Throat\\" Mark Felt of the FBI.One of the more disturbing scenes for me in this book is the vote by the Congressional sub-committee for impeachment. Looking at the damning evidence that Nixon clearly obstructed justice, there were still numerous Republicans voting no for impeachment, among them a young congressman named Trent Lott. His sanctimonious blustering in the Clinton impeachment proceedings made my skin crawl knowing his own hypocrisy.Anyone interested in American history should have this book in their collection."},{"Title":"The Wars of Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon","review":"At least for those us who cut their political teeth during the 1960's and 1970's, Watergate and Vietnam were the watershed events. There was life before Watergate and Vietnam and life after. Stanley Kutler's work is one of the first to bring an historian's perspective to the Watergate story. As the saying goes, if you read one book about Watergate, this is the one.Kutler is by no means neutral on Richard Nixon, but one of the unique things about Watergate was that Nixon's own taping system provided the record to hang himself. If nothing else the tapes proved Nixon was a habitual and flagrant liar. Kutler, whose regular job is as a professor at the University of Wisconsin, was drawn into a lifetime of work by his expertise on the sprawling scandal that was Watergate. His work has continued as he battled first Nixon, Nixon's estate, and then the National Archivists for full access to the White House tapes. Nixon kept up his lies and deception to his last days, with far more success than one would have hoped. In the long run, history's judgment of Nixon will be harsh and will start with Kutler's work."},{"Title":"The Wars of Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon","review":"I couldn't add anything else to the other comments; just buy it - you will not regret."},{"Title":"The Wars of Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon","review":"Not just about Watergate, but a comprehensive look at RN's political career.

The story is good, the characters well drawn, and the pacing is relatively fast for stories from that era. On the other hand, the fact that the girl, despite numerous attempts on her life, contemptuously ignores the repeated entreaties of one who is looking out for her, is a little hard to accept.

Creative, transformative regeneration--a concept not always integrated in Death card imagery.Susan Hudes created her namesake Tarot by combining luminous watercolors with antique maps, constellation charts and marbled paper, which adds a decidedly three-dimensional feel to this seamlessly collaged deck.From the sky-clad lemniscate above the Magician's head to the smooth, cool marbled face of the Moon, Ms. Hudes' compositions are inviting and intriguing. I love some of the unusual perspectives, such as the bird's eye view of the boat in the 6 of Swords where we get to peek down at a man about to row while six swords lay scattered in the water.In the Cups suit, the Court Cards show figures holding golden goblets filled with not water, but aquatic representations from maps. And the rich, raspberry-colored discs in the Pentacles suit are simple, but striking.The cards from the Hudes Tarot measure approximately 4 x 2 inches, and while the design on the backs is attractive, it is not reversible. The suits of this deck are Cups, Swords, Wands and Pentacles while the Courts follow the Page, Knight, Queen and King ordering.The Little White Book for this deck is unusually brief, offering only a few upright meanings for the cards, which were gleaned from Wisdom in the Cards by A.L. Samul--a commentary on the Hudes Tarot.If you prefer well-crafted collage decks, especially ones that employ cheery hues and flowing watercolors, the Hudes Tarot will more than meet your expectations. It is a very readable deck, so it's an excellent choice for those new to Tarot. Experienced readers who favor Rider-Waite-Smith imagery will likely make fast friends with this deck, as well. Absent of nudity or darker imagery, this deck is also well suited to readings for children or those spooked by traditional renderings.(To see 12 card images from the Hudes Tarot, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)"},{"Title":"Hudes Tarot Deck","review":"This deck is not for the impatient--nor for thrill seekers or lovers of the trendy! That being said, let not the Hudes tarot's simplicity be misleading. The artist managed to create an unusual blend of soft melancholy mixed in with decided movement. The moon-dipped skies and watercoloured trees give it an otherworldly feel, almost like its message is floating before the mind's eye rather than one passively viewing the images. Some tarot readers prefer their cards to be chock a block with symbols of every school and religion, combined with a million subliminal messages--this deck really uses it's own aura and atmosphere to convey it's meaning. It adheres very closely to the RW deck--I could tell which card was which without looking at the title--so all these features allow the mind to relax and the spirit to take over--for deep personal meditation and professional readings alike. There are so many levels here to travel.I think my favourite cards are definitely Temperance, where I could almost drink the water in the Angel's reflection and Death, with the Fool card coming close behind. the use of maps in the courtcard background lend to a medieval, exploratory and adventurous flavour. Some have criticized the seeming lack of expression for the people depicted in the cards. Over time (this deck sometimes takes a while to \\"grow on you\\") I came to understand it was part of the dreamy state which is the general trademark of this deck.A lovely deck for beginners who might have outgrown their Pamela Coleman deck or want to begin to progress a little further, but still a great deck for seasoned and experienced readers who just want to dive into the world presented here in the Hudes world and enjoy the peace of finding an old friend under a different guise! btw, the artist is a graphic novelist as well, check out her website!"},{"Title":"Hudes Tarot Deck","review":"The Hudes Deck is the most beautiful tarot deck I have ever seen. It is creative in the symbols it uses that are unique to the deck, such as antique maps, astrological colors, and strokes meant to represent the beautiful and many-meaning rock Malachite. The colors are bold as is the art, done in a way that draws you into the card and its meaning. All together it is an artistic deck that, because of its dramatic beauty, forces you to really examine the card and you life with intense depth and scrutiny."},{"Title":"Hudes Tarot Deck","review":"I am relatively new to the tarot so i can't tell you about the accuracy of readings and such,but i can tell you these cards are fantastic looking this is up there in the top 5 of medieval style of decks ,along with Nigel Jackson's Medieval Enchantment Deck(Out of print),The Golden Tarot By Kat Black, the Gilded Tarot and the Old English Tarot along with this one is your top five medieval decks.Hudes deck though may not be for some do to its melancholy nature along with the subtle colors and lack of uber happy people but thats what makes it medieval.So if you like very happy fluff decks this one may not be for you also disregard one other reviewer who called it a \\"too cute deck\\" its not that kind of deck at all as i described it earlier.The cards themselfs are well coated so they will be around for a long haul but are a little slick,a small little problem i had with is the size they are a little small i always feel that 3x5 is a perfect size, but all and all these cards are great for any level tarot card reader and a must have in a collection."},{"Title":"Hudes Tarot Deck","review":"I am currently re-immersing myself in the Tarot after some years away from it, and have purchased three new decks, of which this is one.

It isn't my perfect deck, but I may never find that, still I will say I can tell I will probably work with this one personally and professionally quite a lot.

I discovered this book in the course of the last semester , being one of the must reads for the game theory course I'd taken , and once I got my hands on this book I couldn't wait to have the time to read it thoroughly , a task I completed only lately .Game theory in general and TOM in particular , have given me a new way of looking at the world surrounding me ; I feel like I understand it better than before I've learned to use this logical and rational thinking . Many things look simpler now , since the facts and principals I've learned make them comprehensible , understandable and clearer than before .Prior to reading this book you'd have to have some background on the classical game theory . I learned this background mainly from the booklet of Frank Zagare that pretty much covered all the main basic principals of the qualitative use of the theory . Morton Davis is also a good choice for beginners , both center on the non-mathematical aspects of the theory which are used to dissect and explain the decisions of players at matters of internal politics ,international relations and everyday's life serious decisions people make .This work represents an extension of game theory that helps to adjust it better to real life , or as Brams puts it : \\"The Theory of Moves brings a dynamic dimension to the classical theory which was defined as static , by postulating that players think ahead not just to the immediate consequences but also to the consequences of the other player's countermove , counter countermove and so on ... TOM extends the strategic thinking into the more distant future . \\"Brams , in his book , gives all the tools needed to learn and understand everything about his fascinating theory . This effort is mostly a summation of more then two decades of trial and error , deep investigations , constant changes and improvements , and examination of a myriad of case studies .The major concepts and issues you are going to read about and be captivated with will start with the 'Anticipation Problem' , going through 'Magnanimity' with the teasing theme - \\"it sometimes pays ...\\", 'Moving Power' , 'Order' and 'Threat power' , ending with 'Information Problems' in games such as 'Misperception' (which is enormously intriguing concept to capture) , 'Deception' and 'Omniscience' . There is also an additional chapter that was difficult for me to understand , in which Brams offers a new model of negotiations .Each chapter is written with the well known form of introduction - theory principals - applications , in addition to a last chapter that concludes the entire book . This design is very helpful since whenever you have problems understanding the theory - you can immediately skip to the examples Brams is generous with giving - and solve all the unclear points instantly . As for the style itself , we're dealing here with a first class author that has the outstanding ability to keep you thrilled all along the reading effort , winding up asking for more ...From what I've gathered so far this is the best book you can get about this brilliant extension . I believe everyone that is interested in expanding horizons in this evolving field should read this book , and maybe add further applications and modifications in the future to come ."},{"Title":"Theory of Moves","review":"Steven Brams' Theory of Moves is a fascinating publication that supplies qualitative and quantitative mathematical models used to explain the merits and deficiencies in the logic of hypothetical and anecdotal decisions of various types (economic, political, social, etc.).Brams intermittently isolates two-party conflicts and highlights each conceivable resolution by using a 2x2 matrix that gives a variety of possibilities provided in ordered pair combinations, where the numbers range from a 1, which translates to a worst case scenario for the party concerned, to a 4, which is the best possible outcome. For instance, a (1,4) would be interpreted as a two-party game where the deciding party, who receives a 1, ends up with the theoretically worst possible outcome, leaving the opponent, which receives a 4, with the best. As another case, a (3,2) would be read as a pairing where the 3 represents a next-to-best outcome for the decision making party, whereas the 2, on the other hand, would be the next-to-worst outcome for the opponent.Brams looks at various situations, comparing and contrasting, for instance, the fictional works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, whose most famous character, the detective Sherlock Holmes, always comes out one step ahead of his arch nemesis, with those that display what is referred to as the Minimax Theorem, which espouses that \\"[i]n a two-person constant-sum game,[it] guarantees that each player can ensure at least a certain expected value, called the value of the game, that does not depend on the strategy choice of the other player\\". Among the works in this latter category is William Faulkner's Light in August, where a chase scene is partially deconstructed by Brams in such a way that argues that, unlike Doyle, whose protagonist is portrayed as a character with computational abilities that are superior to those of the antagonist, who never, in turn, makes the necessary adjustments to place himself or herself at an unequivocally victorious stage, Faulkner understood the mixed strategies involved in a two-person sum game where, perhaps, a decision made by the inferior might have the silver bullet effect to overcome the superior.As a relevant case that might be brought forth, sports analysts paid special attention to the selection of players for the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team. After the best American players, even at the top of the National Hockey League, had previously been beaten by the Soviets time and again, the hopes of ever defeating Russia, especially in 1980, were dim. What transpired to be the Miracle on Ice was regarded by sports historians as essentially this. Though decision making officials were inclined to put together what were deemed the very best of the best, the U.S. coach used, as I recall, a counterintuitive approach by forming a team that largely consisted of players with, perhaps, less talent than the hockey elite but, nonetheless, an overall determination to win which could not be denied. In other words, the U.S. probably did not have its best team that day, but it had, more importantly, the right team.Throughout Theory of Moves, Brams portrays various situations where diplomacy and compromise are the appropriate, realistic approaches to dealing with an opponent. For instance, if the outcome is ideologically next-to-best, it might, in reality terms, be the applicable best, especially in cases where the opponent has interests that run counter to those of the decision maker. In those particular scenes, Brams provides further outlets of analyses, expounding upon where it is not worth pursuing the attainment or maintenance of the best possible state; in discussion, Brams introduces us to magnanimity, which is a transfer of moving from what was the best possible state to the next-best possible. Magnanimity, according to Brams, is essential, especially if what was regarded as the best possible situation devolves into a worst case Status Quo, where the opposing party, over time, grows resentful and decides to rise up in hostile action.What have been provided in these few paragraphs are only a handful of terms that Brams gives in these roughly 215 pages, for there are so many angles for the reader to look upon. In fact, the information and explanations are so thorough and detailed that once a person gains a more refined appreciation or understanding of the decision making powers or adjustments necessary for optimal outcome in game theory, he or she can apply it in life, especially when making personal decisions and effectively dealing with the dilemma that we often put 80% of our energies into what amounts to only 20% of what is really of immediate importance.Theory of Moves is a definite must have. Quite a bit of the language is technical, but there is enough induction applied where one can draw enough analogies and parallels to what is discussed so as to relate to the points that Brams is getting across."},{"Title":"Theory of Moves","review":"The next step on the journey to understanding and applying game theory.

That aside, this Kindle version is still worth the 99 cents.The book itself is a series of brief to long reports and opinions by Marines of the 1st Division on Guadalcanal (and some members of the Army's 164th Regiment) gathered in interviews at the end of November 1942. The reports vary from Gen. Vandegrift's analysis of a particular small-unit battle on the Matanikau and the lessons learned, to simple opinions of officers and NCOs about tactics, the shortcomings of US soldiers and Marines, and various weapons. These aren't reminiscences and memories years later about combat; these are men, many still in combat, expressing their immediate concerns and warnings about fighting the Japanese army in the South Pacific jungles. Not surprisingly, the language used to describe their enemy is course, but that just adds to the value of this pamphlet which is really a remarkable snapshot of American fighting forces learning their trade at the start of the Pacific offenses.The men respect the Japanese skills at camouflage and seek to learn from their opponents, and are particularly envious of their \\"knee mortars.\\" Some of the comments highlight the nature of the fight, like the officer who warns that no Japanese soldier should ever be left alive, and another who declares that the best action one could offer a wounded American was to ignore him and keep advancing - when the enemy is dead, then you can go back and render first aid. My favorite statement: \\"I love our mortars.\\"The formatting of the Kindle version is just fine, and the photos added by the editor are useful and appreciated as well.If you're looking to read how Americans talked about combat in 1942, or need to know what to pack for a patrol against Japanese positions on Guadalcanal, this is a good start."},{"Title":"Fighting on Guadalcanal","review":"I enjoy reading about the struggle of our forces in the Pacific during WWII. This book shows the terrible sacrifices our troops made in the jungles and island fighting. It is well written and exposes the real cost of war to the individual soldier. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Fighting on Guadalcanal","review":"This book is a must for any world war two history buff. Written by people who where there and who new what went on."},{"Title":"Fighting on Guadalcanal","review":"When compiled, the complaints of USA troops during the battle of Guadalcanal were top secret - we didn't want the Japanese to know of our deficiencies. Nowadays, these complaints of the USA troops seems odd but then the lack of training, poor leadership and need for better weapons was apparent. This is a good book detailing those complaints."},{"Title":"Follow That Blonde","review":"Lana Morton was on the trip of her dreams - a whirlwind tour of Greece, Italy, England, and more! Too bad her drop dead gorgeous cousin, Nancy Bankes, decided to come along. Well, actually Nancy wasn't too bad for all that she was incredibly beautiful. Lana had a wonderful time until they hit Rome. Rome wasn't quite what Lana expected and she hoped that that coin she threw in the Trevi fountain wouldn't really bring her back there. Things got worse when Lana and Nancy ran into Bert Garr, an old high school classmate that they nicknamed \\"Pig Eyes.\\" Bert seemed to be doing quite well for himself in Rome, however, and even took them to an exhibit of artists' work. Lana couldn't believe that someone as talented as Nick Hansen was would ever consider using someone like Bert as his agent. No accounting for taste...Before Lana knew it, she was stuck with the gorgeous Nick (who had made it very clear that he was only with her as a favor to Bert) while Bert tried to pick up where he and Nancy left off in high school. Then they missed their bus to the next city and all three ganged up on Lana to persuade her to stay in Nick's villa for a few days and rejoin their tour - which was prepaid, by the way - later. Lana actually began to enjoy herself, until she found herself embroiled in the midst of an art scam. Turns out Nick's work in tempera was relatively new. He used to do modern art pieces in France, but they didn't sell at all well so he switched techniques. However, someone was selling Nick's old paintings under a different, dead artist's name. And that someone knew that Nick would recognize his own work, which he definitely couldn't allow to happen....This is just a very light, fun read. The characters are all a bit ludicrous and foolish in their actions, but they were good hearted and very fun to get to know. All of them kept finding themselves in absolutely impossible situations, but it was just so funny that you couldn't help but laugh at their antics. I especially enjoyed Nick trying to warm up to the prickly Lana and to persuade her that looks weren't everything. The author's descriptions of Rome were charming and her accounts of Nick driving in Italian traffic were absolutely hilarious. If you find the opportunity to read this entertaining novel, jump on it!"},{"Title":"Revolution 1776","review":"I'll add one thing to the title of my review: I picked this up in a used book store once while I was a student in Jerusalem. I ended up donating my copy to some very thoroughly English friends, who loved it, precisely because the book was a) funny, b) irreverent, and c) was particularly good at pointing out the biases that many Americans who read it when it first came out would have brought with them to reading the book.A very good book to read second about the revolution."},{"Title":"Revolution 1776","review":"Although flawed by the omniscient hindsight, this is an excellent review of the American Revolution.

(The other off course is Little Women).Little men is a book that can make you both laugh and cry. The morals inside are more useful than any of the ten commandments. Louisa May Alcott has definetly done it again.Without giving away everything, these are some of the reasons why you will enjoy the book:1) You see Jo grow up. She is no longer the wild child who's impetuous and androgynous character often lead her to trouble. She inherits maternal qualities that you never expected Jo to have.2) You will get more insight on the professor. Although I truly wanted Teddy and Jo to get together, this book made me think otherwise. Professor Bhaer, with Jo's help, makes a delightful father to the boys. He is the one you will get most of the life morals from.3) The boys in Plumfield are definetly the key figures in the book. They create both the mischievious and melancholy stories. As I said, 'you'll laugh and cry'. Reading about these boys will make everyone reflect on their own lives.4) Teddy grows up too. If you enjoyed the young scandulous Teddy, you'll enjoy the new one even more. In little men, Teddy (like Jo) has grown into a real mature father.There are plenty more exciting things in the book. It is truly a classic masterpiece recommended to anyone who needs a lift in their spirit."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"While Little Men is not up to the literary achievement of Little Women, it is a wonderful tale for kids. It is JUST perfect for reading chapter by chapter to kids as part of an evening family night. It is as jolly as a house full of rambunctious boys could be.Jo Bhaer, nee March, has boys of her own now and boys to spare. She and the Professor take in students based on charity and kindness. Some boys are neglected, some are badly brought up, all need love, laughter and a caring environment. Plumfield is all that and more.The jolly goings-on make you wish you could have gone to school and lived at Plumfield. The book is prevented from being saccharine by the all-too-familiar themes of neglected kids, growing pains and the sad and much too early death of a favorite character from Little Women.There is lots of fun, and lots to discuss in this sequel to Alcott's marvelous Little Women.

I am not reviewing the story Little Men, but the way it was published by IndiePublish. I would give the story 5 stars, but this presentation only two.On the bright side, the cloth binding appears very well done and should last quite a while.Unfortunately, the publisher chose to reformat all the paragraphs in the text so that like this review all margins are left justified and a blank line separates the paragraphs. If it were done well, it might have worked ok, but it was done very clumsily with the completion of a sentence often being separated from the rest of the paragraph. (I have a suspicion that the reformatting of an original text was done by using a Find-Replace function of a word processor and not checked by an editor.) This makes for some awkward readings, and probably not something I would want to put into the hands of a child.Also the text was not proofed for typos or other simple errors in punctuation, and there are some places where I could not tell what the original sentence was intended to say. Again, I expect that the only proofing done on this version was by a spellchecker and a lot of simple mistakes entered into the publication.I wish to repeat, that I love this story and have since I was a boy, and would recommend the story to any child, but would not recomment this particular volume."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"I really loved this book!

I know what every room looks like and how to get there!I could see the boy's foot when he hurt it and I could see his face when the doctor had to fix it.I love this book!! It is not a girly book like I thought it would be. In fact it is quite a boy book!! A boy or a girl could read this book and really enjoy it!!I would recommend this book for ages 12 and up.By Seth Courtney Age 13 Grade 7"},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"&quot;Little Men&quot; was one of my childhood favorites (I found &quot;Little Women&quot; too sad), and I was pleased to find on rereading it that it's almost as much fun for me now as it was when I was ten. Loosely plotted, it's a good bedtime book, because each chapter or couple of chapters presents a complete vignette. After all, you don't always want to be reading a book that keeps you up till all hours! Life at Plumfield is almost idyllic, with just enough conflict to keep things moving along. When I was a child, I longed for a museum like theirs, and a miniature cast-iron stove, and all kinds of things--the book was wonderful for my imagination. N.B.: I tried reading it to my boys, and even though it's about boys, they were bored, so it may be a girl book."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"This is the continuation of Little Women, and Jo's Boys will be the cont. of this book. Little Men is a book about the boys and girls of all ages, and if you thought little women was much about women, READ THIS BOOK. The boys are all different ages. There is musical Nat, bookworm Demi, troublesome Tommy, fireband Dan(my fav't character), resonsible Franz, commodore Emil, Little Ted, Rob...and dont forget girls, Lovely Daisy, ms.giddy gaddy Nan, and pretty Bess....and so many other characters. They just will not be friends, but a great big FAMILY. They will be happy, sad, confused, angry...at each other, but will not be a problem for Mr.&amp;Mrs. Bhaer(Jo), Mr.&amp;Mrs. Brooke(Meg), and Mr.and Mrs. Laurence(laurie&amp;Amy). These young men and women will be so different, yet so together and close!"},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"This sequel to \\"Little Women\\" continues the heart warming saga of the March family girls. It follows events in their lives as married women, and the lives of their children. This book seems to be more popular with boy readers than \\"Little Women\\", which often appeals to girls between the ages of 11-15 (depending on their individual reading level). Perhaps this is linked to the fact that there are more main characters who are boys in \\"Little Men\\". The innocent quality of romance and adventure in this plot, as well as the emphasis on morality and family relationships, make this a good gift for those concerned about the types of literature their children are reading. Adults buying this for children should note that the moral aspects of the story generally reinforce 19th century Protestant Christian values (its your choice whether that impacts your purchase or not!).This is another book that has continued to be my favorite 20 years after reading it for the first time."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"I really liked this book because it was really exciting and fun all at the same time! I mean, the characters in the book were just so fun to be with and when you are reading the book, it almost seems like you are there with them. I just really enjoyed the book because Louis wrote it so well! I've also read Jo's Boy and that one was good too, but somehow, I couldn't finish Little Women.

I had to read it for a class project and this book was a snooze. Now I know everyone who did enjoy this book is probably wanting to rip my eyeballs out of my head, but I wanted to give my opinion. I hated this book so much I never wanted to reopen it, I couldn't help put it down. It took me weeks to read this book when it usually only takes me 2 days to read a book. The book had really no plot, it rambled on and it felt like a huge run on sentence. There was a few good parts and when I started to get excited and then it made me want to throw it across the room."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"I love this book.

However, there are twelve boys and two girls. The author takes you through six months of the year with the children. People will laugh at their antics and in the same token will be touched by the love and respect with which they treat each other. Each child has his or her obsticals to overcome and each has their own good points. The author makes you feel as if you are in the school with them the entire time. The reader will be drawn into their world and wish he or she were really there. This is an overall great book and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"The magic of youth is captured here in all its transitory and fleeting beauty and turmoil.

There are many really wonderful sequences in this story, though it doesn't really have much of a plotline. In fact, there are even some very creative and uncannily modern methods of parenting to drill the boys (yes, there are a few girls present, too) into well-meaning gentlemen one day. A do-gooder's fantasy that really gushes with sappy maternal cooing and fussing at times, but overall it's a very remarkable book ever written by a proper lady of the Victorian era."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"Little Men is the funniest of all the three books. I like this book, but not as much as the Jo's Boys or Little Women. Little Men begins with 'Nat as the 1st ch. If you have seen the movie and think it is great, wait till you read the book. The novel is much more sophisticated and very touching. The movie basically concentrates on Nat and Dan, but the novel is about every single boy and girl. If you've seen the movie and didnt like it, guess what, try the novel! My fav't characters are everybody. Old Chirper(Nat), Dan, Demi, Daisy, Tommy, Franz, Commodore(Emil), Nan, Princess(Bess), little Ted, Rob, Jack..too many people. If you like the story of boys and girls, this is one of the books to read. If this is the Alcott's 1st book you've read, TRY ALL! ALCOTT IS THE BEST! My fav't part is the LITTLE COOKSTOVE(iron). Its so neat, and how Daisy, Nat, Demi, Dan, Emil, Tommy, and dont forget our Teddy, and Rob, standing up for each others."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"This book is a follow up on the wonderful book (that I love) Little women. Little women was a enchanting book about the March girls and a friendly neighbor named Laurie. Jo March gets married to Mr. Bhaer and in Little Women and now they have a place called Plumfield, which they inheirited. With Plumfield they make it sort of like an orphanage and takes boys from the street, teaching them and loving them. I would recommend this book, if you read the first one.

This novel is simple with its man against himself conflict, yet sweet, and a reminder of the trials and tribulations of growing up. You have no choice but to feel compassion for the boys and girls of Jo's house, and the innocent that they maintain throughout the book. After having read three books by the above authour, I am eagerly about to devour another as Alcott continually supplies the reader with innovative, and intriguing emotions, faces, and experiences."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"Mostly I got this book because I never owned it and do own Little Women and Jo's Boys.I want my daughter to have the trilogy.I thought it was terrible.A mere series of goody-goody character sketches with very little holding it all together. If anything, it just underscored how Jo should have accepted Teddy! They were a great pair.I did not care about these boys much and even had trouble distinguishing them from one another.Jo's Boys was much better--at least a novel, so read Little Men only to fill in the blanks."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"Though I read Little Women many times as a girl and just again recently, I hadn't ever read Little Men. I recnetly purchased the book so I could find out what happens to the March family. The story begins slowly (even for 19th century literature) and I found myself wondering if Louisa May Alcott actually wrote it-the style seemed so different. However, as I became more involved in the book Alcott's old charm comes through. I enjoyed a thouroughly delightful tale. Little Men continues with the story of Plumfield and introduces all of Jo's boys.

I got all the companion ones to this one, plus several other similar ones.I won't review the actual \\"book\\", because it should be extremely well-known, as one of the most beloved American authors did her usual great job.My review is of the Kindle version of this and the other similar items. Although \\"print books\\" these days have many errors in proofreading, punctuation, spelling, etc., the Kindle versions of ALL of these books is DEPLORABLE. Missing words, misspelled words, terrible punctuation, missing paragraph indicators--the list goes on and on. The wretched result is a product which is virtually unreadable unless you are already familiar with the book and know what it is SUPPOSED to say.I have seen some of the same issues creeping into Kindle books that are brand new on the market as well. I don't want to get free books, or cheap books if they are unreadable, and I don't want to purchase new books for a Kindle (for a price higher than I can buy that book at Costco) that are so badly reproduced.That said, enjoy the story (if you can figure out what it is SUPPOSED to say)."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"I am 76 years old and reading is a passion. Since the Kindle I have enjoyed numerous books for free. i grew up on Little Women. Have loved that story in print and in movies for as long as I can remember. June Allyson will always be Jo in my mind and heart. It dawned on me as i was looking through titles that I do not remember Little Men. In fact, for one who grew up reading, and loving it, i do not remember ever reading Little Men. So since it cost me nothing, i decided to download it and give it a try. I was transported back in time to a kinder, gentler, era where characters became family once again and stories became new and at the same time familiar. I still don't know if I ever read Little Men growing up but I lost myself in it at this age. Louisa Mae Alcott lived again in my heart and in my head. If I am lucky enough to celebrate an 80th birthday, I plan on reading it again."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"Excellent book. I enjoyed reading this book. The whole series of these are good reading for readers of any age."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"This book should be required reading for every child. Although fiction, it describes life in the 19th century quite well. It talks about poorhouses, running away from home (or boarding school in this case), sacrifices made for friendship, the sorrow of death (in a kind way), homemade fun, etc. It's also wildly funny in places; the chapter \\"In the Willow\\" is my favorite because of the witty things the children say. In some ways, I liked it better than \\"Little Women\\" because the cultural references were easier to undertand."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"an awesome read for any lover of classics.

The boys that Jo and her husband are raising and teaching get into fun, silly adventures. This book is both heartwarming and, at times, heart-wrenching. If you like stories about children and their joys and triumphs, you'll enjoy this sweet little book.All that being said, the Kindle version has MANY editorial mistakes; words missing, misspelled, a word which was clearly mistakenly entered in place of another, etc."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"Looking back on this book, I've noticed that it seems less (I don't want to say elaborate) but that's about the word...then say Nathaniel Hawthorne or Charles Dickens. But, in a way that is refreshing.I still think that the sacrifice of the toys was slightly funny and I'm still very much impressed by the unique parenting/leadership skills of the now adult Jo and her husband.Without giving away the entire plot, I'll say that it's about a school they run out of their house and it doesn't have a nice neat plotline.Now may I add: This version is amazing, the discussion questions in the back enhanced my reading immensely and I got so much more from the story then I would have. Also the illustartions are lovely. This book (compared to other's from it's era) is very revolutionary, and full of love for all humanity, even if their are: ethnical differences, age differences, wealth differences, and gender differences"},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"I first read this book when I was a child, and I love it just as much now as I did then.

I didn't think it was nearly as good as Little Women, perhaps because there are more characters and it takes place within a shorter period of time... so there is less development in each character and even more moralizing as each short story within the book has a lesson to be learned!"},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"Well, this book always will remain among my favorites, one that touches me and makes me feel. I think that when I was little, I saw a cartoon series about it. At that time, I didnt know that it was based on the novel by Louisa May Alcott. The success of this stories is the wide ranges of characters shown in this book, the spirit, moral conduct, inner strength, and most of all, the splash of fun and careless boyish pranks. THe setting is great, and I like to see how the old characters are developed, as well as the new. Strangely, my favorite character out of all the interesting ones was Dan, Jo's favorite firebrand. I liked how behind his rough nature and blazing dark eyes, and careless attitude, there is gentlenes, courage, and inner strength which Jo gradually brings out of him. And needless to say, Dan is a black sheep that Jo continues to cling on to. Yet, I liked the others as well, including rascal TOmmy, music loving Nat (especially how loyal Dan is to him), tomboy Nan, thoughtful Demi, little and big Teddy, (and Amy, who I am one of those rare people that wanted her to get with Laurie,) and adorable little Bess. All these heartwarming characters create a fire in the story which really warms me up. I've read Jo's Boys, and I like Little Men better because I can feel the spirit of things. Jo's Boys made me feel depressed. SO, this is a great book and surprizingly, the tone was very different from LIttle Women (which I liked greatly) and I just think that the firebrand is the most dashing character in it. He kind of reminds me of Laurie, except in a different, stronger way. Jo's Boys made me sad that all was to an end."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"This book is very heartwarming, and, at times, funny. The characters seem real, and Louisa May Alcott portrayed the girls, Nan and Daisy, very realistically-one a tomboy, one a \\"girl\\".

This is an excellent book...get it!"},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"I read this book 14 years ago and I can still remember how I felt while I was reading it.

I read all of these books as a child, and the additional Alcott books as well.To satisfy a reading challenge, I have decided to reread some of these old favorites.Little Menwas delightful, highlighting the wonderfully compassionate nature of Jo and her husband, Professor Bhaer, whom she met in Little Women. At the end of that book, Jo's Great-aunt March, the cranky old woman who seemed too demanding at times has left her house (Plumfield) to Jo. Now Jo and Fritz (Professor Bhaer) have opened a school for boys. Most of the boys appear to be troubled or challenged in some way. The story tells us various antics and behaviors exhibited by the boys, and displays how Jo and Fritz deal with these issues.After reading the biographyLouisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind Little Women (John MacRae Books), I could see the parallels between LMA's father's ideals and their methods in dealing with the recalcitrant boys.The book was colorfully illustrated in the edition I reread, and was reminiscent of the book I read as a child.While I would always recommend any Alcott book, I must admit thatLittle Mendid not resonate with me the wayLittle Women (Unabridged Classics)did.

One reviewer mentioned Jo's &quot;maturation;&quot; part of such growth may be the ability to somehow nurture such &quot;firebrands,&quot; without changing their personal character.

I decided to give this book four stars because in some cases she didn't write as enthusiaticly as in her other books. Don't get me wrong though, as a book, it deserves ten stars! As a Louisa May book, only four (out of five that is!) I cannot write to you, reader, too much about the sumery because every chapter was a new scrape or story. But don't worry, everything is connected. Jo March from Little Women now is married and has two boys of her own, plus a few orphans and sons of busy fathers. In Plumfield, boys are every where, including the musical Nat, book worm Demi Brooke, indestructable Tommy, Dan, adorable Teddy, and deticated Rob! But don't forget the three girls: timid Daisy Brooke, Giddy-Gaddy Nan, and the loveable Bess. All share scrapes and adventures that will leave you scandalized. Jo and her husband have a lot in store for them! Plus, a hint of romance at the end. Look for the sequal, Jo's Boys!

She would recommend it to anyone, and if I don't read it before hand that after I have children of my own she will give me the book and tell me to read it.She wished she had read it many years ago when I was younger because the examples of how to help little boys to become young men where amazing."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"Mention the name Louisa May Alcott, and most people will instantly think of \\"Little Women.\\" But in my mind, the less often discussed \\"Little Men\\" is just as great, if not better.The story picks up shortly after the conclusion of \\"Little Women,\\" with Jo and Frederick Bhaer running a school at Plumfield. Along with their own little Rob and Teddy, they are busy raising the neglected children of rich folks alongside the orphans they have taken in.While the boys exist in a virtual haven for good ol' fashioned fun upon the farmlike Plumfield, Mother and Father Bhaer still manage to teach them moral life lessons along with their classroom exercises.If you enjoy this book, be sure to pick up \\"Jo's Boys,\\" which takes place ten years after \\"Little Men\\" and concludes the boys' stories."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. i don't like to re-read books because i know what will happen, but i did re-read Little Men.

Let me say, that it was well worth the wait! Thank you for such a great deal on a really good book."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"If Little Men weren't an entertaining novel, it could serve as a timeless reminder of how adults can help children direct their energies in helpful ways and develop better habits. The philosophy is to provide lots of love, understanding, forgiveness, slack and carefully chosen incentives and guidance while encouraging friendships among youngsters who will balance one another out if they spend time together. You'll recognize lots of Marmee's loving approach in Jo's more rough and tumble perspective. It's a nice combination.For those who loved the child-centered world of Little Women, you'll be entranced by what Jo does to educate and raise her own boys, her nephew and niece, a troublesome neighbor girl, male boarders and some unfortunate orphans.Much of the novel focuses on the character development of two poor orphans, Nat and Dan, who find Jo's Plumfield (which she inherited near the end of Little Women) to be an unfamiliar paradise of a home and school that requires some adjusting to.Although the title is Little Men, there's plenty of focus on Daisy, twin sister to Demi, Nan, an independent girl with lots of energy, and Bess, Amy and Laurie's daughter. There are pretend balls, teas, and dramatic performances that echo those in Little Women.But the male slant that is subdued in Little Women bursts forth in Little Men as the book recounts pranks, brawls, collections of disgusting items, pillow fights, taming a colt and doing heavy chores.Like Little Women, the chapters are really short stories involving the same characters as they progress from month to month.If you haven't read Little Women, by all means start there. An important part of the fun of Little Men is finding out what happened next to Meg, Jo, Amy and Laurie."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"I have read Little Men a dozen times over and each time I either find something new...or just love the parts I already read! It is excellent, with great morals, and true-to-life characters."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"There is not that much to say about this brilliantly crafted book, for it is almost too good to describe. I decided to give this book four stars because in some cases she didn't write as enthusiaticly as in her other books. Don't get me wrong though, as a book, it deserves ten stars! As a Louisa May book, only four (out of five that is!) I cannot write to you, reader, too much about the sumery because every chapter was a new scrape or story. But don't worry, everything is connected. Jo March from Little Women now is married and has two boys of her own, plus a few orphans and sons of busy fathers. In Plumfield, boys are every where, including the musical Nat, book worm Demi Brooke, indestructable Tommy, Dan, adorable Teddy, and deticated Rob! But don't forget the three girls: timid Daisy Brooke, Giddy-Gaddy Nan, and the loveable Bess. All share scrapes and adventures that will leave you scandalized. Jo and her husband have a lot in store for them! Plus, a hint of romance at the end. Look for the sequal, Jo's Boys! So, reader, thank you for taking you time to read this review, and I honostly insist for you to read this book! Louisa May Alcott is one of my favorite authors, and maybe she can be yours too! Sincerly, A grateful reader."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"I loved Little Men !

I am not 1, but I don't want to share my age"},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"I read Little Men; the sequel to the classic tale of Little Women. Louisa May Alcott, the author of Little Men, Little Women, Country Cousins, Eight Cousins or the Aunt Hill, and Jo's Boys was born and raised in Concord, Massachusetts, where she did all her writing. As she got older she suffered the loss of her two sisters, both at a young age. In her books she basis her characters on herself and on people she knew, including her three sisters, her mother, and her father. Overall, she had a happy life of writing, though she never got married. Little Men was first published in 1871 by the Nelson Doubleday, Inc. This book is about life at Plumfield; the school Jo Bhaer and her husband Fritz founded. Their school allows boys (and some select girls) from all locks of life into it. Because of this reason it has become well known by many people for its kindness to all. The Bhaers show great love to every child who comes through, including boys from the street, Jo's own nieces and nephews, and her own children. They treat each boy the same and give them their own jobs to do around the farm. In turn, each child learns responsibility, respect, patients, and love at Plumfield, unlike any other school.Plumfield has many residents, but only some are characters in this book Jo Bhaer was the hero in Little Women, who ends up marries the German professor, Fritz Bhaer. She is lively as ever caring for the boys and girls of Plumfield including her own sons Teddy and Rob. Mrs. Bhaer is a gentle, caring woman who loves each child as her own. In turn the boys and girls teach her that not all lessons are learned in the classroom, in fact some are learned and she doesn't even realize it. Fritz Bhaer is a kind German professor who has a very heavy accent. He teaches the children all the regular subjects like math, science, arithmetic, and history. Father Bhaer also teaches lessons on growing crops and cultivating them, taking care of animals, and helps each child on their mishaps. For all these reasons, the boys and girls love Father Bhaer, and help him in any way they can.Nathaniel (Nat) Blake, one of the boys taken off the street and given a second chance at Plumfield. In the beginning he is a weak and sickly boy who is sent to Plumfield by Mr. Laurie, a dear friend of Jo's. When he gets their he does not now how to read or write. Gradually, kindness and determination help Nat to get stronger, less sickly, become a great reader, and an unusually good writer.Tommy Bangs, one of the boys who goes to Plumfield. He is the biggest troublemaker there, but has a kind heart so everyone can't help but love him. Overtime, he becomes less troublesome, and helps out more than anyone expected. Daisy and Demi, Jo's sister's kids also go to Plumfiled. They are very kind to each other and to everyone else. Daisy loves to play with dolls and cook for the residents of the school. Demi is a very smart boy, who listened to every one of his grandfather's stories, as a small boy. He learned a lot of his knowledge from those stories. He does have a downfall though. He loves to read, but he reads action books when he should be reading and studying for school. Father Bhaer breaks this habit quite easily when he finds out.On the street Nat met many people, including a sluggish boy Dan who was nice to him. Dan ends up coming to the school also. He is not the best boy to make friends with, because he makes a lot of trouble. As the book goes on Dan gets cured from these bad ways by Father Bhaer and becomes a very nice, gentle boy. The second female resident of Plumfield is named Nan. She is nothing like Daisy or like most girls. Nan will take dares from anyone and do them, no matter how dangerous they may be! Daisy would love another girl who would play dolls and cook with her. By the end of the book, Daisy persuades Nan to play dolls with her. Nan agrees. After they play dolls Nan starts to be more girlish, but in the end she still does dangerous things.Little Men takes place in the late 1800s in Concord, Massachusetts. At this time slavery was still in the south. The children of Plumfield had all been sent there to board, for one reason or another. Nat and Dan were sent there because they were on the streets. Nan's mother had just died and her father couldn't afford to take proper care of her anymore. Tommy's parents did not want to deal with his pranks. Daisy and Demi wanted to go to the school where their aunt and uncle taught. A boy named Jack Ford was sent there because it was cheap, and there were other reasons for the boys that come later in the book.Little Men starts out when Mr. Laurie (one of Jo's old friends) sees Nat on the streets and sends him to Plumfield, the school run by Jo and Fritz Baher. When the door to Plumfield is answered by Asia the house maid, Nat can't help but stare at all the boys playing on the staircase, floor, and sliding down the banisters. One boy slides down the banister and lands hard on his rear. Nat rushes over to make sure he is all right. The boy says he's fine and introduces himself as Tommy Bangs. Then Mrs. Jo appears. She asks to see Nat by himself. They go into a side room and Mrs. Jo then tells Nat she will be happy to have him at their school.Nat rests the first day and night he is there. The next day is Monday, the first day of school. Fritz Bhaer teaches the boys at school and he treats Nat with special care since Nat can't read or write. Nat does fine his first day. He then knows that he must work hard to please his new family, and he will do it willingly in between chores and play. All the boys were taught but Daisy would not be permitted. As a result, she was not allowed to play football, or other games the boys played. Mrs. Jo felt sorry for the little girl, so, her and Mr. Laurie go and buy a whole kitchen set for her. She adores it, and will cook anything for anyone. The boys get jealous and eventually allow her to play with them, if she cooks special treats for them. Daisy agrees, and once again Plumfield was at peace.In the middle of the book, Nat's \\"dear friend\\" Dan comes for a visit. Nat pleads with Mrs. Bhaer that Dan can stay. She isn't quite sure she trusts Dan, but she agrees that he can stay. Dan ends up bringing trouble to the school by fighting the other boys, smoking tobacco, (which was strictly prohibited by the school), and setting the Plumfield on fire by not putting out his cigarette. Dan is sent to live with another boarding school for bad children like him. Meanwhile, since Dan was sent away, they have an extra bed to spare. Mrs. Jo meets a man in town whose wife has just died and doesn't want to take care of his daughter named Nan anymore. She comes to Plumfield and she fits right in with the boys better than Daisy. Daisy is heartbroken that there is finally another girl at the school, but doesn't want to play dolls and cook. She pleads and pleads with Nan and finally Nan plays with her. Nan finds out that dolls and cooking aren't that bad and she decides to do it with Daisy more often.Nan and Daisy were cooking one day and they had an idea to have a ball. They invited Nat, Tommy, and Demi. The boys agreed to come if there would be food, and of course there would be. The boys get to the ball and everyone starts dancing. Then they sit down to have tea and pastries. When they all sat down Daisy realized that the pastries were missing! Tommy had hidden them and would not tell where he had hidden them. Nan and Daisy became furious, and ran to get Mrs. Jo. When they told her what happened she did not punish the boys. Instead, she, and the girls would not talk to the boys until they said they were sorry. They finally apologized and the girls forgave them. The night after Mrs. Jo had just came back from town and saw a straw hat and a hand sticking out from a hay bale. She gently pushed the hay aside and saw that it was Dan! He had come back! She awoke him softly and he said, \\"Mother Bhaer, I have come home.\\" Those words touched her heart and carried him into Plumfield where he made a full recovery of his broken foot and tiredness.Towards the end of the book, the children of Plumfield go huckleberry picking. Mrs. Jo doesn't want five-year-old Rob to go but Nan pleads that she'll take care of him. Mrs. Jo gives in. All the children are picking berries peacefully, until Nan and Rob say they are going to a secret spot. They go into the woods and loose their way back. Nan starts to panic, for night is coming soon, and Rob starts to cry because he is scared. Thankfully, they are found before a bear found them. Little Bess, Jo's niece comes for a visit and is treated like a little princess by all the boys. There was some peace between them all. While she is there, they put on an end of school year play. This year it is Cinderella. All the children dress up like the characters in the book and put on a magnificent play. Everyone claps and awards flowers to Mrs. Jo. They finish off the book by having a gigantic feast.In the beginning of the book Father Bhaer tells each boy he is a crop that is growing in his garden. At the end of the year, if they are all good and whole Father did a good job furnishing them. As in all plants, the boys had weeds growing that tried to stop the way, and some of them did for a time. Nat told a lie, Jack stole Tommy's money, Tommy hid Daisy's pastries, and Demi read the wrong books at the wrong time. In the end, though there were some weeds, Father Bhaer had a very successful cultivation, and looked forward to new plants next year."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"Love the whole series and read it every year starting with little women around Christmas time and then read through the entire series."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys, (Illustrated Junior Library)","review":"Having read it as a child, I would have told you then that it was a good book, but having re-read it now, I'd say it's just &#34;okay&#34;.

Sometimes the style of it is annoying and at times the characters unrealistic, and I find myself longing for the more natural tone of Little Women.

(Imagine, a turn-of-the-century copy of a great book for fifty cents!) At first I was put off by its volume (333 pages with illustrations) but I managed to lap up every last word of it...about seven times, I think.Philip Haldane, our hero, and his half-sister Helen are orphans. Helen has been Philip's sister, teacher and playmate for what seemed like all his life, and there wasn't a shadow of a doubt in his mind that this would go on for ever; he wanted it to. But the unimaginable happens -- Helen marries and goes honeymooning around Europe, leaving Philip at his new residence, friendless and bitter. But soon his new, seemingly dreary life is changed by his embarking on an exciting adventure, so splendid and picturesque that he never would have dreamed that he had built it with his own hands. You see, Philip had always played building games, and he built not with plain old building blocks but with...well, everything -- everything from ink-wells to bronze Egyptian figurines! And it was while he was in the depths of his misery and pining harder than ever to see his sister again that he, the Creator, discovered it -- his Magic City -- and its delightful secrets.Now, to look at it from a Harry Potter fan's viewpoint. I shouldn't be giving any clues, you really should have read this book at least once before comparing it with HP, but I'll just say...Philip is of course the Harry Potter of this book, but he is also the Ron Weasley because of his initial malice towards his new stepsister, Lucy -- the Hermoine Granger of this book. The Grey Nurse is the Snape/Malfoy/Voldermort figure of this book. The Great Sloth is rather like Scabbers, and Polly is somewhat Hedwig-like. And Mr. Noah is almost EXACTLY like Professor Dumbledore; if you look at the part of the book when he goes to visit the prison, you'll know what I mean :)If that still doesn't grab the average Potter fan's attention, how about this: J.K.

I realize that I risk the wrath of Potterites everywhere, but I suspect that in a hundred years children and their parents will still be enjoying The Magic City while Harry is at most the subject of earnest dissertations on odd trends in the early 21st century.

Nesbit's stories are wonderful fantasies---very Edwardian but full of incredible feats of imagination. Yet they are always based on a real-life family situation. The Magic City has a young boy as its hero who has been living an idyllic life with his older sister. But when she marries, he is thrust into a new house and must deal with a new step-sister. He doesn't do this very well at first. As in the manner of all good stories, he goes through trials and tribulations and learns a lot. E. Nesbit is perhaps best known for The Railway Children. But all of her books are full of imagination. Definitely for the older child (unless you read to the child) in that it's good vocabulary."},{"Title":"The magic city","review":"Years ago, I stumbled across a book by Edward Eager (Knight's Castle, I believe). This guy wrote books for his children when he ran out of E. Nesbit stories to read to them. So, I discovered E. Nesbit through Edward Eager. When I started reading her, it rapidly became clear that many of my favorite authors were likely influenced by her, so when I found a book that I had not read yet, I was excited.It's good. It's not as good as her more famous books, and it does not age well. However, there is more creativity in this work than in anything of hers that I have read. Sadly, I'm also older now, and was able to see things in this book that I would not have noticed when I was younger.The story introduces two children who are forced to live together when their caretakers marry. (Unlike The Ogre Downstairs, I don't find fault with this plot device because the book is set around 1900. Culture was quite different then.) The girl (Lucy) quite likes the boy (Phillip), but he does not return her affection because he's upset that his life has changed. This continues when they both get magically sucked into a world that was created when Phillip built a city out of various things around the house.This is where it gets difficult to read, due to cultural differences. See, the city is populated by the toys that the boy used to build the city. Additionally, the things in the books that he used for walls sometimes come out. So, there are a LOT of references to toys and educational materials that simply aren't common any longer. However, her writing more than makes up for the cultural divide. I am going to share some with you. If you do not wish the spoilers, buy it and read it yourself.'I was about to tell you,' said Mr. Noah, 'and I will not answer questions. Of course it is magic. Everything in the world is magic, until you understand it.(Mr. Noah is a character from the Noah's Ark toy set.)'Because,' he said, 'I'm more likely to meet Lucy. Girls always keep to paths. They never explore.'Which just shows how little he knew about girls.(This is after Philip loses Lucy due to a strange series of circumstances.)'But laws can't be useful and beautiful, can they?''They can certainly be useful,' said Mr. Noah, 'and,' he added with modest pride, 'my laws are beautiful. What do you think of this? \\"Everybody must try to be kind to everybody else. Any one who has been unkind must be sorry and say so.\\"'(Mr. Noah is also the Chief Judge, so he gets to make the laws.)'Is it something we shall be afraid of too?' Lucy asked. And Philip at once said, 'Oh, then she really did mean to come, did she? But she wasn't to if she was afraid. Girls weren't expected to be brave.''They are, here,' said Mr. Noah, 'the girls are expected to be brave and the boys kind.'(That fact that I grew up reading stuff like this goes a long way to explain my attitudes towards gender, I suppose.)The sun was shining--there was a sun, and Mr. Noah had told the children that it came out of the poetry books, together with rain and flowers and the changing seasons--and in spite of the strange, almost-tumble-no-it's-all-right-but-you'd-better-look-out way in which the camel walked, the two travellers were very happy. The dogs bounded along in the best of spirits, and even the camel seemed less a prey than usual to that proud melancholy which you must have noticed in your visits to the Zoo as his most striking quality.(It's true, camels are quite mournful beasts. I'll try to take photos for you some time.)'Oh, anybody can steer then,' said Billy; 'you if you like.' So it was Lucy who steered the ark into harbour, under Mr. Noah's directions. Arks are very easy to steer if you only know the way. Of course arks are not like other vessels; they require neither sails nor steam engines, nor oars to make them move. The very arkishness of the ark makes it move just as the steersman wishes. He only has to say 'Port,' 'Starboard,' 'Right ahead,' 'Slow' and so on, and the ark (unlike many people I know) immediately does as it is told.(I probably picked up my proclivity for parentheticals from E. Nesbit as well. Oh, and who can not bask in the awesomeness that is the word \\"arkishness\\"?)* * * * * *I'm sorry this chapter is cut up into bits with lines of stars, but stars are difficult to avoid when you have to tell about a lot of different things happening all at once. That is why it is much better always to keep your party together if you can. And I have allowed mine to get separated so that Philip, the parrot and the rest of the company are going through three sets of adventures all at the same time. This is most trying for me, and fully accounts for the stars. Which I hope you'll excuse. However.(Nothing special to say here. I'm just going to let the beauty of that paragraph stand on its own.)'The more a present costs you, the more it's worth,' said Mr. Noah. 'This has cost you so much, it's the most splendid present in the world.'(Look, a moral lesson - just hiding in there waiting to jump out at the unwary reader.)'Oh, dear,' said Lucy despairingly, 'aren't there any women here? They always have more sense than men.''What you say is rude as well as untrue,' said the red leader; 'but to avoid fuss we will lead you and your fierce dog to the huts of the women. And then perhaps you will allow us to go to sleep.'(More gender-preconception correction. Also, note the presence of \\"red leader\\". George Lucas must have read E. Nesbit as well.)So there you go, excellent writing and a story about creativity, magic and the imagination. How can you go wrong?Well, you can make reference to numerous things that are no longer commonplace (Noah's Ark set, motor veils, white dominoes, draughts, blotting pads, lead soldiers, wooden dollhouse food, etc). You can also casually accept the fact that, at that time, there was a strict social hierarchy in England and only address this book to young children of the upper class. (This is very slightly addressed in the end, but not by much.) Oh, and you can suggest that it's a good idea for children to lick lead paint off of wooden toys.However, if you can accept the book as a product of its time, and one that did try to address inequality and prejudice, just not everywhere, it's a very enjoyable read. I burst out laughing several times (especially at the end, which I shan't spoil for you). If you like reading children's stories, it's a delight. If you have children, this would be a good read-aloud book. It's not a good children's read-on-your-own book, because of the cultural differences.I'd give this book six stars, but E. Nesbit already did"},{"Title":"The magic city","review":"I loved this book as a child and still read it from time to time now.

Both Fell and HM were experts in 'impossible' crimes and 'locked-room' mysteries. They were both 'brilliant' men, overweight, eccentric though Fell needed two canes to walk.This mystery revolves around an abandoned house (owned by one of the characters) that had been 'unsellable' because of rumors of ghosts and assorted such things that were left over from a hangman's assistant who took his job to seriously and was said to be buried on the property. Well it's all very English with dotty old aristocratic woman, a retired army Colonel, some flaky interwar caste-offs and such. Throw in some mediums and spiritualists and you have the standard interwar British mystery.In defense of Dickson, it must be remembered that much of this type of story was new and not trite mishmash it appears to be today (though it is a mishmash).Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"Title":"The Plague Court Murders","review":"Not the greatest of Carr's mysteries but essential reading for aficionados since it was the first in a masterful series. Carr was an anglophile American and so can be compared to SS Van Dine and Ellery Queen as much as the English tradition in his emphasis on the 'How done it?' as well as the 'Who done it?'.Immensely entertaining - this is what kept people amused in the days before television. Recommended for your Kindle vacation reading."},{"Title":"The Plague Court Murders","review":"I love John Dickson Carr's mysteries, and this book is no exception.

The purchase was well worth it (to me) because this book coughs up information that is just simply not available from any other source. I felt and still feel that the super-in-depth, unique content of this book justified its exorbitant price tag.However, it is not a book that was written for casual reading. The text is technical, laborious and demands a great deal of time and concentration to wade through its characteristic &quot;Doctoral Thesis&quot; style. Potential purchasers would be well advised to gauge with prudence their level of patience, budget, and time available before making a one-click purchase."},{"Title":"Peg Leg Pete","review":"This is a very small easy to read book. I bought it because we too had a one legged mallard male show up in our yard one day, and became a constant visitor. He became fairly tame and would allow us to get very close to feed him seeds and such, and it was fascinating and heartbreaking to watch him try to fit in with normal 'duck society.' I was expecting the story to be somewhat similiar, but it is mostly about a hunter (who almost shoots him a couple times) and for my taste, it takes a little too long for the hunter to finally realize, maybe hunting isn't for him anymore. Cute book, but not my favorite! We'll see if our own peg leg pete returns this year."},{"Title":"Lampshades: how to make them,","review":"I had my doubts about this book but ordered it anyway.

It is also, in my opinion, Le Guin's absolutely best work, and that's saying quite a bit. With &quot;Searoad&quot; Le Guin proved that she is a master fiction writer in any genre.

Not only do you get vital information on momentous First Amendment cases, but you also get to 'hear' the people involved discuss their motives for and feelings while standing up for their (and our) rights.The book is a compilation of interviews with lawyers, plaintiffs and defendants from 10 key First Amendment law cases that deal with topics such as freedom of expression, libel, privacy, the use of anonymous sources, free press vs. fair trial, commercial speech, broadcast and cable regulation, and new media regulation.While Russomanno probably intended this book to be used in a Mass Communication Law class, it is also a fascinating read for anyone interested in our right to &quot;speak our minds.&quot; The book is well written (especially the Nebraska Press chapter), well researched and interesting on many levels. Definitely a great addition to any collection.If you're into the First Amendment, you must have this book!"},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"3.5 stars. Engaging, multiple interwoven mysteries involving fire and fire fighters, abduction, complex relationships and murder. Like many convoluted mysteries there is a plethora of coincidences, for me a common plot contrivance that grows irksome (when taken to extremes like here) as storylines converge and neatly resolve. Regardless, I very much enjoyed the read, though the writing itslef is not exceptional."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"Detective Inspector Gemma James is having no luck in finding a missing child in her Notting Hill patch of London. An old Victorian warehouse owned by a politician goes up in smoke, and it's hard to believe how much crime is uncovered by the burning of one building.The charred, unidentified body of a woman is found in the warehouse. In trying to give her a name, Detective Superintendent Duncan Kincaid learns there are four possibilities. Checking into each lead and every clue leads to a serial arsonist and another missing child, and it is this missing little girl upon whom Gemma focuses.Crombie has written her most densely plotted novel yet, and it is a pleasure to watch a master weaver at work: having her characters track each missing woman back until they find the right one, introducing a dedicated firefighter who has a hunch about an arsonist that she cannot ignore, and letting her readers know that there is a child out there in the hands of a mentally unstable person. I've even left out several plot threads! Crombie never loses sight of any of those threads, and the result is a book that I did not want to put down.When anyone asks me to recommend a favorite mystery series in which the plots are every bit as good as the characters, Crombie always comes to mind first. I love reading these books for their complex plots and for their recurring characters who develop and change as the series continues.I have a tendency to read series rather slowly. If I read them back to back, I can tire of the writing style or become hyper-critical of characterization, pacing or plot. I picked up the first book in this series less than a year ago, and I'm almost completely caught up. Why so speedy with this one? Because it's a pleasure to see Crombie become more skilled with each book...and because my husband has gotten hooked on them, too. If any of you have wondered how well a Texan can write a series set in England, I'll tell you this: Denis, Lancashire born and bred, gives Crombie two enthusiastic thumbs up. He'll be just as disappointed as I when we're caught up and waiting for the next book in the series to appear!"},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"It just seems that Crombie never has a lack of subject matter. Whereas the previous novel centered around the whiskey trade, In A Dark House weaves an intricate mystery that's centered around fire and the fire brigade.A warehouse of a prominent businessman with lots of political connections leads to Kincaid being assigned 'damage control'. When a body is found in the building however, it makes it all the more sensitive and complicated.Winnie, Kincaid's in law since being married to his relative Jack, is in town taking over for a local minister who's become sick. A house bound parishioner confides to Winnie that her roommate and helper has been missing for over a day and has become concerned but doesn't want to get the police involved for fear that if she's overreacting, her friend would become angered with her so Winnie does the only thing she can think of; she calls in Gemma. Gemma is working a case gone cold where a child has gone missing and welcomes the distraction. She quickly discovers that the roommate may not be who she said she was. Could she be the Jane Doe in the warehouse fire?Not far removed from Gemma's own cold case back in London, Harriet Novak has also gone missing. Last seen with her father Tony who shows up at a local women's shelter where his ex wife was involved, ranting and raving about them stealing his daughter. As it turns out, the women's shelter is right ACROSS THE STREET from Duncan's warehouse fire. Coincidence? Connected?This could be one of the most twisting and red herring filled stories in the series yet which really keeps you guessing. You may think you have it all figured out in the beginning and feel that the book is becoming predictable but it's really anything but that. Just another well thought out and well executed mystery in this fantastic series."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"I didn't like it but give it 5 stars because I recognize excellent writing when I see it. I personally like my protagonists to have heavier problems and to get in a fight with the bad guys every once in a while. I like hard-boiled Harry Bosch/Alan Banks/Stella Mooney/Lucas Davenport/ Dave Robicheaux/Sam Spade detectives, not milk-toast, sensitive sorts like Kinkaid and the whole lot in this book. The only character with any \\"balls\\" is young firefighter Rose and she doesn't get much play. You really can't find a bad guy in this book. Without giving away the plot, the bad woman is charactarized as a poor victim of her background; the apparently bad politician is humanized; the real bad person is never really seen, and when revealed, immediately exits the book without any character development. Everyone else in endlessly worrying about being good. Gemma and Kincaid are overworrying about each others feelings. At least Bosch and others know that they can be and are a-holes and don't apologize for it because they know they can't be fully redeemed. I recommend this book to my 78 year old mother who loves P.D. James, but not to others with my tastes."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"Ms. Crombie's intelligent and thoughtful characters move through a vivid world presented with the perfect amount of detail and nuance. The author's writing is strong enough to transport readers right to London (and if they happen already to BE in London, then I'm guessing they're transported directly into whatever room the action is taking place). If you haven't read Crombie's work, begin with her first Kincaid/James novel and then move ahead.

Ho-hum plot, tepid characters, etc. In a Dark House was vastly superior. The plot was fast-paced (I read this book in two sittings), the characters far more interesting, and mostly, the writing was much richer and more truly \\"Enlish\\". In her other book I felt the author was American trying to write British. I wish she'd written more about the fire bug--his character was intriguing but only the surface was scratched. Same for the Elaine character--I wanted to know more about her, her background and what made her feel/behave the way she did. I will have to read her earlier books in this series to gain a truer understanding of Duncan and Gemma I think. All in all, a terrific read."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"Teriffic story: well dilineated, likeable characters; clever interweaving plots; hard to put down.

I like how it is not just a police drama, but includes so much of their homelife."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"Deborah Crombie's books were recommended to me by a friend. Basically they are murder mysteries. I was in the process of organizing a two-week vacation and so I down-loaded three of her books into my Kindle. One day, during my holiday, it rained all day. I read \\"In A Dark House\\" that day. I couldn't put it down. She has a way of writing that keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through. It rained the next day and I read the second book of hers that day. Same thing - I couldn't put it down. In the past four weeks (since I read the first book by Crombie) I have read seven and am on my eighth Crombie book (all down-loaded into my Kindle, by the way). If you like murder mysteries, I'm sure you will enjoy these by this author. I certainly do."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"Interesting, satisfying, Deborah Crombie is a excellent writer, equally as adept at creating suspense as Martha Grimes. I've read most of Crombie's books and still hoping to find more that I might have missed. I just have a little trouble remembering which titles I've already read."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"Crombie makes a habit of finding, in each book in this generally first-rate series, a new topic to explore and a new location to do it in. This time, the subject is fire-fighting and arson investigations and the venue is the Borough of Southwark, south of the Thames (which originally was merely the village anchoring the other end of the original London Bridge, and has never quite gotten over its concomitant feelings of inferiority). There have been a series of structure fires in Southwark recently, but the most recent one, in a Victorian warehouse being renovated for luxury flats, also produced a heavily burned body. The warehouse is owned by the local Member of Parliament, which gets official attention, so Detective Superintendent Duncan Kincaid is send over to lend a hand and keep an eye on things -- much to the annoyance of DI Maura Bell, on whose patch he is reluctantly intruding. Meanwhile, Kincaid's partner and housemate, DI Gemma James, gets a call from the Rev. Winnie Montfort (whom we first met in _A Finer End,_ and who is now married to Duncan's cousin) who is temporarily handling a parish in Southwark. Winnie is concerned about the abrupt disappearance of the housemate of one of parishioners and calls Gemma for advice, but when she hears the whole story, and meets the diminutive Chinese woman who owns the house, she begins to think the story is a lot deeper than that. Naturally, she has to involve herself.And that's the set-up. A serial arsonist, a battered women's shelter, a parental kidnapping, an MP in a panic over his daughter, and a possible psychopath are the principal ingredients. Crombie stirs them all together and produces what I think is one of her best books yet. (Even though she includes a rather uncomfortable number of coincidences in order to get Duncan and Gemma involved in the same case.) Some of the entries in this series tell the story at a somewhat leisurely pace, but this one is tense and drama-filled from first page to last. And behind it all there's also the continuing situation with Kincaid, the son he discovered only after his ex-wife was killed, and the complex problems of custody and blended families, which provides the reader with a nice point of comparison this time out. An excellent yarn."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"Scotland Yard Superintendent Duncan Kincaid and his lover and partner, Detective Inspector Gemma James, return for the tenth time in Deborah Crombie's award-winning police procedural series. Since the ongoing relationships between the detectives are not a factor in solving the mystery, this book can be read as a stand-alone.The book has many separate plot lines which eventually become connected. An abandoned warehouse owned by a prominent MP, Michael Harwood, has been burned down in a suspicious fire. Inside the police find the charred body of an unidentified woman. Meanwhile, Winifred Montfort, the wife of Duncan's cousin, asks Gemma to help locate Elaine Holland, a hospital administrator who has disappeared. While this is going on, Dr. Tony Kovak has kidnapped his daughter, Harriet, because of a marital dispute with his estranged wife, Laura. Tony has left Harriet with Beth, a woman who he hardly knows, but now both Beth and Harriet have disappeared and Laura is also missing. Finally, across the street from the burned warehouse is a women's shelter where another woman has gone missing. Obviously, one of the four missing women is the one who was killed in the fire, but which one? And what has happened to Tony's daughter, Harriet?If you enjoy British police procedurals, then put Deborah Crombie, who is, amazingly, American, on your must-read list. Her plots are well-crafted, her characters are vivid, and her British settings are completely realistic. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"This is the tenth in the Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James series of cozy/police procedural mysteries.Duncan and Gemma have settled into domestic life in a comfortable house in Notting Hill with their two sons, Gemma's Toby from her previous marriage and Duncan's recently discovered Kit and their menagerie of two dogs and a cat were well on their way to becoming a family. Ian, the man Kit had until recently thought of as his father had moved to Canada and left Kit with Duncan and Gemma, much to the dismay of Duncan's former mother-in-law who now was trying to get custody of the boy. Unfortunately for Duncan and Gemma their professional lives were particularly demanding at the moment, an unidentified young woman had been found at an arson scene and there were altogether too many missing young woman who could the victim. One of the missing women was the daughter of a rising politician who was pressing the Yard to find his daughter, another woman had been involved in a messy divorce but if she was the victim then where was her daughter? As Gemma and Duncan attempt to sort out the fates of the various women they also must contend with the every day domestic matters that face all working parents as well.This is a very well written series that skillfully combines the on going story lines of the cozy genre with the tautly written clever mysteries of the police procedural stories. There is plenty of development in the cozy side of the series in this one, we finally begin to see resolution of the on going custody issue that had figured so largely in the last few stories. In addition we are re-introduced to Winnie who first appeared in A FINER END. The various plot lines of the mystery story are well written, engaging and plausible. The reader is almost guaranteed to be caught by surprise a few times in this one. Sadly this is also a bit a of flaw as well. The author did not play quite fairly with the reader in this one and brought in a character at the eleventh hour to catch the reader off guard. Fans of the series will be a bit surprised that this one does not contain a plot line set in the past but rather a parallel contemporary that intersects with the main story line only in the final pages.There is a strong overall story arc to this series and although the author does a get job of recapping relevant plot points the series would be best enjoyed if read in order."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"One of the most interesting and well-written series that takes place in London written by an American. I now have the entire series in paperback. There is a real human interest thread that runs through the series."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"I've read several books by this author and have enjoyed every one. They provide pleasant, light entertainment . My only quibble is with the plethora of characters the author includes. In the \\"Dark House\\" book I counted 30 characters introduced in about the first 30 pages. I had to take notes to keep everybody straight. As the story progressed a few others joined the crowd on top of it all. Crombie's other books seem to be character-heavy also. Other than this nuisance, I really like her books and will no doubt read more, while keeping note pad handy."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"The literary merit of this mystery is very high -- as good if not better as anything P.D. James or Elizabeth George has written. Several plots intertwine deftly in a rather complex (but not so complex you have trouble following it) plot. I listened to the CD version, read beautifully, and that forced me to hear the story in a measured pace rather than rushing through the book to find out what happened next. The temptation will be to hurry through this book to find out what happens, but it's a book worth savoring.The plots involve several missing women -- including a child -- and an unidentified body of a woman found in a burned out warehouse. In addition to Gemma James and Duncan Kincaid, who both get involved in this although they are working in separate offices of Scotland Yard, a new \\"detective\\" character is added -- a young firefighter named Rose whose interest is in arson investigation. She suspects that this seemingly natural fire is anything but.My only criticism has to do with my impatience with the subplot involving Kit -- I'm tiring of it and wish the author would resolve this family problem, which apparently interests her more than it does me.But on the whole, I think this is a book you may want to keep and suspect it will be winning some awards."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"Deborah Crombie succeeds on at least three levels in the continuation of the Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James series.First, she skillfully develops the historic and contemporary meaning of Southwark, where the story is set. Architectural details, anomalies of language, and anecdotes of days gone by provide a rich and believeable backdrop. Yet the setting informs, rather than overwhelms, the story: no risk of drowning in meaningless detail.Second, the plot nests several mysteries without requiring all the characters to run into each other. Though nuanced, the questions at the story's center differentiate themselves sufficiently to make the reader follow closely the final pages. It would be hard not to care about how each problem resolves and Crombie conscientiously wraps up each of the plots.The primary reason to care so much about the plots is that the characters, both familiar and those making one-time appearances in the series, show rich diversity in character and within characterizations. About the few characters who lack depth, the reader is likely to think simply that -- well, they lack depth. It is true in life, so why not in fiction? But most of the personalities show the range of how well and how poorly people respond to difficulty. Their interactions are anything but predictable.When I pick up a book by this author, I always mean to make it last because I savor the tensions between characters, being immersed in the sights and sounds and smells of a foreign place, and the lovely economy of language in dialog and description, alike. And Deborah Crombie does not shirk from putting out a multi-course feast for the mystery reader. The problem, though, is that the stories she creates invariably drive me into turning pages. I tend to finish her books quickly because my curiosity drives me on, even as I want the story to last longer and longer.A tiny criticism: a personal subplot has strung out over several books. It seems artificial that it remains unresolved. But that's a fly in the neighborhood -- hardly a fly even near the soup of this exciting and interesting book."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"This is a really fine murder mystery in the English style. DS Duncan Kincaid is called in to represent Scotland Yard in a murder/arson investigation of the burning of a warehouse owned by a prominent MP. It's an investigation that he could well do without at this minute as he is concerned about a hearing affecting the custody of his son. His partner and lover, DI. Gemma James, is not prepared to commit to marriage, even though the even tenor of their lives with their joined families is in jeopardy. After the charred body of a female is discovered in the aftermath of the warehouse fire, patient and detailed police work unravels the identity of the victim who is linked to the murder and disappearance of several women from the same district. Dr. Tony Kovak arranges for a casual friend to help kidnap his 10 year old daughter so as to prevent her mother from stopping custody arrangements, but doesn't bargain for his daughters' total disappearance. Yet another woman can't be located and is found murdered. It's a gripping, methodical plot and one which I would recommend to every reader who enjoys this style of mystery."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"Deborah Crombie's latest Gemma James/Duncan Kincaid mystery, \\"In a Dark House,\\" is a blend of three or four plot lines that seem unrelated but eventually converge. Reading this novel is like looking through the lens of a kaleidoscope and wondering when the swirling colors and shapes will settle into a recognizable pattern. Fortunately, Crombie is highly skilled at developing character and an expert at juggling all of her plot elements, and she carries the reader along effortlessly.Gemma James and Duncan Kincaid have settled into their new house with their children, Kit and Toby. Although they are not married, Gemma and Duncan are a committed couple who have weathered many difficult times together. Their main worry now is an impending court battle against Kit's maternal grandmother, who has filed suit to gain custody of her thirteen-year-old grandson. Kit's grandmother, Eugenia, claims that Duncan and Gemma, who are both Scotland Yard detectives, are too busy with their professional lives to take proper care of a child. Neither Gemma nor Duncan have any intention of surrendering Kit without a fight.\\"In a Dark House\\" is chock full of suspense and criminal mischief. Superintendent Kincaid has been asked by his boss to investigate a suspicious fire and a homicide, which may or may not be connected. As a favor to Winnie Montfort, the wife of Duncan's cousin, Gemma looks into the sudden disappearance of a hospital administrator who had been sharing a house with Winnie's friend. Later, both Duncan and Gemma are on the trail of a child abductor who has kidnapped a young girl but has not made a ransom demand.In lesser hands, this novel might have degenerated into a confusing and melodramatic jigsaw puzzle with too many pieces. However, Crombie masterfully delineates each character clearly and succinctly, and she weaves the various plot threads together with a sure and deft touch. Gemma and Duncan are wonderful protagonists. They are brilliant and dedicated detectives, but they have learned over the years that it is a mistake to always put your job ahead of your family.The large cast of vivid characters includes Fanny Liu, a paralyzed woman who is panic-stricken when her flatmate, Elaine disappears, Rose Kearney, a young and ambitious firefighter who has the instincts of a keen fire investigator, and Dr. Tony Novak, whose bitter divorce from his wife, Laura, has put his beloved daughter, Harriet, at risk. The villains are evil and chilling, and there are many twists and turns to keep the reader turning pages at a fast clip.As always, it is amazing that an American author like Crombie perfectly captures British dialect and atmosphere. Her great success as a novelist, however, stems from her deep understanding of human nature and her ability to tell engrossing stories that combine action, drama, poignancy, and tragedy. She carefully leaves some loose ends untied, and I look forward to her addressing some of them in the next installment of this wonderful series."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"Many current writers of mystery fiction have been hailed as \\"the heir to P.D. James.\\" I believe that Deborah Crombie is the only person writing today who can come close to meriting that title. With each book she comes closer to equalling the depth and clarity of style of P.D. James -- while creating characters of her own. Each book in her series is literally better than the last, with In a Dark House stretching beyond genre fiction, just as P.D. James so often does. The fire symbolism, from one character's homemade candles to the burning of the warehouse that begins the story, is rich and powerful. Can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"A fire in the southwest reveals the body of a dead woman, but instead of letting the local police handle the case, Scotland Yard sends Detective Superintendent Duncan Kincaid to investigate because the warehouse that burned down belonged to MP Michael Harwood. The Victorian warehouse was being renovated by converting it into park flats, but rumors has it that was not succeeding so the fire department is looking for signs of arson.Two people entering the building before the blaze were caught on video; one was Harwood's missing daughter Chloe. Also absent is Laura Novak and her child Harriet; however, Harriet's father Tony had left her with someone named Beth, an obvious alias. Duncan concentrates on the fire because he thinks a serial arsonist caused the deadly blaze.Duncan's live-in lover Inspector Gemma James is also in town investigating the disappearance of the roommate of a friend of a friend. Gemma searches for Harriet before time runs out on the child. Neither realizes these two cases connect in a dramatic fashion.In addition to all the pressure in their private lives, Duncan and Gemma are also in a custody battle over his son with the lad's maternal grandmother who blames the cop for her daughter's death and believe the living in sin couple are unfit to raise her grandson. The two parallel police procedural plots are cleverly drawn so that the audience enjoys both, but wonders which of the lovers has chosen the correct path, if either has. Deborah Crombie provides a strong British who-done-it that fans of Val McDermid will appreciate.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"As I have read each of Deborah Crombie's book in her Kincaid and Gemma James series, I find it difficult to believe that she is not English herself. She certainly knows how to write a mystery story in the British tradition. This is an excellent book. In it Ms. Crombie has at least three different crime threads that she weaves in and out throughout. Her stories are believably written and very multi-dimensional, and she can seemlessly weave a plot so that the reader is quite taken in by the time they're less than half the way through the book. In this book Kincaid is brought into an arson case where a body is found. Ms. Crombie's descriptions of fires and how they start show that she has done her research into the area of fires and arson, and into the minds and hearts of those who fight these fires for us. This is a complex book, and I can't begin to get into the entire plot and all it's varied textures. You will have to read it for yourself, and I suggest that you read all the books in this series. Ms. Crombie should not be missed by those of us who love a well-crafted mystery."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"Deborah Crombie's James & Kincaid series just gets better and better. Here the setting is Southwark, not a usual venue for London-loving writers. As always, Crombie provides a physical map with her text, although her descriptions of place are so excellent that it's ironically unnecessary. The aged warehouses oozing toward oblivion in the Thames, the aggressive marks of gentrification (for an even better take on this hot topic, see _Kissed a Sad Goodbye_) mingle with the tang of traditional cheeses from the open market by the cathedral and the wacky/wonky lives of the fringe business people who flourish in spaces between the run-down and the rave restaurant review.Crombie's characters are equally vivid, not only the series stars, but also the agoraphobic in her doll's house and the oddly honest self-made politician. The characters are given dead-on details that call them to mind for the reader, even after an absence of many chapters. Yet Crombie never falls into the grey-page plague of prose. She uses her omniscient narrator's voice and swaths of unforced dialogue to convey both news and nuance. Her skill at plotting really shines here, as she moves among three sets of self-absorbed characters and the police, never once making the reader feel that \\"now for something completely different\\" sense of dislocation.This is a mystery worthy of a re-read - first class!"},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"'In a Dark House' is my first foray into the world of Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James and, mostly likely, it will be my last ... which is strange because the book has all the hallmarks of a good detective/mystery series. The author has obviously done her research on the story's setting (Southwark section of London) and criminal investigation procedures. And the story, an interwoven affair involving arson and murder, has surprising yet plausible plot twists. But why is \\"In a Dark House\\" so forgettable?Well it strikes me that the characterizations, especially of our investigative duo of Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James, are just a bit too manufactured. It felt something out of EastEnders (a UK soap opera) rather than anything realistic. I also felt the author, who is obviously a talented writer, played too safe in her narrative. I wanted high drama, conflict, and the tangible feeling of suspense ... and I didn't find any of it.Bottom line: a competent mystery perfect for the beach but certainly the sort of book you won't want to keep on your bookshelf afterwards."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"I have read all of Deborah Crombie's books featuring Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James and have enjoyed every one. I wish I was just discovering them so I didn't have to wait! The characters and plots are well thought out and I find myslf genuinely caring for these people. I do wish she would resolve the problem with Kit. From the end of this book, it seems we may be close!"},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"I am addicted to this series. As in all her stories, this one is multi-layered. Crombie weaves the layers brilliantly. I would suggest new readers would need to start from the beginning of the series or they might be confused by the relationships, although Crombie does make a good effort to refer back to events in previous books. On to the next."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"Why read mystery stories? What is it about the experience that compels me to return, time after time, to the novels of Deborah Crombie, Elmore Leonard, Elizabeth George, Ian Rankin, Michael Connolly, and a dozen others? After all, I read about as many novels about murder and mayhem as I do both nonfiction and \\"serious\\" fiction combined. Why?This question comes to mind with special poignancy as I sit down to review one of Deborah Crombie's finely wrought police procedurals, In a Dark House. Immediately beforehand, I read Bob Woodward's Obama's Wars, his skillful recounting of the months-long policy-making process that led to President Obama's decision to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan in 2010--and start withdrawing them in July 2011. And just after finishing In a Dark House, I devoured William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer's The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, the inspirational tale of a seventh-grade dropout in Malawi who taught himself physics from an outdated textbook and constructed an operating windmill from scrapyard junk to produce electricity for his father's farm.It's clear to me what I got from reading Woodward and Kamkwamba. The former illuminating the day-to-day reality of decision-making in the White House that resulted in one of the most significant U.S. foreign policy decisions in recent years. The latter helped me understand the crushing weight of poverty, famine, and ignorance--and how an exceptional individual can overcome them with dogged persistence, supportive friends, and a touch of genius.So, what moved me to read In a Dark House when I might otherwise have turned to one of the dozens of highly acclaimed novels and nonfiction books in my reading queue? I can think of four reasons:1. I've grown attracted to Crombie's police duo, Inspector Gemma James and Superintendant Duncan Kincaid, both of Scotland Yard. Picking up another of Crombie's novels is like reconnecting with old friends. I feel as though I'm getting to know them well. And I like them.2. As a writer, I admire Deborah Crombie's skill in character development, plotting, and scene-setting. And I'm in awe of a woman who lives in a small North Texas town who manages to write--apparently with ease--English police procedurals, some of which even win prizes in England!3. The tension that builds within me as the plot unfolds in a skillful mystery story is pleasantly distracting. Reading one of these books is like losing myself in a great film, temporarily oblivious to the real world with its real problems and real annoyances.4. A well-written mystery novel takes place in a world that's new to me. It piques my curiosity. In a Dark House explores the realm of fire and arson. The details revealed in the story reflect the author's careful research, and--for a brief time, at least, before the knowledge slips between the cracks of my memory--I understand a little more about this fascinating topic.There's nothing truly extraordinary about In a Dark House. I'm sure I'll remember little or nothing about it six months or a year from now. But it was a rewarding experience while it lasted. And that's probably enough.(From Mal Warwick's Blog on Books)"},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"This was my first Crombie and I just purchased the debut in the series so I can go back and catch-up.

I highly recommend this book and am excited about delving into more stories featuring Kincaid and Gemma."},{"Title":"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","review":"I thought that the two books previous to this in the Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James series were slight disappointments.

Their personal lives intermingle with their cases. As readers, we root for each installment. Her stories are keepers as we weed our shelves to make room for new favorites.With \\"In a Dark House,\\" Ms. Crombie apply demonstrates her ability to rank with Martha Grimes in creating the stark and brutal side of human relations.

There is a charred corpse of a female victim found in the wreckage of the warehouse. Due to the political sensitivity of the case, Superintendent Duncan Kincaid from the Scotland Yard is called to investigate. In a seemingly unrelated case, Duncan's lover, Gemma James is asked by a local minister to investigate the disappearance of a parishioner's flatmate. In another parallel story, a child is missing after a parental abduction is screwed up.This is one of the best books I have read in quite awhile. There are a lot of storylines, and the author skillfully intertwines them without confusing the reader. Duncan and Gemma are two of the most realistic and engaging characters written in the crime genre. Their story is almost as interesting as the mystery plot and that was compelling enough.

The motion picture score that Howard Shore composed for The Lord of the Rings trilogy is absolutely brilliant, and while nothing can match his magnificent orchestra, there is something unique and incredible about hearing the same music played on a simple piano -- coming from your very own fingers. Or, with today's synthesizer technology, you can orchestrate your own versions!The cover is the same as the Return of the King promotional photo. Inside, one can find fifty-four lovely pages' worth of selections from his score for Return of the King. Included in that tally are six pages of rich photos from the movie. Thankfully, it's just the heroes this time, there are no frightening pictures of orcs which, as in the case of the first and second books, caused the need to keep an eye on little youngsters who might be a little frightened by the ugly and gruesome orcs. Shoot, they still frighten me! ;-)The songs include:- Minas Tirith, the theme for Gandalf's ride to the City of Kings, and Pippin Took's first glimpse of the grandeur of the stronghold. Lyrics are included for the Elvish verses sung in the background, including the Retreat from Osgiliath, and The White Rider. This is one of the best songs, if you ask me, because it includes the gorgeous theme for Gondor.- The Steward of Gondor, which includes the White Tree \\"theme\\" (not a really defined royal theme, unfortunately), and Billy Boyd's solo he sung to Denethor as Faramir rode out on his suicide mission.- Twilight and Shadow, with is essentially a \\"poor Frodo\\" score, but also includes some music for Arwen.- The End of All Things, the tumultuous but awing cacophony that you hear during the battle on the slopes of Mt. Doom and subsequently before the Black Gates as Frodo attempts to destroy the Ring, and Aragorn leads his troops in a last effort to distract Sauron. (As you can imagine, this, like the others, is not exactly a simple tune for beginners, but I was able to pick out some Lord of the Rings tunes, so middling players ought to be able to do okay) Lyrics are included for the many verses sung in the background of this as well.- The Return of the King, which begins with Frodo's awakening and the reuniting of the Fellowship, and then Aragorn's coronation. At the end, sheet music fans FINALLY get the music for the Hobbiton theme, which is titled \\"A Toast in the Shire\\".- Into the West, Annie Lennox's endearing song which pretty much sings about heaven, or at least Middle-Earth's version of it.- Use Well The Days, a bonus because fans haven't yet heard how Howard Shore has arranged this one! It's pretty certain it will be crafted into the Return of the King: Extended Edition which releases around Christmas. From the lyrics, one would infer that it is sort of a benediction that Frodo gives to Sam, although I seriously doubt it is sung that way.For your piano players, guitar-strummers, and singers, make 'em happy, give them some of the most awesome soundtrack ever to be played for the Lord of the Rings movies."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Piano/Vocal/Chords)","review":"Unlike some adaptations I've seen, this book takes care to transcribe entire tracks from the score, including the ENTIRE 10+ minutes of the &quot;Return of the King&quot; track. This is a huge plus, even if it does lead to some awkward times (like the &quot;melody only&quot; portions mentioned by an earlier reviewer).I don't have as much trouble with the &quot;Into the West&quot; track not including the melody (I use a keyboard, so can record the accompaniment separately and play along) but it seems to be a symptom of a larger problem, which is that the music is at takes taken down a bit too literally and not adapted properly for the piano/keyboard. There are a few instances of notes which are held for much longer than a piano can normally sustain notes, and one amusing instance where the pianist is asked to crescendo and descrecendo on a held note (hey, if the vocalist can do it...). Overall the arrangements are excellent, but I docked a star for these lapses and the regrettable decision to waste pages on photographs from the movie instead of filling them with more music."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Piano/Vocal/Chords)","review":"Pretty good...but not as good as the other two. This contains less memorable tunes, and much, much harder pieces. I bought this book mostly for the song Pippin sings and Into the West. Both turned out a little disappointing. Pippin's song (called The Edge of Night) is just the melody line, with no chords or anything for the bottom hand. I know he sang it that way, but I was hoping for something a little more full. Into the West is still absolutely beautiful, but that doesn't have the melody line written into the piano part. It's just there for the singer, so unless you can sing, or you're really good at improvising, you won't be able to play it like you'd hope. However, I would still recommend this book to any Howard Shore/LOTR fan. It will take practice, but I think it will be worth your time. Also, when I was looking at this, I was wondering what the book would look like because there was no picture. It's the movie poster, just like the other two were."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Piano/Vocal/Chords)","review":"I love this! It is much better than the Two Towers or Felloship books. Why? Because I'm a pianist, and these solos are actually fun to play.

And the point that he repeats incessantly about one housetraining mistake being a catastrophe is ridiculous. Our dog did have accidents when I wasn't as vigilant as I should have been, but now she is completely housetrained.

The movement gave birth to Marc Blitzstein's masterpiece 'Cradle Will Rock' (directed by Orson Welles), but the play offended the reactionary congressmen. They made their soldiers lock out the theater. 'Cradle Will Rock,' can't the play see the light?

And I learn that Harlem Renaissance (I like Zora Neale Hurston) wasn't an isolated and mutant movement. Etc, etc.The movie and the book represent artists' courage.

McGuckin has assembled and translated hymns from the Early Church from both the Greek and Latin traditions.Starting with hymns from the New Testament, such as \\"Hymn to the Creative Word\\" (from John 1), McGuckin breathes new life into these ancient texts by setting them in contemporary English free verse. On each facing page the reader will find the text to the original Greek or Latin. (He even provides a pronunciation guide to Byzantine Greek, for those who would like to read it in the original language.)This is a beautiful collection, one that could used for private prayers, or simply to read these rich ancient texts as poetry. One could even chant them to get a sense of the musical beauty of these words.This volume begins with an introduction in which McGuckin explains the role of hymnody in the Early Church, how he made some of the selections, what sources he used, and his reasoning behind some of the translations. In the end notes at the back of the book one can find additional comments on each individual hymn. The book closes with a list of primary sources and a select bibliography.This little volume (102 pages) is recommended for those who wish to read Early Church poetry and hymnody, for those who are involved in the liturgical life of the Church, for those who wish to enrichen their prayer life, or for those who are simply interested in Church history."},{"Title":"At the Lighting of the Lamps: Hymns of the Ancient Church","review":"Although it isn't recognized as such by many American Christians, from the beginning Christianity has been a liturgical religion with the center of worship being the expectation and preparation for the return of Christ. The Gospel even begins with an angelic hymn: \\"Glory to God in the highest heaven...\\" All theology proper operates from within the worshiping tradition of the Church. Scriptures are liturgical texts, the canon is a liturgical canon, and the sacraments are, largely, all liturgical. One f the Latin phrases that sums up this perspective is Prosper of Aquitaine's legem credendi lex statuat supplicandi; or more simply, lex orandi lex credendi: the rule of prayer is the rule of faith. Because of this, it behooves the modern Christian, with all that this implies, to have some familiarity with the way Christians from ages past have proclaimed their hope and faith in Father, Son and Holy Spirit. This book thus serves as both a devotional and scholarly supplement and I would hope that readers/prayers will seek to understand more fully that devotional prayers are also liturgical and corporate prayers, and that these prayers are alive and well in the Eastern Orthodox liturgy, and hopefully in the Roman tradition as well. To quote Tertullian, \\"One Christian, no Christian.\\" The only thing we do alone is go to hell.The selections range from the Bible to the ninth century and each hymn appears in the original language (Greek or Latin) with English on the facing page. For those who wish to read in the original Greek, a helpful guide to pronunciation is provided. What the prayer/reader will quickly realize is that this is not the 7-11 prayers of pop-Christianity where you say the same 7 \\"we just\\" prayers 11 times. Rather, the well-springs of theology flow freshly with hymns worthy of the dignity, splendor and love of God.\\"This day receive me Son of God, communing at your mystic feast, for I will not betray your Mystery to your foes; will never give a kiss as did Judas. But like the thief will I confess you; In your royal Kingdom, remember me.\\"Other books of interest may include:The Gate of Heaven: The History and Symbolism of the Temple in Jerusalem,Temple Themes in Christian Worship,The Shape of the Liturgy,The Eucharist Sacrament of the Kingdom: Sacrament of the Kingdom,For the Life of the World: Sacraments and Orthodoxy,The Place of Christ in Liturgical Prayer: Christology, Trinity, Liturgical TheologyandHymn of Entry: Liturgy and Life in the Orthodox Church (Contemporary Greek Theologians Series , No 1)"},{"Title":"Porsche 911 Red Book: 1965-1999","review":"Porsche 911 information abounds -- so Patrick C.

Picked this book and thought I would just about manage to get through the first chapter before being lulled off to sleep. How wrong I was. I couldn't put it down.I could relate to all three main characters and haven't laughed so much in years.Thanks Patrick Sanchez, I'd never have thought that a man could relate to women's feelings the way you have done.In my PC (politically correct) world , it was such a refreshing read."},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"In THE WAY IT IS by Patrick Sanchez, three seemingly different women have much more in common than they think. Issues with weight, love, careers, and self-worth put these women to the test.Ruby is a woman with a successful career and a beautiful home in downtown Washington, DC. However, Ruby's weight issues plague her day in and day out. Between her mother's constant nagging for Ruby to shed some pounds, to the inner struggles with food, body image, and self-worth, she really has her work cut out for her. As if things couldn't get any worse, she has to take in two roommates to help with the mortgage after her nerdy husband leaves her for another woman.Wanda is big, beautiful, and loving life. As a plus-sized model, she embraces her size and isn't too shy to let everyone know it. But there is an annoying obstacle in Wanda's way if she wants to make it to the top of the modeling industry.Simone is a beautiful Latina anchorwoman for DC's local news channel. Coveted by many and very popular with the men, Simone thinks she has everything under control. However, Simone holds a dark secret that could ruin her career and, ultimately, her life.Patrick Sanchez doesn't disappoint with THE WAY IT IS. He delves deeply into his characters, their quirks, and insecurities and writes from deep within his characters' minds, allowing the readers to walk beside them in their struggles and antics. The result is an outrageously touching and hysterical novel.Reviewed by CandaceKof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"Can this guy get any better? Oh my! He is wonderful!! Patrick Sanchez is one of the best authors I have ever read! The Way It Is is a fabulous page turner of a novel! I enjoyed every minute of it and it was hard to put it down. It is the story of three gals, who by chance became roommates, and the life issues they are dealing with at the moment. The covers of his novels alone will draw you in and never let you go!! Read this one!"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"Patrick Sanchez has done it again with his second novel, The Way It Is. Each chapter is filled with comedic antics that will keep the reader laughing and looking forward to the next chapter. Mr. Sanchez introduces the reader to three women from three different paths in life.Ruby Waters is lacking self-confidence, divorced, plus-sized and is saving for the day when she will be thin. She is waiting for the day when she will be thin so she can wear a little black dress that her mother (Doris) has saved from her younger days. She goes to work each day trying to get the courage to talk to the co-worker she has a crush on. Ruby has a three-bedroom house and is in need of a roommate. She puts an ad in the paper and has an interesting time interviewing the interested parties. She decides to have two roommates (Wanda and Simone). Ruby's roommates help her with her self-confidence and she is also able to give others some help in the process.Wanda is a plus-sized model that knows what she wants and how to get it. She moves in with Ruby and helps Ruby to become a new person. Wanda has a co-worker that wants to take Wanda's place as a model. Wanda finds out a secret about her co-worker that just may change everything.Simone is a sexy, famous news anchorwoman that is living in style. She moves in with Ruby while her place is being renovated. She likes her men young and does not want a commitment. While Simone looks good on the outside, she has issues of her own that have to be dealt with and soon.I did not want the story to end and hope that the author will write a sequel. Each of the characters is interesting. Ruby is one of my favorite characters because her issues are real for some people today. I recommend this book and look forward to reading future novels by Patrick Sanchez.Reviewed by PhyllisFor BBW Reviews"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"This book was funny and poignant. I liked Ruby's character. She reminds me of myself. I complain about my weight all the time like she does. My goal is be Simone's size. Read the book and find out for yourselves. This book gives all the ladies their own voice and I thought that was well done coming from a male author. He knows the women."},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"This book reminded me of Muriel's Wedding. It was funny but had sad parts to. I've told all my friends about it!"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"I'm always reading &quot;chick-lit&quot; books and one thing I really liked about The Way It Is was how it was different from most chick lit books. It had a mult-ethnic cast of characters (white, black, latino) and two of the main characters were plus-size women. Also, and thank God, it was not set in New York City (it takes place in D.C.).The Way It Is is a quick fun read and made me laugh out loud more than a book has in a long time....a great vacation read!"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"This book is awesome! I read Patrick Sanchez's first book Girlfriends and it was great, but when I read this one, I nearly fell off my chair laughing!The author really knows his stuff about the area and about women in general. My favorite part was when Ruby had a screaming fit to her two roommates after having a particularly bad day!Mr. Sanchez, keep up the great work and get us another book quick!!"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"It's been a long time since I've encountered a work as witty and wonderful as Patrick Sanchez's &quot;The Way It Is.&quot; It's funny, poignant, well written-I literally could NOT put it down. Sanchez is one of the few male writers able to capture the way women think and feel about themselves. A true gem not to be missed!"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"This book made a usually gruesome flight to Europe an enjoyable experience. I read the entire thing in one sitting (from New York to Paris). The book was made up of very short chapters that kept me constantly entertained. I think everyone near me on the plane was going to by a copy when they got back to the States as they kept watching me laugh out loud during the flight."},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"Like one of the other reviewers, I bought this book more to see how a man would write about fat women than for any other reason and I must say that Patrick Sanchez really did his research or was a fat girl in his former life. I've been a &quot;big girl&quot; all my life and I saw so much of myself in Ruby. I felt her pain and I cried at the end when things worked out for her. This wasn't one of those typical &quot;girl loses weight and life is now perfect&quot; books. It was original and although some of the plot twist were unbelievable I empathized so much with the characters that I didn't care. I've been inspired by this book and plan to read it a second time. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"The Way It Is is the story of three women - all dealing with weight and self-esteem issues in their own way. Ruby has been overweight since she was a child and the trauma of being &quot;the fat girl&quot; has followed her into adulthood. Wanda is overweight as well but still sees herself as a beautiful woman. Simone is thin and beautiful but it's through Simone that Sanchez shows us the extremes woman will go through to be thin. This book was an absolute riot as times and very poignant and moving at others. I feel like I have three new friends in Ruby, Wanda, and Simone. I hope Sanchez does a sequel. I'll be the first in line to buy it!"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"I loved loved loved this book! I was up until 3am finishing it. I could relate to everything about Sanchez's main character, Ruby Waters. I was cheering for her at the end! I don't want to give anything away, but there is a scene in the middle of the book that involves Ruby and some cinnamon rolls that is probably the funniest thing I have ever read in my life! I can't reccomend this book enough!"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"I decided to by this book out of curiousity more than anything else. What the hell does a man (Patrick Sanchez) know about being a fat woman? Well, boy did I find out -- he knows a hell of lot. There were points in this book where I would say &quot;that's me!...that is SO me!&quot; It was hilarious at times and so sad at others it made me cry. But, in the end, the big girls win out! It was like some kind of wharped Cinderella story. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"The author has an amazing way of connecting with people through his writing. This is his best book yet! He takes very difficult issues and allows us to laugh at ourselves. Any person who has ever had issues with weight, relationships, and life will absolutely enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"A very funny very realistic book. You'll relate to this book in so many ways whether you have weight issues or not. There's so much more to the book. Very interesting characters as well."},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"Wow!! Patrick Sanchez did it again!! This was a fun novel about three women who went through all of life's stuff, and survived notoriously........I love Mr. Sanchez' style of writing. He introduces the characters in depth (leaving no room for confusion) before his story line begins.I felt sorry for Ruby, as she was tormented her entire life about being fat. Even her mother was relentless. This part of the story seemed to go on and on, for me, as she was extremely obsessed with dietary fashion (or lack thereof).I loved the three of them together. It showed the real meaning of TRUE SISTERHOOD. The three of them worked well together and the story line seemed to mesh.I loved the fact that Wanda taught Ruby how to love herself just the way she was, and that she did not have to change herself in order to love herself.Although I enjoyed this book, GIRLFRIENDS is still my #1 favorite!!!Thanks, Mr. Sanchez, once again. Looking forward to book #3."},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"This book is drama drama drama from start to finish. From Ruby, the fat girl that can't catch a break. To Wanda, the plus-size model who knows that &quot;fat is where it's at.&quot; To Simone, who used to be fat but is now the da'bomb slender newscaster. All three of the girls take their own wild ride through the book. You'll find it hard to put down and if you read it in public you'll find people staring at you for laughing out loud."},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"This was another great book. I am an avid reader of African American authors but he's an honorary member of my author list.I thought Girlfriends was great, this is better. The funny situations that one did to eat out, another proud to be plump and one scared to be.I love the fact that one of the characters was so comfortable with her weight and did not care about societies opinion of the average weight."},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"Heroines: variedThey don't know it but they are on a collision course with each other, three women who will change each other's lives:Rubenesque Ruby wants to be thin and craves her mother's and society's acceptance almost as much as she does food. But every time these opposing desires start bickering in her head, the food demons win out and she finds herself agonizing as each bite she consumes carries her farther away from her size six ideal. Anxious to love something other than food Ruby fixes her eye on her gorgeous coworker, but her low self esteem keeps her from trying to reach out to him. Or to any man she wants. Up until this point the peaks of her romantic experiences have been flatter than Kansas, and the only men in her life now are her lackluster ex-hubby and her gay pal.Bootylicious Wanda is anxious to make it big in the plus modeling world, but she has three strikes against her: size, age, and race. Add to that a snotty, rich, daddy's girl coworker who undermines her at every turn, Wanda will be lucky not to wind up in the slammer for wringing the chick's neck.Luscious Simone is dying to get out of the local TV news racket and into the limelight of the entertainment industry. Literally. She even figures the notoriety of leaving behind a trail of boy toys might add to her cachet. But she's got tunnel vision where her career is concerned and doesn't see that her life is unraveling around the edges. Living fast and furious might be her ticket to the top--or to six feet underground.What worked for me:This book has a great cover! It's sexy and sassy, colorful and eye-catching. And most importantly it doesn't downsize the big girls.The story is funny, has interesting characters, good plot twists, and a great if not completely pat (the way I like it) ending. Yet it takes the time to insert insightful comments on various social issues rather than deliver up pure fluff.The characters have some flaws that render them unlikable at times, but it's these same flaws which make them leap off the page with realism. (The author also did a great job nailing down the behavior and innermost thoughts of an unhappy-to-be-fat woman.)Size-wise Ruby and Wanda were abundant and Simone was petite but shapely.What didn't work for me:I slurped this story down in one sitting. So honestly, the few technical issues I saw barely registered with me as I was so anxious to keep cruising along.Overall:\\"The Way It Is\\" is: . . . outrageous! You'll laugh, cry, and possibly throw a few things while reading this book. Don't miss it!Warning: there are some coarse words, eating disorders, and sexual references in this book.If you liked \\"The Way It Is\\" you might also enjoy \\"The Fat Friend\\", \\"All of Me\\", \\"The High Price of a Good Man\\", \\"Good in Bed\\", \\"Jemima J.\\", \\"Sisterhood Situation\\", \\"Etta Mae's Little Theory\\", or the \\"Odelia Grey\\" series."},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"When I read the jacket copy for The Way It Is, I thought is was going to a Bridget Jones' type book about neurotic women trying to take off 10 pounds....boy was I wrong! Two of the main characters are fat...and I mean FAT...not typical chick-lit &quot;I'm a size 8 and I'm a hippo and need to loose weight.&quot; Sanchez never says how big they are but from one scene in the book we do know they are larger than a size 16. It was so refreshing to read a book about two truly large women and see how each one of them handled it so differently. The book was hilarious, well written, and has a great ending. BUY IT!"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"Kudos to Patrick Sanchez for writing such a sympathetic book about us big girls. I felt Ruby's pain throughout the book although at some points I just felt so terrible for her I had to put the book down for awhile. Patrick Sanchez tells it like it is and the results are often hilarious but sometimes very sad. The book had a great ending and left me wanting more. Anyone who has ever struggled with weight should buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"The Way It Is is about three women who all end up living together and they all handle their issues with weight in different ways. Ruby hates being fat and spends her days wishing to be thin. Wanda is fat and proud and is striving to make it as a plus size model. Simone used to be fat but now is thin and her past as a fat girl still follows her. All three of the girls are likable and very real and each has their own story line. The book is full of laughs and offer an ocassional social commentary."},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"Okay...I have never written one of these before, but when I finished The Way It Is I felt like I had to spread the word. I connected with this book on a level that I never have connected with a book before. As someone who has been struggling with her weight for most of my life, I found this book to be so refreshing. I felt like I had found a support group through this book...like I was trading stories with the characters. I loved Ruby and Wanda and even eventually fell for Simone. I felt so bad for Ruby during so much of the book, but I can't tell you how happy I was with the ending.Anyone who has tried to lose weight should pick up this book. It will change the way you feel about being fat and leave you hopeful and inspired.You go, Ruby!"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"I couldn't put this book down - very entertaining! I don't know how Patrick Sanchez gets into the female mind so well, but I found myself relating to so many of the characters. A terrific, quick read that leaves you smiling for days."},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"Do yourself a really big favor and buy this book! Patrick Sanchez is a true genius when writing about women. His writing is captivating and his characters are charming and unforgetable. I could'nt put this book down until I finished it. Ruby and Wanda, the big girls in the book, are totally identifiable by anyone who has ever had a weight problem. Sanchez has the inner thoughts of big girls down pat. This book is funny, inspiring, and just plain enjoyable. I can't wait for his next book!"},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"This book is a must read for all women whether you're battling with weight issues now or before. It deals with alot of underlying issues that all of us deal with at one time or another. This book is highly recommended with much needed laugh out loud humor. It's amazing that a male author wrote such an outstanding novel representing women."},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"I am so in love with this author's writing, however, we need more books.......Keep them coming Patric Sanchez, you are brilliant."},{"Title":"The Way It Is","review":"I would really love to see this book made into a movie. It is so hilarious and heartwarming. Patrick Sanchez is one of my favorite authors, he knows how to put so much detail into his books to make you fall in love with his characters and their plights!"},{"Title":"How to Paints Rocks and Surf (Volume 150)","review":"I painted my first seascape from this book,and started a new passion!

Yes, conspiracy theories are a dime a dozen, BUT Hemingway's theory is solid and ties together many of the mysteries of the era."},{"Title":"Friendly Fire on Holy Grounds: The Stockpile Conspiracy","review":"There are numerous books and conspiracy theorists out there providing reasonable, unreasonable and provocative opinions regarding the reasoning for John F.

Millions have wondered and now they will know the truth."},{"Title":"Friendly Fire on Holy Grounds: The Stockpile Conspiracy","review":"Like most people that lived through the JFK assassination I can remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when I heard the news of his death like time stoped. I never believed what the United States government passed off as factual rationale, for the cause of this tragedy. The Warren Commission report did not make sense. I read it in the 1965 and could sense that something was not right. A friend of mine recommended this book to me she knew I was like a majority of people alive, thinking that we would go to our grave not knowing what really happened to JFK. It was her husband a career law enforcement official that convinced me to read this story; it was the best documentation surrounding the crime he claimed. Mr. Hemingway takes you on a trek that only he and JFK traveled while presenting new facts that I have never heard and would have never thought of. I would have never imagined that murdering someone over a political mistake could have caused the turmoil it did. So much of the story sounds like what is going in the United States today, it borders on surreal. The book made me livid. When I was finished; there was a lot of corruption exposed. Truly I can accept this research as fact and this gives me a sense of closure to this grave incident in United States history. Some minor editing changes could be made but it did not overshadow the ground breaking content and earthshaking ideas made this incredible."},{"Title":"Friendly Fire on Holy Grounds: The Stockpile Conspiracy","review":"This is a whole new twist on the JFK assisination. The writer presented some very interesting facts which I think should be looked into further. Possible movie plot???"},{"Title":"Friendly Fire on Holy Grounds: The Stockpile Conspiracy","review":"It is becoming more and more clear that the US Government has not be honest with the masses. This book helps the reader draw a FACTUAL conclusion of what the US Government has been up to using strong and organized evidence. While the first edition has some typographical errors, it remains that Hemingway delivers a strong case."},{"Title":"Friendly Fire on Holy Grounds: The Stockpile Conspiracy","review":"Despite the bizarre cover, the very poor writing and truly terrible editing - there are some very interesting ideas and research here. It is just presented and organized so very poorly. The title is perplexing, but the core of the work is truly thought-provoking. It is frustrating to read because of all of the structural and grammatical errors."},{"Title":"Wooden Toys: Step-By-Step Plans for Over 50 Colourful Toys","review":"With 5 grandchildren I was looking for a book for ideas about making some simple wooden toys that would keep me occupied, and give them pleasure. Nielsen,s Wooden Toys takes you step-by-step through the various stages with each model and is well illustrated to guide you to the finished article.I found my electric fretsaw a big help cutting out the basic shapes although hand tools are all that are needed to make the toys in this book.Making wooden toys like the ones displayed in this book is a good way to use up all those odd bits of timber you have saved and gives a great deal of satisfaction when you see the look of happiness on the face of the child receiving the finished item.Easy to follow, well compiled and illustrated, this book is a good reference guide for the novice toy-maker."},{"Title":"Mafia to Mormon: My Conversion Story","review":"I loved it.

Very touching story --- loved it."},{"Title":"Mafia to Mormon: My Conversion Story","review":"It stunk. To begin with the title is bogus because Mario says he is not actually part of the Mafia. If you get the recorded version, it is poorly recorded.

I appreciate Mario taking the time to tell his story and he has a distinctive writing style (complete with bad grammar but hey, he says himself he is poorly educated). He needs to choose a different printing company next time though, the proofreader for this one was obviously on vacation or asleep. All in all, what I recommend as I said is read the editorial comments and then get the book from your local library and skip ahead to chapters 19 and 20, they are definately worth reading, especially 19."},{"Title":"Mafia to Mormon: My Conversion Story","review":"This is the kind of book that is not, and does not need to be a literary masterpiece. It does not claim to be one either. It's one man's story, simply told, and it's one that should be told. What an amazing transformation and an amazing story. I thoroughly enjoyed this little book and it has been the kind that I think back on often and recommend to people, not for its flowery eloquence, but for its being one of those tales that is worth telling; Honest and simple in it's telling, but uniquely complex in it's content. Loved it. The more I think about it, I would like to change my rating to five stars but I can't figure out how. I origanally gave it four for literary reason's but I actually feel that the content outweighs that. Rock on Mario."},{"Title":"Mafia to Mormon: My Conversion Story","review":"I picked this up and the library during lunch and finished the book before going to bed that night. I'm NOT a reader either.

Not a literary masterpiece, but a fascinating, enjoyable, and inspiring story."},{"Title":"Mafia to Mormon: My Conversion Story","review":"The first half of this book outlines the life that Mario Facione led growing up in crime and as an adult dedicating himself to the challenge of committing crime rather than the desire to get rich. But get rich on ill gotten gain he did.Surprisingly when two Mormon missionaries come to his door, he listens to them. At first, he wants to figure out their scam, but as time goes on he realizes that they have answers to life's questions that he has never found anywhere else.He joins the LDS church with the thought he can continue his life of crime and be a good member at the same time. He soon finds that this is not the case and he is confronted with a decision that leaves his life in the balance.The first half of this book is a look into how a person can become involved in crime. I was ready to put the book down at that point, it was so disturbing, but the second half of this book is inspirational.The only thing I found lacking was any expression of guilt he had for all the hurt he perpetrated upon others because of his actions. That's not to say that he didn't have such remorse, but putting it into the book would have added the extra missing dimension that would have made this book better."},{"Title":"Mafia to Mormon: My Conversion Story","review":"The author allows us to see him as he really is and as he really was before his conversion.

I rushed to pick up &quot;Peder Victorious&quot; and its sequel &quot;Their Father's God&quot; and again, I was not dissapointed.&quot;Peder Victorious&quot; chronicles the childhood of the youngest Holm child, Peder, who is bound for greatness. Through his tribulations with love and sex, to his conflicts with authority this novel brings out all the strife of Americanization.Perhaps the best built conflict and consequently the most frustrating, is that between Peder and his mother. His mother becomes religiously fanatical at times and consequently drives Peder from the church.&quot;Peder Victorious&quot; is a powerful novel, written by a brilliant author. It is too bad that I can't read Norwegian, because I'm sure that these novels are even greater in their original language. I would strongly recommend &quot;Peder Victorious&quot; for anyone that is interested in the conflicts of a widening generation gap, but also for those seeking simply a superbly written novel that is entertaining to the end - Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Peder Victorious: A Tale of the Pioneers Twenty Years Later","review":"&quot;Giant's in the Earth&quot; ended with Per Hansa going off into the snow storm. This novel picks up on his son (who was only 4 when his father disappeared) and his growing years and also fills in the gaps that one had to assumed happened in the first book. A very powerful story regarding a Norwegian boy growing up in America. I only wish that Rolvaag extended it a few more chapters. Peder Victorious, all though it moved slowly at times, was well worth the reading!"},{"Title":"Peder Victorious: A Tale of the Pioneers Twenty Years Later","review":"This book is the sequel to &quot;Giants in the Earth,&quot; an engrossing adventure story about the settlement of the South Dakota prairie. Peder turned out to be entirely different, more cerebral, slower, less exhuberant. I read Giants to learn what my ancestors experienced. It turned out to be a truly significant and exciting novel, but I didn't learn much about the Norwegian-American experience. I picked up Peder to discover what happened to the characters in Giant. Instead, I gained a deeper understanding of the joys and agonies that my family must have experienced as they lost their Norwegian language and culture, becoming Americans.Peder starts off slowly. Revolving around the title character, it uses Peder Holm's experience as an adolescent as a device to illustrate the changes and conflicts within the Norwegian-American community. As he becomes more mature, and his dilemmas become more adult, the story becomes more engrossing.I have to admit that I set this one down for about a month before finishing it, but I'm ready to read the next one. In many ways, it is a more significant novel than Giants. It was moving and thought-provoking. Great novels are not always an easy read--this one is worth a bit of patience through Peder's childhood years."},{"Title":"Peder Victorious: A Tale of the Pioneers Twenty Years Later","review":"I stumbled onto \\"Giants in the Earth\\" years ago and fell in love with it immediately.

In this story, Private Investigator Kat Vargas finds herself relocating temporarily from Long Beach, California to the small beach town of Twilight Cove, house-sitting for her good friend Jake, another P.I. While she is settling in, she meets one of the local residents of the town, Ty Chandler, who asks her to help find his daughter, someone he did not know existed until just recently. The missing daughter was born 19 years ago to his high school sweetheart, but because of a life of drugs that destroyed Amy in the end, he and Amy parted before he ever knew about the baby.Kat's current philosophy in life was to keep emotional attachments at bay, and had focused on her career to keep from falling in love again. She keeps her past hidden from most people, a past that has shaped her into who she is today. But Ty Chandler is about to change everything. He finds himself falling in love with Kat while they work together searching for his daughter, and Kat tries her best to keep her own feelings for Ty hidden.Their search leads them back to Southern California, where Ty's daughter Sunny is living a life that is headed towards disaster. When Ty offers her a home with him in Twilight Cove, Sunny at first turns him down, but surprises him and Kat by showing up one day at his front door, with her own baby in her arms. Ty has become an instant father and grand father!Kat and Ty slowly build their friendship, while Ty and Sunny develop their own. Things get complicated when Sunny starts to distrust Kat, seeing that Kat does not seem too comfortable around the baby. Sunny senses that Kat is hiding something, and does not hesitate to let Ty know. And Kat finds her instincts tuned in to the fact that Sunny may not be telling them everything that they should know about her. When Sunny and the baby disappear one day without a trace, Kat goes on her own to track down the missing girl.HEAT WAVE was my first book by Jill Marie Landis. It was not what I had expected, thinking I would be reading a pure romance novel. Although the main story line is that of Kat and Ty's budding romance, Kat's secret past and Sunny's life in Southern California play a big part in the novel, a story that brings two people together who may have never met except under these circumstances. I give this book 4 stars, and recommend it to those who are not true romance fans, but may enjoy a book that has a mix of several genres in one."},{"Title":"Heat Wave","review":"In HEAT WAVE, the second in a trilogy of books by Jill Marie Landis, Kat Vargas is a private investigator who for many years has focused only on her career, to the exclusion of her family and any serious love interests. She's too busy to have a long-term boyfriend and she likes it this way. When her friend and ex-partner Jake needs a housesitter for his beachside home near San Luis Obispo so he can take the family away on a long vacation, Kat is coerced into taking the job. She had just come off of a very dangerous situation, ended up in the hospital and now needed time to recuperate. She leaves her home in Long Beach, California and drives up the coast to a small beach town called Twilight Cove.Kat isn't there very long when a neighbor comes by Jake's house to see her. Ty Chandler, one of the residents of this small resort town, has heard about her and asks if he can hire her to do a job. He has just found out that he has a daughter, born nineteen years ago to an old girlfriend from high school, but was never told about the daughter until recently, right before his mother passed away. He's angry with his mother for hiding this information from him. She had never liked his girlfriend Amy and wanted to protect him, but his mother and Amy are now both gone, and it was time to make up for the time he had lost. He's ready to find his daughter.With only a few clues to go by, Kat and Ty work side by side, searching the Internet and making phone calls, following the trail of the missing girl. While this is strictly business for Kat, she senses that Ty is growing fond of her, but Kat does her best to tell him &quot;no.&quot; She insists that she does not mix business with pleasure, but she also remembers what Jake has told her --- that she needs to relax and let someone new into her life. It was about time she moved on from her tragic past, a past that she hides from everyone she has met since leaving her home in Hawaii. Her career as a private investigator had come about because of what she endured on Hawaii due to a tragic accident. Only her family and friends back on the island of Kauai know of her tragic loss and the pain she kept buried inside her all these years.Ty and Kat have enough clues to find Ty's daughter, who they discover is now living in Southern California with a number of other people her age, all of whom seem to be destitute, shady-looking and lacking any financial means to make ends meet. Upon meeting them, Sunny, Ty's daughter, looks upon both of them with distrust and lets them know that she is not interested in going back with Ty to Twilight Cove. But Ty hands over his phone number to her, hoping that she changes her mind.Sunny does take Ty up on his offer and comes to find him in Twilight Cove. They get to know each other while she tries to make a home for herself and her baby, another surprise for Ty. While Ty is dealing with a new family, Kat is dealing with her own feelings, not sure whether she is falling in love with Ty or wanting to run away again. She's also not sure about Sunny, and decides to investigate Sunny's past to see what kind of trouble she may have gotten herself into.HEAT WAVE was a surprise to this reviewer. It was a lot more than a romance. The story of Ty and his long-lost daughter was a great story-within-the-story, allowing the reader to get to know Ty's character much better than simply as a love interest. And Sunny's account of her life in Southern California was another interesting side-story that fit in with the rest of the book. Landis does a good job at creating characters that the reader will relate to, although this reviewer was not totally sure she liked Kat Vargas at first. As is the case with any romance, the most important feature should be the reader's ability to relate to the characters, and whether the story is believable or not. Based on that, this reviewer recommends HEAT WAVE to any person looking for an engrossing romance and a great beach read.--- Reviewed by Marie Hashima Lofton"},{"Title":"Heat Wave","review":"When we first met beautiful private investigator Kat Vargas in &quot;Lover's Lane,&quot; we soon learned that her heart had been broken.

Another man. She was convinced happy endings were only for romance novels and that ninety percent of the population shouldn't even bother getting married.&quot;No, she hasn't forgotten who done her wrong, how much it hurt, and she's not about to make that mistake again. Most of us know better than to say &quot;never,&quot; and Kat should, too.Once more the setting in Jill Marie Landis's second novel in the Twilight Cove series is a small California beach community, Twilight Cove, of course. It's a sleepy, slow spot, much too laid back for Kat who likes activity and is beginning to show signs of boredom. Then the doorbell rang.Ty Chandler was too good to be true in the looks department. When he said he needed a PI, Kat was sure he thought his wife was cheating on him (which meant his wife was nuts or he wasn't very good in the husband department). Never able to resist a story, she agreed to listen to him.Some nineteen years ago Ty had become a father; the girl he went steady with in high school had secretly given birth to a daughter. He had just learned of his daughter's existence, and he desperately wants to find her.As the two begin their search for Ty's offspring they are irresistibly drawn to one another.

Though the budding love between Kat and Ty makes for a fine romance, the underlying focus of the plot is the relationship, often dysfunctional on her part, between Ty and Sunny. She is an engaging protagonist struggling with what is right for her daughter and her friends at the cost of her self.

It starts out great and draws you right in. Kat Vargas is on a case and gets shot in the hand. Her partner Jake Montgomery insists she recuperate in his new home in Twilight Cove, Cal. Her first visitor there is Ty Chandler, who is looking for a daughter he didn't know he had. His girl friend got pregnant in Senior year of High School and left town -when Ty followed she told him she didn't want to see him again. He goes off to Alaska and lives there for the next 17 years. He learns of his daughter from his mother who found out about his child but never told him until she is dying. He hires Kat to find the child (he doesn't know the sex of the child until Kat investigates). When he finds his daughter,Sunny, she has a daughter herself -Alice (her nickname is French Fry)Sunny has some questionable friends and her dad Ty invites her to come and stay with him in Twilight Cove. The romance between Ty and Kat is unbelievable. Anyway the Sunny story is much more interesting than her dad Ty and Kat. Also her Dad's unmarried 37 year old best friend is naturally attracted to Sunny. Of course Sunny is beautiful and Dad's friend is gorgeous too. I wish it had been a better developed story. Everyone is gorgeous. Is anyone ever just average in these romances. As I mentioned above Sunny story is more interesting with her friends involved in insurance fraud - she goes back with them since her husband Dodge is living in a nursing home (brain dead from an auto accident). That is a last minute detail to excuse her involvement in the insurance fraud. Regardless of this book, I will still anticipate another romance from Jill who I know must have a better story up her sleeve than this one.Was this review helpful to you?"},{"Title":"Heat Wave","review":"I love Jill Marie Landis' novels.

When the King's Dream, a luxury charter yacht, part of a small fleet headed to a weekend birthday and gambling party at the Atlantic Resort in the Bahamas, shipwrecks all hell breaks loose. With the exception of the Caucasian captain, the castaway passengers are all African Americans. The similarities end there. In addition to surviving with limited food and water supplies, sub-par shelter, and yesterdays clothing, the gang is also struggling to cope with each other. Their social backgrounds, education, income, zip codes, political and religious affiliations are as diverse as the Rainbow Coalition. The motley squad include Sahara, a former college beauty queen and aspiring medical student/part time waitress; Fame, a StepInFetch up-and-coming inner city comedian; Rachel and Valerie, cousins and \\"I ain't saying they're gold diggers...but\\"; Muhammad, a married Muslim and his Christian mistress, Shon; Samuel aka Sammy a Clarence Thomas wannabee whose dossier includes a career as a successful corporate lawyer and a blonde haired/blue eyed white girlfriend; Wolf, a menacing and evil Brooklyn thug/drug dealer; and, Jean Paul Baptiste, heir of a prominent New Orleans family with serious cold feet who is two weeks away from an \`arranged' marriage. Will this group be able to tolerate each other and work together until they are rescued or will they be like crabs in a barrel and allow their differences to interfere with their mission and cause a few casualties along the way?Crabs in a Barrel is an entertaining and enjoyable page-turner. It was a delectable treat that I stopped my world for so that I could give it my undivided attention and read uninterrupted until the last page. Crabs in the Barrel made me laugh, scream, sad, become angry and reflective. For those who are unfamiliar with the term \`crabs in a barrel', Harmon enlightens in an informative and easy to follow manner. One of the few shortcomings of the novel is that the female voices were not strong and the characters not as distinctive or memorable as the male characters. But it is a weakness that I believe Harmon will quickly overcome as he continues to hone his writing style. I am glad that I did not allow my bias regarding the cover or the author's last two books to taint my decision as I would have missed out on a really good book. Reading Crabs in a Barrel was like watching a movie unfold. Fans of castaway series such as Gilligan Islands, Lost and Survivors will enjoy the storyline. Readers looking for tight writing, a strong storyline with colorful characters, vivid imagery and poignant social messages will appreciate the fresh voice.Reviewed by Yasmin ColemanAPOOO BookClubwww.apooo.org"},{"Title":"Crabs in a Barrel","review":"Byron Harmon's Crabs in a Barrel is a short, satisfying read that is not only entertaining, but also thought-provoking. Harmon's characters are diverse in background and experience, and each of the castaways has a unique perspective. Harmon punches up the storyline with historical facts and a dialog between the characters that makes the reader stop and think. Racism is a key topic, both between blacks and whites and among the races themselves. The only white person in the story, Capt. Murphy, elicits some interesting responses from the rest of the castaways in a spirited and intelligent debate about this subject.My only complaint is that the book was too short.

Very quick read, less than 175 pages. Very nice change from the \\"norm\\". I'm not sure if it's intended to be a comedy or not, since some of the subject matter (rape, murder, explosions, etc.) is not funny, but the author has one hell of a humorous streak.

The premise of the book is somewhat innovative, probably inspired by all of the reality tv shows out there. The reading is light and the book is not very long. In addition, the chapters are short, and this makes for a swift read. There were errors that editing did not catch and the cover is not suited well for the content of the book. Nonetheless, it was a fun story. There was a blend of humor, suspense, and even some philosophizing."},{"Title":"Crabs in a Barrel","review":"Byron Harmon is back with a quick and funny, yet thoughtful read which will make you think far beyond the words on the page. Reminiscent of television favorites Gilligan's Island and Survivor, CRABS IN A BARREL introduces the reader to a mismatched group of individuals sailing on a luxury yacht enroute to the Bahamas for a birthday party. When they end up lost on a remote island, the fear of never being discovered mixes with the various personalities, setting the stage for endless moments of tension, debate, laughter, and most importantly, thoughts of survival. The cast of characters is African-American, with the exception of the captain, and includes a medical student, who is working on the boat as a waitress, a drug dealer, a sell-out lawyer, a Muslim and his Christian mistress, a wannabe comedian, and two gold-digging cousins. As imagined, they quickly size each other up, pick sides, and do their best to survive. However, with so many different opinions and mistrust settling in, it's not quite clear if they'll ever make it off the island.What I really enjoyed about CRABS IN A BARREL is how Harmon uses humor to bring up some very serious topics revolving around race, religion, and social classes. It is an engaging read which truly depicts the \\"crabs in a barrel\\" mentality. It brings home many messages about stereotypes within our community and other ethnic groups. Harmon's writing pulls in the reader and the dialogue lends for a great discussion. Most importantly for me, the ending of the book is believable and will please even the worst critic. CRABS IN A BARREL is a realistic portrayal of life as we know it and comes highly recommended.Reviewed by Tee C.

Unfortunately I've heard these conversations before so that was a slight let down.The story, however, was fast, sometimes brutal, funny, and I didn't expect some of the things to happen that actually did happen.

And &quot;bothered&quot; is just he word to describe how Kate feels about the events in her life. Not least of these events is the swarm of reporters that has descended upon the town of Jesus Creek to cover the disappearance of a mentally unstable rich girl. The girl checked into Kate's hotel one night and soon disappeared from her locked room. When the girl's parents hire a psychic to help them, the local religious figure, Brother B., runs around talking about the dangers of dealing with demons. After a s&eacute;ance, the psychic announces that he knows where the body will be found. To give away any more of the plot would be to give away too much of the story, but I can say safely that before all is said and done, very few people will turn out to be what they seemed, and murder will be done. Author Deborah Adams handles herself quite adeptly in her first outing, though it should be said that the ending is a too abrupt. Her characters are well-drawn and engaging, and she does a wonderful job of sharing the town with us. For mystery readers who like their mysteries cozy, &quot;All the Great Pretenders&quot; is recommended reading."},{"Title":"All the Great Pretenders","review":"After being pretty impressed with recent Agatha first book nominees, I've been venturing back into some of the older nominees. This book, a nominee in 1991, wasn't very impressive. The story is set in a B&amp;B in a small town in Tennessee. Far too much of the book is about the B&amp;B and small town life. Such mystery as there is only gets rolling in the second half of the book. It seemed to me that the author's real agenda was to write about life in her town and the mystery was an afterthought.Bottom-line: Not sure what this book did to earn a nomination and not surprised the series hasn't gone on to further critical acclaim. There's better southern small town mystery out there (Margaret Maron, Carolyn Hart and others)."},{"Title":"All the Great Pretenders","review":"I enjoy this series.

SjomanThe Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace has just come out in its second edition with some minor corrections and a new preface. It is an extraordinary book in the breadth of research that informs it. The book presents strikingly original conclusions on a subject where most insights have been doctored to fulfill the faith in its various forms or keep up with the advertising extravaganza.The book traces not the history but the development of the yoga schools that have flowered with B. K. S. Iyengar, Pattabhi Jois and T. Krishnamacariar. It goes back further into the history of yoga reclaiming the practise history as the main authority, as opposed to the academic history.Sjoman examines the academic history from the point of view of the &quot;practise history&quot; which requires re-evaluating and reclaiming it from both Sanskrit commentators and Western academics. His interpretation of the sutra of Patanjali from the perspective of yoga practitioners is especially welcome.This approach makes more sense than the academic interpretations. The story elaborated here is supplemented by philosophical and textual arguments by Indian scholars and pandits too often neglected in Western scholastics, and by unique insights into those traditions that could only be given by someone immersed in the tradition.The history of the Mysore Palace School gives us an insight into how the yoga system which is foremost in the whole world today has come into being. The history reveals not just the &quot;material moments&quot; as such, but the ideas that were part of what went into the formation of modern yoga today. The book examines how contemporary yoga practise is shaping yoga, and the vital factors that give it social context.The core of the book is a translation of a text from the 1800s from the private library of the Mysore palace which is the only textual documentation of an extended asana practise - asanas being the yoga positions that form the core of yoga practise today.The translation of this text from Sanskrit in Kannada script is supplemented with notes and appendices relating the asanas to earlier references and later practise. This text is helpful in establishing a dynamic tradition of how the groups of asanas came about.The book is written with a rare scholarly acumen and humor. It is not a &quot;how to&quot; or &quot;save the world&quot; book but a deeper and more sustained insight into the transition of the practises of yoga from a spiritual discipline carried on by ascetics in solitude to a modern world mass marketing phenomenon. The learning and research that has gone into this book is not generally accessible. The insight it provides should be welcome to any serious student of yoga. A complex and learned assessment of the whole yoga tradition, this book will claim its rightful place on the shelves of scholars all over the world as the first actual history of yoga. ======================================"},{"Title":"The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace","review":"The Yoga tradition of the Mysore palace stands distinct in that it does not seem to be supported by any documented lineage of teachers or philosophical traditions. But it is an ancient tradition that has its roots from the times of sage Patajali (150 B.C.E?).The great value of this book is that it includes an English translation of the Sritattvanidhi text from Mysore palace, with photographs of 121 asanas from the manuscript. It is attributed to Maharaja Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar (1794-1868 A.D). The Maharaja authored about 60 artistic works, and the Wodeyar royal family has been patrons and participants of arts.The author has included short sections on the Mysore palace gymnastics and wrestling traditions, with a few black and white illustrations and photographs in Appendices 7 and 8. Appendix 9 is an alphabetical list of the Sanskrit names of asanas from Sritattvanidhi, with their page numbers in this work. Many rare names are there. There is also a lengthy bibliography and an 8-page alphabetical Index of asanas.The Introduction section candidly speaks of the author's background and philosophy of learning. He has intense training in the Mysore system and deep interest in spiritual disciplines.Students interested in the asana traditions can greatly improve their understanding from this book."},{"Title":"The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace","review":"The book is an interesting read for those who like histories of asana (postural yoga) practices. My main quibble with the book is simply the format, which is not obvious from the Amazon product page. The entire book is 124 pages long, but the actual number of pages of text written by the author (minus illustrations, appendices, table of contents, indexes, bibliographies, and translation of the SRITATTVANIDHI text) is about 36. The various indexes and translations are, in themselves, interesting, but I'd actually like to read more historical discussion from the author."},{"Title":"The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace","review":"If you practice, Iyengar, Ashtanga Vinyasa, Viniyoga or Vinyasa Krama you will want to know more about Krishnamacharya.

However, for someone using it in a non-network setting, it is frustrating; only occassional asides are given to internet connectivity, and often whole chapters on functionality are ended with a note to the effect of, &quot;If you are an internet-only user, these functions are not available.&quot; The point is, Outlook allows those in a mobile office/home office setting to take advantage of many of these features, and these functions can be utilized. This book does not explain this very clearly, however. Further, there are many step-by-step instructions that do not apply, exactly, to the most recent version of Outlook 2000; commands are slightly different, and often the Outlook 98 steps are given.

Part of me says 4 stars, but the other part says 3 stars. In the end I'm going with 4 because, while it may not be the greatest book out there, it sure was hard to put down. Now, I've always made it clear that I'm not a fan of chick-lit, most of it's just shallow women in the big city going from one superficial crises to the next...but 'Suburbanistas' actually has some meat to it.I liked the dynamic between the two friends...they both grow up in a small Jersey town, and one (Mary Jean) becomes a cop's wife and raises four kids, while the other (Stella) runs off to Hollywood and becomes a super famous actress. The two have lost touch ever since Stella left abruptly for California, but when she returns home to visit her mother, who dies shortly after, they get back together and slowly regain the close bond they once shared.Now...as for the political end of the story, this is why I was wanting to give it 3 stars. It was just silly, and predictable. I could see from a mile away who was going to end up becoming the mayor of Homewood...and are we really supposed to believe that Pete (Mary Jeans husband) would campaign against her and continue to help Henry Sladowsky just for the sake of becoming Chief of Police? Isn't it obvious that if Mary Jean were to win that she would appoint her husband to that position? Because of this I really didn't care too much for Pete, or Mary Jean's daughter Fanny, who was just a little to over-the-top in my opinion.But, those few things aside, and as mad as I would get during some parts of the book, I just couldn't put the darn thing down. And something should be said for that. Ms. Satran may not have a classic here, but she certainly knows who to keep the readers attention, and that's big. Upon reading the interview section at the end, I learned that her other two novels take place in Homewood, New Jersey as well, and I'm thinking I just might pick them up. So...if your a fan of chick-lit, I absolutely think you'll enjoy this, and even if your not, it's still not a bad way to pass a couple of rainy afternoons."},{"Title":"Suburbanistas","review":"Pam Satran plays with a lot of themes in her latest Homewood novel -- the renewal of old-friendships, small-town politics, the downside of suburban development -- but you'll want to buy her novel for the funniest sex scene in all literature.

Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"Suburbanistas","review":"Since so many popular chick-literature focuses on the privileged, glamorous lives of beautiful Manhattanites, I was curious to read this book which focuses instead on the lifestyle of women in Hollywood and suburban New Jersey (especially since I am former New Yorker, who lives in the New York suburbs and works in the New Jersey suburbs).However, I was left disappointed and annoyed.Compared to other popular chick-lit, the author's characters are fully-dimensional and likeable (compared to say Plum Sykes' inanely vapid and selfish characters in Bergdorf Blondes). It was for this reason that I finished the book, and other readers will want to as well, since the author excels at making the reader care about the characters.However, advertised as a book about \\"friendship\\", this book is no different than any of the NYC-center chic-lit narratives which center on a have v. have not lifestyle. The problem being that in works such as \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" or \\"The Ivy Chronicles\\" which are a humorous look at the lives of the haves, they make no particular moral statement about the class differentials of the have-nots.Suburbanistas, on the other hand is infused with a subtle brand of class issues, and populist, democratic socialism and anti-corporate message which in my opinion has no place in chic-lit. What makes this subtle moralistic message annoying, is that in the end the glamorous, thin, beautiful woman from Hollywood continues to be fabulous and continue her acting on Broadway, while there is no Cinderella ending for her childhood friend from New Jersey. Since the author took it upon herself to promote a socially democratic message throughout the book, suggesting that at the end, both characters will achieve equality, to end the book with this obvious contraction is frustrating and annoying."},{"Title":"Suburbanistas","review":"There's rich, really rich and filthy stinking rich.

Eddie failed to accompany her as he was to busy with a gig. However, Stella is stunned when her mom suddenly dies. The funeral is a farce with reporters and fans trampling on everything and her husband stays in Hollywood grooving with Idaho's nanny while Stella grieves. Her best friend in high school Mary Jean Wright helps her escape the mob, whose despicable actions at the funeral were a disgrace.As Stella feels guilt and loneliness, she begins seeing developer Henry Sladowski who wants to convert the small sleepy down into an expensive burb for the rich and famous. This will price Mary Jean, her spouse a cop, and their four children out of the town. However, as Stella begins to understand local politics she becomes involved as any place in which her beloved mom could not call home is not for her.Stella will learn that you can go home though it takes the death of her beloved mom and a lesson in civics to do so.

Taylor learns that her uncle killed her lover, who actually was the murderer, and that she must flee her nation to live with her white father Charles in St. Louis. Taylor hates Charles, who deserted her and her mother when she was nine.Before encountering her father, his friend Greyson Talbott intercepts Taylor at Charles' doorsteps. Greyson knows that his friend believes his beloved daughter is dead. He forces her to go to his home until he can straighten out this mess that could destroy the mayoral ambitions of his brother, engaged to Charles' niece. As Greyson and Taylor become acquainted, they fall in love. However, a relative of either Taylor or Charles wants the &quot;sin&quot; either to leave town now or die.Award-winning novelist Cheryl Ann Porter demonstrates why she is a fan favorite when it comes to exciting romances with mystery elements. Her current historical tale, WILDFIRE, is a well-written novel with solid lead characters although a couple of flaws in the who-done-it subplot hurt the story line. The insight into the Cherokee Nation one-decade after the Civil War is enlightening, cleverly interwoven into the main theme, and propels the plot forward. Americana romance readers will enjoy this action-packed tale with an entertaining cast who brings St. Louis to life twenty-five years before readers meet Judy Garland on the trolley.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wild Flower","review":"A Cherokee maiden, Taylor Christie James, was accused of a murder she did not commit and sentenced to hang.

That being said, I think the work would have benefited greatly from someone knowledgeable in Orthodox theology and liturgics. In many instances, the author speculates on various possible reasons for practices whose origins and purposes are already well known to historians or theologians (albeit not to the Old Believers he was interviewing). The author's ethnographic research coupled with a sound understanding of liturgical and doctrinal development would have made for a much more thorough study (without it becoming inaccessible to readers).

All was preserved in letters (May 7, 1861 to June 18, 1864) from Pvt. John R. McClure, 14th Regiment of the Indiana Volunteers. It was amazing that, although wounded, John survived three years of the war's fighting.Nancy Niblack Baxter, who edited the letters and did the introduction, also includes a paragraph of information preceding many letters placing Pvt.

Pastel is the story of an older sister who loves her younger sister dearly but feels totally eclipsed by her personality or 'pastel' in comparison. The way she deals with her feelings and realizes her life is the one she really wants is the crux of the story. The story is very much of it's time period - no liberated women in this book, so it may seem more dated to some, but it's a worthwhile read and beautifully written."},{"Title":"Pastel","review":"&quot;Pastel&quot; is not for people who expect the 'usual', lighthearted Heyer. It's a contemporary (1920's) novel about the intense jealousy of one sister towards another, and it deals with it in a fairly realistic manner. As such, &quot;Pastel&quot; is probably one of the most psychologically complex of Heyer's novels, and, in my opinion, it succeeds superbly, in realistically delineating relationships between Siblings. One of my favorite Heyer novels."},{"Title":"Pastel","review":"Another of Georgette Heyers surpressed books, this is a charming tale, never saccharine or improbable. It tells the story of a young woman trying to reconcile her ideas of love and happiness with reality, and tells it well, our heroins insecurities making her the more endearing. Well worth the read, especially for hardened Heyer fans, her references to animals being particularly funny."},{"Title":"Pastel","review":"A Novice Reviewer's ViewpointPastel is set in the 1910's and is of its era, where people in books and on the stage seem brittle. Perhaps because it was the age when the middle and upper classes in Britain did not reveal their true feelings, but I couldn't get &quot;into the skin&quot; of the characters and lose myself.Saying that, of course, shows how well G.H. manages to portray the world she is writing about so well.Probably because I prefer G.H's later books set in the Regency period and written in a more lighthearted vein, I found Pastel disappointing."},{"Title":"Pastel","review":"Set in the '20s, Pastel is not at all what I've come to expect of Heyer. It's witty dialogue doesn't quite make up for the lack of action in this comedy of manners. The characters are not so well developed as one normally finds in Heyer's period pieces (Regency, etc.).

And, as another reviewer said, this book was not as lighthearted as her regency books I've read. That being said, I think that Georgette Heyer did a nice job with her characters. Georgette Heyer's ability to write books in different genres and of different types within the genre is pretty impressive.The romance in this book was on some levels depressing. I don't mind some disappointments happening to my heroines, but the disappointment in this book was long-lived. About a year. You feel that the character is settling for the man that becomes her husband, and a lot of the book just seems to be about a young lady's view of the world and her life through a crush, her dashed hopes, inner turmoil over the differences between herself and her sister, marriage to someone she is not passionately in love with, and then her married life.

Otherwise, one cannot fully appreciate Williamson's skill in the character development of his hero Phillip, and of the surrounding cast of family, friends and fellow soldiers"},{"Title":"On Genetic Interests: Family, Ethnicity, and Humanity in an Age of Mass Migration","review":"The need to identify with others like oneself, and to be with one's own kind, is a major component of human nature and so ethnic identity is a powerful force in human affairs. Group members have \\"ties of blood\\" that make them \\"special\\" and different from outsiders. This is why patriotism is almost always seen as a virtue and an extension of family loyalty. It also explains why ethnic remarks so easily become \\"fighting words.\\" Culture builds on genetic similarity and is bound together by it. Patriotism is preached in kinship terms. Nations are the \\"motherland\\" or the \\"fatherland\\" and unions and churches refer to their members as \\"brothers\\" and \\"sisters.\\"Salter draws out the implications, however politically incorrect, for immigration policies, citizenship law, affirmative action, multiculturalism, and other ways of allocating resources within and between states. There are constraints on how much diversity can be appreciated.On Genetic Interests extends evolutionary theorizing, including my own Genetic Similarity Theory, to the new ground of interpersonal and ethnic relations such as within-group cohesion and between-group conflict. It discusses studies on likeness in social partners such as spouses and best friends. Most importantly, it applies genetic calculations and finds that the average coefficient of kinship within most ethnic groups is about as high as between half-siblings, aunt and nephew, or grandparent and grandchild. Thus, ethnic nepotism is no mere poor relation of family nepotism-it is virtually a proxy for it. Because we have many more co-ethnics than relatives, the aggregate mass of genes shared with the former dwarfs that shared with the latter.Frank Salter, a political scientists and ethologist at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, argues persuasively in this book that shared genes are the glue of sociality.On Genetic Interests goes so far as to refer to the mind as having an \\"innate descent-group module\\" (p. 102). It uses this concept to explain the universality of ethnic nepotism. This is heartening because many social scientists and sociobiologists alike have been reluctant to even consider applying gene-based similarity to ethnic and national preferences. Following World War II, few political scientists and historians have considered inter-group conflict from a Darwinian viewpoint. Partly in an effort to insure that they are perceived as in no way condoning racism, many evolutionists have minimized the theoretical possibility of a biological underpinning to ethnic, national, and racial favoritism. As the late, great, evolutionary biologist William Hamilton himself remarked in 1987, while noting why kin discrimination even among animals is not more readily expected, \\"in civilized cultures, nepotism has become an embarrassment.\\"Social scientists and historians have been quick to condemn the extent to which political leaders or would-be leaders have been able to manipulate ethnic identity. But the questions they never ask, let alone attempt to answer is, \\"Why is it always so easy?\\" and \\"Why can a relatively uneducated political outsider set off a race riot simply by uttering a few well delivered ethnic epithets?\\" On Genetic Interests provides an illuminating answer."},{"Title":"On Genetic Interests: Family, Ethnicity, and Humanity in an Age of Mass Migration","review":"The importance of this book is that it explains that racism is rational. That is, by favoring people of one's own race, a person is increasing his fitness. This means that the anti-racists are trying to convince people to lower their fitness and eventually go extinct. In evolutionary terms, racism is adaptive and anti-racism is maladaptive. A further implication is that racists are in harmony with man's nature (indeed, the nature of all living things - to pass on the unique forms of one's genes), and that anti-racists, who go ballistic at any tinge of racism, are psychologically pathological.While there is some math in the book, it can be understood by the average person who thinks carefully about the definitions of the terms. The reader should consult the glossary in the back of the book and be sure he understands the difference between \\"individual fitness,\\" \\"absolute fitness,\\" \\"relative fitness,\\" and \\"inclusive fitness.\\" Chapter 2 is the most important and difficult chapter and should be read several times."},{"Title":"On Genetic Interests: Family, Ethnicity, and Humanity in an Age of Mass Migration","review":"This book gives scientific legitimacy to genetic interests which can be protected by the ethnostate. It reads like a scientific journal and is a bit daunting to understand at times for the layman, but not overwhelming.Salter advocates putting more emphasis on preserving the ethny rather than just focusing on families or humanity. The three concerns involved are humanity, ethny, and family. Conservatives favor family and liberals favor humanity in their concerns. The mass immigration of genetically distant populations into America is displacing the European ethny here. He uses evolutionary sociobiology to make his arguments against alien immigration. He advocates universal nationalism for the world's ethnies. He reviews arguments against his ideas and the ethical considerations involving universal nationalism.He argues for the same thing that David Duke and Robert McCollough argue for, but his arguments are even more focused on scientifically justifying ethnic separations such as having ethnies monopolize a territory. This strategy would echo the tribal evolutionary strategy that has always existed and has built the nation state. Modern mass anonymous societies with all their technologies have made us confused about our genetic interests. He is against the multi-racial polities which favor minority interests over majority ones, although he does not forbid multi-racial states for those who desire them. Minorities are more motivated to defend their interests in multi-racial states because of alienation and the subtle rejection of the majority. Majorities are complacent about their interests because they deal more with their own kind everyday and do not feel alienated.He is against aggression in his model of universal nationalism; it is no longer worth it to take over territory because of population growth and the destruction war can cause. The age of empire should not be renewed.Unfortunately, ethnic polices are often decided by political cunning and will to power, rather than by scientific reasoning. I do not see that any of ideas will be implemented soon. Some states are based on ethnic solidarity such as in Germany, where only those of German blood are citizens. Still Germany has not sent many Turks back home because they do not have the political will, even though it is constitutionally legal for them to do so. Even such ethnic states will not always enforce their ethnic policies. But Germany is better off than the US and England, which have become proposition nations in which citizens supposedly attain solidarity by believing in liberal democratic ideals that deny the genetic interests of various ethnies. Multi-racial proposition nations are hard to hold together and require a lot of propaganda from the media, government, entertainment, and education to keep people believing in the proposition."},{"Title":"On Genetic Interests: Family, Ethnicity, and Humanity in an Age of Mass Migration","review":"\\"A tour-de-force.

The author also gives 1 to 2 page narratives of the various major battles GD participated in during this time frame. As well as descriptions of the various sub-units that made up GD, including rarely covered support/maitenance units.My favorite part of the book were the biographical sketches of various GD personalities. These include not only senior and company grade officers, but several NCO's as well. I recomend this book to anyone interested in German units or the Eastern front of WW2, particularly armor buffs and modelers."},{"Title":"GOD, HONOR, FATHERLAND: A Photo History of Panzergrenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\" on the Eastern Front 1942-1944","review":"Not just another mundane collection of photos, this book is perhaps one of the best volumes in English regarding German soldiers, and especially the GD Division. The captions cast light on many arcance areas of study - uniforms, organization, history, tactics - and all the details are consistently correct and well researched. The only minor nit I was able to find is the mis-captioning of an NCO equivalent beamten as a &quot;Hauptmann&quot; - (p. 114)Overall, a thoroughly excellent photographic record, with emphasis on naming photo subjects (a very nice touch). Of course, as with any collection of WW II photos, most of the pictures in this book are obviously posed, and there is nothing in the way of &quot;real action&quot; shots. This is not a drawback, and few &quot;real action&quot; shots were taken during the war by any of the combatants.There are also some excellent biographical sketches of Knight' Cross winners and unit commanders."},{"Title":"GOD, HONOR, FATHERLAND: A Photo History of Panzergrenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\" on the Eastern Front 1942-1944","review":"Having purchased many Grossdeutschland photo histories over the years, I was pleasantly surprised to find this outstanding RZM product at a used bookstore. Yep...that doesn't happen every day. Naturally I snapped this gem up and am still amazed at the quality of pictures and narrative.This volume follows the GD from 1942-1944, which are the years focused on the Soviet front. The pictures cover all aspects of the division from the maintenance and logistics elements to the Infantry, Panzer, and Reconnaissance units. As earlier reviews indicated, the captions are very well done and specific attention is paid to naming the individuals pictured. Another great plus is the large format size of many pictures. For modellers these are a window into details often missed in smaller format photos.So if you already think you already have enough volumes of GD related history...think again. This volume is one that you don't want to be without.Another first rate job by RZM."},{"Title":"GOD, HONOR, FATHERLAND: A Photo History of Panzergrenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\" on the Eastern Front 1942-1944","review":"When I first received this book in the mail, I wondered if it was worth the $75 price I paid for it. By the time I was done leafing through it, I realized that it most certainly was! It is a photo book, meaning that the reader will not find quantities of detailed accounts of the division.Aside from the first 10 pages, that describe the development of GD, the book is essentially divided into three major sections, chronologically. Beginning with 1942, the subsections for each year focus on different aspects of the division. For example, the first part includes subsections on the Divisional HQ, armored car tactics, the StuG Brigade, and \\"The Race to the Lower Don.\\"Within the 1943 section is a discussion on the Panzerregiment GD, tank maintenance, and education. The educational topics include the Close-Quarter Tank Destruction Course and the Feldkampfschule.The last area includes topics such as the Flakabteilung, the F&uuml;silierregiment, the Panzergrenadierregiment, and the Tiger Regiment. A few of the more pivotal battles are also outlined.There are aspects of this book that will greatly appeal to historians and model builders. The first is that there are 19 short biographies scattered throughout the book, of some of the more major personalities. At the end of the book is a two-page bibliography that lists specific GD unit histories, unpublished GD documents, and dozens of general references that discuss this unit. Those that wish to learn more about this unit will find more than ample references here!The strength of this book, however, lies in the photographs. There are 223 pages of \`book,' which include 285 photos. These photos range from small portrait shots, to two-page action photos. They include men from the most recent new-join, to the division commanders. In some cases, the production team managed to group photos taken at the same time into groupings, so that there are several shots of an event. What I truly appreciated was that most of the photos are captioned with not only a description of what is going on, but the names of the men in the photos! To me, that was a very nice touch.This book is destined to become a classic visual reference for GD. It is strengthened by the help of the \\"many dozens of veterans, archivists, collectors, and friends\\" that the authors acknowledge, who \\"gave unstintingly and ceaselessly of their time, their memories, and their resources.\\"I would recommend this book as definitely worth the investment."},{"Title":"GOD, HONOR, FATHERLAND: A Photo History of Panzergrenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\" on the Eastern Front 1942-1944","review":"This is an extremely well-done large format photo history of the GD division and it's going to stand up well through the years as the standard by which other books on the division will be judged. It's filled with photos from private collections that aren't seen everywhere else and it has numerous short bios on GD officers and NCO's that are very insightful. Can't recommend this one high enough, if you're into German WWII history, this is a \\"must-have\\" book."},{"Title":"GOD, HONOR, FATHERLAND: A Photo History of Panzergrenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\" on the Eastern Front 1942-1944","review":"Really a first class effort, as the other reviewers have stated. The vast majority of photos have not, I believe, been published previously, and the reproduction is crisp and clear. The very detailed captions are a real plus.For anyone with even a modest interest in the Heer of WWII, this is a must. My only,minor, complaint,is that it ends in 1944, but I surmise that good photos after that were few and far between. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"GOD, HONOR, FATHERLAND: A Photo History of Panzergrenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\" on the Eastern Front 1942-1944","review":"This book is everything you could want in a photo history type book. It has very crisp pictures, LOTS of photos I have never seen before anywhere else, a good balance between photos of personnel and equipment, and great supporting text. The book is also well organized, looking at the division's operations chronologically but also examining different subunits. The book also includes a number of short biographies of division personnel.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the German Army."},{"Title":"GOD, HONOR, FATHERLAND: A Photo History of Panzergrenadier Division \\"Grossdeutschland\\" on the Eastern Front 1942-1944","review":"I've had this book now for about five years and I have to say it's probably the best photo history of the German Army (whether single unit or campaign/theater focused) during WWII that I own, and I own dozens, if not well over a hundred at this point! The clarity and reproduction quality of most of the pictures is stunning, and the text and captions are actually very informative and well written. The layout is well done and attractive. I can't tell you how many times I've picked up this book and discovered another hidden detail that I missed before, whether of uniforms or equipment, or unit markings and insignia. I seem to learn something new every time I read or peruse it. Much better than the Helmut Spaeter/Schiffer GD photohistory, where the photo reproduction as well as selection is very poor.

Each chapter is explained thoroughly enough so that if you are truly a beginner opening Maya for the first time you will easily be able to follow instructions. The terminology used in the book is at a level where all can follow. He touched upon each aspect of Maya with enough detail to give a strong basis of understanding for the program. I especially like where he created a detailed model using primitives and simple modeling tools (i.e. catapult). He succesfully uses the same project to show several different concepts of 3D as you advance through the book."},{"Title":"Introducing Maya 5: 3D for Beginners","review":"I was mostly impressed with how Darisuh first breaks down the concepts around which 3d animation is based. With such a clear breakdown of the theory first, it makes the actual learning and manipulation of MAYA so much easier, especially for a 100% beginner like me. I never imagined that I would be doing 3d programming and animation, but Hey Mom - look at me now! Unlike most technical manuals, it is also very good reading, rather than a chore."},{"Title":"Introducing Maya 5: 3D for Beginners","review":"I have been a Graphic Designer for several years and have become very efficient at teaching myself new programs with well written books. Unfortunately, I have found this book to be a bit confusing. It seem as though topics are covered with small bits of pertinent information missing. I had to use the Quick Start guide to fill in the holes of this book so I could continue to use it. Maybe this book should be reworked then re-released. I think it has the beginnings of a good starter book but for now its a struggle."},{"Title":"Introducing Maya 5: 3D for Beginners","review":"Based on the title, I thought this book would be great for learning Maya through self-study. Unfortunately, it is not. It is one of the worst-written \\"how-to\\" computer books I have ever read (and I have read many, with experience in lots of programming languages).The book is weak both structurally and in the details. Structurally, the opening two chapters are all theory: the first main chapter is a full 30+ pages of introduction to the vast set of file menus of Maya, all with no concrete examples to work through! All this detailed discussion of the menus and buttons with no examples is essentially useless. It is always best to learn programming through detailed examples, so the opening salvo in the book is a pedagogical car crash.Even worse, once the book does start with examples (in Chapter 3), the instructions suffer as they leave out important details required to actually get the program to work (suggesting the book was written to be used in a classroom setting, where an instructor can tell you things left out of the book). For instance, you might be told to open a certain window that is embedded in multiple subdirectories but the book does not clearly describe how to get to the proper subdirectory. Not a good way to get started.Overall, a very unsatisfying experience, and I am on the lookout for a better book on Maya. This might be a good book for a class, but for self-study I do not recommend it. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the software that comes with the book is very useful (more useful than the book, in fact!)."},{"Title":"Introducing Maya 5: 3D for Beginners","review":"While I found everything in the book to be general okay in terms of the intruction, the chapter on Inverse Kinetics should be avoided AT ALL COST!!

Just kidding :)At any rate, do yourself a favor and don't try to learn Maya with this book."},{"Title":"Introducing Maya 5: 3D for Beginners","review":"Maya is a vastly complex and heavy software, whose mastery needs years of real-world experience. As a beginner who is simply &quot;playing&quot; with Maya as a hobby, I am obviously just having fun and have no professional aspirations with Maya. Regardless, I found this book to be well written, and a good introduction to Maya for the beginner -- whether professional or not.I have read many other books (of other subjects) that only list step after step of bland instructions with no room for self-initiative. This book's style is different in that it makes the reader think and work on his or her own and actually &quot;work&quot; the software to accomplish some portions of the excercises without repeated step-by-step instructions -- although this style may not work for some readers.I found the excercises to have a nice approach at teaching several fundamentals and tools together, for example the solar system excercise was a great way of showing the concepts of parenting and pivot points in one place. My engineering background helped me grasp some of Maya's concepts easier, but I still have difficulty with some other concepts and found myself repeating excercises or chapters. I think a few extra small excercises could also have helped.All in all, this is a great guide for the Maya beginner, I have recommended it to several friends who actually are in the creative art field."},{"Title":"Introducing Maya 5: 3D for Beginners","review":"This book is great. Maya is a beast of a program and just following instructions in a book will guide and teach you but it takes actual practice and thinking on your own to really learn and understand.

II)","review":"Walter Bagehot was the first editor of the now world-famous Economist magazine, which has in many ways remained faithful to the liberal philosophy (in a European sense)of its founder. Lombard Street might be difficult to read at first, but as with Charles Dickens once you get used to the style the tale is riveting. And his advice on how a central bank, as the lender of last resort, should behave in the face of a banking crisis remains valid to this day."},{"Title":"Lombard Street: A description of the money market (The Paternoster library ; vol. II)","review":"Can a book about finance written in 1873 be helpful in a world with complex financial markets and plenty of information about how they work? The answer is yes. It is not that \\"Lombard Street\\" is a classic that one finds quoted many a time; the reader's interest should transcend historical inquiry or curiosity; \\"Lombard Street\\" should be read and revered by anyone interested in the underlying, abiding features of financial markets.But what are those characteristics? Bagehot, then editor of The Economist, writes that credit centers on trust: \\"Credit means that a certain confidence is given, a certain trust reposed.\\" And, banks always have on-demand liabilities that far exceed their readily available assets. In short, credit works on trust, and the system, in the absence of trust, can fall apart rapidly.What follows from these premises is a careful examination of how the money market came about, what its uses are, how its operations are connected to trade and country's overall welfare, and, most importantly, how central banks can deal with financial crises. Written elegantly, \\"Lombard Street\\" is, at the same time, an introductory overview of the market and a trenchant analysis of its most salient features.But what makes \\"Lombard Street\\" timeless is that it deals with finance in its human form. Bagehot talks about power, prestige and perception as much as he does about interest, discount, and credit. Trust is based on institutions and people: the human features of finance-trust, anxiety, mania, optimism-are timeless and apply to the financial markets of the nineteenth, twentieth, or twenty-first century. That is why \\"Lombard Street\\" is an ever useful introduction and guide."},{"Title":"Lombard Street: A description of the money market (The Paternoster library ; vol. II)","review":"Wiley Investment Classics generally fall into two categories, tough and dreary reads full of information, and lively entertaining accounts which also educate. Unfortunately, Mr. Bagehot and Mr. Bernstein's text is the former. The book does an outstanding job of promoting the importance of a strong central banking system and the importance of strict credit control when combating financial crises. However, it does so amidst extremely repetitive and somewhat painful language. The authors provide outstanding quantitative and anecdotal evidence supporting their case, but they do so in such a way that makes the book a true labor to read.This book would be very beneficial to anyone doing research on, or working for some kind of central banking organization. Otherwise, I would suggest looking to any of the other Wiley Investment Classics for a more interesting and educational read about finance."},{"Title":"Lombard Street: A description of the money market (The Paternoster library ; vol.

But I have to wince at the terrible job Echo Library did in printing it.It's full of obvious missing spaces so that words run together, likethesewords.This happens on almost every page. The author, Walter Bagehot, includes some actual balance sheets from the Bank of England as examples. Yet Echo Library fails to align the figures into columns. Instead it appears as a bunch of jibberish.It appears that Echo Library somehow acquired a text file of the book, perhaps as a Word document or something, and then simply output that onto paper and binder, and then shipped the books, without even glancing at the results, let alone proof reading it.Also, apparently to save paper, the publisher made the type size a bit small, and made the page column a bit wide. That saves paper alright, and makes it a thinner book, but it makes it harder to read. But it's still worth reading because Bagehot is so good.MY RECOMMENDATION: It's an excellent writing by Bagehot, first class.

She fills her entire day working double shifts and more handling freight for Baird Airlines.Her life changes again when her boss hires someone to work the second shift. Kate recognizes the new employee as State Trooper Jim Chopin, who is working undercover for the FBI. He is looking for the plutonium that the Russian Mafia has apparently smuggled into the area. When Jim is hospitalized with a bullet wound, Kate takes over the investigation.The star of a Kate Shugat novel is usually Alaska, but in MIDNIGHT COME AGAIN the emotionally raw lead protagonist takes center stage. Kate is in transition as she grieves her loss while struggling to learn how to live life without her heart. Dana Stabenow serves up a fascinating and emotionally moving story line that keeps the reader's interest from first page to last. Fans of unpredictable, event-laden tales with plenty of regional color will gain much pleasure from Ms. Stabenow's latest achievement.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Midnight Come Again (Kate Shugak Mysteries)","review":"After reading Hunter's Moon, I went back and bought all of Dana's previous Kate Shugak books, as well as those in Dana's Liam Campbell series. I got up-to-date only a couple of months before Midnight Come Again. Dana has come through again with another great story about Alaska and some very interesting and sometimes (in the cases of the &quot;good guys&quot;) endearing charcaters. If you haven't read Dana's books, give them a try -- but be forewarned -- you, too, could become hooked on her wonderful books. (PS: I'd like to marry Kate Shugak, but I'm not sure I could keep up with her.) (PSS: Thanks, Dana, for the email recommendation for the bar near the Anchorage airport where you can sit and watch sea planes land and take off -- I'm coming back to AK in August and plan to go there again.)"},{"Title":"Midnight Come Again (Kate Shugak Mysteries)","review":"I cried at the end of Hunter's Moon so I impatiently waited the release of her new book. Kate hid herself very well, but Chopper, Jim Chopin finds her by accident and the sparks fly. Involvement in a new mystery helps her regain her old self and to start to put her past tradegy behind her. We are also introduced to new characters, which we are sure to read about in the future. Also, there is a physical attraction between Jim and Kate which neither one is willing to accept. Finding the killers, fighting her feelings for Jim, believing herself reasponsible for her friends death, comforting her friend's daughter,and uncovering the reason for the murders has Kate slowly emerging from existing to living. The ending is as riveting as all the others have been. The next book I'm sure,will be as excellent as the one's preceding Midnight Come Again."},{"Title":"Midnight Come Again (Kate Shugak Mysteries)","review":"I didn't think I would be very interested in a story concerning the Russian Mafia, but Stabenow changed my mind. Although I missed reading about the folks back in Niniltna, the introduction to the people of Bering was a true joy. Jim Chopin has a prominent role here and the insights into his character are very reveling. I also enjoyed a surprising revelation concerning Kate's grandmother, Ekaterina. The descriptions of Kate's dog, Mutt (one of my favorite characters) are, as always, vivid and alive. A word of warning: if you are a big fan of the FBI, you should know that the two FBI agents in this story are not portrayed in a very favorable light. I have read all of Stabenow's previous Kate Shugak mysteries, so it was easy for me to pick up where the story left off last time, but this probably isn't where a reader new to the series should begin. For a true understanding of Kate, it would be best to start at the beginning (A Cold Day For Murder). It was easy getting into this story and it held my attention throughout. The ending was spectacular."},{"Title":"Midnight Come Again (Kate Shugak Mysteries)","review":"Kate Shugak is missing. The gutsy, female, Aleut PI is trying to recover from the death of her soulmate, Jack. She runs away to Bering where she joins the ground crew of a small airline. Jim Chopin, a state trooper who has worked on several cases with Kate, is asked to find her and to uncover a Russian smuggler who is operating in Alaska. In one of those wonderful coincidences which only happen in novels, Jim finds both Kate and the Russian. Kate is in a state of apathy, but finally her investigative instincts rise to the surface and she begins to check into a scheme which seems to connect the Russians with a local banker and a local politician. As always, this book has the splendor of Alaska as a background. It's interesting to read the first part of the book through Chopper Jim's eyes and to see his character developed a bit more."},{"Title":"Midnight Come Again (Kate Shugak Mysteries)","review":"Ms. Stabenow has had quite a run of books over the past several years and does not seem to be letting up, neither in quantity or quality. The book being reviewed here is number nine in the Kate Shugak Novels and is certainly one of her best offerings so far. (At this writing, I believe she is up to number 15 in this particular series). When I say it is one of her best offerings, reader do be aware that the author deviates somewhat from her game plan that we have become accustom to. In this novel, our heroine, Kate Shugak, is living and working in Bering, Alaska and the story is told more though the experiences of State Trooper, Jim Chopin than through the eyes and thoughts of Kate. This, in my opinion, is a neat twist, but many may be less than happy. One of the things most people look for in a continuing series such as this is consistency, and are sort of put out about it when the author deviates from there normal mode. I must admit to having been a bit put off by it myself when I first started the book, but got over that quickly as the story developed. In many ways, this is the most powerful book in the series so far.Readers should also be warned that if this is the first book in this series you read, then you will be a bit lost here and there as to how everyone got where they are and why. That does not mean that this is a work that cannot stand alone...it certainly can, but the reading of this story will be greatly enhances by having some knowledge of past novels featuring these characters.Kate and her dog Mutt have disappeared from the homestead; Kate's refuge during troubled times. No one knows where she is and Jim Chopin begins his search. Long story short, as I do not want to include any spoilers here, is that he finds her working for an air cargo company deep in the Alaskan wilderness; on an island on the Western Coast. He has been assigned an undercover job there investigating members of the Russian Mafia and their apparent attempts to smuggle and sell material for the making of radio-active devices. He and Kate, also working under a false name to simply hide herself, become fellow workers at the Air Service and of course deeply embroiled in the mystery at hand...dangerous work!The plot here is not what drives this particular story. This is a very emotional tale, as Kate is in the process of healing after loosing her long time lover Jack. She is not the same Kate as we know from previous works (I will tell you though, that the old Kate is still there; lurking deep maybe at times, but still most certainly there).The evil guys, and they are indeed evil, are more or less provided simply to act as instruments to hang Kate's story on, and to let us get to know the character of the womanizing and \\"rounder,\\" Jim Chopin. I will tell you that their relationship deepens and is actually quite complex.I enjoy these books because of the characters Dana Stabenow has provided us over the years; the least not being Kate's dog. The author's descriptive abilities are quite keen and there is no doubt that she knows her Alaska from top to bottom. Reading her descriptive prose absolutely puts you there...where she, the author is writing about on any given page. I like that. I also enjoy and learn from her description of Native American customs of the region...a truly fascinating people.Emotional turmoil, extreme danger, exciting action, a goodly romance, great background descriptions, and an ending that....Ooops! No spoilers here...sorry. What more could you want?This is an excellent addition to an already excellent and classic series. Female P.I.s have become more common now, but few can equal Kate Shugak. Now this series, like any other in this particular genre, are a matter of taste. I would suggest that you read a couple of the previous offerings in this series before judgment is passed. Personally, I like them; they fit my reading needs perfectly. That of course is not to say that everyone will feel the same way. That's what is so nice about having such a wonderful and numerous varieties of reads to choose from!Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Midnight Come Again (Kate Shugak Mysteries)","review":"After one of the most disappointing books in the series, Ms. Stabenow comes up with a suspenseful and enjoyable read in Midnight Come Again. Away from the bush and Kate's home, she is healing the wounds of losing Jack, only to find herself running the assault on a smuggling &quot;syndicate&quot;. Kate once again comes out on top. Good story, if it is getting to be a bit too predictable."},{"Title":"Midnight Come Again (Kate Shugak Mysteries)","review":"After the tragic events of Hunter's Moon, Alaskan PI Kate Shugak disappears from the Park and Jim Chopin sets out to find her. The question for readers of the Kate Shugak series isn't so much WHERE is Kate, but HOW is she? Chopper Jim finds her hiding out in Bering, nursing her wounds - both figurative and literal.Ultimately this book is about grief and survival, and surviving grief. It has huge doses of Stabenow's unique blend of cinematic action to keep you on the edge of your seat instead of reaching for the nearest box of Kleenex. Though the reader could use a couple of tissues, too. Highly recommended, and yes, you should definitely read Hunter's Moon before you read this one."},{"Title":"Midnight Come Again (Kate Shugak Mysteries)","review":"I discovered Dana Stabenow & her Kate Shugat series in August, only a few months ago. In that short time, I have read up to #12, Fine & Bitter Snow. I love this series and have recommended it several times, including to my sister, who just visited Alaska (my dream trip). Let me say this, Midnight Come Again (#10) was one of my favorites. To fully appreciate it, though, I suspect that the series is better in order and in its entirety. To the other reviewers who found the character development lacking, you would have had no trouble understanding the simmering & pent-up emotions if you had read #1 thru 9! Many authors write detective series into which you can jump at any time. Dana Stabenow tries to recap and catch up a new reader but the depth of knowledge obtained from starting from the beginning is invaluable. You will then understand how I can be plowing through the Kate Shugak books in record time and am anxiously anticipating the remainder and the #18, Though Not Dead, promised for Feb 2011."},{"Title":"Midnight Come Again (Kate Shugak Mysteries)","review":"Stabenow has given us another amazing Kate Shugak mystery. She takes us this time to the southwest coast of AK where Kate has exiled herself from her home turf after a devastating personal loss.Stabenow is an artist with words. She draws you into her characters and their lives as though you are there living and experiencing right along with them. She makes you see, hear and feel Alaska, its animals and people.One of my absolute favorite authors. Stabenow never disappoints."},{"Title":"Midnight Come Again (Kate Shugak Mysteries)","review":"Far away from kith and kin, Kate Shugak is holed up in Bering with a false identity and a broken heart. No spoilers as to why: Midnight Come Again serves as a flawless continuation of the horrifying Singing of the Dead, and I have no wish to spoil the former in order to praise the latter.Suffice to say that Kate has survived--but barely. She is sick at heart, sick in her soul, and so unlike herself that Chopper Jim, who is ostensibly on an undercover mission but really searching for his old and dear friend, is horrified when he finally meets up with her again.It is Jim's undercover mission, however clandestine he tries to keep it, that sparks the first modicum of interest in Kate since the unspeakable events the year before. As she and her trusty sidekick Mutt (who thankfully has survived as well) get embroiled in the doings of Russian Mafia members who may be hiding a stolen cache of plutonium, she seems to come back to life, slowly but surely.Along the way are a pair of bumbling FBI agents who are sure that Kate is among the bad guys; and from afar, the call of Kate's nearest and dearest, all of whom pull her back to the world of the living.A superb entry in the series!"},{"Title":"Midnight Come Again (Kate Shugak Mysteries)","review":"I cried at the end of Hunter's Moon and couldn't wait for the next book.

Together, they shoot off sparks which I hope to see more of in later books."},{"Title":"Midnight Come Again (Kate Shugak Mysteries)","review":"Terribly disappointing that she has left the area of Alaska that readers have come to enjoy reading about. I feel that I not only lost a character I had become fond of as well as a relationship that was interesting, but the entire region as well! And the mafia is a predictable, much less interesting twist than the local people/characters that I had come to look forward to reading about. Kate is just not as appealing anymore.

The Alaska Geographic Society type information is very interesting. Generally, there wasn't a problem &quot;jumping in mid-stream&quot; in this series - the author does a pretty good job of providing background information for the new reader except that I didn't &quot;get&quot; the ending. Did I miss something?

She seems completely disinterested in her friends, family, or extending professional courtesy to others in law enforcement, but that's only because she's deeply scarred.This was my first (and last) Dana Stabenow novel. The plot about Russian mafioso was simplistic and mundane. The characters were one dimensional and unsympathetic. And, did you know that FBI agents and local police sometimes really don't get along very well? The bulk of the novel was devoted to setting up the characters of Chopin and Shugak, leaving little time to develop a compelling conclusion to the crime story, and yet never left me with the impression that I knew anything at all about the two main characters. If you like mysteries that are well written page turners, you're better off with early Sue Grafton, Elizabeth George, Martha Grimes, or S.J. Rozan."},{"Title":"Midnight Come Again (Kate Shugak Mysteries)","review":"As usual this is a good book but only rated it three stars as there isstill to much sex/violence. Please, please dear author let Kate getthrough one book without getting beat up. These are great stories butsure could use some more mystery in them instead.

He puts things in a broad historical and cultural context to give a real sense of how and why the neighborhoods of Brooklyn evolved. Few books of this kind even attempt to do that, let alone do it well. The book is well written, with many astute observations, and often very funny."},{"Title":"An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn","review":"I just bought this book and I absolutely love it. It's a treasure that I'm sure I'll take with me on many a weekend walk around Brooklyn. True to the title, this is an excellent guidebook to Brooklyn, but it's much more than this. It includes lots of historical and cultural information about the buildings, political figures and architects connected to the various neighborhoods and buildings that Morrone describes. Obviously the author feels the same love for the borough that many Brooklynites share, and this comes through in the affectionate and informative details he relates. The layout is very reader-friendly as well, and the photos (though black and white) capture many of the most noteworthy buildings. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in city architecture and history."},{"Title":"An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn","review":"An elegant writer and gifted independent scholar, Francis Morrone has done his adopted home proud in An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn. With sharp descriptions and apposite facts, Morrone conveys both the complexity and vibrancy of one of New York City's largest boroughs. Readers may well disagree with a few of his assured opinions but what use is a guidebook without a point of view? Morrone's perceptive comments, illustrated by James Iska's graceful photographs, make An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn a boon for both the Brooklyn visitor and the armchair New York fan alike."},{"Title":"An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn","review":"Rare is the architectural guidebook that merges intricate depictions of the masterpieces with compelling tales about how they came to be. Yet that is precisely what Mr. Morrone has accomplished with this tome, which shows off a borough he clearly loves to great effect. This is a book you can, and should, hold in your hands as you walk through the neighborhoods Mr. Morrone has chosen to include. He made me love Brooklyn even more than I thought possible, and made me wish I lived both in this era and some many years ago, when the many buildings and neighborhoods he describes were coming into being. A must-have book for anyone who intends to look at the buildings of Brooklyn, whether for scholarly pursuits or for pure weekend pleasure."},{"Title":"An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn","review":"Everything in this book is 100% correct: Mr Morrone is doubtless a perfectionist in his research and I mean that as a compliment. You want to know the history of a building, an area in Brooklyn or an architect, this book is the ne plus ultra.I give it 3 stars because his writing style is a tad heavy. It reminds me of Frasier Crane, he of the tv show &quot;Frasier&quot;.But it is good enough to merit a double purchase: One you keep at home and the second you rip out pages at a time as you work your way through the various sections/chapters in Brooklyn. I am never in favor of destroying books, but given the size of this tome, buying two and giving one of them a good going over in the streets of Brooklyn is entirely acceptable."},{"Title":"An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn","review":"If you know of or live in Brooklyn, this is a bible on the structure of this great borough!"},{"Title":"An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn","review":"Francis Morrone's new book on the architecture of Brooklyn proves once again that he is not just a masterful prose stylist, he is a uniquely high-spirited urbanist of wide-ranging tastes, keen architectural discrimination and infectious enthusiasms. At every page I wanted to jump up and rush out to Brooklyn to walk up and down the streets with *An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn* in hand, sharing Francis Morrone's delight in Brooklyn's wonderful, and even its less wonderful, buildings. A popular lecturer on New York City history at NYU, and long-time principal guide for the Municipal Art Society of New York, Morrone does not merely describe the architecture of his own borough, Brooklyn, he savors it, he uncovers it--many Brooklyn treasures have never been described in print before this book--and he loves it. He knows the fascinating histories of the buildings and their owners, he knows his architecture, he looks not just at the buildings but at the neighborhoods and the whole borough. He has read deeply, he has walked the streets of the borough many times, and his research has even taken him to the best web sites. A wonderful, richly detailed, helpfully illustrated book for every urbanist, architecture fan, history buff and, indeed, for every reader. If you love cities, architecture and good writing, read this book!"},{"Title":"NMS Clinical Manual of Anesthesia","review":"I loved this book!

You will be able to answer questions from the attending, and ask even better ones! It is concise, easy to read, and very high-yield. To add to it, it fits in the back pocket of your scrubs.The word on the street among Harvard Med students is that there are two textbooks that every med student should have and read cover-to-cover: Weinberg \\"Pulmonology\\" and Lilly's cardiovascular text.

It was nothing like the great English teen chick-lit I've read (Louise Rennison is amazing, and even Cathy Hopkins is excellent compared to this). The main character, Angel, is overweight, and wants to be skinnier. Sounds like \\"Girls Under Pressure\\" and Ellie's dilemma. Her friends are perfect to her... the way Ellie views her friends in the \\"Girls\\" Trilogy (now a quartet, I believe) and the way Lucy views her friends in the \\"Mates, Dates and...\\" series. Her friend Minnie is amazing at designing clothing. I'm drawing a blank to the exact character, but it's one of the girls from either \\"Girls\\" or \\"Mates, Dates, and...\\" I think it might be Lucy from \\"M, D, a...\\" But still it's a boring read, and I suggest you move on to something more worthwhile!"},{"Title":"From the Outside Looking in: Short Stories for Lds Teenagers","review":"For those of you that don't enjoy ploughing through those long books, this one's the one for you!

Now, I occasionally go back and reread or read new Nancy Drew books. When I read this one, it was the first time I had ever read it. It captures your attention, and you won't be able to put it down or stop turning pages. The endings of the chapters are suspenseful, and you'll want to read the next chapter to see what happens. Although it sometimes seemed like there was way too much going on at the same time, making just a little hard to read and understand, I found the characters to be realistic, although I had a few questions after finishing. I won't say because it will give everything away.One of Nancy's best friends, Bess Marvin, has just acquired Casey, a young golden retriever that she is training to be a guide dog. She got her at Candlelight Inn, an old, slightly spooky inn that was donated to the Guiding Eyes by Emmaline Whitby, a blind woman. Her granddaughter, Marisa, is currently Devon Marshall, Bess's neighbor's, girlfriend. Even though Marisa is blind and uses a guide dog, she is still friendly and finds ways to get around using Misty, Marisa's golden retriever guide dog. But there's also mystery around their hometown of River Heights.Counterfeit money is being passed around Nancy, Bess, and George's town of River Heights, and the three best friends are shocked to find out that Eric Pavlik, one of Marisa's friends, was caught passing a counterfeit bill, which mysteriously is dated to twenty-five years ago---back when there was another counterfeiting ring. Standing up for Eric along with her friends, Bess is almost arrested when she hands in a dollar bill, as Casey ate one, and the bill turns out to be counterfeit. Even worse, the bill is Marisa's. Marisa and Nancy have been receiving multiple threats to stop, too. But Nancy won't give up a case!Suspenseful and fun.Sammy D."},{"Title":"The Secret Of Candlelight Inn","review":"I liked the book a lot, every chapter left you wanting to read more and more.

The reason: the layout of the material is terrible, page after page after page. It seems, that if an item could be fitted on the page is was slapped on the page. Completely amateur layout. I paid full price as I ordered it unseen. Big mistake.Clearly the authors were so confident of the content they wished to publish they let someone help them overlook that the good content is literally buried in a messy layout.This is terribly unfortunate, as we need at this critical time in U. S. history, a clear and readable presentation of the imaginary figures and contrived history by a brilliant sociopathic sexual predator who obviously believed that religious freedom in the U. S. meant anything goes...religiously.Of course, when the 'prophet' marched his militia around Nauvoo this scared the pants off of Baptist, Methodists, etc who were onlookers. So they took dreadful action.Had the 'prophet' lived we might have even seen these people giving their 'children up to Moloch.'This is astonishly being done today, in a metaphorical sense, with little girls in jack-Mormon colonies in the Western United States. We are killing Taliban, in part, around the world for mistreatment of women but allowing incredible things happen to young females in our own country. Did you, America, you criminals and thugs, not see what happened in Texas?In all of human history, not just U.S. history, the LDS is a near perfect blend of raw human imagination, gross libido and utterly fantastic musings that became a non-Christian religion that has finally stopped growing both in the U.S. and worldwide!The authors failed in their mission to present the astonishing contrasts between the LDS and basic streams of Christian thought and practice. They failed because their presentation was so messy and amateur, making for an almost unreadable and cluttered document."},{"Title":"Understanding Mormonism: Mormonism and Christianity compared : a derivative work","review":"I was LDS for 25 years!!!

This book is written in such a way that the authors try to convince the reader that everything they say is said with love, but you cannot call a good and righteous people and faith evil and have it come across as love. Unfortunatly, these authors, once mebers of the church, bought into satan's (the world's) lies about the church, and abandoned their faith.

Cain: less of a detective story or murder mystery than a hard-as-nails action novel, Hansen's prose is clean, unsentimental, detailed, occasionally witty, and somewhat bitter. The hero of the piece is a bit unusual, for Hansen's David Brandstetter is a gay man. Some readers may be put off by this, but it will be their loss, for it gives the novel an edge of interest too often lacking in the genre, and even the most demanding reader will have no complaint with the fast-paced, action-laced, and very gritty story.

This book is based on a series of lectures delivered by Bury at Cambridge University. He begins with a description of German life in the forests outside the Empire and then tells how population pressures and migrations eventually ruptured the border of the Roman Empire, letting in tribe after tribe of German warriors.They came as federates, seldom thinking of themselves as conquerors, seeking to partake of the goodness of Roman civilization, not destroy it. Seen in this light, the Western Empire didn't so much fall as fade away under the successive waves of migrating tribes.Most history books date the fall of the Western Empire from the date on which Odovacer deposed the last Western Emperor, Romulus Augustulus. Bury makes the point that Odovacer and his successors, the Ostrogoths, recognized the authority of the Eastern Emperor. It wasn't until the Lombard invasion that a completely independent German state was set up in Italy.My misconception always was that the Germans were pagan invaders. The major tribes of the invasion were all Christians. They weren't Catholic, they subscribed to the heretical doctrine of Arianism. Bury makes a compelling case that the Ostrogothic kingdom's short existence was caused by the fact that Italy was largely Catholic and hostile to their heretical overlords.It is interesting that the first lasting Germanic kingdom was established by the Frankish king, Clovis, who converted to Catholicism. Bury makes the case that Clovis converted to Catholicism, not because of a battlefield prayer for victory and a sign from heaven, but because of a calculated decision of statecraft by a shrewd politician. Clovis correctly discerned that his rule would be more lasting if he adopted the religion of most of his subjects.A compelling chronicle of a turbulent time peopled with remarkable protagonists. And it is told in masterful fashion. The only shortcoming of the book is the absence of maps. The reader can easily get lost in the arcane geographical references."},{"Title":"The Invasion of Europe By the Barbarians","review":"This is an excellent book that goes into great detail of how the barbarians went into the Roman Empire.

It goes into great detail about many of the different barbarian groups. For example, it discusses the Visigoths, the Ostragoths, the Lombards, the Huns, Gepids, and many more. In conclusion, the book shows the side of the barbarians. Too often the barbarians are looked at from the Roman side because that is where most historians get the records from. However, J. B. Bury takes it from the Barbarian side and shows why they wanted to come into the Roman Empire. They really didn't want to destroy it, they just wanted a better way of living.

I found this book to be an easy read; the lectures have been conveniently divided into sub-categories, making it even easier to understand the main points of each chapter.

D. 247 until the fifth century. From the historical perspective, of importance is the insistence of the author on the gradual encroachment of Barbarism upon Romanism during this period. The author, Professor Bury, was appointed (in 1902) successor to Lord Acton as holder of the Chair of Modern History at the University of Cambridge. A reputed scholar, he is well known for his illustrated edition of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1909) as well as his own seminal works Constitution of the Later Roman Empire (1910) and History of the Roman Empire (1923).Not envisioned by Bury originally as a book, this is an ensemble of lectures given by him at the University (and edited by Professor Hearnshaw, from King's College at the University of London). This vivid excursion through the \\"barbarization\\" of the Empire, starts with a reference to the early German history and Gothic migrations. Then an account of the first invasions of the Goths in the third century follows, with a description of the Visigothic invasion of Dacia and the Ostrogothic settlements. According to Bury it is during the third century that the extension and heterogeneity of the Roman Empire led to a natural tendency of the parts of this huge empire to fall asunder. Two great subdivisions appeared- a western or Latin section and an eastern or Greek section. The emperor Diocletian was convinced that the empire was too extended to be ruled by one emperor and so he concocted a scheme to put it under two coequal emperors. This system was unsuccessful and it was abandoned after 150 years by Constantine. But it led to the decisive act of the foundation of a second Rome at Constantinople in A.D. 330. Bury presents an interesting overview of the much discussed issue of the size of the forces of the empire and of the barbarians during this period, as well as the general factors of the penetration of the Germanic element in the population of the empire. The advent of the Huns is a momentous event, because it forced the Visigoths into roman space, leading thereafter to the disastrous battle of Hadrianopole (well described by Ammianus Marcellinus) and the death of emperor Valens. From there, we follow the efforts of emperor Theodosius to deal with the Gothic problem pursuing a policy of conciliation and friendship with Alaric the Bold.But at the death of Theodosius, Alaric, then elected king of the Visigoths turned against the empire. And he turned to the West, in events that led to the sack of Rome and the invasion of Gaul. And so professor Bury's refreshing narration takes us to the following episodes of this dramatic saga: The death of Alaricus; the Visigothic Kingdom of Toulouse; the invasion of the Vandals in Spain and in Africa; the Anglo-Saxon conquest of Britain; the Hunnic invasion of Italy; the decline of the roman power in the west; the Ostrogothic conquest of Italy; and the Lombard invasion of Italy.For its freshness and clarity, this book is highly recommended as a first approach to the study of the complex structural problems that led to the dissolution of the great Roman Empire."},{"Title":"The Invasion of Europe By the Barbarians","review":"This transcription of lectures dates from 1927 yet it still shows up on Norman Cantor's &quot;Core Bibliography in Medieval Studies&quot; (Inventing the Middle Ages, p. 443). There is good reason to continue to include it among a list of works generally of much more recent vintage.Lucid and engaging, Bury presents a convincing case for the idea that the Roman Empire in the West did not &quot;fall&quot; but rather transformed through assimilation of the various Germanic tribes. Bury's description of the extent to which the &quot;barbarians&quot; strove to work within the empire and co-existed with remnants of Roman society are of particular interest.Good companions to this work are &quot;Before France &amp; Germany&quot; (Geary) and &quot;The World of Late Antiquity&quot; (Peter Brown)."},{"Title":"The Invasion of Europe By the Barbarians","review":"This book is a collection of 15 fascinating lectures given over 100 years ago by University of Cambridge professor J. B. Bury concerning the invasion of the Roman Empire during the third through the sixth century by various tribes from in and around Europe. Historians consider this book a classic work on the topic.Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the story is that the fall of the Roman Empire did not occur by military conquest as I had always assumed, but instead mostly by the gradual assimilation of various barbarian tribes into the empire itself. As these tribes became more independent, the empire gradually disintegrated.Bury tells how the various Germanic tribes, such as the Goths, Visigoths, and Ostrogoths, concentrated in settlements along the Northern border of the empire. The empire allowed members of these tribes to join its military forces, which they came to dominate led by their German leaders in service of Rome.The effect on the Roman Empire of other groups, such as the Huns, Vandals, Franks and Lombards, through invasion and otherwise are also part of the interesting story. The roles of key leaders of these tribes, such as Alaric the Visigoth, Attila the Hun, Theoderic the Ostrogoth, and Clovis the Frank, are woven into the narrative.Despite covering several centuries and the events across the full expanse of Europe, Bury's concise and lucid presentation holds the reader's interest. The one major drawback is that although he refers to hundreds of places, using both historical and modern names for them, there is not a single map in the book. Unless you have a pretty good mental map of Europe over the past two millenia, you are either going to need to go find maps or you will simply be skimming over the names of many places without a clear idea of their location. To me, including maps would have made this book a five star experience. Maybe the editors will come to their senses in the next edition."},{"Title":"The Invasion of Europe By the Barbarians","review":"Bury takes a unique perspective in this work. He describes how the early Germanic peoples migrated, and later penetrated into the confines of the Roman Empire; likewise, he focuses on the flood of Asiatic barbarians as well. Bury does an excellent job portraying the motives of the Barbarians, and how they ended up contributing to the formation of modern Europe. The epic un-barbarianization, rather than the deterioration of the Empire, is the crux of this work. This book is complete,concise, and very time saving for busy students...highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Invasion of Europe By the Barbarians","review":"_The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians_ by J. B. Bury is a very readable and well written book that outlines the sequence and consequences of the migratory movements of the northern barbarians into Roman territory, migrations of the third through sixth centuries AD that eventually lead to Germanic peoples occupying the western half of the Roman Empire, from Britain to North Africa and ultimately largely dismembering the Empire.It would be difficult for one to guess how old this work is from reading it; the book was basically a compilation of lectures Bury gave on the subject originally in 1903 (Bury himself passed away in 1927). The book read quite well for the most part as it had a brisk pace and the author a rather dry wit. My only complaints are that the final sections delved too much into what were for me the esoteric nature of Roman versus Lombard law (not as interesting or as useful to me at least as his coverage of the migrations and their consequences) as well as the complete lack of maps.One of Bury's main themes was that the barbarians became a threat from inside the Empire's borders - what he called disintegration from within - as various Germanic peoples became federates of the Empire, invited to settle within its boundaries and in return generally for some form of tribute protected the frontiers and supplied contingents of troops. Nearly all the German peoples were for a time federates of the Empire before becoming independent masters of the lands they seized. Sometimes the rulers of the various tribes worked closely with the Emperor, at other times they were actually kings of their people and only nominally within the Empire. A system of establishing federate states within the Empire paved the way for the system of independent states that eventually replaced the Empire, a process that though not without conflict was also not cataclysmic either.The Germanic federati became quite important in part because as Bury wrote the population of the old civilized lands around the Mediterranean had become \\"too highly civilized, and not physically fit enough\\" and thus were \\"quite useless for military service.\\" The bulk of the army came from frontier provinces and from adventurers, many of which were barbarian volunteers from outside the Empire. Before Germanization of the lands under the federates began a dangerous Germanization was underway in the military (a military which was increasingly important, particularly in the West), a Germanization he called a \\"peaceful penetration,\\" as by the end of the fourth century Germans had largely replaced most of the peoples from within the Empire and due to their ability had risen to hold the highest officer posts as well. This \\"grave danger\\" was overlooked by too many Emperors, too liberal in their policies in allowing Germans to occupy positions of supreme command due to their desire to attract the best men for the job. Eventually when the Empire had to face not only the threat of Germanic invaders from without but from the Germanic peoples already within the Empire military leadership fell predictably to Germans. Two of the chief actors of the fifth century for instance - the enemy leader Alaric and the Roman military leader Stilicho - were both German.The traditional end given for the Western Roman Empire (AD 476) is addressed by Bury and in a manner supporting some of his key points. First, he said \\"Western Empire\\" is improper; it was the western provinces of the Empire, as there was really only one Empire. Second, on several occasions in the fifth century the death or deposition of an emperor in the west was followed by a considerable span of time with no emperor in Rome or Ravenna. Third, the rule of the Germans Odovacar and later that of Theoderic the Ostrogoth in Italy was not at all unlike that of other federates leaders; they acted with some coordination with the Emperor in Constantinople and both leaders respected Roman laws with regard to their Roman subjects; they were but intermediary stages between Italy being part of the Roman Empire and being a true Germanic kingdom.Bury spent some time analyzing the populations of the Germanic peoples during the migrations and comparing military sizes with that of the Romans, noting that from the fourth to the sixth centuries most battles were fought by roughly even numbers of troops; the problem of military defense was not all hopeless or even \\"superlatively difficult,\\" and it was not through battle alone that the Empire was dismembered.For their part the Germans did not feel like hostile invaders, but rather regarded the Empire as a great institution that they had a rightful place within, their struggles less that of hostile external enemies but more a disenfranchised segment of society struggling for its rights. Alaric marched through Italy and attacked Rome not to destroy the Empire but to put pressure upon the imperial government to meet his various demands.An interesting thread was the real legacy of the Huns. The Huns defeat of the Visigoths lead the latter to seek the shelter of the Roman Empire, an unprecedented decision as Emperor Valens permitted a nation of 80,000+ people to settle within his borders, allowing in essentially a foreign nation of a warlike nature and with strong national unity, a situation that eventually resulted in a war, culminating in the battle of Hadrianople in AD 378, one of the greatest disasters that befell Rome due to the Germans (and by the way the last battle the Romans fought mainly with infantry, as cavalry prevailed as a result and Europe did not see much infantry use again until the fourteenth century). Also the Hun invasion served to delay the process of German dismemberment of the Empire, both by the Huns controlling many of the East German peoples beyond the Danube (the ones most a threat to Rome) and by providing Roman generals with auxiliaries that proved an invaluable resource against their German enemies."},{"Title":"The Invasion of Europe By the Barbarians","review":"One of the earlier reviewers of this book expressed surprise that J.B. Bury delivered the lectures on which it is based after being appointed Professor of Modern History. This was not a personal whim. British institutional usage (that is, what was done at Oxford and Cambridge) had long divided time between \\"Classical\\" and \\"Modern.\\" Until well into the twentieth century, medievalists held the \\"Modern History\\" chairs. Bury was doing what was expected of him. And very well, I might add.Despite dating from the 1920s, Bury is an excellent place to start, but the fact that these are essentially lectures limits their usefulness. Those seriously interested in more up-to-date information on the period might turn to Peter Heather's \\"The Goths,\\" and continue with the elaborately documented consideration of the evidence in Herwig Wolfram's \\"History of the Goths\\" (translated from the German). The differences between those two books will illuminate how much that Bury could take for granted is now open to debate. Peter Llewellyn's \\"Rome in the Dark Ages\\" is easier reading, and concentrates on a single region, but the invaders are incidental players in his narrative.(Reposted from my \\"anonymous\\" review of September 11, 2003)"},{"Title":"The Invasion of Europe By the Barbarians","review":"I remember looking at an historical atlas as a kid, transfixed by the dizzying criss-cross of arrows puporting to illustrate (and clarify?) the movements of the various \\"barbarian\\" tribes that overran the Western Roman Empire over the fourth and fifth centuries. I was utterly perplexed and mesmerized. It seemed an indecipherable jumble and I really couldn't make heads or tails of it, but I was hooked. The fascination has never left me.Now I have had the inexpressible pleasure of reading J. B. Bury's marvelous book on the subject. As an introduction to a confused and confusing period, this collection of lectures nearly as old as the subject they address (just kidding--but they were written and delivered before the Great Depression) is a model of restraint, erudition, and clarity. More than 80 years later, it still sets the standard. Bury, better known as a classicist, may have raised eyebrows when he presented these as \\"modern\\" history, but who cares what you call it--this is some of the best history writing you'll find.The style is wonderfully relaxed--remember, these were originally lectures--and the information is broken out into delightfully brief chapters that can easily be read in a short lull between life's innumerable other pressing demands. This is NOT heavy going, ever. Bury's graceful prose seems to allow us to gaze back on the turbulence of Rome's twilight as though into the depths of a luminous fish tank. It's that limpid, and it seems to have the effect of throwing the events and characters discussed into sharp relief. Indeed, I have yet to read another author who manages to breathe such vitality into historical figures with such an economy of words.This book is \\"Old School\\" the way J. S. Bach's music is old school. Just experiencing it has a calming, civilizing effect. It automatically makes you a better person. And it will whet your appetite for more.

Being a slow reader, it took me about eight hours over three days to finish it. Mr. Hewitt doesn't wander over his subject, he gets to the point and provides excellent examples to reinforce his argument.He gives a good history of the information age and how it impacted the world from the first pages of Guttenberg's printing press to Instipundits.com's popularity during the last election cycle. The basic theme of the book is how blogging challenges the gatekeepers of information.During the 2004 presidential election, the bloggers forced the mainstream media to recognize stories they tried to ignore and, in the meantime, the bloggers became the story. \\"Blog\\" gives me examples of how people sitting in a the corners of their house, cutting and pasting, linking and emailing, informed the world to the alternative to what the mainstream media wanted me to know.I loved the history of this book and I liked the commentary. I had hoped for more instruction on blogging. Mr. Hewitt gives a general outline to maintaining a blog, but simply refers the reader to a Blog called Evangelicaloutpost.com for instructions on how to start a Blog.Regardless, the word Blog now has meaning so I can include it in my vocabulary of Net, Web, and Link. \\"Blog, Understanding the Information Reformation That's Changing Your World\\" is a must read for anybody wanting to start a blog. So, Blog on."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"The first 2 parts of the book have some excellent scholarship, you just wish Chapter 1 had sister chapters. Hugh starts Chapter 2 (on the Reformation) defensively, probably in opposition to pre-publication counsel to drop the analogy. Borrowing on the life-or-death upheaval of the Protestant Reformation to describe blogging's effect on media makes bloggers sound like glory craving talents claiming lordship over a new faith. Chapter 1 is spectacular and is diluted by the chapter 2 blather. [Confession: while I love my Protestant brethren, they do push my Catholic buttons from time to time.]The subsequent chapters on media trends, blog hits and blog advertising are useful. The mention of the origin of the professorbainbridge.com blog (which is a great blog by the way) is motivating, and the suggestion of blogs for businesses and products is interesting -- you just think there could have been at least one concrete example dissected (maybe a blog on Firestone SUV tires, or on a soon to be good/bad stock pick?).Since Hugh has been blogging for years now, the part on developing a blog, building hits, using web technology to analize hits and links, and booking advertising falls so far short of expectations. All those offerings were apparently sacrificed to get a book to market for the holidays. OK, I accept that and I still recommend the book, but I need 2 hot cups of coffee in the morning, and this book just seems like a half cup."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Hugh is one of the pioneers of blogging. He presents a good summary of what blogging is and how blogging will impact our future."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"This is an excellent new book by law professor, radio talk show host and Hugh Hewitt. Folks who have no idea what blogs are will be provided with an excellent intro to blogs-what they are, who runs them, why they're important. Bloggers and devotees of the blogosphere will gain a better grasp of the significance of the media revolution that blogs have ushered in.Hewitt revisits recent episodes in the young history of blogs-Trent Lott's stupid comments at Strom Thurmond's birthday party, ex-NY Times editor in chief Howell Raines' role in the Jayson Blair scandal/saga, the Swift Boat Vets' exposure of John Kerry's bogus \\"Christmas in Cambodia\\", and Rathergate-the fake memos CBS so boldly proclaimed out of political bias. All of these episodes were carried by blogs, as Old Media/Legacy Media/MSM would have let these go, but for the diligence of bloggers.Hewitt's succinct history of the blogosphere drives home its significance in creating a media reformation. In the same way the Protestant Reformation took place in light of newly-created printing press technology, today's New Media is made possible by the easy access to information and publishing provided by blogs on the internet. The result: information is now directly accessible to people faster and in proportions never imagined--and Old Media authorities will have to accept a new, diminished role in delivering news.This book is the first big book on blogs by a top blogger, and with the recent release of the Whitewash Report over Rathergate, Hewitt's timing could not be better. (Let the Whitewash Report serve as proof that the blogosphere should never rest on its laurels or expect other outlets to carry water for it.) So go get it."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Hugh Hewitt's newest book, \\"Blog: Understanding the Information Reformation That's Changing Your World\\" has a breathless urgency in its message about the current impact and future promise of blogs. Hugh presents practical and innovative approaches to corporate and niche blogging that will appeal to forward-thinking publishers, musicians, sports franchises, and just about any special interest group.Hugh Hewitt is easy to listen to on his daily talk radio show, and he is equally easy to read. His style is briskly conversational, to the point, and always buttressed by meticulous research and presentation of facts.Hugh closes \\"Blog\\" with a clarion call to readers to launch into the rapidly expanding blogosphere. His persuasive argument is so effective that it makes me grateful that my little blog, www.oneclearcall.blogspot.com, has been up and running since August 2004."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"This is an excellent introduction to blogging. It gives a short history of the activity, some great tips on how to do it and some wonderful resources. It explains RSS functions in browsers (which allow an individual to collect blogs for reading much as you would form your own newspaper). All in all, it is a useful tool.At the same time, it hyperventilates at some points and offers opinions about the blogging movement that are a bit over the top.Hewitt is a keen observer and if you want a basic introduction to blogging or if you want to be inspired to start your own blog - this is a great text for that. If you want to think more deeply about the blogging phenomenom or about the implications for all sorts of other things (like the survival of Mainstream Media (MSM), or changes that we will need to think about for all sorts of societal issues - then this is not the book for you.But then if you read the book - and are inspired, as I was, to start a blog - you can opine on all those issues yourself. The real message of Blog - is Si, s&eacute; puede - yes you can!"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"This is an excellent and insightful overview of a growing phenomenon.The current state of the Blogosphere seems to be much the same as the Internet was 8-9 years ago, when it was very broad, but lacked depth, and was still heavily populated by people eager to talk about themselves or their favorite hobby horses. Of course, many of them are still here, but the Internet has deepened and matured as will the Blogosphere. I say that despite all the porn and paranoia that pops up everywhere. Both the Internet and the Blogosphere are powerful tools for research, representation and empowerment.One of the most interesting aspects of the Blogosphere's development has been the similarity to the way in which neural connections form in the brain. And I think it likely that, as in the brain, less useful pathways will be pruned over time.The reviewer who likened the current state of blogging to graffiti is quite right as things stand now. But over time neurological systems tend to be self-regulating, as I suspect, the Blogosphere will be. Indeed, I think that many of the examples in this book point to self-regulation that is already occurring.Be very clear that this is not a \\"How To\\" book, of which there are plenty of good ones. It is instead a cultural and sociological analysis of something new that is evolving extremely rapidly, and is already impacting all our lives.This is arguably the best overview of blogging currently available, but I hope that Hugh Hewitt knows that he's going to have to update the book with monotonous regularity!Highly recommended to anyone who wants to know what blogging is all about, and whether they want to be involved in it."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"It's funny--the author, conservative drum-beater Hugh Hewitt, wrote an entire chapter comparing the internet age to the invention of the printing press and the publishing of the first Bibles, and how it rocked the world of that time. I say it's funny, because I had thought exactly about the comparison before I read \\"Blog\\". And he's exactly right.Face it: the bloggers are here, and here to stay. Like the sixteenth-century Catholic hierarchy fearing the impact of the printing press on their own power, the mainstream media is running scared of the blogs, and takes every opportunity to discredit them whenever they can, often blasting them for writing their blog entries \\"in their pajamas\\" or underwear or whatever.Hewitt documents the history (albeit brief) of the blog craze, and how it was used to bring down reporters and politicians from boths sides of the political spectrum (Dan Rather, Trent Lott).A must-read for all who embrace technology."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"The Internet was once an orderly place where authorities exchanged views with authorities, and you could save time and money by accessing the top people directly.Then, the Internet took off and was soon filled with scams, slams, sham and spam . . . and even less desirable material.Blogs create the potential to regain the best of the Internet's potential. Hugh Hewitt provides a great service for those who are new to blogs and blogging by describing the positive role that blogs can play in balancing the Main Stream Media. He also warns those who are blogless what risks they are running and how to protect themselves.This is a beginner's book, but even with millions of blogs over 98% of people on the Internet don't have one yet.The book is a quick and interesting read, and will send you to the resources you need to find out what you want to know . . . whether it's the inside scoop on the latest news controversy, or just how to find readers for your new blog.Usually the people who write books like this about new media don't have much experience. Hugh Hewitt brings the perspective of being a veteran talk show host, a columnist and one of the world's hottest bloggers. That's a great vantage point for a book on the future of blogging.Unless you've been blogging for two years and read blogs daily, you will find this book to be a revelation."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Okay,I can be a little stubborn. Well, maybe very stubborn. My husband, an avid fan of talk radio who is very aware of my writing addiction, told me a year ago to get a blog. Well, I tried a couple of times, wrote a few posts and returned to the solitary musings I put in my journals.Finally, my husband made me check out Hugh Hewitts blog and get this book. Wow, were my eyes opened! I love blogging and I have the sense that most moms will love blogging as soon as they start doing it.It is wonderful for sometimes stuck-at-home moms to feel more connected to other moms who feel the same. Moms can feel more productive and receive intellectual stimulation from writing and reading other's blogs. Blogging is also a great way for work-from-home moms to offer valuable products and services over the Internet.As a former psychiatrist, I find myself wondering if blogging by new moms might cut down on the isolation that can contribute to postpartum depression.Although Hewitt's book is a good start, I have a feeling we have only scratched the surface of the possible roles of blogs in the future.Anyone who does not want to be in the dark about important developments in contemporary society must read this book. Moms need to know!"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Of all talk radio hosts in this country Hugh Hewitt does more to promote freedom and liberty on his show than anyone else. And he shares his platform by encouraging people to visit the wide array of independent journalists in the blogosphere. His book \\"Blog ...\\" is an excellent primer for anyone who desires to make their opinion known and available to everyone in the world with an internet connection."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"This impeccably well-written book (this dude can write!) is about blogs and how they are melting down mainstream media's influence and importance.Hugh Hewitt asserts that \\"People's attentions are up for grabs\\" and blogs are capturing much of that attention. He is a national syndicated radio host and has one of the most popular political opinion blogs with over 100,000 unique visitors some days. His knowledge of the blogoshere is apparent. He examines recent events that have brought blogs into the mainstream consciousness including Dan Rather's recent disaster involving forged documents.Hugh doesn't hide his political opinions or the fact that he is a political junkie. Although this book is a quick and fun read, those not interested in US politics may end up skimming some of the later sections including the 41-page appendix A, \\"Early Writings on Blogging.\\"Part 1 contains historical information on significant blogging events, all political in nature, a fascinating comparison of the development of the movable type printing press and blogs, and a brief history of text as it relates to blogging. Although I ignore politics as much as possible, each of his examples were familiar to me as they were \\"big deals\\" in the news. His concept of \\"blog storms\\" is interesting; when many blogs start examining the same events or story, an opinion storm brews and if it breaks, fundamentally changes the public's perceptions. Examples include John Kerry's Vietnam service in August 2004 and Dan Rather's blind faith in his forged documents in September 2004.Part 2 focuses on the meltdown of mainstream media due in part to their extreme leftwing political bias and loss of trust with most news consumers. Hugh also comments briefly on a large number of influential and widely read blogs, primarily political in nature. He makes a good case that blogs have gained the trust that mainstream media has lost. \\"Why bloggers blog?\\" is an interesting question. Hewitt believes that bloggers are vain and blog for two reasons: to persuade, and to leave a record of having been there. He claims that both pursuits are a blast in real time and I concur. In the recent past, those who wanted to persuade had to persuade someone to let them persuade, for example a magazine or newspaper editor. Today the gatekeeper is gone. Anyone can start a blog, and if they have something interesting to say and some luck, might generate an enormous audience. The public takes on the role of editor by choosing what to read or not read. Bloggers have the same authority as big name columnists for the mainstream media, whether they have 10 or 10,000 regular readers.Part 3 is the most fascinating but by its nature least detailed section. It concentrates on blogs and business uses, which are in their infancy. Hewitt suggests first developing a defensive blog strategy, as the destructive power of the blogosphere is immense. He then moves onto ways to use blogs for public relations and marketing purposes, including suggestions on finding appropriate bloggers for organizations, and advertising on blogs. Hewitt's \\"A Dozen Blogs I Would Start If I Were . . .\\" contains some fascinating thoughts on uses for blogs. The last chapter, \\"Getting Started: The Technology,\\" contains very little technical advice as Hewitt isn't a technologist, but does have a superb list of key rules of \\"blogging success and significance.\\"I fully enjoyed this book despite despising politics. Since much of blog's recent rise into the public consciousness has been due to political events, some political content is unavoidable. Hewitt makes no apology for his political views or focus, and he shouldn't. He simply uses his experiences with blogs, which are unabashedly political, as his primary view into the blogosphere. The book is worth reading just for Hewitt's many insights, for example that bloggers run the spectrum from pure aggregators of other's materials to pure analysts, \\"blogs are about trust,\\" and bloggers are part of a new culture of hyperscutiny."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"One of my current interests is \\"how to blog successfully\\", and when I came across Hugh Hewitt's book Blog: Understanding the Information Reformation That's Changing Your World, it inevitably peaked my interest, wanting to look for insights that can help me become a better blogger.However, this is the wrong book for that - or rather, this is a prequel to the howto's that I was wishing for.Hewitt's book is intended as a business justification for individuals and businesses that are still undecided on the virtue of blogging. He started the book by providing real world examples where the blogosphere generated impacts at national and world stages. That used to be the realm of influence for the Main Stream Media (MSM), but the toppling of Trent Lott and the Rathergate incident opened the door for the blogosphere as a legitimate alternative media outlet. Hewitt then further extrapolate the trend and draw parallels to Gutenberg's printing revolution to predict an oncoming media revolution, and ask reader to prepare and utilize for oncoming blog swarm. And finally, he shared some thoughts on what can people blog, and how to prepare a blog strategy for businesses.While Hewitt gave extensive treatment and account on the historical blogosphere events and formulate his thesis on the blog revolution, it provides little information on implementation. Of course, the title of the book does not suggest an in-depth analysis of successful blogging, so it would be unfair of me to say this book did not meet an objective that it should not meet, but it would be interesting to see if the author would publish a sequel on that particular topic.Now - I did not know of Hugh Hewitt before I pick up the book, and I was surprised to the amount of political overtones and the despise toward MSM in the book. He is definitely not shy about his views on some of these subjects, and it feels \\"in-you-face\\". If you are not a Hewitt fan already or you are not used to hearing people speaking in tones of \\"I know better than you\\", then you might not enjoy this book too much.Who will get benefit from this book?If you are thinking of blogging, either for personal or business reasons, but are still unsure about the possible impacts (or returns), then this book should do it for you.On the other hand, if you are already blogging, or decided to start blogging, then you can safely skip this book without losing much. But of course, you can always buy the book for an interesting recount of what happened to Lott and Rather ;)"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I suppose time will tell wether Hugh is a prophet or a farce and as he predicts, blogging does for our society what the printing press did for the reformation.I picked up his book at our local library last week and read it in a few hours and have been re-reading various chapters over the past few days. My gut tells me that he is right...Blogging, as we speak, is revolutionizing our world in a million different ways.Over the past few years I have wondered how families who are working long difficult hours trying to make marriages, businesses, and lives work were going to overcome all the propaganda. Especially mothers, who are so overworked and fatigued.At times I have felt overwhelmed by the seeming tidal wave of control that the various institutions in our society seemed to have over the individual day to day lives of men and women. Lining this reality up with the prophecies from the bible - most specifically Isaiah, I wondered how we would get from point A to point B. Meaning, how we would get from this Babylonian nightmare to Isaiahs pictoral of lambs lying down with lions and children living to the age of a tree???I believe the internet and blogging hold the key to the powerstructures crumbling. Let them all come a tumbling down...The only thing we the people have to gain is our health, our financial well being, our freedom, and our ultimate happiness and contentment.Thanks Hugh for being the Sage you are and not only calling it confidently for what it is, but also for recognizing the need for a book to share the good news with anyone smart enough to come take a look.I plan to start my own blog sometime in the next month or so, and have already reserved the name WWW.NaturalFamilyBlog.com to chat about anything and everything that I think is important.Give Blog a read, you will be glad you took the time.Jenny Hatchhttp://WWW.NaturalFamilyCo.com"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"A couple of weeks ago I was browsing through my pastor's library and remarking on the number of people who lay claim to \\"the next Reformation.\\" Over twenty years ago, Robert Schuller told us it would be a Reformation of self-esteem and more recently his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Rick Warren that it will be one of purpose. Other books tell us the next Reformation will involve breaking the church body into small groups, essentially giving the church back to the people in the same way that the first Reformation gave the theology back to the people. And now Hugh Hewitt has entered the fray with his latest book Blog, predicting that the next Reformation will be blogging. The book is subtitled \\"Understanding the information Reformation that's changing your world\\" and the front cover adds, \\"Why you must know how the blogosphere is smashing the old media monopoly and giving individuals power in the marketplace of ideas.\\" This is a book about the power and importance of blogging. If you are looking for a \\"how-to\\" guide to get you started or a book that will explain the pros and cons of commenting or tell you what a trackback ping is, you will have to look elsewhere.Blog is divided into four sections and I will briefly outline each of them. In the first, Hewitt shows the power of \\"blog swarms\\" and provides a historical parallel for this new Reformation. To illustrate the power of blogs, Hewitt traces four of the blogosphere's greatest success stories: the toppling of Trent Lott; Catching the New York Times and reporter Jayson Blair in a lie; John Kerry lying about Christmas in Cambodia; and the Rathergate scandal that toppled Dan Rather. He outlines how these stories broke and how the MSM was usually far behind the blogosphere. In fact, had it not been for bloggers, it is likely that none of these stories would ever have broken in the way they did. And there is no doubt that these are only the first of many similar stories.Following this, Hewitt risks what some Protestants would consider near-blasphemy by drawing direct comparisons between the first and (supposedly) impending Reformations. It is a twelve page \\"Coles Notes\\" summary of the Reformation and critical role played by the newly invented printing press. To summarize, without the movable type printing press, there would have been no Reformation simply because it was a popular movement that was championed by the common man who was provided information via this new medium.In the second part of the book, Hewitt sets out to prove that Mainstream Media (MSM) is facing impending doom and that the blogosphere will be the benefactor in MSM's long-overdue demise. He believes that the overbearing issue in the dissemination of information is trust, and our society is rapidly losing trust in MSM. \\"The key to keep in mind is that trust drives everything. To build and maintain trust is a tremendously difficult thing, requiring patient attention to detail and discipline over long periods of time ... In a world changing as rapidly as ours is, only those who have earned and continue to earn trust will be in a position to influence the choices of third parties. Blogs can earn that most valuable commodity. Which is why you have to get started. Your competitors already have\\" (page 155). The blogosphere offers readers a wide variety of authors to choose from and provides ample opportunity to regain the trust that is so lacking in MSM. This section (and, in fact, the whole book) is firmly slanted to the right (as one might expect if they read Hewitt's blog or listen to his radio program) and Hewitt takes every opportunity to criticize the Democratic Party and every media outlet other than FOX. I suspect this will hinder the potential impact of this book, as it alienates much of its potential audience. If you can see through this slant, you'll find that it is worth your while to keep reading.I understand that the MSM is declining in so far as people no longer watch the nightly news and buy newspapers as they once did. However, what Hewitt does not do, is trace the number of readers at sites such as cnn.com or cbsnews.com. Is it possible that MSM is merely evolving in the media it uses to present its information? I would suggest that as fewer people tune in to CNN on their television, growing numbers are visiting cnn.com. Thus it seems that Hewitt may be missing the point. Could it be that blogging is merely a symptom of the change that we are seeing as people gravitate towards Internet-based media? Blogging is clearly one of the most exciting and most important aspects of this, but I would suggest that it is merely one aspect of a wider change.I also wonder how plausible it is that MSM will die off. After all, bloggers do not usually create the news. Instead, they interpret the news that the MSM has already reported. Without the MSM, what will bloggers use for source material? What upper level organization will gather the news to disseminate it to the blogosphere so that it can be examined by the growing numbers of pundits? These are questions Hewitt does not adequately address.The third section of the book suggests ways that blogging can be beneficial to individuals and organizations. The author suggests that every CEO should begin a blog to champion his company and his employees and that every hobbyist should be blogging about his hobby. Every major organization needs to secure blog-related domain names, so, for example, General Motors needs to acquire gmblog.com and use it to market their products. And on the whole I agree. Blogging has tremendous potential in a wide variety of applications.The book concludes with two lengthy appendices that comprise almost 30 percent of the book. Appendix A is a disjointed collection of some of Hewitt's early writings on blogging and Appendix B is an assortment of emails sent to him from his readers which describe their blog-reading habits. Some of this is interesting, but most adds no significant value to the book.As I read Blog, I was continually struck by how self-serving the book seemed. It struck me as being almost like the biography of a proud, self-made billionaire, except with site traffic and recognition in place of dollars and European models. If you do not know how many visits Hugh has to his blog in an average day, a busy day or an election day, you will before you have finished the book. You will know how many blogs have been started because of his influence and just how useful a link from his blog to yours can be. I came to realize, though, that in a sense the blogosphere is built on just this sort of self-importance. Bloggers succeed by driving visitors to their sites by whatever means possible. The most important person in the blogosphere is the one with the greatest readership, just like the most important person in my hometown is the one with the most money. And lest I sound hypocritical, I will admit that I have a blog of my own and that I have no right to cast the first stone.Another reviewer commented that, \\"The book reads like it was cranked out over a few long weekends.\\" I suspect that may be the case. Reviews of this book were posted on Amazon as early as December 28 of 2004 and some high-traffic bloggers reported receiving copies as early as December 24, yet the book discusses Hewitt's site traffic during the Presidential elections of that same year, which took place on November 2 (only seven weeks earlier). Some have suggested that the frantic pace of the book owes to the frantic pace of technology in general and the blogosphere in particular. I would suggest that the frantic pace comes from a frantic writing and publishing schedule. Several of the chapters, especially near the end of the book, are so short (several are less than two pages) that it almost seems like the author just never got around to finishing them.I have long since grown tired and skeptical of people claiming to have discovered the next Reformation. I don't believe blogging represents the next Reformation any more than did self-esteem. At the same time, there are some interesting and undeniable parallels between the availability of information at the time of the rise of the Reformers and our time where we are witnessing the rise of the bloggers. Blogging is already going mainstream and, especially in a fast-paced society like our own, it is never good to be left behind.This book has much to say that is valuable, especially in regards to the importance of trust and the application of blogging to corporations and organizations. Unfortunately, I found it frantically-written and poorly-organized. I wanted to love it, but in the end just could not. Yet I still do give recommend it, especially to those in positions of leadership. Its alarmist tone may convince some of the value of blogging, but I suspect just as many others will be put-off. I agree with Hewitt that the blogosphere is giving individuals power in the marketplace of ideas and agree that this is generally a good thing. I think there is great future for the blogosphere.In the end, Blog is a 155-page book, padded with appendices to 220 pages, but one that to treat the topic properly needs to be about 300 pages (with no appendices!). It is, no doubt, a valuable contribution to our understanding of the power and importance of blogging, but it is incomplete. I know Hugh Hewitt has the knowledge to do justice to the subject matter - it just seems that perhaps he was not given the time."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"According to the statistics a new blog is launched every 8 seconds. The trick is seeing if anyone will return to read your blog and respond from it. Hugh Hewitt is one of the leaders of this communications revolution.In a highly-readable style, Hewitt explains how people's reading habits have changed to include blogs and the influence these blogs have on traditional news media. The blogosphere (or community of bloggers) has influenced everything from Senator John Kerry to Anchorman Dan Rather. After the bloggers began discussing these issues, the traditional news media picked up on the discussion and carried it forward but it started in blogs, according to Hewitt.Whether you write nonfiction or fiction, anyone can begin a blog. As he writes, \\"What is new about the blogosphere is that there are no barriers to entry to a world offering a nearly limitless audience. Key point: offering, not guaranteeing. Anyone can post, and if it is worth reading, it will be read. There is a vast audience of wisdom/ entertainment seekers. Whether your product is economic analysis, NASCAR boosterism, sexual gossip, or political smack talk, the blogosphere will allow you a chance to peddle your text wares.\\"Many fiction and nonfiction authors are beginning to blog as a means to interact with their audience on a regular basis. Numerous sites offer free blogs and some of the key rules according to Hewitt include: \\"post often, link freely, be generous in praise and attribution, don't be long winded too often, if at all. Brevity is the soul of blogging when you are getting started. Paragraphs are your friend. Profanity loses audiences...Keep the title short and easy too remember.\\"Most of these rules are applicable to a variety of writing. I know many bloggers who use this tool as a means to kickstart their writing day or maybe summarize their writing at the end of their session. Discover what works best for your style. No matter what you write, you can learn from this discipline. You can catch my blog at: [...]Through reading Blog, you can start this journey. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Hugh had a good idea here, but it was idea that was quickly surpassed by tweeting. Blogging had the potential of becoming a bigger deal in our social lives, but it was quickly surpassed by another innovation. Hewitt was at the edge of the innovation in blogging, so far on the edge that he missed the fact that it was open to being challenged by another technology. I give him kudos for being on the edge of things, and writing well. However, this book sadly is too far out of date to be of use any longer."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Don't get me wrong, I think this book is a good primer and a pointed commentary on the growing influence and impact of blogs in the information society. But \\"the death of MSM\\"? Sounds like the death of \\"bricks and mortar\\" touted a few years back.Also, chapters 8 and 9 are summarized as follows: \\"To make money, sell ads on blogs catering to your target audience. Better yet, start your own blog and sell ads to others.\\" It's deja vu all over again!Depsite the eeire echos of the 1999 internet hype, this book is worth the read. If nothing else, it will give you ammunition to annoy your liberal acquaintances!"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Even though it often seems that most people don't really know what blogs are, blogs are changing the way we receive information, what information we receive, and who we receive it from. In Blog, Hugh Hewitt puts forward the case that this \\"information reformation\\" will completely change who has power in the \\"marketplace of ideas.\\"In Part One, Mr. Hewitt recounts a few stories of how the blogosphere has impacted our world including the fall of Trent Lott, the exposure Dan Rather's forged memos, and the investigation into John Kerry's \\"Christmas in Cambodia.\\" Without the blogosphere, these stories would never have had the impact they did. This is followed up by a history of the Protestant Reformation and an early history of the blogosphere.Moving on to what's going on now, Mr. Hewitt examines why people are transitioning from television and newspapers (\\"old media\\") to blogs for their information. It mostly has to do with the loss of credibility by folks like Dan Rather and the New York Times. He believes that bloggers blog for two reasons: \\"to persuade, and to leave a record of having been there.\\" (105)The third part of the book deals almost exclusively with blogging for businesses and organizations. Mr. Hewitt offers tips for starting and maintaining blogs on multiple levels especially for internal and external (primarily promotional) uses. The first appendix is an archive of Mr. Hewitt's writings on blogs from articles and chapters of previous books. In the second appendix a series of emails are transcribed from his radio listeners explaining what blogs they read and how often.Hugh Hewitt makes an analogy between this reformation and the Protestant Reformation with Luther and his use of the printing press. While blogs certainly are changing things, which is evident from the impact it's already had, to draw too close a parallel between the reformations seems a bit ridiculous. There's no significant evidence that the blogosphere will change culture and history to the extraordinary extent the printing press did.For someone wanting to understand what a \\"blog\\" is and how blogs have already made an impact in our world, this is a valuable book. It's also good for easily finding out which are the most popular conservative and theological blogs out there. As usual, the writing style is easy to follow and accessible to any reader, however, it's also a bit disjointed and shallow. Particularly in the areas of practical tips for new bloggers and companies it felt as though Mr. Hewitt just wrote from the top of his head without really developing his ideas. Overall this is a useful book for those who don't know much about blogs, however, those who currently blog will not get much out of it."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I received this book for Christmas. I looked forward to reading it since blogging is one of my favorite hobbies. But it was a struggle to finish it. It's written with an arrogant tone. I almost wonder whether Hugh Hewitt actually wrote the book or if some ghost writer did.I don't think I learned very much from reading it. Basically, the message of the book is: You better blog because it's important to your business, your faith, and your political candidate.I didn't bother reading the appendices because the main text was so torturous.I'm grateful for the present because this book is one the things I wanted for Christmas, but personally, you're not missing much if you don't read it. A definite thumbs down.P.S. This is not a very scholarly written review. It's my first review, but I hope to write others that are more serious, especially for books that are worth my time."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"...got it right in their review of this book (a review which Hewitt snidely dismisses on his blog). This is a quickly dashed off screed of partisan hackery designed to make a quick buck for the holiday season. Full of howlers that would keep any self-respecting information technologist doubled up in laughter, it rambles pointlessly, overstating the influence of blogs on information dissemination on page after page.Mr. Hewitt must have a hard time fitting his head through doorways."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Mr. Hewitt, I was at the book store today and happened to pick up your book, BLOG. Although I would be considered young, I'm still not of the mindset that I know everything and anything there is to know, thus, I picked up your book to gain further knowledge.A few things come to mind and the very first is the cover. Interestingly enough how blogging is destroying MSM, as referenced in your book, yet on the cover of your book it states: New York Times Best-Selling Author and the last time I checked the New York Times is MSM. I'm sure that was the publisher's decision though. I do agree with that statement, however, although I found it a tad ironic. Moving on.I'm sure Mr. Hewitt that you have talent and obviously you have a resume somewhere down the line that allows you to teach at a law school and have a show I've read about in this book, although I've never heard of you. Your knowledge of the church and politics seems to be extensive, but unfortunately the title of your book was not Political Blogging, which I guess brings me to my first question; with so much mention of the \\"right\\" and the \\"left\\" or as you so eloquently phrase it \\"the far left,\\" what does any of this have to do with Blogging? Does it matter who I voted for in a Presidential election, or a city election for that matter, as to whether or not I understand, comprehend and participate in the blogging process? I can tell you right now my father is Republican and would never touch the word blog in a million years.I read the book, partly against my will because so much OP-ED was involved that I didn't feel like I was being provided any rational or educational information for me to make my own decisions with, but like someone was jamming a spoon down my throat full of cough syrup. Each chapter is rhetorical in, not only it's references, but context and I'd quite frankly like to know how this would help anyone on the face of this earth better understand blogging and how to properly utilize it - that's my second question.This book is clever none-the-less. I've never seen anyone be able to take one subject, Blogging, three cases, Rather, Kerry and Lott (I'll leave out Raines) and turn it into a 225 page book, throwing in a few history, church and political references to top it off like cherries.This email is neither a slight nor derogatory, but truthful. If I was a politician looking to gain further knowledge about political events and how I could use the power of blogging to support or discredit an individual, that I could fully understand - 220 pages of your book are devoted to that. However, the title of your book, BLOG, insinuates the notion that this will cover a wide spectrum of valuable information, not just politics. Blogs cover the landscape of the internet in many forms and none of that is touched upon on in your book, other than to say, if this is how it applies to politics, this is how it applies to your \\"field.\\" If I was an Executive looking to gain further knowledge about blogging and its useful strategies and I had purchased this book, I'd be infuriated.The title reads: BLOG - Understanding the information reformation that's changing the world. First, the understanding of the reformation is a one chapter subject - at best. Second, this book doesn't even mention the world - it mentions the US and I'm gathering, from your distaste of the left, it's directed to those on the right, segregating your target audience even more. Personally, politics are of no interest to me, but that refers to me as an individual. Even so, I'd like to throw in the suggestion that your next book be titled: Political Blog - The Snow Storm You Can Create With A Mouse and Keyboard.In addition, as you so ingratiatingly phrase numerous times in this book, if you are not of the same opinion as I, this book isn't for you - that was a paraphrase, but I'll take your advice Mr. Hewitt, not only will I be blogging this entry, but I will be returning your book tomorrow.Thank you for your time and pleasant blogging journeys,J WrightPS. To read story telling and proper information gathering/feeding at its best, reference Nina Munk's Fools Rush In, about the debacle between AOL and Time Warner - fantastic book and every executive on the planet should read it !"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I guess the easiest books to like are those that support the ideas that you already have. Therefore I think this book is great. Specifically, or perhaps I should say superficially, this book is on the development of Blogs that are primarily concerned with current events, particularly on comments about the breaking news.Underneath the Blog, however, there's the bigger picture of the emergence of electronic communications of all type. Mr. Hewitt consentrates on blogs saying that old fashioned static web pages are a thing of the past. There are web pages, see www.newbooksinprint.com for instance that change every day, giving the latest books that are available free on the internet.This kind of communications that is possible now is something new. I think, Mr. Hewitt is right when he compares it to the development of printing by Gutenberg. (Although when I said this at the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz, Germany they didn't agree.) We are at the beginning of a basic fundamental change in how communications are made. Leaders in the area, like Mr. Hewitt are pioneering the trails that out descendents will follow.Read this book, regardless of your political persuasion, just for the information and understanding it brings of new developments in communications."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Hugh Hewitt is an enthusiastic writer, analyst and blogger. This book is for Republicans and Conservatives and is an insiders long look at politics, elections and a very useful \\"What To Do Book\\".Easily read and thoughtful, it makes the most hardened political junkie teachable."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I was looking for a book about the potential of Blogs to facilitate organizational and social change. Learning about Guttenberg and Martin Luther and the history of how text transformed our world was interesting but not particulary helpful in exploring Blogging. What was really disappointing is the \\"right wing political\\" bent to the book. In describing the bloggers ability to bring down Trent Lott, John Kerry and Dan Rather I was disturbed by the lack of recognition that many of the reports given by bloggers were blatantly false (Swift Boat Veterens) but lauded as heroic. Any technology can be misused for unscrupulous means and this book honors these practices. The content is fair - the ethics are questionable."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"This is a terrific book. Unfortunately, I bought the audio version and now have to shell out more for a paper copy. If you know anyone in business, get them a copy of this book. If you know anyone in Main Stream Media (MSM) and they don't know what a blog is, it may be too late, but get them a copy anyway. Those that have posted negative comments don't get it and may represent the MSM that Hugh points out. If you think he is off base check the stats. When the book was published 4.7 million blogs, now over 7 million (up 3 million in 5 months). If that is not convincing, the CEO of GM took Hugh's advice and now has a GM blog (fastlane.gmblogs.com) that is leading the way."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Quite simply, I just couldn't get through the boorish political slamming. The author did not deliver on the promise \\"Understanding The Information Reformation That's Changing Your World\\". It's more about Hughy Hewitt's political tyrants than a serious inquiry on Blogs. He should take a course in writing, or run for office. Wish I could get a refund."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"While I have read books of fiction cover to cover in one sitting on several occasions, this is the first non-fiction to be accorded that honor. My free time for reading is limited, this was time well spent.If you were a regular blog reader during the incidents Hugh uses to illustrate the raise of blogs you will enjoy the recap (or not depending on your party affiliation!). More important is Hugh's insightful vision of where it's all going."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I agree with all the other reviewers. This book was given to me as a present, and it took all my willpower to read it because of the incessant need to talk politics. However. Mentioning that Fox News is Fair and Balanced--three times--and that CNN is dead, (\\"nobody's watching\\" ???) and calling CNN sophomoric names, and dismissing all mainstream media except Fox, really put me off. One challenge for Hugh...IMO blogs are going to run under the radar for two reasons. Few people have the time to read and click through all that info. Second, the people you really want reading the sites (newer computer users) now have computers full of adware and malware."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Hugh Hewitt says bloggers (webloggers) beat out those who buy ink by the barrel and are the new fact checkers for the one-sided messengers in the MSM (main stream media). He's right!A basic primer from a pioneer in the blogosphere. A leader of the pajamahadeen. A must read intro for journalists of every stripe and those who want to keep on the cutting edge."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Hugh Hewitt is a conservative: that simple fact accounts for many of the negative reviews this gem has received. If you're blinded or biased by the color of someone's skin or their political leanings or other personal attribute, nothing they do will meet your approval.Pity for those involved in business, politics, causes and pursuits of any kind who do not read Hewitt's \\"Blog.\\"Hewitt has written a classic primer on blogging as a phenomena, how it has already impacted politics and the mainstream media and how it may impact business. Hewitt uses examples from the political sphere to illustrate the impact of blogs and this will probably irritate leftists, since all but one of his examples have leftist icons like Dan Rather and his forged documents.But Hewitt brilliantly traces the combined ascendancy of Gutenberg's invention and Martin Luther's desire for reformation to illustrate his point. From that perspective, Hewitt's message that blogs are a destroyer of worlds, a creator of worlds is crystal clear and very impressive.Hewitt does not go into the technical details of blogging, a process, which in fact has been made simple, by operations like Blogger and TypePad. Rather he gets to the meat of the matter explaining why every political candidate, business, social cause needs a blog.Like the salesmen of yore who went forth to convince merchants of their need for mechanical cash registers, Hewitt sells the idea of the need for the blogging. And the man is totally dead-on. This is a must read for every one who has a need to communicate with the public. Hewitt is the first so far to sense the ultimate power of blogging. Great read.Jerry"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I received my copy of Hugh Hewitt's new book, Blog. It's a book that's having a significant impact in the blogsphere, particularly among Evangelical bloggers. What's the fuss?I'm afraid I don't have a great answer to that question. I liked the book -- I really wanted to like it -- but I didn't love it.Here's what I liked: Hewitt does a good job of demonstrating how the blogsphere has grown to rival, and in some celebrated recent examples such as \\"Rathergate,\\" to supplant or at least upstage, traditional print and broadcast media. And, he makes some cogent, although not revolutionary, observations about how business organizations should utilize blogs and bloggers. He also refers to some useful blogs that newbies in the blogsphere will want to visit, although at times he seems mostly to be shilling for his blogging friends and promoting his own site.Here's what I didn't like. The book reads like it was cranked out over a few long weekends. If you're looking for serious analysis of blogging as a social or political phenomenon, this isn't it. There are many breathless sections about how the blogsphere has \\"shattered\\" the \\"MSM\\" (Main Stream Media), interrupted with long block quotes and padded with filler such as an \\"Appendix\\" comprised of Hewitt's \\"early writings on blogging\\" and a second \\"Appendix\\" comprised of e-mails from visitors to Hewitt's website. Any 220 page book with nearly 70 pages of appendices from old, disjointed writings suggests, to me, that the book's main themes perhaps aren't that well developed. It also lacks an index, which again suggests perhaps some haste in getting to press.The book's brevity might be understandable if it were a monograph on one or two tightly argued points. It isn't. In fact, it's difficult to tease out the book's main focus. Is it primarily a call to arms for conservative bloggers, or more of a business blogger's how-to? Is this book in the tradition of Sean Hannity or Stephen Covey? It seems to want to be both, and as a result does strike oil with either.In addition to problems of style and organization, I think the book includes several important substantive missteps. It seems to me that Hewitt suffers from myopia when he compares blogging to the information revolution that followed Guttenberg's invention of the printing press. Blogging isn't the revolution -- the Internet is the revolution. Blogging is just the latest tool made possible by the Internet. The sorts of discussions now happening in blogs once happened (and still do happen) on bulletin boards and chat rooms. Years ago they happened mostly on the Usenet and on proprietary boards such as The Well and Delphi.I would agree that blogging has accelerated this trend by making this sort of informal information exchange easier. Yet it's important to place blogging in context. Blogging may persist, or it may go the way of the Usenet as new tools arise. The Internet, though, is here to stay. A truly strategic vision for communication will embrace this new tool while recognizing its possibly transitory nature. At the very least, Hewitt should explain why blogging is here to stay.Hewitt also spends little time on the potential dangers of the blogsphere. He does recognize that jihadist groups have taken to the Internet and blogging, which he seems to employ as a call to arms for good people to occupy the space. Yet, he seems so enchanted by the blogsphere's potential to correct perceived bias in the traditional print and broadcast media that he never addresses the way network effects can magnify the impact of false information. A case in point, which Hewitt ignores, is the post-election blogswarm about vote fraud started by a blogger whose statistical analysis of the exit polls was inaccurate. Hewitt even briefly refers to the concept of memes, without acknowledging that memes are often bits of false information that replicate virulently over a network. (I'd give a cite to Hewitt's book where he references memes, but the lack of an index makes the job of searching too difficult).Finally, Hewitt seems too sanguine about the commercialization of blogging. He goes so far as to suggest pricing models for blog banner ads. Call me a purist, but the last thing I want to see is the extensive commoditization of blogs. In fact, there's a real danger that the commercialization of blogs will signal the decline of the blogsphere. Public relations professionals have already recognized the importance of the blogsphere and are becoming adept at \\"seeding\\" stories in influential blogs, just as they seed stories through \\"leaks\\" to the traditional news media. A commercialized, coopted blogsphere will lose its authenticity. Surprisingly, Hewitt doesn't seem concerned about this. In my view, what we need in the blogsphere is writers who say what they think regardless of the consequences. Once you begin eating from the hands of sponsors, advertisers, and public relations flackers, you become the MSM.So, if you're new to blogging or just curious about it and want to learn more, get Biz Stone's Blogging, which contains much more nuts and bolts information about blog culture and tools. If you're an active blogger, read Hewitt's book, but blog about how much more interesting a book it could have been if it had been a more thorough analysis of the blogsphere's place in the Internet and the culture at large."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Why is it that some ideas or behaviors or products start epidemics and others don't? That's the question that Malcom Gladwell attempts to answer in \\"The Tipping Point\\", a fascinating examination of the phenomena of social epidemics. While examining the question Gladwell introduces three types of people -- Mavens, Connectors, and Salesmen -- who play a critical role in dictating trends.Mavens are information brokers who have the knowledge and social skills to start epidemics; connectors are people who know lots of other people; and salesmen are people with the skills to persuade us when we are unconvinced by what we are hearing. While many of us play some of these roles, there are few truly influential mavens, connectors, or salesmen. An even few number of remarkable people are a combination of all three. Hugh Hewitt is one of those people.As a best-selling author, national radio host, and popular blogger, Hewitt is a classic connector. And his willingness to help and encourage others, sparking in them a passion for blogging marks him as a true maven. Now, with the release of his extraordinary new book, Blog: Understanding the Information Reformation, he exhibits his persuasive skills as a salesman. Hewitt is a one-man epidemic, spreading the burgeoning trend of blogging.While many of us might see 5 million blogs as a revolution already well on its way to maturity, Hewiit sees a vast, relatively untapped market. His book is squarely aimed at the large segment of the population who might use email and surf the Internet but still doesn't quite understand the importance of the \\"blog thing.\\" Hewitt explains why blogs are significant, how they are changing the world around us, and - most importantly - how not to get left behind in this phase of the \\"information reformation.\\"With a style reminiscent of management guru Tom Peters, Blog hits the ground running. \\"I know you are busy,\\" Hewitt writes in the opening words of the preface and spends the next 220 pages cutting to the chase. He doesn't waste time trying to explain what isn't necessary. Like a classic maven he convinces the reader to just trust him, he knows what he's talking about and is willing to freely share his valuable knowledge.Blog is divided into three sections, each explaining an essential aspect of blogging. Part one lays out the case for \\"What Happened\\" by describing the \\"blog storms\\" that helped bring down such powerful figures as Trent Lott and Dan Rather. Even mainstream media types will have a hard time scoffing at the power of the blogosphere after the retelling of these seminal \\"opinion storms.\\" And those of us who watched the events unfold in real time will be impressed by Hewitt's post-mortem examination. He clearly did his homework.In explaining the twenty-first century \\"information reformation\\" Hewitt compares it to the sixteenth century's Protestant Reformation. While many others have compared blogging to the invention of the printing press, Hewitt delves into the history of the event and shows how a young monk named Luther used the new technology to transform Western culture. In doing so he revives an often overused metaphor and gives it new life, making a convincing case that 2005 really is \\"1449 and 1517, at the same moment.\\"While the first section of the book will be of special interest to bloggers, Parts II and III lay out the case for why leaders of business, church, government, and media should be paying attention to the new media. Even those of us who spend a considerable amount of time thinking about blogging will be impressed by the creative uses for the medium that Hewitt suggests. His recommendations, if adopted, would benefit both bloggers and the organizations that could use our unique skills to their advantage.Throughout the book, Hewitt exhibits his typically generous \\"linking\\" and praise for blogs and bloggers. Instead of using the book solely as a vehicle for promoting his own \\"brand\\", he shows that blogging truly is an interconnected community. As he readily admits, no blog - no matter how much traffic it receives -- is as important as the blogosphere. The fact that Hewitt \\"gets\\" this and is able to use it to his advantage is one of the primary reasons he has become one of the foremost leaders of the new media.When you order your copy of Blog from Amazon you'll want to get at least two copies -- one to keep and one to give away. No matter whether you are a connector, a maven, or just a wannabe, after reading Hewitt's book you'll become a salesman for blogging.[...]"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"If the blogosphere had a press agent, it would be Hugh Hewitt. He has flogged the potential of the blogosphere for over a year on his website, and \\"Blog\\" attempts to bring the word to people who don't get their news from the Internet.Like his previous work, \\"If It's Not Close, They Can't Cheat,\\" \\"Blog\\" is an eminently readable work you can devour in an afternoon. Hugh's writing style is conversational and transmits information quickly and clearly. This makes \\"Blog\\" a good read regardless of your position on blogs and blogging.Hugh's thesis is simple: blogs are the next wave in the information revolution, as important to the dissemination of information as the printing press was to the Reformation. While Hugh touts a number of blogs (oddly enough missing yours truly, but I'm sure that was an oversight), his discussion isn't about any particular blog, but about how the technology of blogs is changing how information reaches the public. He cites four significant instances of the blogosphere influencing the public discourse: the removal of Trent Lott from his position as Senate Majority Leader, the fall of Jayson Blair and Howell Raines at the New York Times, the takedown of John Kerry by the Swift Boat Veterans for the Truth and Dan Rather's immolation following the 60 Minutes forged National Guard documents scandal. Each case illustrates how the blogosphere was able to keep stories percolating (and even breaking, in the latter two cases) until the national media had no choice to take what the blogosphere was giving them, and in each case the results were markedly different than what would have occurred prior to the rise of the blogosphere.Naysayers will probably ding Hugh for what notes as blogger triumphalism, but I think such readers are missing the point. Hugh is not arguing that any one blogger or group of bloggers is able to have this effect, but that the blogosphere as a whole is distributing the flow of information in such a manner as to make it far more difficult for anyone to control that flow. That will make life far more difficult for people accustomed to keeping tight control over information, but it also represents a great opportunity for people willing to take advantage of this new medium's strengths. And this is what Hugh is trying to sell: those people and businesses that jump into the blogosphere now are going to gain a serious competitive advantage on those who continue to stick to older methods of communicating. While this process in likely to move in fits and starts over the next few years, it is coming nevertheless, and \\"Blog\\" offers some good advice to those people looking to get out ahead of the blogosphere rather than ending up in trouble due to a failure to understand this new technology.The definitive work on the blogosphere is yet to be written, because it's still too early in the development of the system to chronicle it all. But Blog is a good start and a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand more about what the blogosphere is and how it can help or hurt your business."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Some moron, presumably a liberal, misappropriated my identity to post a fictitious review in my name.

Here is what I wrote on Power Line: \\"My copy of Hugh's book arrived in the mail today. From a quick skim, it looks great. Hugh documents the rise of the blogosphere, gives a riveting account of the role blogs played in the 2004 election, and offers both theoretical and empirical arguments for the historical importance of the blogosphere....Buy it!\\"Having now had time to finish the book, I can confirm that anyone who is interested in blogs, the media, politics, or just doesn't want to be left behind by the next wave of the communications revolution should read Blog.

On this end, Hugh does a credible job in illuminating how important and trusted these information sources have become in the recent few years.The book is the strongest when Hugh is outlining some of the well documented failing of the tradition media, in particular the sad and unfortunate tarnish to Dan Rather for whom what little objectivity he ever had was destroyed by his foolishly supporting a news story based on forged documents. In this aspect, as well as the failed exit polling in the last Presidential election, the \\"blogs\\" had the accurate data and talk radio personalities like Hugh let the public know about it. It is true that the world has changed and people in general no longer trust the far left leaning main stream media.I also learned about a number of great blog sites, and plan on checking those out. For that alone, the book was also useful.However, I cannot give the book high marks overall because it was not written well. The chapters and themes are disjointed and disconnected, Hugh at times seems to launch into nothing more than personal grandstanding, and his technical data points were a bit weak.This would have been a fabulous article somewhere, but it feels like it got stretched into a book for nothing more than a few more bucks in his pocket. Good points, poor presentation. Overall, there was enough to keep me interested, but I can't give the book a high recommendation, despite more often than not agreeing with his viewpoints."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"In broad strokes, the first 100 pages of BLOG are a rehash of the \\"W\\" - Kerry campaign and how bloggers impacted the election.

At least for now, BLOG is the book.Four stars"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Hewitt suggests the blogosphere allows for the organization of dissent, which is focused, credentialed, complete, and--crucially--publicized. In short, he champions blogs as the force providing accountability to \`legacy media'.Any fair-minded observer of \`legacy media' would conclude not all journalism is good journalism. Of course, likewise, not all blogs are good journalism either. However, the point Hewitt makes is that, instead of a one-sided, agenda-driven media, we've been given balance through the quickness and efficiency of the blogsosphere. That is, one of the ways blogs provide benefits is through their timely response to periodic mainstream media error.Hewitt claims the \`old media' is increasingly devoid of serious scholarship, and is slowly being reduced to mere polemic. The irony here is that Hewitt's communicating in one of the oldest media forms - the book. OK, to be fair, Hewitt isn't suggesting all other media forms are 'legacy', rather, he's pointing to the perviously dominate outlets more than the forms. (LA Times beware, and you too Newsweek and CBS.)In short, he suggests the blogs must be taken seriously, and they are rapidly becoming so. There are too many qualified journalists who run blogs for them not to have an enormous impact on our changing world. Finally, Hewitt claims the accountability they provide is long overdue.Has Hewitt been wrong before? Of course he has - he claimed national security was going to be far and away the primary voter issue of 2004. However, is he likely right about the increasing importance of the blogosphere, and why it's growing in influence and power? I believe so."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"As a Hugh Hewitt fan for serveral years now, this book is a really good book that illustrates the phenomenon of blogs. After receiving a limited release for his book, I am very surprise with the accurate detail he describes in the book. This book answers many question people might have been wondering, and one of them is: why so many people are now turning to 'Blogs' as sources of credible information. This book is a great book. I am very happy with Mr. Hewitt because he finally found the time to pen a thoughtful, well-documented look at the rise of the blogosphere. Mr. Hewitt is nothing, if not prolific, and we're fortunate to have a visionary thinker like Hewitt on our side. I would encourage anyone for this book who is interested in the blogosphere, and what it might look like in the future with all the \\"Blogs\\" we have today."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"This is the second Hewitt book I've read. I've found Hewitt's books to be very well-written and informative, but I've also found his writing style to be a little annoying, a little too full of himself. Despite that personality clash, I found \\"Blog\\" to be a very informative book, though a little long.The book seems to spend a good amount of time trying to stress to companies to start blogs of their own. For a while there, I thought I might have picked up a special version of the book, but alas, I had not. The book was for \\"me\\" (a non-corporation), but also had many sections geared for \\"others,\\" people managing corporations. There are, though, many interesting sections in the book.The beginning of the book provides an important and informative look into \\"What Happened\\" and why blogs matter. An interesting history lesson opens the book, showing how this entity had emerged into the mainstream public's consciousness and helped set the facts straight when some of the mainstream media organizations (for example CBS) \\"accidentally\\" found themselves airing or publishing incorrect information (there is also a section going back to the Gutenberg bible).The book was good enough, and inspiring enough, that I actually went out and created my own blog. Unfortunately, I grew tired of being in that long tail (or whatever that phrase Hewitt used), writing for just myself, and now that blog is no more. This is an interesting book about blogs that might be more political than some people are looking for on the subject."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Yes, it's a must-have book on the growth and power of the blogosphere, but I'd be lying if I said there were no flaws.Hugh is, of course, an opinionated guy. And in chapter 1, as he chronicles the impact of blogging on Trent Lott, the New York Times, John Kerry, and Dan Rather, we learn his opinions of CNN, the New York Times' Paul Krugman (he calls him &quot;unbalanced and frothing&quot; even though Krugman quotes a blogger approvingly), the mainstream media and Barbra Streisand. (To his credit, he does try to be fair to the blogsites Atrios and DailyKos.) If you can get past the slant, you'll find he has quite a bit to say.Hugh seems a bit apocalyptic in his view of the MSM, which is perhaps why some of them are dismissive of this book. But at the same time he outlines in plain language some of the reasons why mainstream journalism is in a crisis of confidence, and why the blogosphere aggravates it.Chapter 7 describes strategies for dealing with the blogosphere, intended for businesses that could be potential targets. For the most part it's common sense, but this is one chapter that can and should be longer, particularly in outlining policies on employee blogging.Chapters 8 and 9 deal with starting and maintaining blogs for business, from leaders to managers to subordinates, as well as the use of blogs for gathering corporate intelligence. And Chapter 12 lists typical examples of blogs that types of people could start.There are nice concrete suggestions here, but the chapters could have benefitted from real-world examples. For instance, Hugh could interview TV producer Rhett Reese, who maintained a showblog while his series Joe Schmo 2 was airing on Spike TV.And yet these latter chapters are perhaps the most important contributions Hugh makes to the blog literature, because they attempt to show how the blogosphere can be mined and exploited for better corporate behavior.My recommendation? If you don't know much about blogs but want to use the Net to help your business, you should buy this edition. If you're already a blogger, you might want to wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I borrowed this book with the assumption that it would help me learn about technical aspects of blogging and getting started. Instead, I found it to be full of right-wing drivel.

Turn the book over and look at the name of the publisher on the back. If it says Nelson Books, don't buy it, unless you want to be the victim of a fraud.The good folks at Nelson Books are marketing the far right wing rantings of a tiresome blowhard named Hugh Hewitt under the title of Blog: Understanding the Information Reformation That's Changing Your World. This book devotes about 20% of its pages to discussing blogs. The other 80% is a mean-spirited and sustained attack on what Hewitt considers the \\"far left leaning main stream media\\". If you disagree with his assessment of things, you can get bent, according to this sweetheart of a man, who tells you that \\"if you want to argue the point... you don't have a clue, and you won't when the night is over.\\" Later, he rubs your nose in it when he says \\"[If] you want to argue what \\"left-of-center means\\", you have purchased the wrong book. You are living in the land of the lost.\\"Okay, so can I have my money back? I mistakenly thought I was buying a book on blogs. Oh, and by the way, your publisher marketed it that way, so do I have a cause of action against them? 80% of $20 is $16. Can I have my $16 back? Had I known the full title of your previous screed I would've side stepped your current dung heap, but the good folks at Nelson Books only saw fit to mention that you'd written a book called If It's Not Close, They Can't Cheat. They didn't provide the full title (which you manage to mention at least five times in the body text along with numerous other glowing references to yourself ): It It's Not Close, They Can't Cheat: Crushing the Democrats in Every Election and Why Your Life Depends on It.Gee, that seems fair and balanced.Considering that a lack of fairness and balance seems to be your main complaint against the mainstream media, it occurs to me that you've become the very monster you despise. But of course, only liberals can be bad guys. The farther to the right one gets, the less accountable one has to be. Consequently, after 150 pages of haranguing readers to use the blogosphere to attack and dismember as many liberals as possible, you blithely warn us that, \\"Demagogues will, no doubt, try to use the blogosphere, even as hate groups have, to identify and motivate their followers.\\"Hmm, that never occurred to me. Thanks for the tip, Hugh. I'll keep my head up.I could go on and on, but responding to this doofus's absurd rantings seems a bit like rising to the bait, which wasn't what I signed on for. I really, genuinely wanted a book about blogs, one targeted to anyone who might want to start one. Yet when this book finally does get around to talking about blogs it's for a very narrow audience indeed, one that doesn't include me. Hewitt is writing strictly for executives with leadership responsibilities, executives of Fortune 500 companies, as it turns out, and only far right wing executives of Fortune 500 companies. Everybody else is not worth addressing, and anybody who doesn't agree with Hewitt is beneath contempt.Obviously, the publishers of this book realized early on that the target audience for their clever boy was somewhat limited, so they did what any good hard right publishing house would do, they set out to trick us. There's not a word on the jacket or fly leaf anywhere to tell you you're in for a tongue lashing about what's right and good and true from a conceited extremist who sincerely believes Rush Limbaugh is a moderate and that every liberal should be scourged to the border and given a sharp kick in the rump. Instead, you're promised a book about Blogs. This is the definition of fraud. Don't fall for it. I don't think they're going to be amenable to giving you your $16 back."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I purchased BLOG with the hope that I would learn more about blogging, something I know very little about. While Hewitt is an enthusiastic cheerleader for blogging, he provides very little practical or detailed information about blogging. As other reviewers have mentioned, I found his stories and writing style arrogant and painfully redundant. I would recommend the book only for individuals who would like to know more about the origin of political blogs, specifically conservative blogs."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"This is nothing more than a piece dedicated to bragging about the part blogs played in the electoral success of George Bush in the 2004 presidential election. It is arrogant and assumes others are too stupid to make use of the blogosphere. If you are a Bushee, you will probably love it. If you are anything else and looking for information on how to get started blogging, it is useless and condescending."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I am not criticizing Hewlett being the first to market with a book that capitalizes on the evolving technology everyone has come to know as the Web. I would have rather seen somebody with a little more gravitas write about it. Obviously Hewlett is a novice who never heard of bulletin boards or uunet particularly since he compared the impact of blogging to Gutenberg inventing moveable type. All he is doing is leveraging his radio show with books and blogging. Blog offers nothing of import other that to inspire others to try their hand at self promotion. Kind of like an est seminar leader pushing for you to take more seminars or a televangelist who asks a donation for some two-bit trinket.You would be better served to read The Cathedral and the Bazaar and it will not cost you anything.I give Blog a solid D."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I bought this through a book club, and wish I had looked up the author first. If you can get past the NeoCon slams at Michael Moore and Al Franken, Hewitt makes a couple of good points. Not good enough to overshadow his attitude, but definitely relevant. Too bad he didn't show a little restraint - this might have been a good resource for those seeking to learn about blogs, but as it is, I can't really recommend it.One thing it did confirm for me, which I had long suspected, is that most conservative bloggers are paid writers or professional political operatives. While there are one or two of those on the Left of the political blogosphere, most of the Progressive Bloggers write on their own time and own dime."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"This book was a waste of my time and money. The author seems to be interested in only two things: 1) Patting himself on the back for his \\"accomplishments\\" and 2) Spewing as much right wing, conservative rhetoric as possible. There are many more good books on the market that discuss blogging, the Internet, etc. The author of this book seems more to be a mouthpiece for the far right wing Republican Party and big business.

They would not have won the race if not for her meticulous scientific research and one hundred hours spent developing the photo that led to Watson's aha! moment. Even if Franklin had been a man, the ethical lapse displayed by a Watson who looked down on being \\"nice\\" is damning to the basic character of the man and not good science. Because science relies on collaboration and the abilty to share ideas without fear of intellectual theft and worse, this kind of libeling of the dead that he performs throughout the book on Franklin.

This novel was written by famous scientist; James D. Watson, who was also the author of this book. Watson and a group of other famous scientists, such as Francis Crick, come together and try and figure out one of the most significant questions of our time, which is what is the basic building block of life? Yet, Crick and Watson are not the only men trying to solve this question. A man by the name of Linus Pauling and his men are doing just the same.Due to the fact that Crick and Watson were basically competing against Pauling and his group of scientists, errors were made. When one group of scientists would present and idea of a pattern that may be considered the DNA helix, the other group of scientists would find any little detail that would make the pattern wrong or incorrect. Not only did these men analyze the other groups work, they would take their original idea, and apply it to their own. These men were feeding off each others ideas. Eventually, the two men that finally figured out the DNA helix structure were Watson and Crick. This meant that Linus Pauling and his men did not discover the structure, and Crick and Watson felt a great deal of accomplishment.The DNA helix structure is very helpful because its nucleic acid carries all of your genetic information in your cells. These sequences of nucleotides will determine in each person their individual heredity characteristics. An example of this would be if you were born with a disease such as Cystic Fibrosis. If this were the case, this means that a parts of your DNA molecules are not normal and that a defect is in one of those molecules. Another reason that DNA is such a wonderful discovery is that police and the FBI can use it to trace criminals that have left a finger print or hair behind a the crime scene. This method has been used in many criminal cases, and has been proven to be a very useful tool.After reading this book cover to cover, I was not very happy with the end result. For me, I am not very interested in how the DNA helix was found. The book seemed to drag on longer than it needed to, which made reading it very difficult and boring. For someone who is extremely interested in how the DNA helix was found, then this would be a great book for them. The book seemed to be more of a biography, rather then just about the DNA helix. Watson used a lot of scientific terms that made parts of the book confusing. The book did not flow very well either. Also, people and events that Watson mentioned in the book did not have any real significance or importance on how the DNA helix was invented. Overall, I did not like this book, and would not recommend it to anyone who is not extremely interested in the foundation of the DNA helix."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"All I can say is, some lunatic at my school thought that a bunch of 9th graders would be able to read, understand, and write about this book."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"You have to like science and like to read about it, then u might possibly enjoy this book.

Crossreference this book with Gleick's book \\"Genius\\". Wherein we read that in1967 Watson comes begging Feynman for his \\"seal of approval\\" at some social event at The University of Chicago. Feynman relented and said something like \\"yes that's how things can get discovered....in crazy ways....\\"Well, I finished it. Took me only three days to read it which for me is a record.And at first I was thinking, \\"well here we go again another book on DNA\\" but toward the end of the book ( about two thirds I think ) I began to start cheering in my mind with \\"C'mon Crick!...C'mon Watson..\\" then I got to the end of the book...and then for some reason everybody \\"ran away\\".

Of course that's what really makes the book. The idea that these two young \\"college boys\\" with a \\"Devil may care\\" attitude could pull of this great discovery like it was simply \\"a day at the tennis courts\\". And in that way it reads like a double O spy thriller. But that's not how it really was. DNA was promised to Cambridge and King's College by people much higher up. Watson was along for the ride as part of the American contingent in and \\"Anglo-American deal\\" since DNA was really something that was captured from Germany after WW2 and there's every reason to believe that the Germans in fact already knew the structure of DNA years before the Americans and British. There was no \\"intellectual freedom\\" happening here. Never on a deal this big. And even on smaller \\"scientific deals\\" you wouldn't get too much sympathy for being a \\"cavalier\\" James Bond like Watson makes himself out to be.

If you've solved the structure for DNA the cure for cancer is starring you in the face!)

Why is it that if in fact \\"The Secret of Life\\" was figured out as was stated in the book that whenever any one of these Nobel Laureates gets some kind of nasty disease that they.........well you know........they follow the crowd down to the local...you know where .......and opt for the same.... you know what treatment as everyone else.....but don't they understand a molecule better than everyone else?.....certainly better than the \\"experts\\" they go to....why are these Nobel Laureates listening to those guys????So I wanna know....and .....so should you.sjwI mean isn't that why they get the prize in the first place?"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I was initially daunted by the very subject of this book.

Having helped her in a lab once or twice, I was well aware that genetic science was far beyond anything I could remember from seventh grade.But The Double Helix was no problem. Some have called Watson's tone condescending--I, for one, am glad he talked down in his book, because dealing with DNA on a lower level is the only way I could ever approach it. And it's to Watson's great credit that he not only helped discover the double helix, but can write about it in mostly layman's terms and make the story understandable.The most fascinating thing about the book, for me, was the nature of the research and the scientists themselves. Most of my life I've thought of scientists with the subconscious imagery of Frankenstein in my head. Here, Watson gives us a mostly genial but very often competitive world of collaborators and laid-back geniuses.

Describes the whole process very well without getting too deep in the science. The narrative does justice to a dramatic sequence of events.-- Maybe Watson is being modest, but, it seems like he didn't do much in discovering the structure. He was just there discussing things with Crick and others.-- Linus Pauling was subjected to harrasment by Sen. McCarthy.

Watson and Francis Crick work in unison to discover the structure of DNA. As they work jointly to piece together information about the double helix, they also have competition against the admired and better known Linus Pauling. At the same time, what is enjoyable about this book, is that everybody works in a cooperative manner, as they all have different abilities in the field and knowledge, in order to come to a final conclusion. The success of Watson and Crick came from the many different individuals with different experiences in science. Yet at the same time, the fact that it is a competition to discover the mystery of the structure of DNA titillates the reader. Although from the cover, this book seems very unapproachable, not because of its size, but because of its science nature, one would think that the jargons used in this book would be quite difficult. Rather, this book does not take much technical qualifications to understand, and as a matter of fact, it is quite easy to comprehend. What is positive about this book is the humor, and clever wit that takes place. An example would be on the bottom of page 68, \\"After Pauling's success, no one could claim that faith in helices implied anything but an uncomplicated brain.\\" The Double Helix is an excellent book to read, with great illustrations of models, pictures of certain individuals, and x-rays of DNA, making the moment of discovery in this book vibrant and dynamic."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I didn't like this book at all, even though I'm very interested in the subject area. I think (judging by this book) James D. Watson is not a very good writer in general, and not very good popularizer of scientific ideas in particular.The book is full of irrelevant details, mostly biographical, but they'd be irrelevant in a well-written biography as well. For some reason the author gives a lot of details of his personal life, which to my view have nothing to do with his work on DNA structure. This is also the case with other people's lives Watson describes in his book.Another serious problem with this book for me - I think the author completely failed to show importance of DNA structure discovery for biology, even though he says that it's of high importance a number of times throughout the text. He just fails to substantiate his claim.Watson's discourse seems to be more on the chemical side of his and Crick's discovery, but even here he is far from being clear and concise as one would expect from a popular book written by a Nobel prize winner.After reading this book, one is left wondering if they came to their discovery by pure chance, prompted by Paulings's and other people work, tweaking here and there rather than following some broader picture, vision they had when starting their search of DNA structure.Finally, the quality of Watson's writing is not that high to my taste, comparing with other scientists. One example which immediately comes to mind is Erwin Schroedinger."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"\\"The Double Helix\\" is Watson's scattered memory of how he and Crick discovered the structure of DNA, along with other significant figures who were involved. Self-absorbed, biased, and disorganized as it is, Watson frankly revealed what scientists are like behind the honorable mask they put on for the masses.The truth that Watson is a bad writer does not take away all the attractions of the book, fortunately. Some occasions Watson dwelled on seemed to have no relationship with the DNA discovery at all. Moreover, his prejudice against Rosalind Franklin is extremely annoying. Still, Watson and Crick's story is generally fun to read, and it was somewhat entertaining to see what evil schemes they used to rise to prominence.Despite to all the turmoil and controversy Watson invited when the book was first published, it has become a modern classic out of most people's expectation. Remarkably, Watson revealed scientists' real intention to do researches- for fame and profit rather than having the sacred wish to improve human life. Scientists are, after all, human, so they party, compete and do extremities in order to achieve their goal. Watson, in particular, is probably among the most notorious to have written this book."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book is a personal account from one of the discovers of the DNA structure. I read it because I was interested in how scientific discoveries are made.It's a good book. I like it because it illustrates how intense the competition is in research, and also gave me some ideas in how to do research.Some ideas I got from the book are:1. I must have a good sense of what's important. In the book, Watson and Crick were very sure that DNA is the important pursuit, whereas many others didn't realize that.2. I needs to be very confident in my own judgements. In the book, Watson went against his home institution (where his grant was coming from) and left wherever he was and went to Cambridge, because he had no interest and saw no big developments in what he was told to do.If you are a student, and are interested in going into research, you should read this book (it's quite short).

This account of the discovery of the structure of DNA, by one of the key participants Dr. James D. Watson, includes a lot of both. Written as though from his perspective at the time, The Double Helix presented a fascinating and candid look at the work which led up to this amazing discover.For the non-scientist, this book is an important reminder that scientists are human too. For the scientist, this book is an important reminder that scientists are human too. It's just nice to know that at times even the great scientists struggled with their choice of research topic or felt a little adrift too. It also makes for a great read, very casual and easy to follow with lots of drama and personality clashes. The science included is pretty minimal and is explained well with helpful pictures, so I think this would be a pretty easy read even for people with no science background.The casualness is occasionally a downside, as people are referred to by their first or last name at random and there's no cast list. Despite that small flaw, I would still say the relaxed writing style is strongest point of the book. Watson's surprising openness about everyone's feelings for each other and his ability to convey the rush he and Crick were in to finish the structure made this a very engaging book. It was pretty cool to feel like you were actually there during the race to discover the structure of DNA."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I needed this book for a class and got what I paid for.

I was lucky enough to have had someone send this great book to me while I was stationed in Iraq in 2003. I was absolutely engrossed in Watson's sometimes colorful, sometimes biased and always entertaining recounting of the discovery of DNA.Watson, an American originally studying physics, stumbled upon the field of biochemistry almost by accident. He seems to have been a bit of an unfocused graduate student who by chance ended up working with Crick. Countless numbers of little dead ends as well as one very big one are remembered. Of special interest is the 'political' nature of the relationships between scientists of different universities working similar aims.And the competition. Scientists, it seems, are as competitive as any of us. Very aware of their main rivals Watson and Crick tracked the progress of Linus Pauling and they react with glee as they discover he's made a critical error that will set his progress back indefinately. They are almost as competitive with their cross-town London rivals Marurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin.A special mention should be made of Rosalind Franklin. Some have accused Watson and Crick of stealing the Nobel Prize. Nothing was further from the truth. Watson and Crick determined the structure of DNA from the work of Wilkins and Franklin. Franklin was an unfriendly and cold person, as confirmed by co-workers, but a brilliant scientist. Watson spends several pages defending her work and wishing that she had lived so that she could share in the Noble prize [not awarded posthumously]. Any talk of Watson and Crick stealing Franklin's glory is bunk not borne out by the facts.The Double Helix is one of those rare science books that highlights the human element of discovery with all its foibles. I highly recommend this entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Double Helix is a worthy read. In a few hours of reading, one catches a fairly representative look into the scientific commmunity, though the eyes of one man. Some people critique this book as being one-sided. Of course it is! Watson admitted that up front. The book was written as an account his perceptions of the events and people involved with the discovery of the structure of DNA, not as a documentary. Like any human, Watson's perceptions of the events were scewed in his own favor. This, however, adds to the value of the book, rather than detracts. From my experience in the scientific community, the issues of ownership of ideas and work, plagarism, and politics are both real and complex. Double Helix does a good job of exemplifying these difficult issues."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I recently reread The Double Helix and greatly enjoyed it, because (a) Watson conveys vividly (but perhaps not completely) events leading to the discovery of the structure of DNA, one of the great discoveries of the century and (b) he gives a warts and all description and shows that science is not a glorious straightline progression.What distinguishes him from most of the other participants, and explains his passion, is that (as a biologist) he was investigating the structure of DNA to gain insights into genetics. Therefore he saw elucidating the structure as a step to bigger things (e.g. Human Genome Project), not as an end in itself. Most of the other participants as biophysicists were content to find the structure. One of the beauties of the double helix is that the structure itself gave a very immediate indication as to the mechanism of genetic replication.I have been intrigued by the strongly polarised reactions to the book reflected in the reviews on this site. I think that some of the criticims of the book are unfair. Watson makes it clear that it is a personal account and reflects his own perceptions of the events at the time. From reading other accounts (e.g. The Path to the Double Helix by Olby) it is clear that his memories of some events are not shared by other participants in those events, including Crick and Wilkins.I can certainly understand why many readers (and in particular women) object to the characterisation of Rosalind Franklin, particularly the repeated derogatory references to &quot;feminists&quot;. On the other hand Watson acknowledges in the epilogue that his perceptions of her at the time of the events described were wildly wrong. Even in the body of the book, he never denies that she contributed key information (although he doesn't explain why they did not acknowledge that contribution more explicitly at the time - Sayre could be right that Watson is trying to put his spin on events to obscure this aspect). As I read the book his perceptions and comments about Franklin were almost entirely reporting or based on Maurice Wilkins complaints about her. Notwithstanding Anne Sayres' defence of Franklin in Rosalind Franklin and DNA (which I recommend to balance Watson's account) it does appear that Franklin was far from blameless in the bad relationship which developed between Franklin and Wilkins.It is also clear, even from Watson's account, that Franklin (and others such as Chargraff) had good reason for believing that Watson and Crick were not serious scientists. So her reserve when dealing with them is understandable.As well as the objectionable personal description of Franklin, Anne Sayre also criticises Watson for the suggestion in the Double Helix that Franklin rejected the suggestion that DNA was a helix. Franklin's private papers disclose that she thought that there was clear evidence that the B form was a helix, and Crick thought that she was not far away from demonstrating the double helical structure through her X-ray crystallography work. However, for most of the period that the events in the Double Helix unfolded in 1952 her work focussed on the A form of DNA which was not clearly helical on X-ray evidence. Both Watson and Wilkins are clear that when the possibility of a helical structure was discussed with Franklin on various occasions during 1952 she reacted negatively (and very strongly). Only in early 1953 did she begin to actively work on the B form and to turn her mind seriously to the detail of helical structures. This reflects either rigorous scientific standards or an overcautious approach depending on which side of the fence you are on. Either way, if she had been prepared to indulge the idle speculations of Wilkins, Watson and Crick earlier she may have found her name on the paper announcing the structure of DNA to the world either alone or with Wilkins, or Crick and Watson."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book is almost totally about the human side of science, the story of people on the quest for the structure of the genetic material where all knew that the winners would get Nobel prizes. Watson was one-half of the team of James Watson and Francis Crick, the men that first constructed the correct model for DNA but this book is also about all the others around them in their corner of England with a great deal of Linus Pauling thrown in.Watson writes about the antagonism, friendships, rivalries and social structure of the scientists as well as the British culture that he is living in. This is a human-interest story, easily followed by people with little knowledge of biology. Forty years have passed since this book was first published; yet it still remains the best book about the human side of science and how scientists interact and gather data as they stagger towards the truth.The book also has relevance in the current debate over global warming, especially given the recent publication of some e-mails between scientists conducting an internal debate about the environmental data. As is demonstrated so strongly in this book, the presence of dissension among the investigators cannot be used to justify the conclusion that global warming is not happening."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"A must read for everybody who is even vaguely interested in modern biology, this books describes the key event that lead to today's age of biotechnology: the discovery of the double helix by Watson and Crick in 1951-1953 through the eyes of one of the discoverers, James Watson. At the time of the discovery James Watson was a young, brilliant student in the laboratory of Francis Crick in Cambridge. The two formed an unlikely pair: the smooth, young, ambitious American and his English colleague, every inch the typical English university scholar. The scientific path leading to the conception of the Double Helix (the structure of the DNA) is described and it is not a path with nice views only. The descriptions of Francis Crick and Roselind Franklin are not very flattering to say the least.The book is a very smooth read, especially for a &quot;science&quot; book, maybe also because James Watson dared to vent his personal opinions on his colleagues. This may not be very scientific, but it makes the book interesting to read. And of course the highlight in not every scientist's life is there: that one time only moment when you have a deep insight and all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fall into place and what is left afterwards is this feeling of utter joy and satisfaction. And in the case of James Watson of course also the Nobel prize."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Most readers of &quot;The Double Helix&quot; would be further enlightened by Anne Sayre's &quot;Rosalind Franklin and DNA&quot;."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The Double Helix a hysterical science novel. By Raphael MermeyI thought that the double Helix was an outstanding piece of science literature. I liked the humor in James D. Watson's writing. He always found a way to make a serious topic funny. One example of his humor was when he stated that: At first he was only occasionally felling ill from his work but by the end of his apprenticeship he was violating the terms of conventional biochemistry. He was totally board with the normal rules. Another example of his unconventional sense of humor was when he was describing was describing the food at one of the labs he worked was working at and how sometimes he got sick from not eating at all. Another important part of this novel was the competition. Who would solve the double helix mystery first? The competition was between Linus Pauling (A well known and highly respected scientist) And the team of James D. Watson and Francis Crick. Up to this point in Watson's and Crick's careers neither of them had been well known. In fact Crick had been known for going off on tangents and then realizing what he though was a great idea had just been his imagination. But even with his defects he was a crucial part of figuring out what the double helix was.I liked the way the book did not leave out parts where every one needed every one else's skills and expertise. This is a trite in a book or in the world of science and I thought this was one of the most successful books at doing that which I have ever read. They showed that one of the most important reasons for Watson's and Crick's success was many different people with different backgrounds in science.I thought The Double Helix was an outstanding science novel, that had a great sense of humor and increased my knowledge, and was truly enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Clarification is in order. First of all, this is not a substantive science book. For all the significance of the discovery it chronicles, The Double Helix never bothers to explain how, for example, x-ray crystallography actually works, or what the difference between a keto- and an -enol is, or even why Watson's and Crick's discovery brought on a new era in the life sciences. Aspiring students of genetics and molecular biology are urged to inquire elsewhere for answers to these questions.Second, to label The Double Helix a book on scientific method is almost equally misleading - the reason being that there is no room in the rarefied formalism extolled by the likes of Karl Popper for Watson's subjectivity and sarcasm, not to mention the latter's frequent excursions on nubile au pairs and the deplorable student housing market at Cambridge.Third (not that it matters for an appreciation of the book, but it's a common misunderstanding), Watson and Crick did not discover DNA itself, or even the function of DNA. Rather, they were awarded the Nobel Prize for solving the molecular structure of DNA.With those clarifications in mind, The Double Helix is a profitable read. Watson shows us non-scientists that the practice of science is \\"just\\" another human endeavor, and not some remote, sterilized activity conducted by emotional eunuchs in white coats. Watson's first-person narrative is downright conversational, as if he's talking shop over a pint of stout in an English pub. He is unabashedly honest about both his ambitions and his naivete (he was only 23 at the time the events in the book took place). And his sometimes scathing portrayals of his colleagues - in all their brilliance and banality - give the impression that working in a world-class research facility is a lot like working anywhere else.Francis Crick comes across as that certain guy we all knew in college (wherever and whenever that was) - impish and boisterous, egocentric but big-hearted, who might be dapper if he didn't sleep in his clothes, whose eccentricity is the bane of faculty advisors, whose attention is everywhere but on task, whose breath sometimes smells like beer after lunch, and whose serendipitous genius comes through at all the right times. The supporting cast is equally colorful: Maurice Wilkins, the quintessential English academic stuffed corpse; Rosalind Franklin, a Freudian caricature of icy feminine competence in a man's world; the godlike Linus Pauling playing with his tinker toy molecular models in California.And it wasn't just his colleagues who made Watson's work interesting. There were the aforementioned au pairs, the pubs and the parties and the formal receptions, there was the professional competitiveness between the English and the Americans - with Watson (a Yank in Cambridge) more of an American insurance policy against the Brits getting all the credit for solving DNA if Pauling wasn't fast enough. And there was the Cold War, which had an impact on research priorities and, sometimes, hampered communication in the scientific community.But most importantly - although Watson never deigns to make this point explicit - The Double Helix is a fascinating chronicle of the scientific method in action, notwithstanding the politics, the distractions, and the idiosyncrasies of the protagonists. The task itself was daunting. Watson and Crick already knew what DNA was composed of, and they knew with some certainty the proportions in which the bases were represented, but there could only be one correct way to put all the pieces together and the haystack was a big one. The researchers were quick to offer and to accept criticism, and false leads were abandoned without regard to ego or sunk time. Even though each wanted to get there first, London shared their findings with Cambridge, Cambridge shared their insights with London, and England and California held nothing from each other for long - admirable examples of the \\"sociable competition\\" of science that expedites discovery.In the end, Watson's and Crick's success relied heavily on Wilkins's and Franklin's crystallography, with important contributions from whomever happened to stop by the lab during the two year period, and insights from conferences and the textbooks and articles Watson happened to read at the time. Creativity, serendipity, and openness to the ideas of others eventually yielded hypotheses, which were tested using Pauling's modeling methods. It could not have been done alone, as Watson makes clear, and the structure of DNA would have been discovered sooner or later. While ultimately it doesn't matter who gets the credit for the discovery, the world seems a better place for James Watson's being involved, if only because The Double Helix is such an entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The Double Helix was a one of the books on my high school biology teacher's reading list for the class. The name itself, The Double Helix, had shied me away from reading it; it sounds like some boring old book that will describe the structure of DNA in some very big and boring words. However, after finally reading the book, I completely changed my thoughts on this book. I found the novel to be an easy and exciting to read in an almost fictious hero-like story.Watson's story is not just a mere account of the events that occurred, but it also contains many of his personal thoughts and views of the events. Watson's purpose for writing The Double Helix was to explain that scientific research was a combination of \\"the contradictory pulls of ambition and the sense of fair play.\\" Watson involves the reader in the \\"race\\" of the DNA structure with Linus Pauling and in the underhanded use of Rosalind Franklin's X-ray data. I, like many others, was sucked into the thrill of Watson's first-hand account of this dishonest race. During many points in the course of the novel, I was anxiously waiting to turn the page to see what Watson or Crick might do next. As Sir Lawrence Bragg puts it in the foreword, \\"I do not know any other instance where one is able to share so intimately in the researcher's struggle and doubts and final triumph.\\"The Double Helix was not only a good read, but also it has reinvigorated my spirit in the field of research, especially the active field of genetics. My first year of college courses in chemistry and biology had began to turn me away from research in particular areas, for the courses just did not seem to interest me anymore. However, this book has provided me with a new avenue into the exciting world and life of scientific research; I am again looking forward to going into the genetic research field.I observed a very interesting point in the book, which is that all the data and diagrams that were discussed throughout the novel are also taught in our chemistry classes; it is in this fact that I find science's beauty, that only 50 years ago this data was used to solve the structure of a totally unknown molecule/idea and is now taught in elementary chemistry classes.The Double Helix is an exceptional novel that I recommend to all."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I recommend this book to anyone with a curiosity about DNA or an inside view of the world of science. It is a book about personalities, egos, and following one's dreams. There is only enough technical stuff in the book for the story to make sense. The author, himself, avoided chemistry except when it became vital to learn. Yet, he and Francis Crick beat the greatest chemist of our times (i.e., Linus Pauling) in a race to determine the structure of DNA. Personally, I found this book to be a suprisingly delightful read.

His need to vilify and degrade Rosalind Franklin (whose essential (and stolen) work he used) can hardly be something that is admirable.

Although they are given more credit than they are due, they did make a monumental discovery. Rosalind Franklin first interprete the B form of DNA as having a helical structure, and later, in a private, unpublished notebook, as having &quot;interchangability.&quot; Although Rosalind Franklin contributed equally to the discovery of DNA, Watson and Crick made the final, crucial step. However, Watson's portrayal of Rosalind Franklin as &quot;Rosy&quot; is inaccurate an inexcusable. Even Maurice Wilkins, another scientist involved with the discovery of DNA and was honored with the Nobel Prize, states this clearly. Although the personality clashes between Wilkins and Franklin caused a lack of communication which may have ultimately impeded the discovery, he says, referring to a ridulous Double Helix passage in which &quot;Rosy&quot; nearly physically attacks Watson, &quot;Jim wrote a novel.&quot; I advise any readers of this book to be wary of such departures from the truth, and to read Rosalind Franklin and DNA (widely recognized among educated readers as the clear and balanced account of the discovery of the structure of DNA.)"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"In my 5th attempt to read this book (err rather start it) as required reading for a class, I immediately noticed typos as well as the author's inability to refer to all of the \\"characters\\" by one name; instead going back and forth between their first names or last - after a while making it very confusing with all of the Watson's, Wilkins, etc....as to who was who. Now I'll have to assemble a character sheet because this otherwise brilliant man completely missed that we as the reader are not going to have an easy time remembering the names of EVERYONE he mentions, let alone properly pairing their first & last correctly. Ps - as a woman in science his references to \\"Rosy\\" are typical, sexist, debasing, etc...She was a feminist who's fellow colleagues thought she'd be better off if she'd doll it up and be less opinionated.

Watson is not the most riveting-can't-put-it-down book, it does offer a fascinating first-hand account of the events leading up to one of the most impacting scientific discoveries ever. Its manifestation of the unique existence of a scientist exposes what type of competitions, manipulation, and discovery exist in the science arena.The introduction of other key figures who played prominent and influential roles in the discovery of the DNA structure is at the very least, enlightening. The network of knowledge necessary to ensure there are no foibles in a key discovery is something that the general public may have never taken into account. Also, it evinces the professional barriers that exist between the genders. The back story of Rosalind \\"Rosie\\" Franklin is fascinating as it examines the \\"glass ceiling\\" and what type of personality a woman needs to adopt in order to survive in a male dominated field. The end of the end of the book-where Watson realizes her seemingly callous attitude emanates from her essential need to incorporate survival methods is refreshing. The science terms are difficult to follow if one does not have previous scientific background, but there is enough universality imbedded into the story to keep a reader's attention.Another aspect that proves to be surprising is the fact that scientists are not without their weak fields-just because they excel in chemistry does not mean they are equally capable in biology. Reading of how Watson and Crick were unsuccessful on several occasions somehow made them human-like they were mortals rather than some higher power intellectuals. Somehow, there seems to be an idea or stigma attached to scientists that suggest they are always brilliant and do not make mistakes. This book sheds that concept.Watson and Crick needed to do research, work hard, and learn from their mistakes in order to accomplish their objective. They even needed help from their friends. They beat out a great scientist in Linus and won the \\"DNA Race.\\" Their discovery has changed the world, and this book depicts them in a humble role-two guys doing their job."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"As a young woman in the still male-dominated world of science and technology, this book was utterly disappointing.

If you read this book, I suggest you immediately read Anne Sayre's &quot;Rosalind Franklin and DNA.&quot; If you are a woman reading this book, then that doubly holds true.Watson's portrayal of the one woman involved in this great discovery is not only biased, but pure fiction. It is unexcusable. Franklin was responsible for much of the research that led to Watson and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA, a discovery which gained them and Wilkins the Nobel Prize. Not only did Watson and Crick use her findings without her knowledge or consent, but did not even give her the proper credit for it.For a great scientist to make a statement such as &quot;the best place for a feminist is in another person's lab&quot; is horrific. A step backwards for any woman attempting to make a name for herself as a serious scientist.

The Double Helix, frankly, is not a book to put down, but that is only if you can put up with the stale depictions of the scientific endeavors that occured in the Cavendish Laboratory, conveyed in an all but enthralling manner. The non-fiction novel is basic and rather tasteless. Expect no enticing extravaganzas with this, but more of a dull, yet informative tale portraying the discovery of DNA. appealing, yes, but that is to the bare handful. One with scientific interest, impressed by marvelous scientific discoveries and realizations such as man's exploration with space per say, might be impressed with what James Watson's Double Helix piece has to offer. What do you get from this book? If you're biology-savvy and possibly a history buff, this book might be worth giving a try. If you're the common man-or woman-who tends to enjoy J.K. rowling's Harry Potter series, Stephenie Meyer's Twilight, or are on the intellectual side and prefer Steinbeck, Capote, or Miller, this would be as desirable of a pick-up as a rich, medium rare steak for a five year vegan. Nonetheless, a science and literature lover might enjoy this book greatly. The goal of this brief review is not to inform you on all the events that occured-such as the disputes between the protagonists, possible sexism, the detailed location, and magnificent discoveries-but to inform you if this is the right pick-up for you. As aforementioned, this is for the science buffs, not the common person. This day and age, with technology at an all time high, there is no reason I can think of for someone to want to invest time towards a novel with such a researchable storyline. I personally felt the book was an informative read, something to read in school if mandated, not on spare time. I can't think of any event in the book that I'd say was my favorite part. I assume, with all the scientific marvels in the universe-there are more fascinating scientific reads out there, and I will leave it at that."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"QUICK REVIEWThis book is a semi-interesting, semi-enjoyable story of the research and path of discovery of the scientists who figured out the structure of DNA.FULL REVIEWFor the reader to really enjoy this book, he/she needs to already know some things about DNA prior to reading it. So in that sense, that is one of the book's weaknesses. However, someone who does not know anything about DNA probably wouldn't be interested in it in the first place. So the problem kind of takes care of itself. The book, though, can still easily go over the reader's head in parts. The author does not try to walk the reader through the understanding of the research that went on, and thus the reader can get lost in the specifics and the jargon. However, that is not what the author is interested in doing anyway. He wants us to see the personalities and the human side of the story rather than the scientific details. In this he succeeds. The story could have been dry, but it keeps your attention by making you interested in the people involved and the dynamics of those people behind the discovery. It is a good book that may or may not engross some people, but the reader can't help but get caught up in the excitement when they close in on the final discovery, knowing that they will receive the Nobel Prize and what it means to the biological world. It is a good book but not a great book, and will probably be enjoyed by any reader who is interested in the topic."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This is a racy &amp; insouciant account of the months leading up to the deciphering of the structure of DNA ____an intellectual achievement on par with Relativity ,Quantum mechanics ,the theory of evolution and psychoanalysis .Watson is as incapable of being pedantic as he is of being dull ."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I am an undergradudate student dreaming of a biologist. I think this book is very helpful to pre-scientists as well as lay people, for it shows failures and disappointments hidden behind a 'great discovery' together with how they are treated and overcome. I was also impressed by the scientific passion represented vividly in this book."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The race to discover the double - helix structure of the 'molecule of life' is the subject of this book. James Watson who was then a twenty- four year old visiting American scientist worked with the team of the British Francis Crick , and this team succeeded in beating the Linus Pauling team to the discovery. There are of course many ' doubles' in the history of science, perhaps most famously Newton- Leibniz invention of the differential calculus, and Darwin- Wallace's discovery of evolution through natural selection. But the ' double ' here was avoided in part by Crick- Watson's fierce competitiveness, and making use without permission of the work of another .(Rosalind Franklin) In other words the story here is valuable in being a realistic ( if incomplete) story of how this monumental discovery was actually made. But it makes in a way the whole process seem if not less exciting, than less emotionally and spiritually satisfactory than one would like in regard to a discovery of such great importance. Compare the kind of wheeling and dealing done by Crick and Watson with Wilkins in filching the Franklin work, with the very different spectacle of Einstein alone through thought- experiments wholly transforming the way we see the world.I also to tell the truth did not find the Watson who tells the tale a particularly likeable character, and Crick even less so.This book however does give a real sense of how scientific work is often done, and does in its best moments provide a sense of the excitement of great discovery."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"It has been mentioned by reviewers that Dr. R Franklin's contribution goes unappreciated. Of course she had died of cancer when Watson and Crick et. al. received the Nobel Prize; otherwise she would have been included, as she deserved. That aside, the principal value of young people's reading this book, aside from a passing familiarity with a key discovery of modern times, is the way Watson and Crick interacted to get to the truth. Each would attack the arguments of the other- not in the tricky sort of way one associates with TV lawyers, but pointing out the limits of the other's arguments and contradictions with established principles of chemistry and physics. It is somewhat akin to Talmudic argument. It has a good deal owed to the logic of Aristotle and the thought processof thesis, antithesis, synthesis repeated over and over developed by Hegal. The book provides enough insight to be of value without such technical detail that would take it out of the range of an average reader."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Even though I read this book for my college Biology class, I wanted to tell readers that there isn't a need to have a strong biology background to enjoy this book. At first, one may be hesitant because a Nobel Prize winner wrote this book, and may be full of complicated scientific jargon. However, this isn't the case and is really enjoyable to see the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; discovery of DNA. This was a very fast reading and interesting book; I think it should be a must for anyone wanting to further their education in science."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The discovery of the structure of DNA was a monumental leap forward for the world of science. Whether or not you are looking to forward you studies in this area, I recommend opening this book. Watson provides a vibrantly colorful description of the exciting race to find a solution. A biography, the Double Helix adds a hint of humanism to a scientific search. His writing is fresh and direct, without any hesitation to state what he feels. Apart from being highly informative, it is an exciting retelling of the research process. Upon reading the novel, however aware you are that Watson and Crick will be receiving Nobel Prize for their discovery, you are still caught up in the chase.A discovery of such epic size could not have been achieved by two scientists alone. Watson delves into descriptions of the scientists who provided essential pieces of information. Over the course of the novel we are introduced to Maurice Wilkins, who would be awarded the Nobel Prize along side Watson and Crick in 1962. Rosalind Franklin is depicted, giving her an undersized portion of recognition she deserved, as without her work with radiation Watson and Crick would have never gotten any where.It is fascinating to hear the overlooked aspects of what happens on the path to discovery. When we are introduced to Watson he is an unfocused American graduate studying physics, who on account of sheer luck stumbles across bio chemistry and his future boastful partner Francis Crick.In the Double Helix, Watson does more than merely recount the steps of his discovery. Here, is a very human story about an important scientific endeavor. You travel with Watson as he tastes wine and debates politics; a reminder that science is also a part of everyday life. Therefore, it is a narrative that holds appeal for all people with all levels of interest in science."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"** The Double Helix was read as the December selection for our book club. **I marginally enjoyed reading The Double Helix simply because I never would have read it had it not been a selection by my book club. I enjoyed the perspective, and did find the final chapters engaging as the final pieces of the DNA puzzle were discovered. The book as a whole, however, was quite difficult to get through with feigned interest. Watson recounts the experience by pulling from personal letters and his journal, and it is quite obvious to the reader throughout. The writing style and quality is subpar, and he certainly focuses on aspects of the experience that I doubt many readers care about.The book itself is not horrible, and this first hand account certainly carries value, but it isn't something I would recommend to anyone other than those with a very keen desire to understand the discovery of the structure of DNA."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I found this somewhat interesting, but it got into some 'history' that I didn't care that much about. Still the underlying history of fascination with the body being a guide to the universe -- yes for over 1000 years -- made it all worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I felt this was a truthful outpouring of Watson's first-hand account. The discovery of DNA's structure was so monumental in this feild, it is hard not to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Excellent book. I read it about 30 years ago. The book is insightful to the world of research and discovery."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I began this book with some trepidation. I am not a science scholar by any means, so I wasn't sure how much of the book I would understand. And true, I didn't grasp a lot of the scientific explanations, but what I found interesting, and humorous, was the description of the many characters and their personality traits. They could all be right out of the TV show \\"The Big Bang Theory.\\" The book is a quick read, as long as you don't get bogged down in the science, and interesting to discover the workings and social interactions of the scientists involved in their quest to discovery DNA."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"What a great book! I totally understand how the structure of DNA was formed and loved the journey getting there! This book was assigned for a class I had, but it was very enjoyable to read. Some of the science is difficult to understand if you don't know much about chemistry and how different molecular structures are laid out, but the big picture can still be understood."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"One of the best books I have read, and it is fascinating to hear from the discoverer on perhaps one of the greatest, if not the greatest, discoveries in the scientific arena. The discovery of the structure of the DNA is an important milestone in the annals of science and to get such a fascinating writeup from James D Watson is just fantastic. In a research environment, there is always stress, and to understand the frustrations and self-doubts lingering in these great minds just serve an important reminder that at the end of the day, the human element plays a vital cog in shaping your life.This book is such a fast paced read that you can finish it in one setting, and the best part is, you are not reading some kind of a fiction. These are true events, these are events that have shaped mankind's though process towards life. It was interesting to read what went through the minds of Francis Crick, James Watson, Maurice Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and many others when they were on the cusp of something so life changing. I've always though that Linus always referred to Linus Torvalds, but then got to know that there is another genius who goes by the same first name, Linus Pauling. I really liked the way Watson discusses about Rosalind. Initially, she comes across as haughty and arrogant, but finally, Watson realizes how wrong they were to have judged her like that and has very good things to say about her academic accomplishments. In a way, it is very interesting to note how science was a male dominated affair and the women folk could never invoke the same respect compared to their male counterparts.Anyway, it's a great first account and makes for stupendous reading. It's totally a must read for people who realize the importance of this life changing moment in science and history. If only, research is conducted the same way today as it was in those days. Today, driven by the need for quick results and profit, the whole face of research has turned out to be an ultra-fast, competitive and result oriented slug-fest."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"A reference with intersting insights to the challenges individual researchers face in pursuing their \\"out of the box\\" hypotheses. Illustrates how pursuing new ideas within established research institutions can land on deaf ears and how research scientists may need to pursue their own interests while being supported financially with grants for other approved research projects."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book is both entertaining and informative. It probably is not a perfectly balanced view of the events however. Watson writes at length about parties, pleasure trips and the like and one gets the impression that 1960s Cambridge was merely a great party place. Obviously Watson and Crick spent hours doing some of the most significant scientific work of the century but the reader doesn't get much feel for how much of the time was spent on science instead of the parties."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I listened to this audiobook that I borrowed from my library. I love genetics but have very little reading time at this point in my life - so I wandered to the library in search of audiobooks.I don't recall the name of the individual who read the book - but he did an excellent job and was completely unobtrusive.The book itself would have been a very dry read and may have taken me weeks to finish had I not listened to the audiobook version. As it was I was done in two days and completely enjoyed it.This book is told from Watson's (of Watson and Crick fame) perspective on the discovery of the structural nature of DNA. There were several scientists all working toward the discovery sometimes together and many times opposing. This book is told in a rather personal set of remembrances. His feelings of the other scientists and their decisions are very human - at times frustrated, at times annoyed, and at other times filled with respect and honor. The excitement at the science and the discovery comes through and following the piece by piece uncovering of the truth engages the listener from beginning to end. In addition you get the underlying feeling that you are starting to know these different scientists through Watson's eyes.Because it is written by a scientist much of the writing is dry which is why I am so glad that I listened to the audio version of this book. For those that are scientifically minded or interested in Genetics this is a must read. I advise the audiobook version."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book was required for one of my college courses, which is the only reason that I finished it. Parts of the book were interesting, but it was hard to follow. Also, Watson has the very dry humor of a British scientist, despite the fact that he is an America. All in all, I did not enjoy reading it, but someone who is thrilled by DNA might be interested in it."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This was a great book sold by a great seller. The book was in great condition, I got it in a timely manner, and the value was perfect. Thank you for a great buy! I highly recommend this seller!"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This is how science should be taught in schools - through real stories, of real individuals, with all pitfalls of egos, politics, and everything in between. This is both an amusing and an educational account, from the perspective of James D. Watson, of their race towards the discovery of DNA. What is remarkable and refreshing is that for once we see the real process of discovery, which takes numerous dark alleys, backtracks, breakthroughs, and a healthy doze of paranoia about \\"who will get there first\\". Every student should read this book, if for nothing else but to dispel the myth of the \\"genius innovator\\" on an uninterrupted path towards the next big discovery.Not being familiar with the field or the terminology I am sure I missed some of the more subtle points and jokes, but it was nonetheless a great an educational read. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I wish I knew a little more about nucleotides, purine, backbone and so on; not knowing or remembering any of that, I couldn't enjoy the book the way I would've liked - to genuinely enjoy this book you would need to understand the basics of the science discussed here. Yeah, I did enjoy the details of the various personailities, the gossip and the humor, though, that won't make up for the excitement one gets when the main puzzle is unravelled.This is Dr Watson's story, the way he saw it and it's fairly evident that Rosalind and Maurice would've seen it pretty differently. Planning to get hold of Maurice's book to get his perspective on the race."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"on the work and lives of scientists. Watson's tale importantly serves to humanise science by humanising scientists. He paves the way for a now-large literature."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Watson's account of his and Crick's race to determine the structure of DNA is very exciting. Very little technical information makes it accessible for the non-scientist. The Double Helix is very quick reading, and is one of the most captivating books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"After reading this, I really have to wonder about the value of awarding prizes in science when most (all?) discoveries build on previous discoveries. Does science need competition to advance? Watson did seem fueled by a competitive desire to be first to discover the structure of DNA. However, his ethics seemed questionable and as other reviewers mentioned, he basically stole Rosalind Franklin's data and work. I would like to read a more objective third-person account of the \\"discovery\\" of the DNA structure.Having said that, this book provided a moderately interesting account of the time and the personalities involved, and it gave me some insight into scientific collaboration and in-fighting. I did not understand the science so I skipped quickly through those parts. I never got too involved in the drama and did not get any deep insight from this book."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Science and I have never been on a level playing field. We go together like jalapenos and cheesecake. When the opportunity arose to do extra credit for my biology class, I was ecstatic. That is until I found out exactly what the assignment was. I had to read a book, a scientific one of course, from a list compiled by my instructor, write a review, and post it on here on Amazon. If I wasn't so desperate for the extra points I would have torn that book list into a million pieces, but describing my need for an A as desperate would be an understatement. Naturally, I chose the book with the least amount of pages, James Watson's Double Helix. The title alone made me drowsy. I was in for a big surprise, though. I actually enjoyed the book and even learned a little bit in the process. The story was extremely well told and I found myself eagerly awaiting the answer to Mr. Watson's burning question, \\"What does DNA look like?\\"James Watson was en exceptionally intelligent man, as was clearly demonstrated in his book by his eloquent writing style, extensive vocabulary, and impressive syntax. He was, however, not an intimidating scientist, which allowed me to relate to his story with ease. Watson was full of ideas, a quick study, and very receptive to the work of his superiors, but at the time of his brilliant discovery, he was merely a student, fighting to get funded for his research. He had studied biology, chemistry, and physics, but was not particularly fond of any of them. Unfortunately, Mr. Watson was at a disadvantage because all three disciplines were the building blocks for understanding the composition and structure of DNA.Although James Watson was funded to research viruses while away in England, his immediate fascination with DNA quickly derailed his educational focus, and with several incorrect theories about DNA already spread, he was unquestionably discouraged from his desired area of study. The entire book boasted his bliss and reverence, having met and worked with some of the worlds most famous and respected scientists. Watson was clever enough to draw knowledge from each of them which assisted him throughout the stages of the project.The best part about reading the book was that while I was devouring my literature, my Biology professor was covering DNA and genetics in class. I felt like the smartest kid in the world because I truly understood all the material he was discussing, thanks to Mr. Watson. The novel included supportive illustrations which assisted me in following some of the more difficult language, such as nitrogenous bases, and phosphate groups. I was astounded to know that I had a firm grasp of a minute portion of the scientific world.I thought the book was great primarily because I could understand it. While it may sound facetious, it's absolutely true. Unless you love science, the terminology involved sounds completely foreign. I was utterly terrified just thinking about how I was going to attempt to comprehend my newfound author. My fright was quickly put to ease as I turned each page. Initially I was dreading reading a few pages per night, and soon found myself reading five chapters a night and finished the book, in its entirety, within just a few days. I would undeniably recommend this book to anyone like me who feels inferior when it comes to the sciences. It is a superb account of a scientific breakthrough intertwined with a story of friendship, inspiration, competition, and triumph."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I found this book to read much more like a soap opera than a true scientific account. I think that it was this tendency that kept the pages turning. ALthough this was required class reading, it was a fast read, especially in comparison to some of the sleep-inducing journal accounts out there."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The Double Helix, A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA, is a great book, which I would highly recommend. Written by James D. Watson, it is a novel about the adventures and struggles James Watson and Francis Crick went through to finally discover the double helix structure. The book is very well written and you can never put the book down. The subject is so informative and interesting that you can't help but keep flipping through the pages. This was such an amazing discovery, which makes the book that much better to read. Watson is great at thoroughly explaining the challenges they went through. They fail many times, like all scientists sometimes do, but it all paid off in the end. He tells the story very well, and explains the different encounters he had with many different scientists. He talks about his times working with Crick in the Cavendish laboratory, and what they went through to finally discover DNA. Watson writes a lot about the scientific part of his discovery, but also writes about the adventures and vacations he went on, which make the story that much more interesting. The novel also has pictures in it, which I love. They help me follow the plot of the story, and help me form an image in my head of what he is talking about. Some of the images are also diagrams that are labeled to help you understand the scientific part of the book. I would recommend this novel to anyone, even if you are not interested in science or DNA very much. The book is well written and gives a great story of how one of the best discoveries of all time was made."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The Double Helix presents the narrow of window in time (1953-1954) just prior to solving the DNA structure when molecular biology was still a new field. I enjoyed Watson's book, particularly his concise perspective on the event leading up to their triumphant discovery. It was interesting to learn that the majority of scientist at the time were largely unaware that DNA was the \\"transforming principle\\". As this book points out- although the discovery of the DNA molecular structure was credited to James D. Watson and Francis H.C. Crick, the quest to elucidate the structure of DNA was many years in the making and accomplished through the efforts of many devoted scientist. I read the Norton Critical Edition of the Double Helix that was edited by Gunther S. Stent. This edition includes a series of photos, notes, and a great introduction by along with 13 reprinted reviews by a number of scientific minds that offer views on James D. Watson and commentary on the ethics of scientific discovery. As many reviewers have pointed out, this book is the perspective of one tenacious mind and should not be considered in light of other historical narratives that are available in print. I agree with the reviewers included in the book that the Double Helix will remain a literary achievement apart from its scientific merits. Prior to reading the Double Helix I was vaguely aware of Rosalind Franklin's x-ray work with Maurice Wilkins; however it was only after reading this book that I realized how important x-ray crystallography was to the discovery of the DNA structure and how underappreciated Dr. Franklin's efforts were. I am eager to read Maurice Wilkins book (The Third Man of the Double Helix: The Autobiography of Maurice Wilkins) and at least one of the books dedicated to the contributions Dr. Franklin (Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA&Rosalind Franklin and DNA). Overall, I recommend this book to emerging scientists and self-confessed DNA addicts- the Double Helix is a great piece of literature that illustrates the excitement of discovery and the people who defined molecular biology."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I recently read this book for my undergraduate genetics class. Out of all the required reading that I have had to do in the sciences, this was by far my favorite. Watson is quick, funny, and tells a compelling story. Watson is somewhat biased (aren't we all) but he tells a fairly objective story from HIS point of view. I loved the way the book kept me on the edge of my seat and thus I read it very quickly. For those of you who are not science people, this book will not \\"go over your head\\". This book describes a critical discovery that influences us all today. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"James D. Watson bares all in The Double Helix, whether he attempts to or not. Though Watson attempts to hide the fact that he and Francis Crick stole the discovery that the double helix is the structure of DNA from colleague Rosalind Franklin, he instead shows that they did while loosely trying to disguise it. In the process Watson shows himself to be a misogynous, spending more time talking about how Ms. Franklin could look more attractive with a different style than discussing her work. Essentially, Watson created a heck of an interesting read, maybe not what the general science buff is looking for. A perfect read for the critical history of science student."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I remember upon first reading The Double Helix I was delighted with the fact that Watson was a slacker and still managed to make one of the most important discoveries in biology. There was hope for me too! It is a pleasure to read a book about scientific discovery where the researchers are not mercilessly driven type-A personalities confined to their labs. A well-written account of the personalities and community behind a major scientific discovery, of the molding of disparate facts into a new theory that changed the field."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"While I am glad to see the current rush to purchase M. Greene's best seller (which I reviewed), there are good arguments for putting first priority on Watson's The Double Helix. Not only did Watson and Crick win the Nobel Prize for discovering the structure of DNA, but Watson reveals much about what makes a Creative Genius tick (which Greene's book does not). One of these ingredients is non-conformity, even non-conformity with the mainstream of one's own field of research. Watson is non-conformist to the point of embarrassment, revealing his arguments with colleagues whom I would describe as Ingenious Followers in part at least (as well as those colleagues' own weaknesses). Secondly, Creative Geniuses have an unusually strong motivation typically. In the case of Watson and Crick, they had a competitive spirit to win against their colleagues (who were also trying to unravel DNA) in the race for the discovery, and their competitive spirit was an absolute obsession &quot;day and night&quot;. Thirdly, they built ingenious toy models of DNA with movable parts which enabled them to use more sensory modalities to help them think. Fourthly, they kept up completely with what their rivals were doing, which is to say that they sought and used information wisely and in a timely manner. Fifth, they used the computer technology of their era to the fullest (which Creative Geniuses sometimes do not do - compare Roger Penrose, whose books I have reviewed). Sixth, they were incredibly mobile - they went to different countries frequently to learn, to attend seminars, to talk with experts in particular areas, especially countries in Europe (where Creative Geniuses are more common, in my opinion, than in most parts of the world). You will find many other characteristics of Creative Geniuses by reading the Watson-Crick story yourself."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA written by James D. Watson is a rather engaging with a easily readable down to earth style book on the discovery of the structure of DNA. James D. Watson and Francis Crick worked on the structure of DNA, as did other of the time L. Pauling and R. Franklin were hot on the heals of Watson and Crick.This is the story of how they made history, a story by a scientist about scientists, this is a superbly human tale of how a very unusual 23 year old American saw his chance for scientific immortality and set out to seize it.If you like reading about about discovery and how it was done, then you'll like this book. Written in a folksy mannor, this is a book that is thrilling as you get to experience the discovery firsthand. Here you'll read about observation, the suspense of making this discovery before others and the mounting tension associated with science. You'll feel Watson's brilliance come through the narrative, his frank tone mixed with humor all making this a fast read, but never boring.You'll be transported back to college, Cambridge, off to London and Paris, experience things like wine, movies, and girls, but you'll feel the undertone of scientific politics at its finest. This is a very entertaining book about the beautiful experience of making a great scientific discovery."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"gfsdffdg oh dear god it was just terrrible. i hated this book so much. i cant even believe i read the whole thing"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"GOOD UPDATE OF CLASSIC CONTRIBUTION TO SCIENCE.WATSON IS NOT LIKEABLE, BUT TELLS IT AS HE SAW IT - WARTS AND ALL.'ROSIE' WAS ALSO NOT LIKEABLE BUT DID HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE.CRICK WAS FUN.THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO KNEW MORE THAN THEY DID E.G.

In my opinion, the book was very well done for a person looking for some real insight into the technical parts of the discovery of the structure DNA.I recomend it for a person trying to learn about the discovery of DNA from a scientific standpoint, or for someone doing a research report. However I would not reccomend this book for an individual looking for an easy read. This book will go hand in hand with a high intensity biology or bio-chem class, but not for a \\"hobby reader\\".In conclusion, I give this book 3 out of 5 stars; I think the intensity and density of the technical terms at times were difficult to get through and brought down the enjoyment of certain parts of the book, but once past the technicallities I think that this book was very interesting and great insight to the real story behind one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I bought this used Double Helix for my MCB reading.

Older, which is what I was expecting. The book took a long time to get here though. I am glad I didn't need it for class yet!"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"There have been so many books written about the discovery of the DNA, and after some browsing, I decided to pick this one (at least, seems to be most popular).Watson describes in vivid detail the happenings that precipitated in the final moment. It is really a story of drama, espionage, deception and a little bit of exploratory science. Captivating narrative and inspiring in some ways. But, not the &quot;high class&quot; I was expecting.Personal Chatter:The book gave glimpses of how much pressure &quot;doing science&quot; can be. I thought pure science (or at least the kind that gets people the Nobel) is generally done with a pristine pursuit of the truth with not much time pressures. But, in the world of annual conferences, research paper deadlines, high profile spending, and expectations of &quot;ROI&quot; in almost anything, it was only a matter of time before any serious science had to answer to corporate/defense spending and peer pressures. In light of such a situation, it is no surprise that there can be people who actually have a game-plan (and in some ways, a business plan) to get the Nobel prize. Venture Capitalists invest in people and ideas to make companies that will be bought by others or will go public. Defense spending (and increasingly corporate spending) invests in scientists to get big-tag prizes, and protectionist patents that will give them first dibs at cash-cow-products/projects. At least, that is the reality of today."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Before one sits down to read this novel, you must first understand that it is the personal account of James Watson, one of two Nobel Prize laureates who won the race in the discovery of DNA. As a result of his singular perspective, certain aspects will be biased to a given degree, an example being his views on Rosalind Franklin (an individual whom many believe Watson stole research material from).In this novel Watson actively reflects his trials and tribulations in his struggle to research the biochemical deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). As he unravels his tales and discoveries leading up to his ultimate success, Watson, humorously adds his own sense of style and wit in the telling of his personal encounters as well as Crick's (his partner). He is also able to balance the pros and the cons of his tedious scientific exploration. At times thoroughly illustrating his frustration in his attempts to understand DNA.Reading this novel allows a reader to easily identify Watson's passion and drive in his analyzes of DNA in correlation to other \\"building blocks\\" of life (e.g. RNA). These characteristics provide an explanation why he is so willing to further investigate DNA even after its discovery as a unique structure, unlike other scientists within the same field of research.Although this is not a difficult novel to peruse through, \\"What is all the hype about?\\" is a question that may resurface several times within the reader's mind. Thus, one must remember the time frame in which this discovery was made. Unlike our current scientific advances in the field of genetics, Watson and Crick were pioneers (along with a handful of others) in this field and prompted a new branch of biology as well as biochemistry to evolve as a result of their findings. Without this discovery many questions regarding medical and health issues would still be left unanswered. More importantly our current understanding of genetics would not be where it is today. Let alone the discoveries made within the Human Genome Project."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The Double Helix, by James D. Watson is a great book. I have learned a lot by reading this book. It is a simple book that contains lots of humor. I have discovered that Watson is a smart, but at the same time funny, while competing with an admired scientist, Linus Pauling. Watson makes the book fun to read because he conveys his process vividly and shows how important DNA is to the world. All of this started in a dumpy, worn down chemical lab at Cambridge University called \\"The Cavendish.\\" Watson was interested in investigating the structure of DNA to gain more insight into genetics. James Watson shows that his discovery was also part of Francis Crick, his partner that helped him. However, Crick was sometimes not very helpful because he wondered off. Watson had to get use to the structure of Cambridge where they had meals and everyone sat together on a special table on an elevated platform and were expected to engage in an enlightened conversation. I also like the part where Watson is honest by showing his ignorance on X-ray crystallographic techniques. I also enjoy the sarcasm in chapter 15 where they say, \\"After Pauling's success, no one could claim that faith in helices implied anything but an uncomplicated brain.\\" Also the information from page 83 describes that ratio of bases of DNA: where A-T and C-G, which is what I have learned in class. Therefore, I believe that The Double Helix is a great book worth reading because it does not contain much technical terms and is also a short book that will show important the discovery of DNA was and still is to the world."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"James Watson's book, The Double Helix, gives the not-so-scientific public excellent insight into how the scientific process was put to work less than fifty years ago to make a discovery that changed everything we know about biology and medicine. In an age where science is becoming increasingly important yet even less understood, this book portrays science as the dectective story that it is while throwing a delightfully human light on the scientists whose passion it is to unravel the puzzell. A quick, enjoyable, and necessary read for anyone who is or ever has been interested in science, as well as anyone else who likes a good &quot;detective&quot; story."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Though the structure of DNA is now common knowledge to virtually everyone (both scientist and layman alike), reading this book really put into context the excitement of of having made this huge discovery. I really enjoyed reading this little book and it actually changed my perception of researchers from &quot;strange people with thick glasses who spend their whole day looking at a dark spot on some rare beetle&quot; to &quot;interesting people with somewhat thin glasses who still spend their whole day looking at some dark spot on a beetle&quot;. Seriously, if you think science is boring - this book is especially for you. Recommended"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book was a great success when it came out, more because of what it revealed about the persons involved than becasue it revealed any great insights about DNA. The story it told was far from the public's preconceived notions about dry, dull scientists plodding away relentlessly towords some foregone conclusion. This was a story with sex, intrigue, gossip and a great race to see who would win the big prize- since it was well known that whoever cracked the structure of DNA was a shoe-in for a Nobel.Reading it today, over 40 years after in was published, and after a brief career in scientific research, I'm struck not so much by the antics of Watson and Crick as I am by the cavelier way they denigrated their rivals, poached on thier areas of research, and stole from them when necessary. Especially noteworthy is the way women were abused in this old-boy world. You don't have to be a radical feminist to be astounded at the way the abuse heaped on females in general, and on Rosalind Franklin in particular.Franklin was the first to produce the excellent x-ray crystallography that led Watson and Crick to their insights into the structure of DNA. With little regard for her or her work, they used her data without permission in their publications, and were pleased when a researcher with a dislike for intelligent and independant women arranged for Franklin to be sent away to another institute- and essentially banned from continuing work on DNA. Franklin produced a wealth of good work in other areas, and tragically died young before her story could be told.Writing &quot;The Double Helix&quot; ten years after the events of the book, and though acknowledging some of Franklin's contributions, Watson still seems loathe to give her any real credit. In the epilogue he acknowledges that her contributions were under valued at the time, yet he resists stating the obvious- that without her work, his would not have been possible. She truely deserved equal credit with Watson and Crick (and Wilkins) in the discovery of the double helix.Read this book, but also read &quot;Rosalind Franklin and DNA&quot; by Anne Sayre for a more complete picture."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Although The Double Helix by James D. Watson is not the most riveting-can't-put-it-down book, it does offer a fascinating first-hand account of the events leading up to one of the most impacting scientific discoveries ever. Its manifestation of the unique existence of a scientist exposes what type of competitions, manipulation, and discovery exist in the science arena.The introduction of other key figures who played prominent and influential roles in the discovery of the DNA structure is at the very least, enlightening. The network of knowledge necessary to ensure there are no foibles in a key discovery is something that the general public may have never taken into account. Also, it evinces the professional barriers that exist between the genders. The back story of Rosalind \\"Rosie\\" Franklin is fascinating as it examines the \\"glass ceiling\\" and what type of personality a woman needs to adopt in order to survive in a male dominated field. The end of the end of the book-where Watson realizes her seemingly callous attitude emanates from her essential need to incorporate survival methods is refreshing. The science terms are difficult to follow if one does not have previous scientific background, but there is enough universality imbedded into the story to keep a reader's attention.Another aspect that proves to be surprising is the fact that scientists are not without their weak fields-just because they excel in chemistry does not mean they are equally capable in biology. Reading of how Watson and Crick were unsuccessful on several occasions somehow made them human-like they were mortals rather than some higher power intellectuals. Somehow, there seems to be an idea or stigma attached to scientists that suggest they are always brilliant and do not make mistakes. This book sheds that concept.Watson and Crick needed to do research, work hard, and learn from their mistakes in order to accomplish their objective. They even needed help from their friends. They beat out a great scientist in Linus and won the \\"DNA Race.\\" Their discovery has changed the world, and this book depicts them in a humble role-two guys doing their job."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"this is easily one of my favorite books. some dislike it for watson's dramatization of certain social elements in the story, and for the way in which crick and watson made their discovery. but i think the book should be appreciated as a text which makes science more accessible to the general public. and perhaps most impressive is how watson does manage to include some science in a way which i think will not distract the lay reader, or bore him."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This is the story of the search for the structure of DNA, told by the one who (with Francis Crick) discovered it. But it's far more than that. It is also the story of a young man who tries to find his way in the world of science. The book is very well written, in a charming informal style. However, this is a highly personal account, and should not be considered as the objective truth about the subject. Especially the fans of Rosalind Franklin will testify this. Nevertheless, I recommend this book if you want to savour the thrill of scientific discovery."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This firsthand account of the discovery of DNA dispels a lot of the notions that ousiders have about how science really works. Watson's descriptions of the competition, politics, dead ends, personality clashes, mistakes, and eventually inspiration reveal that discovery is not as clear-cut a process as it sometimes might seem.Watson is honest in his introduction that his account is just that, the story told through his own point of view, complete with possible faulty memories and personal prejudices. I was intrigued by the portrayals of the personalities of so many famous figures that I've been learning about for years in my biology and genetics classes - Francis Crick, of course, along with Maurice Wilikins, Rosalind Franklin, Linus Pauling, and many more. I was touched by Watson's admission at the end of the book that his unfavorable impressions of Rosalind Franklin stemmed from the fact that she was a woman trying to make a name for herself in the male-dominated world of scientific research in the 1950s.There is quite a bit of biological jargon in this book, and though it could probably be read by someone without any knowledge of genetics, it will be appreciated more by readers with some background. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in genetics and science."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The structure of DNA was discovered before I was born. This book allowed me to look back to a time when the structure of DNA was unknown. Could proteins be the genetic material? Seems like it since there are so many amino acids. Could DNA be the genetic material? But how could only 4 bases create such diversity? How could these 4 bases possibly fit together? These are questions that every scientist now knows the answers to. But these questions used to be very puzzling. &quot;The Double Helix&quot; truly is a personal account in the race to discover the structure. The book explains the many ideas that were considered, the fears that someone would beat them to it, and the feeling of triumph when they knew they had succeeded. &quot;The Double Helix&quot; is a book for scientist and non-scientist alike."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I think the Double helix is a wonderful and entertaining book to read. The great scientist James D. Watson clearly describes about the discovery of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) structure, which can be consider to be the greatest discoveries in the millennium. The author is very detailed in explaining how, when and where the discovery took place. He emphasizes on the role of recreation and day dreaming in the context of everyday life in sparking fresh insights towards possible connections. He also explains his motivations of research and his ambitions in getting a noble prize. I think Watson's style is very personable as he includes a lot of stories about his life such as personal vanities, annoying mannerisms and even his formal dinning parties. I think this book is fun to read and can be shared among children as to motivate them in expanding their ideas."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The book is a first hand story from Watson, who along with Francis Cricks was the first to formulate the double helical structure of the gene. Watson writes candidly about the frustrations, setbacks, anguishes and the breakthroughs involved in the process of discovery. The intense rivalry between different labs, particularly between Cambridge (Watson & Cricks) and Pauling (in the US) is insightful. Key players at the time were acutely aware that whoever solved the puzzle would have a place in scientific history, and rightly so. Competition is perhaps a good thing, even in the sciences!Key observations / points from the Double Helix:i. Watson's openness about the failures, progress, wrong turns, thought processes and other associated aspects of research.ii. Cricks' incredible confidence (arrogance?) and commitment - he worked with Watson despite clear direction from Bragg (Sir Lawrence Bragg, the lab Director) to focus on his PhD.iii. Open communication between smart people is critical to success. Scientific development seems to revolve around that. Why is business generally so poor at doing this - communicating?iv. A combination of theoretical, experimental (x-ray / lithography) and model building (it is hard to think in 3d, but easy to see) was critical to the ultimate solution. Particularly the latter, model building. This reminded me of Richard Feynman's book (Surely You are Joking Mr Feynman) where he describes something very similar. Theoretical folks obtain insights from experiments and vice versa.v. Hanging around smart and communicative people is a good thing and should be aspired to - something I am lacking at the moment.vi. Watson learned fundamentally new fields (after some considerable reluctance) from scratch after discovering that he had to learn them.vii. Intense rivalry between different labs for solving the gene structure first.viii. Watson's comments that it was much more satisfying to try and have a shot at glory by attempting to solve the gene structure than to never have risked a thought. Reminded me of other academic environments. Even if business people and / or academics adopted a very small part of the general principle that Watson and Cricks' did, they would be much more innovative.ix. Have fun. Watson and Cricks spent a lot of time travelling, eating out, drinking, chasing girls, attending parties - they seemed to be acutely aware of the fact that they (particulary Watson) would be labelled boring and thus strived to be interesting. Have (am?) i been guilty of that as well??x. No ego. Watson, Cricks and most others in the community apprear to talk straight, admit to faults quickly, learn and progress.Overall, a candid first-hand account of the pursuit of the discovery of the \`secret of life' - a must read."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The earlier chapters are somewhat disorganized, but understandably so perhaps: Watson is not exactly a writer. \\"The Double Helix\\" is a fascinating tale about how DNA structure was discovered and understood in detail. It is written in novel form, like a biography - which adds a little more humanity and simplicity to it all. Therefore, anyone can read it.As you get to the middle, it gets quite involved as Watson narrates the ups and downs that he and Crick (and others) encountered. He also writes about the jealousies, tensions, and hardships in science research. He describes his partner, Francis, as a constant talker - almost obnoxious. I found the way Watson described Rosalind Franklin a little unsettling. It seems that he just casts her off as a choleric woman having a hard time in a men's world of science and research. It's clear that he doesn't give her the recognition she deserves. I doubt that Watson and Crick would have solved the structure of DNA without Rose's hard work in crystallography and x-rays.On another note however, it's good that Watson wrote this book when events were still fresh in his mind, as he claims. As for DNA itself...people shall keep on making more and more discoveries a thousand years from now. Watson and Crick (and others) just helped hurl things up to the horizon. Discoveries on DNA, chromosomes, genes, etc. shall continue to unprecedented heights. And who knows what else is out there that we don't know?I almost gave it 4 stars, but truth be told: my mind was less than piqued by Watson's writing style. And maybe if he showed the tiniest bit of respect for Ms. Franklin, her contributions, and her hard work."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"\\"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\\"Isaac Newton.No better words could be used to describe the discovery of the double helix structure of the DNA.In The Double Helix, Nobel Prize Winner James D. Watson describes the events which led to his discovery, with Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, of the double helix structure.Major scientific advances are not made in isolation, so we get critical vignettes of titans like Linus Pauling, Lawrence Bragg, as well as his co-workers. We are treated to an unembellished account of missteps, false starts, and overblown egos. This straight-to-the-heart book emotes the milieu of the UK educational system in the 60s.In plain language with a smattering of technical jargon, we are shown how this mystery was solved not with the arcane tools of the trade, but rather with the age-old faculty called commonsense.Very few science books captivate one's attention like Watson's. Beyond being a tell-most of the race to unravel the DNA structure, the Double Helix shows us how far we can go when, determined, we swim against the tide of conventional wisdom."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in either learning about DNA or furthering his or her studies and knowledge on the subject. This was an entertaining, short read with a large amount of information packed into one book. The information was comprehensible and easy to read, which made understanding the contents much easier. James Watson, the author of the book, speaks not only of his research with Francis Crick, but his relationships with most members of the DNA team; Maurice Wilkins, Linus Pauling, and Rosalind Franklin are all characters in the book. It's interesting to read Watson's views on these people, but if it's one complaint I have about this book it is that it is in the point of view in which you can only understand Watson's views. You do not fully understand what these other people contributed. It is a very bias piece book. It's pretty sad that after all the work Rosalind Franklin did, she is not recognized as genuinely as Watson and Crick are. It is sad that she died probably of cancer, and as a result of her work with radiation.As previously stated, this book was very informative, but not overly scientific. The vocabulary was explained, which was helpful, coming from someone who does not have a very large genetic vocabulary to begin with. Watson is quite humorous, as he once states that he likes to be \\"seated near the evenings box of chocolates.\\" He talks about his personal life, too, as opposed to simply stating the facts that he has discovered while working with DNA. He talks about his sister, Elizabeth Watson, and he talks about his disliking of \\"Rosy\\" Franklin. Watson journeyed to many different colleges throughout his life, and he speaks of those with the highest dignity.This book was an overall good to read. It was very informative yet also enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"(Referring to the UK Penguin edition, 1971)As Dr. Joe Black of Louisiana College Professor Emeritus attests, &quot;It reads like a great mystery&quot;--a rarity for science books of the popular thread.This book truly is the exciting account of Watson and Crick's race to discover the structure of DNA. The book is as plainly entertaining as that. Watson writes with plain elegance, which no offense to most scientists, is refreshing. The author relates not only his excitement and energy of his work toward the Double Helix, but also the (now) historical context of the race to discover as well as the immense gravity of the implications of its discovery.The reader does absorb a little science jargon in the descritions of the biological and physics work of Watson and Crick respectively, but the writing is so direct that it appeals to the lay reader. It is a must read for any student interested in medical and/or biological research and genetics. Science has come a long way since the discovery of DNA's structure and this book describes the event that changed the course of science forever."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Watson and Crick's discovery has been compared to Darwin's for biological impact and it would be fair to rate Watson's book alongside Darwin's &quot;Voyage of the Beagle&quot; as a work of scientific literature.

No one else who has tried to tell this story comes close to this protagonist's inside version."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I am a college student in Northern California and an extra credit oppertunity was presented if we read this book. In college we read many books some of which are very boring to read and this sounded like one to me. It was imperitive that I did all I could for my Biology class so I went out and purchased the story of James Watson and Francis Crick. I love to read adventure stories and this book (Double Helix) was a great adventure novel. I had no idea that a scientist has the ability to write a story of discovering DNA in adventure format. James Watson was much like myself, and I could relate to him real well when he went on to write about how he wanted to avoid different aspects of science just like myself. All he was interested in was genetics and DNA extraction and he would do all it takes to put himself in the position of discovering the Double Helix. Through some luck and alot of knowledge Watson and Crick meet up with each other and went on to eventually decoding DNA. I recommmend this book to all that are interested in reading a great adventure story about Watson and his travels through Europe and what eventually brought him to meet one of the worlds greatest scientist ever.

For instance, the inclusion of letters to Rosalind Franklin and Linus Pauling's thoughts on nucleic acid structure from his notebook just add many more layers to a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"+++++In this book (first published in 1968), \\"Honest Jim\\" (as a scientist friend called him) or Dr. James Dewey Watson has explained his \\"version of how the structure of DNA was discovered\\" and \\"this account represents the way [he] saw things then, in [the fall of] 1951 [to the spring of] 1953.\\" (The discovery was announced in April 1953.) That is, he has \\"attempted to re-create [his] first impressions of the relevant events and personalities\\" that he encountered along the way to making the discovery. Thus, understand this is not a book of historical facts.Also, because of the personal nature of this book Watson states that \\"many of the comments [that he makes] may seem one-sided and unfair, but this is often the case in the incomplete and hurried way in which human beings decide to like or dislike a new idea or [a new] acquaintance.\\"This book revolves around five main people:(1) Dr. Francis Crick (1916 to 2004) of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England(2) Dr. James Watson (born 1928) also of the Cavendish Laboratory(3) Dr. Rosalind Franklin (1920 to 1958) of King's College, a division of the University of London(4) Dr. Maurice Wilkins (1916 to 2004) also of King's College(5) Dr. Linus Pauling (1901 to 1994) of the California Institute of Technology.However, along the way the reader meets many other people, both scientists and non-scientists.As Watson explains, the above five people are in a \\"race\\" to discover DNA's structure. However, I got the impression that neither Franklin nor Wilkins knew they were in a race. By the end of the race, Watson was \\"one of the winners\\" who shared the Nobel Prize in 1962 with Crick and Wilkins.According to the official Nobel Prize internet site, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins won a shared Nobel Prize in physiology \\"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material.\\"This 29-chapter (with epilogue) book is a fast read (but only if you gloss over the science parts). As Watson proceeds in this story, you'll find that he is quite sociable and takes us to such places as pubs, restaurants, and \\"smashing\\" parties.As you read this book, you'll find that there is considerable tension between Watson and Franklin (who was an expert in X-ray diffraction crystallography) as well as between Wilkins and Franklin.For me, this book imparts four major things:(1) THE THRILL OF DISCOVERY. That is, this book effectively conveys, especially in the latter chapters, the struggle to find the correct answer. With each chapter, the anticipation mounts toward the final climax: the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA.(2) HOW SCIENCE IS DONE. For example, both Watson & Crick and Pauling used molecular models while Franklin & Wilkins used X-ray crystallography. However, all science is not done as it is conveyed in this book. As Watson states, \\"styles of scientific research vary almost as much as human personalities.\\"(3) THE QUESTION OF ETHICS IN SCIENCE. For example, Wilkins told Watson secretly that Franklin \\"had evidence for a new three-dimensional form of DNA.\\" When Watson \\"asked what the pattern [of this new form] was like, [Wilkins] went into the adjacent room to pick up an [X-ray diffraction] print [or photograph] of [this] new form [called the 'B' form]\\" and showed it to Watson. This was done without Franklin's permission. It turns out that this X-ray photo was critical and \\"gave several...vital helical parameters.\\"(4) WATSON'S HONESTY. In all of this book, Franklin is portrayed as an unattractive, unapproachable, and angry person whose scientific work is questionable. However, in the book's epilogue Watson devotes the last two paragraphs to her and her achievements. He admits that \\"my initial impressions of her, both scientific and personal...were often wrong\\" and that she was a person of \\"personal honesty and generosity\\" as well as of \\"intelligence.\\"Two good features of this book are that it has photographs (a total of 19) and diagrams (a total of 11) throughout. My favorite photo is the one captioned \\"X-ray diffraction photograph of DNA, B form\\" taken by Franklin in late 1952. My favorite diagram is captioned \\"Schematic illustration of the double helix.\\"This book was written for a general audience so they could experience the thrill of this revolutionary discovery. Thus, I was surprised that it had no chapter table of contents (but the photos and diagrams each have one), no chapter headings, and no index. I feel these would have made the book more user friendly.Also, I feel what was needed was a science glossary and name index/page. The former is needed because the reader encounters many scientific terms (especially those related to DNA) and thus a glossary would make the science more accessible to the general reader. The latter is needed because Watson encounters many people and a name index/page would have helped the reader keep track of these names. Besides Watson talked with other scientists to clarify ideas, and in a way they indirectly contributed to the discovery. Thus, a name index/page would have acknowledged their indirect contribution.Finally, in the epilogue Watson states, \\"All of [the major] people [in this book], should they desire, can indicate events and details they remember differently.\\" Thus, I recommend these books:(1) \\"Linus Pauling: Scientist and Peacemaker\\" (2001). In this book, refer to the science article entitled \\"The Triple Helix\\" which describes the race to discover DNA's structure. Note Pauling's observations throughout the article.(2) \\"Rosalind Franklin and DNA\\" (first published in 1975) by Anne Sayre. This book clears up Watson's misconceptions about Franklin who died in 1958.(3) \\"The Third Man of the Double Helix\\" (2003) by Maurice Wilkins. Wilkins finally speaks out on what really happened from his perspective.In conclusion, Dr. James Watson tells us honestly his version of how the structure of DNA was discovered. He effectively conveys the struggle to find the right answer and the thrill of discovery. Don't deny yourself from reading this exciting book but be sure to read the recommended books to get the full story.*** 1/2+++++"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"_________________________________________________________________When &quot;The Double Helix&quot; came out in 1968, as a geneticist I naturally read it. And it has stuck far more firmly for me than any of the many other books I've read over the years about genetics.Why do I remember this book so well? I've wondered. The answer is right in the first sentence of &quot;The Double Helix&quot; that reads: &quot;I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood.&quot;In his account of how the structure of DNA was discovered, Jim Watson doesn't try to tell the story from a disinterested point of view. This is my version, he says, and I'm not going to touch it up to cover the warts and other blemishes. Yes, for instance, Watson and Crick were patently and terribly unfair and unjust toward Rosalind Franklin but Jim doesn't deny it. He makes it plenty clear.Most writing in and about science is well varnished. But varnish gives a gloss and it's not easy to hold onto. Jim Watson forgot the varnish, on purpose. Watson's brashness (and Crick's conceit) season this narrative in a memorable way, a way I can't easily forget, even if I wanted to.This is first-rate personal science writing. Five stars, for sure, or more. It's about one of the most important discoveries in the history of science.

You definitively catch a sense of the urgency of their research. I was flipping pages nervously, like i didn't know Watson and Crick were the ones who won the race.In the edition i have, Watson is very thankful about the contributions that Rosalind Franklin made to their discovery. He is crystal clear about how she was the one convinced that the backbone was on the outside, and had not he followed her advice, it would have taken him even longer to figure out the structure, and who knows?, Pauling might have gotten there first. In the epilogue, Watson is all praise about Rosalind, acknowledges how his opinions about her were often wrong, how excellent the quality of her work was, and ponders about the obstacles that she encountered in her career in science for being a woman.I wonder if these comments were missing in other people's books, because according to their critiques, one comes out with the idea that Watson and the male-dominated scientific establishment gave Rosalind the cancer that killed her.This is an excellent, honest account of an event that took place when the author was 25 years old. I could not believe my eyes when i read that sentence. Twenty-five, worrying about girls and tennis and the structure of the most important molecule in the universe. These facts might count for something. This is a must-read book, for everybody, whether you understand science or not."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This firsthand account of the discovery of DNA dispels a lot of the notions that ousiders have about how science really works. Watson's descriptions of the competition, politics, dead ends, personality clashes, mistakes, and eventually inspiration reveal that discovery is not as clear-cut a process as it sometimes might seem.Watson is honest in his introduction that his account is just that, the story told through his own point of view, complete with possible faulty memories and personal prejudices. I was intrigued by the portrayals of the personalities of so many famous figures that I've been learning about for years in my biology and genetics classes - Francis Crick, of course, along with Maurice Wilikins, Rosalind Franklin, Linus Pauling, and many more. I was touched by Watson's admission at the end of the book that his unfavorable impressions of Rosalind Franklin stemmed from the fact that she was a woman trying to make a name for herself in the male-dominated world of scientific research in the 1950s.There is quite a bit of biological jargon in this book, and though it could probably be read by someone without any knowledge of genetics, it will be appreciated more by readers with some background. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in genetics and science."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Several previous reviewers of &quot;The Double Helix&quot; have, rightly it seems, upbraided Watson for his negative portrait of Rosalind Franklin and his downplaying of her contributions to his and Crick's elucidation of the structure of DNA. The new book by Meyer Friedman and Gerald Friedland, &quot;Medicine's Ten Greatest Discoveries,&quot; of course contains a chapter on this achievement, interestingly entitled &quot;Maurice Wilkins and DNA.&quot; It tells the story of Franklin's involvement with the DNA research and the political abuse to which she was treated during her fellowship at Kings College London--a post from which she was ultimately fired. It also shows how Franklin's conflict with Wilkins--and his with her--probably cost the two of them the first prize in the race for the discovery. It was a race which Watson &amp; Crick won by a whisker."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The title of the book says it all - this is a &quot;personal account of the discovery of the structure of DNA.&quot; Told from the point of view of James Watson, who later shared the Nobel Prize with Crick and Wilkins for the discovery. Both Crick and Watson were theorists, who analysed other peoples' data (I've heard more than one biochemist say they &quot;stole&quot; it from Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin) and correctly deduced the double-helix structure of DNA.The drama mostly centres on Cambridge and King's College, the universities where these scientists were studying/working at the time. Also figuring prominently in the story is Linus Pauling, winner of 2 Nobel Prizes (one in chemistry, the other for peace). He was hot on the trail and this competition that gives the narrative a driving energy. It's interesting that both he and the Watson/Crick combo both independently came up with a triple-helix structure with the backbone on the inside before W &amp; C turned that idea inside out and put the backbone in the correct position, on the outside.This brings us to the contribution of Rosalind Franklin. Her contribution to the discovery are significant - she first expounded the idea that the backbone must be on the outside, and her X-ray diffraction pictures led C &amp; W to a helical structure. She did not win the Nobel Prize - the reason is not because she was female or difficult to work with, but because she passed away at 37, before the prize was awarded. Whether her gender or personality would have excluded her were she still alive is, of course, debatable.What is most enjoyable about this book, however, is the personal style - Watson gives us an inside look at London, time spent in pubs, boring conferences, and his relationship with Watson, Bragg, and other famous scientists in London and elsewhere. This is the personal aspect, and he makes no qualms about telling unflattering stories about these people (and himself). These include run-ins with Franklin, Bragg, and his first postdoctoral advisor. Throw in a healthy dose of interdisciplinary squabbling (biologists vs. chemists vs. physicists) and you get an entertaining story of one of the most important discoveries of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I read this book as a requirement for my undergraduate biology class, but I ended up enjoying it quite thoroughly. I think the depiction of Watson &amp; Crick, as well as their adventure to discover the Double Helix as naturally assumed by pairs of DNA, was far more entertaining than one would assume coming from a \\"science\\" book. There are really three major points that make this an interesting read. (1)The unbelievable ease of reading in this book was unexpected. One would normally assume that a \\"science\\" book would be difficult to say the least but in fact the layout of the book was really reader friendly. (2)The race against another, more well-known scientist, in Linus Pauling to discover the structure of DNA, and (3) the teamwork approach to this discovery that Watson &amp; Crick took. I was personally enthralled with the overall competition between the two different groups and how Watson, Crick, and Franklin came together to add to one purpose. It was very interesting to see all of them bring something different to the table in regards to their scientific specialties. Overall I thought the book was an excellent read but I was surprised to see the personality clashes with Watson and Franklin. I would recommend this work for anyone who has a creative want to learn more about the human side of science and DNA in general."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Many people undoubtedly never pick up this book because they think science is too boring or too complex to make for a true page-turner. How wrong they are! This is edge-of-your-seat fascinating. I doubt that Watson could write a super suspense novel, but he did something greater. In my humble opinion, he wrote one of the finest books of scientific achievement ever written. Pick up the book and read."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"\\"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of The Structure of DNA\\", James D.

Nasar. 8 1/2\\" x 5 1/2\\".Written by Dr. James D. Watson in 1968, reprinted several times, this is one of the most intriguing, personal stories of scientific endeavors written to unravel the molecular basis of heredity and the genetic code of life itself, the DNA molecule - deservingly referenced as the Holy Grail of scientific inqiry. With an explanatory apology, Watson describes his maturation from an initial lazy undergraduate at Univ. of Chicago having primary interest in ornithology and avoiding chemistry and physics courses,to doing post-doctoral research abroad, first in Copenhagen and subsequently in Cambridge where he began serious research with Francis Crick that culminated in elucidating the molecular structure of the double helix DNA molecule with base-pairing of A-T and G-C, allowing a model construct possessing correspondence to its X-ray crystalline lattice structure. Much of the time it appeared to a 'Mission Impossible'. Success came in 1953, Watson was then 25 years old.The author's prose and pace of relating this story reveals the passion of his quest to establish his mark in science - and he relates intimate anecdotes of his cohorts, teachers and the scientific cult of divisions enjoyed by the scholarly, erudite academicians in England and elsewhere. In the end, he shared along with his associate Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins, the Nobel Prize in 1962. The future of medicine was forever changed. The book is a compelling, refrehing read for anyone with a modicum of curiosity - a science background is not essential."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I ended up getting copies of two different paperback editions.The Simon & Schuster Touchstone Book, with a little bit of an introduction by Sylvia Nasar, has easy-to-read print and the photographs are pleasantly large. Good for reading in the subway.But the Norton Critical edition, edited by Gunther S. Stent, is the one to get if you can only afford one. Its typeface leaves much to be desired, and, in my copy, some of the pages are hard to read because the printer seems to have run out of ink in the middle of the job. But the edition has materials that are indispensable for an understanding of this classic work of science. I enjoyed, most of all, Stent's essay \\"reviewing the reviews,\\" showing both the wisdom (by some) and the foolishness (by others) with which the Double Helix was received by the scientific community."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"First, I would like to say I am not a scientist or aspiring to be one. This book was recommended to me by a professor. Although I am just an ordinary person, I am glad that I read the book. I had a hard time understanding the technical side of the book, but the personal side was a definitely understandable.Watson's portrayal of what a scientist has to go through in order to become a great one had me interestedt to the very end. I felt myself riding the emotional train that he and his colleagues were on. Everytime he thought that he had &quot;it,&quot; (the answer to DNA) had me at the edge of my seat.I did not know that such a simple concept to us now required so much work and discipline to uncover. The amount of trials and errors that he and his colleagues had to go through to achieve it. It is just an astounding accomplishment. He not only had to figure out the key to DNA but he also had to persevere superiors always looking &quot;over his shoulder,&quot; less than enthusiastic colleagues, and lastly people, who just did not want him to succeed. For someone to overcome all of those obstacles is just amazing and they deserve to reap the rewards of all that nerve racking work.In conclusion, this book is a great read even if you are not hoping to win the Nobel prize or any other scientific prize."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book give lots of information on DNA and is detailed on the events that took place while workin in the lab in England.

The novel gave a closer look into the discoverers and how an amazing task, such as the discovery of the structure of DNA, is produced. I chose to read this book for my AP Biology class and was not enthusiastic in the beginning. I believed that I would need a medical dictionary at my side for reference. However, my hypothesis was disproven and I understood the makings of the DNA.

James Watson was only 24 when he and Francis Crick (who was supposed to be working on his PhD) discovered the \\"secret of life.\\"I really enjoyed reading about this process of scientific discovery. Watson is very candid about his limitations. He discusses his reluctance to learn different subjects because they are too hard. He talks about reading journal articles and attending talks and not understanding anything.What stood out was his determination to understand DNA. He knew it was important and he was willing to do what it took to discover its structure. He spent a lot of time thinking about it and a lot of time seeking out people who could teach him what he needed to know to continue making progress. I think that this determination was the major reason for his success."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Honest yet condescending and superficial. These adjectives would be the best way of describing not only the tone of this memoir, but also the personality of its author, the famed James D. Watson who, with the help of others, discovered the structure of DNA. The slight tome gives a unique, inside-look at the inner workings and egos of the scientific community, especially in regards to winning fame and renown. In fact, that seems to be the only goal - there isn't much regard to the fact that their biological work with DNA and helices could actually benefit society. The quest for the Nobel Prize is the dominant theme of the book, and the author is very alienating in this regard. The ending is abrupt and frankly anticlimactic, although, as previously stated, the honesty was rather refreshing. However, the memoir was filled with suspense and intriguing in its descriptions of bickering and competition between scientists. It would have been nice to see some analysis or reflection, but there is little imagery or imagination. The Double Helix is literal and informative, and distinguishes itself only by being the first of its kind. It's more personal than a thesis but less inspiring than a textbook."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book is an innaccurate version of events in the the discovery of teh structure of DNA. What most people don't know is that Rosalind Franklin was crucial to the discovery of the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick actually stole most of her data via Wilson, her supervisor, adn passed it off as their own discoverery. She was a brilliant scientist and should have been an independent researcher at Kings College, but because she was a woman she was made an assistant to Wilson. She was extremely dedicated and plowed through all the obstacles at Kings College. However, her supervisor, Wilson, showed most of her data to his old friend Crick, who shared it with his partner Watson. They too were studying DNA, although they were on completely wrong track. The data that was pilfered included the famous photo 51, which Franklin obtained over a course of years' work and revealed the spiral shape of DNA. They also positioned the competent of DNA, such as the bases, exactly as she hypothesized. Watson, Crick, and Wilson received the Nobel Prize, while Franklin could not, because she died at the age of 38 due to radiation exposure from the X-rays she used to capture photo 51. The men only mentioned her in passing when accepting their prize, and definitely not as the source of the actual discovery. Then Watson had the gall to write a book that casts her in a horrible light, as an inferior person who was bad tempered and selfishly hoarded her information. He also calls her \`Rosy' throughout the entire book, although she despised that name. He once even went up to Rosalind and demanded that she hand over her data. He was a complete bigot, and thought her inferior and was furious when she refused to share her own findings to him. He harps about her appearance in the book, and it is obvious that is the only way he perceives her, and not as a thinking person. And for the record, she was actually quite striking, and wore the latest in French fashions. She was extremely dedicated, and her level of determination would have been completely accepted in a man. That's why I give this book a one, and if I could I'd give it a zero. Watson is just begging for comeuppance for what he wrote in this book. I would reccomend reading other books about Rosalind's struggle, such as 'Rosalind Franklin: The dark lady of DNA'"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"While James Watson is not on the list of authors I'd generally recommend reading, this book is an exception. Those interested in the history of molecular biology should definitely read this book. Given the nature of the topic, it is light and enjoyable reading. Certainly this account is biased to some extent, which makes it necessary to read other books on the topic as well. Further reading on Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin, among other personalities mentioned in the Double Helix, are highly recommended, and necessary for fair balance."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"...not in the strictest sense, but those in the know realise what I'm talking about.Imagine the possibilites.

Watson chronicles James Watson's and Francis Crick's etraordinary discovery of the structure of DNA. This book shows the not only the critical problems and solutions they found but also Watson's thoughts and perceptions of the people around him. Watson's views of his colleagues Sir Lawrence Bragg, Max Perutz and his competitors Linus Pauling, Rosalind Franklin, and Maurice Wilkins are harsh and biased yet they still provide some insight. An interesting look at the competition that takes place between the scientists is also present as Crick and Watson race to be the first to solve the DNA mystery. Watson's description of glee at Linus Pauling's failure to find the structure of DNA shatters the idea that all scientists have a noble drive which is to improve the world.This book begins with Watson's various travels and studies. Before arriving at Cambridge his main focus had been bacterial and viral phages. However, after arriving in Cambridge and meeting Francis Crick, their shared interest in solving the DNA myestery exploded, and their efforts that would eventually lead to success began. It is important to note that during their time of model building and researching, both Crick and Watson were really supposed to be working on other projects. Their discovery, which revolutionized science, was produced during their spare time. Watson clearly explains the thought processes he and Crick underwent while also providing an imporved understanding of DNA.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun read. The Double Helix is short, informative, yet very entertaining. The language is easy to understand and all of the scientific topics are well explained. Watson's dry humor is spread throughout the book making it a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The Double Helix by James D. Watson is a true story based on the real life discovery of the structure of DNA. The book takes the reader on the journey from the beginning. It provides background information on what James Watson and Francis Crick, who co-discovered DNA, were doing. It starts with their early work that did not involve DNA at all. Watson soon becomes intrigued by DNA and when he met Crick in Cambridge some years later, peaked his interest also. This is where their story together began on their journey to finding one of the most important pieces of science ever discovered.Watson and Crick's brilliance are appreciated as they struggle through their problems in trying to work out the unknown and please their employer Sir Lawrence Bragg at the same time. At certain points in the story, both have to put DNA on hold, while they worked on other experiments as instructed. They keep working with the DNA structure in their spare time. When they reach a dead end, they start over and logically work their way through what they know. With the help of others, such as Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins and the use of their x-ray diffraction pictures and other technologies, they are able to obtain information that help them on their way to fame. Not only does this book provide the reader with information on Watson and Crick but gives insight on other scientists and their theories at that present time, such as Linus Pauling and his alpha helix. In the book's conclusion, it is finally revealed how Watson and Crick were able to discover the structure of DNA. With knowing how they discovered the structure, the reader is able to obtain a better understanding of what DNA is.This book is a very easy read. The language it contains is simplistic and easily understood. The book is not lengthy. It is well written and keeps the reader interested, but in turn, still teaches facts and the history of the discovery of the DNA structure. I highly recommend this book, if you are interested in science or not. It is an enjoyable read that provides the reader with information and some humor.

Watson and his clan's quest for the helixical structure of DNA made for an entertaining voyage within these pages. Unexpectedly, as many scientific based books that I have been privy to read lately, this book was very approachable, dare I say readable. The exploits recounted by Watson were very entertaining; they could even be considered witty and humorous although it was biosciences humor. The teamwork and competition aspects of the discovery of the double helix were unexpected but welcomed because I felt that they were the driving forces behind the people. I was impressed by Watson, Crick and Franklin all bringing something to the proverbial table even though I found it a tad bit lucky or coincidental, but that is how these things work sometimes. This, accompanied with the race against Linus Pauling (already a recognized scientist of the time) helped lend to an educational, insightful and entertaining few hours of reading about the basic structure of all of us.

It's great for knowing how exciting science can be (and should be) for the people involved. It's great in that it doesn't require too much, if any, technical knowledge to understand. My *only* complaint is inevitible -- it's one participant's view. I read this years ago, so I don't remember how much, if at all, Dr. Watson dealt with this, but how sad that the female scientist who the got much of their information from was not honored and is pretty much forgotten by most people, simply because she died before they were up for the Nobel Prize (the Nobel foundation doesn't award posthumously). And how ironic that she died from cancer brought on (most likely) by the machinerey she used to do her science.Read this book, it's great. Just keep some solemnity for those whose voices aren't quite heard."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Comments can be directed to respectfulempiricist.comThis is a marvelous little book that brings out impressions of the many great and not so great minds involved in the ultimate understanding of what DNA looks like and how it multiplies. As the title implies, Watson is describing his own subjective mental picture of the people and events that led up to his and Francis Crick's ultimate Nobel winning discovery, a discovery that has stood the test of time.Watson describes the personalities of the many people involved directly or otherwise. Though he uses kind words, it is apparent that different people and different times grated on him. He also describes his travels, academic frailties and personal loneliness. The latter while thinly veiled, was mentioned throughout the book.Though there was description throughout the memoir, it was not burdensome to the non scientist. I used a dictionary about five times and had my much more scientific daughter explain some things to me. While there is academic jargon it was not burdensome. I was able to read the book in nearly one setting as it was written for the layman to spend a little time inside the thinking and personality of a true genius and a humble one at that.Those of us who did not study science when it was convenient but rue it today, can read this book and learn something about the history of one of the finest events in scientific discovery."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Watson was brilliant in bringing pieces of his vague memory and prejudices.

This is amazing compared to the time it takes to read the hopeless eulogy given by Anne Sayer.However, as a man of considerable authority, Watson should have taken the usual scholary precautions and double-chekced when he was talking about &quot;people&quot;.

It's a funny book with a skewed view that he addresses in the prologue. It is his take on the events that revolved around the elucidation of the DNA structure.One of my \\"favorite\\" parts is when he is talking about attending Franklin's seminar on her X-ray crystallography. He admits his thoughts were: \\"what if she removed her glasses and did something novel with her hair?\\" Despite his personal downfalls his gung-ho and risky attitude sped up this important discovery. It is also a realistic view of the politics and competitive nature of a scientific career.I recommend this book to everyone. It is not written in a way that would be over anyone's head.

WatsonThe Double Helix is the tale of the ups and downs of an adventure shared by two men. This novel depicts the struggle of James Watson and Francis Crick to discover the structure of DNA while attempting to simultaneously focus on other tasks at hand. They yearn to make this discovery before rival biochemist Linus Pauling beats them to the punch to thus win the Nobel Prize, which is foreshadowed for whoever might secure this discovery. Having previously put their search on the shelf for a while Watson and Crick return to the task of solving DNA when Linus Pauling becomes presumably close to solving it himself. After much trial and error Watson finally comes to the idea of the double helix and base pairs which proves to be the correct structure for DNA.Watson is able to effectively captivate the reader and create a bridge for the reader to cross, enabling him or her to delve in the Watson's world of science. He is fully able to depict the complicated biochemistry that is present in his story in such a way that it is more easily comprehendible for his audience. Watson is successful in vividly relaying the accounts of his story with plentiful detail that creates a tremendous picture in the mind of the reader.On the other hand, constant reference to numerous scientists and other people is a cause of confusion for the reader as he or she tries desperately but usually ineffectively to recall which person was responsible for which action when they resurface at different times throughout the novel. The inclusion by Watson of all these characters removes and scatters the focus of audience from where he intends it to be, which is on his struggle with DNA.Despite this imperfection The Double Helix is still a great novel. It does so much to further the understanding the discovery of the structure of DNA. It is a great complimentary learning tool for anybody interested in biochemistry and DNA."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Ok. I'm giving this book a 4 because of the importance of the discover of the structure of DNA. In terms of actual reading material, however, I'd probably give it a 2 or 3. I do believe that James Watson is a great scientist, but he is not writer. His writing style is only adequete and far from interesting and he really doesn't do a great job of putting interest into the subject matter. Someone who does not have at least a little background in the general concepts or biology/organic chemistry/physics will probably not get much out of this book.Now on to the science side of the book. Watson describes the various events that took place while he, Franscis Crick, Maurice Wilkins, and Rosalind Franklin worked on discovering the structure of DNA. Again, Watson does not really put much vigor into these events but does describe them realistically (science can't always do interesting). He focuses on his relationship with Crick, battles with Franklin, and competetion with Linus Pauling--the Nobel prize winning chemist who ironically get the structure of DNA wrong. Through his writing, Watson at times reveals his pompousness and his ignorance of certain scientific concepts, but overall shows his devout eagerness of discovery.I would say that this is an important book to read if you are at all interested in science. However, it is probably too boring for just a fun read."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book by James Watson tells his story, in the years he worked on the structure of DNA. As another review noted, this is the story &quot;warts and all,&quot; including his and others' worries about grants being renewed, family, relationships, jealousy, pride, food, and living in England where the labs and accomodations were always cold in winter.I know almost no biology, and while a lot of the discussion was over my head scientifically, I followed the gist of it.The ghost of Rosalind Franklin continually follows James Watson. I've heard Dr. Watson speak publicly twice, and each time he was asked about her. When he was interviewed on NPR, the interviewer persistently went into the interactions between Watson and Franklin. The gist of his response is that she lost the recognition she should have gotten because she refused to collaborate and work with others, and she refused to work with models. Clearly, while Franklin's X-ray photograph of DNA was a major step in pointing Watson and Crick to the double helix AT GC structure of DNA, it was NOT a self-sufficient proof of the double helix, as she herself refused to consider a helical structure of DNA."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I would mostly echo the many accolades that James Watson's book has received on this site and over the years. *The Double Helix* is indeed a classic.However, after seeing 'The Secret of Photo 51' on PBS' Nova program, I realize now that Dr. Watson's work is science fiction rather than science.Like many other young science fans, I grew up with the accepted wisdom that the collective genius of James Watson and Francis Crick cracked the code of life: DNA. In college, I did hear about someone named Rosalind Franklin that was somehow wrongly denied a share of the glory in this magnificent achievement. At the time, being naive and ignorant as I was, I dismissed the contributions made by Rosalind Franklin as being merely that of a technical assistant (rather than as the KEY insight that it really was) and simply dismissed claims on her behalf as being those of the 'politically correct' rather than people sincere about preserving the integrity of science.I freely admit now that I was totally wrong. Rosalind Franklin's contributions to the discovery of the nature and structure of DNA was absolutely crucial to the magnificent moment of science that took place 50 years ago. It seems clear on the evidence that Watson nor Crick could ever have made the mental leaps and had the insights that they had had Dr. Franklin's work not been 'available' to them.What is more disturbing about this whole sordid affair is -- not that Dr. Franklin did not get all the accolades she deserved (which the scientific community is making belated ammends for) -- that Dr. Franklin's work was quite literally stolen from her ... she never gave permission for Watson &amp; Crick to have her results, they never informed her that they had surreptitious access to those results, and Watson &amp; Crick -- for all intents and purposes -- gave her no credit for her contributions.In the *Double Helix* -- rather than simply sweeping those inconvenient facts under the rug -- James Watson goes on to malign Dr. Franklin in both a personal and vicious manner. Even though she was one of the leading pioneers and pillars of X-ray crystallography, James Watson wrote in his book that 'Rosy' (as he derisively referred to her as ... never calling her by her proper name) was not capable of understanding her own results and suggested that she was a lowly technician rather than a leading researcher. To make matters worse, James Watson spent a great deal of time in his book on describing Dr. Franklin as being unattractive, unfeminine, and unsociable (in truth, she was a very attractive and vivacious woman).As I write this on April 25, 2003, the world is commemorating the publication in Nature of Watson &amp; Crick's supposed 'discovery' of the nature of DNA -- an event that heralded a new genomic age of science. The second paper in that issue of Nature after Watson &amp; Crick's paper was a paper by Rosalind Franklin and her graudate assistant Raymond Gosling. Dr. Franklin's paper contained a facsimile of 'Photo 51' -- the X-ray photo of DNA that was key to Watson &amp; Crick's fame and glory. Dr. Franklin's photo alone -- with absolutely no need for the 'insights' of Watson &amp; Crick -- proves the double helical struture of DNA.It seems tragically ironic that a book entitled *Double Helix* devotes so much ink to maligning and belittleing its real discoverer.In summary, if you view the *Double Helix* as a fictional account of how great and smart James Watson is and how homely and dull-witted 'Rosy' is, then this book is still a classic. But I don't think I can view the tale told in its pages the same way as I did before I knew the true history of the double helix."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book is a must for any body interested in how great discoveries actually happen. Watson is one of two who co-discovered the structure of DNA. This is his acount of the time of discovery. Watson fills the readers in on the details of how a discovery happens from both scientific and personal perspectives. Watson writes about how he and his partner Crick work their way towards one of the great dscoveries of the 20th century. Watson also writes about personal dislikes and how men and women of science can be every bit as petty as their lay counterparts. Watson writes about backbiting among the various scientists as well as the heady excitement of the work. This book is a must read because it is from the horses mouth and the horse did a great job."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"a lively account of the personal and professional life and quest for the structure of dna by a young brillant american in london . the science world of the 1950ies is brought to life complete with the zest for competition to advance knowledge and contribute . it is especially interesting due to the present advances in gene sequencing and the stem cell controversy. the regeneration of cells via dna is simply awesome and leads one to think THE MASTER DESIGNER OF THE UNIVERSE CREATED A BEAUTIFUL SYSTEM ."},{"Title":"The Global Etiquette Guide to Europe: Everything You Need to Know for Business and Travel Success (Global Etiquette Guides)","review":"I read this book in anticipation of a trip I am planning this summer. However, it offered much more than the typical travel guide! I learned that enjoying a new country as a tourist or resident means more than just seeing the sights. It means negotiating your way through social interactions with people who may behave in ways that are confusing and different from what the traveler knows or expects.This book offers clear and interesting explanations of various cultural beliefs and practices that I think would really be useful to any traveler.

In the case of the Czech and Slovak section, most of the words are spelled wrong and in some cases just wrong. I wonder who did the research? They should have consulted with a native speaker before the book went to print."},{"Title":"The Global Etiquette Guide to Europe: Everything You Need to Know for Business and Travel Success (Global Etiquette Guides)","review":"This is the type of book which leaves you asking (a) \\"Why didn't this book exist years ago?\\", (b) \\"Why didn't I have the brains to write it?\\". Had it existed when I, for one, took my first clueless steps in Europe all those neiges d'antan ago, I would have saved myself more verbal and gestural gaffes in a day than Dubya makes in a week. The ugly American/Australian/Englishman would simply cease to exist if this book were compulsory reading in high schools and universities. I did spot a few slips in the section on Britain - the Wars of the Roses were not at all religious in motivation, and the term \\"supper\\" (as a synonym for dinner) is usually applied by the British to children and dogs rather than to adults - but overall I am most impressed."},{"Title":"The Global Etiquette Guide to Europe: Everything You Need to Know for Business and Travel Success (Global Etiquette Guides)","review":"This books portrays an arrogant American view of Europe.

However, all the letters O and A have been changed into or , when a word with the letter appears, it has been changed into e. Some V's have been exchanged with U's, and so forth. A lot of words are just plainly spelled wrong. Don't expect to be understood by a native Dane when quoting this book.
