Indispensible! Better than a \\"map of the stars' homes\\" any day. Thoroughly recommended if you are planning to drive yourself around the various parts of L.A. looking for your particular favorite haunts. Thanks to this book, in 1997 I got to see (and exchange waves with) Jack Lemmon as he drove out of his driveway (no, I wasn't lying in wait. I'd pulled over to double check my location).Though I had far less time to use it on my 2007 trip, I would have felt naked and unprepared just travelling without it. Another great feature about this book is that the author encourages submissions/corrections/additions to add to future editions, so if you discover the rare incorrect or out-of-date piece of info, he wants you to submit it to him so the next edition will be just that much more accurate.Used the info in the book to track down the Playboy Mansion in 1997. Had a neat experience at the mansion gates that trip and have pics to prove it. When I drove by it again in 2007 a few hours before I was to attend a party there that evening, I glanced at the book over in the passenger seat of my rental car and gave it a knowing smile.My copy is autographed. Don't know if that increases its value, but it is a nice touch."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Hollywood Tour Book (2nd Edition)","review":"The Ultimate Hollywood Tour Book is full of interesting facts, historical tidbits and interviews with Hollywood natives that provide readers with a realistic view of Hollywood, past and present. As any worthwhile tour guide should, this book lists hundreds of locations of interest to visit in and around the Hollywood area, extending it's reach to surrounding Los Angeles communities that have ties to the entertainment business. However, the tone of Gordon's book is informative, straightforward and friendly, not off-putting or intentionally misleading, as some guide books can be.Not surprisingly, Gordon's book is even a fun read for those of us born and raised in Hollywood. For me it brought back memories of old haunts, and it evoked nods of approval among friends as we read through many accurate descriptions of favorite locales and pages of sound advice about what to visit and why, as well as what to avoid.Whether you're a native of the Los Angeles area, a tourist planning just a few days' visit to Hollywood, or a local history buff searching for a fun and interesting book to read, you can't go wrong picking up a copy of William Gordon's Ultimate Hollywood Tour Book."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Hollywood Tour Book (2nd Edition)","review":"About 5 years ago I took a summer job giving tours of Hollywood on an old trolley car. One of my most memorable experiences was the day one of the guides for the Beverly Hills tour got sick and I was thrown into the front seat of a tour van and sent on my way to give a tour of the star's homes. It was without a doubt one of the more embarrassing moments of my life as it wasn't my regular gig and I had to make a lot of stuff up because I had no idea whose house was whose and the guy driving the van was as clueless as I was. But if the owner's of the tour company had seen fit to give me this book beforehand I would have known where I was and all those tourists wouldn't have asked for their money back when the tour was over."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Hollywood Tour Book (2nd Edition)","review":"Unlike the other people who reviewed this volume, I do not ever expect to make it all the way out to Los Angelos to actually see some of these many fine attractions. What this volume shows me is that there at least 370 very interesting local attractions in that area, that I counted, and this serves as a very exciting, point by point, historical description of people and events in that area for the past 100 years. What I am interested in is, perhaps a little different than, maybe the majority, would be interested in. The most interesting landmark I saw here does not even exist any more, and that is the house on Ciello Drive in Beverly Hills where the Manson Family Murders took place. I was suprised by the number of landmarks that were not really all that far from there. These include the house that silent film actor Harold Lloyd was still living in at the time, Falcon Lair, which used to be R. Valentinos hideaway house, the Superman Death house, where George Reeves committed suicide in 1959, the last home of Danny Kaye, as well as the former homes of Madonna, Peter Falk, Jack Benny, and the last home of Lucille Ball. This last mentioned home Lucy bought for 85k in 1958, and, 3 years after her death, in 1989, this home sold for 3.7 million dollars !!!another house of interest to me is the Beverly Hillbillys Mansion, and points of interest close to it include former homes of the following celebritys: The Mamas and the Papas, Johnny Carson, Sonny and Cher, Ronald Reagan, Elizabeth Taylor, and Nicholas Cage. There are a number of other locations where famous deaths, murders and suicides have happened, but one of the most famous is where mobster Bugsy Siegel was assinated in 1947, in Bel Air. Houses close to this include the \\"Owlwood Estate where Joseph Schenk, Marilyn Monroe, Sonny and Cher, and Tony Curtis all lived in at one time, as well as the former homes of Howard Hughes, and Judy Garland, Buddy Hackett, Lana Turner, and Clara Bow.There are sooo many other positive suprises in this book, and it is a chronicle of local history like none other I have ever seen, and, I think, every city in the USA deserves such an extensive historical anecdote book, with a community by community, street by street map description."},{"Title":"The Carpet: Origins, Art and History","review":"This book is a good overview of carpets produced in eight areas- Anatolia, Persia, The Caucasus, Western Turkestan, Eastern Turkestan, India, China, and Europe. The listing of these titles of the various carpet areas should tell you that this book has focused on historical carpets. It is neither the most basic nor the most detailed of books on this subject. There is more emphasis on earlier, more historical carpets, and on more commercially produced rather than tribal carpets. The photographs are wonderful. Overall, I would give this book high marks. Target market for this book would be interior designers or highly informed buyers, not so much the rug dealers or other professionals who want even more detailed information."},{"Title":"Airport","review":"I found this book by chance and wasn't sure whether it would be worth reading. I decided to give it a try... Soon, I was caught up in the book. I just couldn't put it down, I was so eager to find out what would happen next. The book takes you behind the scenes in an airport in the 1970's and shows you all the things you normally don't get to see or even hear about. You get to a point where you care about the characters, and it's important to find out what happens to them... All in all, I really recommend this book, it's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Airport","review":"Arthur Hailey has compiled his thoughts of the disasters that can occur at an international airport and about the people who deal with it behind the scenes, for most of us who will never even come close to a similar scenario.

The book looked good and we passed it on to our high school German class.

Multiple threads are weaved as the protagonists battle on the ground and in the air. Aviation buffs will enjoy the details Hailey retells. Perfectionists will love reading about people that are very good at what they do (such as a mechanic that needs to dig out an Aero Mexico jet from the mud). This is a fun read, do not miss it!"},{"Title":"Airport","review":"Arthur Hailey has outdone himself in this fast , racy , book . The logistics of maintaining and operating an international airport have been described in painstaking detail. This book is a must for all travellers."},{"Title":"Airport","review":"Almost all my friends who read the book dreamt of becoming airport managers for a few days after that. There can be no greater tribute to Hailey. Unlike many authors, like Mario Puzo, who have written just 1 epic and faded away Hailey has maintained his standard of research &amp; story telling in almost all of his books(except for Overload &amp; Evening News)"},{"Title":"Airport","review":"Mr hailey has done a marvelous job!

A super hunk of brain-candy, stellar, I loved it!"},{"Title":"Airport","review":"Arthur Hailey's novel Airport is surely the book for you, The story of one night that wouldn't quit. The book immediately grabs your attention with the lost United food truck somewhere in the blizzard. Slowly, at first, the reader is introduced to the problems facing the main characters and one by one they start to get solved. Not an easy feat, however, with a witty stowaway, a phsychotic bomber, an arrogant pilot, and even a suicidal radar operator. The airport manager, Mel Bakersfeld, certainly has his hands full! The storm continues, the plot thickens, and the reader can't put the book down. I suggest you get yourself a copy and enjoy an exciting night at Lincoln International Airport"},{"Title":"Airport","review":"I recently watched the comedy film \\"Airplane\\" and then I read the wikipedia entry about the film in order to find out about its history. The entry mentioned the film \\"Airport\\" which was based on the Arthur Hailey book of the same title. I then figured I'd read the book, and I am more than happy that I did. In fact, when I picked up the book at the library, I kind of groaned at its size. Sometimes it's torturous to read a really long book and at times I force myself to read 50 pages a day to guarantee that I'll actually finish the book in a somewhat short amount of time. But I found myself breezing through 50 pages of \\"Airport\\" and wanting more.I loved the multi-plot format. Hailey presents a certain character and his/her motivations, and then the character leaves the book for awhile. You'll be sorry to see the character leave because you want to know what will happen to him/her! I next am going to read \\"Hotel\\" because I am hoping this author was able to replicate his wonderful storytelling ability more than once.I read \\"Airport\\" months ago and I still remember all the plot points and characters very clearly. Not only that, but I actually learned things about how an airport operates. One pilot complains about how passengers don't listen when a stewardess demonstrates what to do in an emergency. Thanks to that line, I actually DO pay attention now!"},{"Title":"Airport","review":"This is classic Arthur Hailey. A well researched novel. It gives us a sneak preview of what happens behind the scenes of a busy airport. The characters are not super humans; they are as normal as you and me. It keeps you interested from the first page itself. The interest is not only maintained by the plot with its several twists and turns but also by the information which Hailey provides his reader with, through his characters. If you have never had been through an Arthur Hailey novel, read this. This might just get you started with an author whose books are as informative as they are entertaining. It might even make you consider on a career."},{"Title":"Airport","review":"Very fast service through the busy holiday season.

I recommend another book by the same author &quot;MONEY CHANGERS&quot; which will give the same exitement."},{"Title":"Airport","review":"This was the hardest book I ever read; not because of difficult language or complexity but sheer volume of endless, ultimately pointless text that muffles the plot. The book's over 300 pages long and very little of note happens until the last 50 or so pages; there are so many characters and storylines that I ended up not caring much about any of them. And the amount of filler is staggering; the author spends several sides explaining the airline policy on stewardesses who are made pregnant by pilots. Of course, the research Hailey has done can't be faulted, and it certainly gives an insight into the running of an airport, but honestly after 200-odd pages of adultery, marital discord, delays, airline stowaways, 'feisty' employees who remove all the capital letters from their typewriters and flippant stewardesses planning seductions in Naples, I really couldn't care less what happened in the end. Don't bother."},{"Title":"Airport","review":"I saw the tail end of the movie a couple years ago. I'm an aviation nut, so enjoyed what I saw.

Every fear you have about flying becomes a reality. I don't recommend that the weak-hearted read it. Definetely, don't read it on a plane!

It is informative, providing much factual information concerning the nations air travel system while telling a very human and compelling story."},{"Title":"Airport","review":"This gripping book makes readers feel like they are piloting a 707 thru a blizzard, or trying to clear snow-filled runways and deal with a terminal full of angry passengers. The scene is Chicago's Lincoln International (O'Hare) Airport on a Friday evening in 1968 as a fierce winter blizzard frazzles the nerves of passengers, pilots, agents, etc. Ground crews must keep the runways open (one is blocked by a stuck jet) while stressed-out air traffic controllers juggle circling airliners in holding patterns as they are unable to land. Then there's those angry suburbanites who arrive to gripe about the searing noise of jets passing directly over their homes. Woven into these pages is stress, danger, and sex, at a time when all stewardesses were young and single, passengers wore suits, metal detectors were unheard of, and three pilots worked the cockpits. Adding to the burdens of airport manager Mel Bakersfield, captain Vernon Demerest and the others, a crazed terrorist may have boarded a Rome-bound flight with a homemade bomb in his briefcase. As you can imagine, the pages fly by as the suspense builds and we yearn to discover what happens next. Along the way readers learn a lot about airports and the airline industry circa late 1960's, much of it still relevant today.Author Arthur Hailey (1920-2004), wrote gripping prose and provided behind-the-scenes looks at the industries he descrbed in his best-selling novels like HOTEL, WHEELS (car making), THE MONEYCHANGERS (banking), etc. This may be the best of his many excellent novels (he'd served in the Royal Air Force), and you might wonder if they dared sell this book at airports to nervous fliers. AIRPORT was also made into a popular movie starring Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin."},{"Title":"Airport","review":"Called a potboiler in its time: Sex, sin, stowaways and a mad bomber, all crammed into one long night at a 1970s snowbound airport stands the test of time. Hailey's meticulous attention to detail with regard to every aspect of the story including the inner workings of an international airport under stress in that decade demand the reader's attention. The plot revolves around a beleaguered airport manager juggling a failing marriage and a crisis on location, his arrogant and philandering pilot brother in law, an out of work man teetering over into desperation and how their paths cross on one dangerous night. Absorbing and thrilling, even after all this time."},{"Title":"Airport","review":"First published in 1968, Arthur Hailey's Airport is one of the original disaster thrillers. Compared to others of its ilk (Hurricane, The Glass Inferno, etc), it has dated poorly but is well-composed enough to still be entertaining.Even to the layman's eyes, airports have changed substantially in the past 35 years - and even more dramatically in the last 5. The center of the thriller's 'disaster' plot relies on a passenger being able to walk onto a plane clutching a bag of dynamite. In the post-9/11 era, this is pure science fiction.On a character level, Airport is also a relic of a bygone era. The book's reliance on the 'shocking' sexual precocity of captains and stewardesses to create character drama isn't nearly as pearl-clutching as it was forty years ago. Although Hailey earns a lot of credit for featuring abortion and divorce-related storylines, the years have been unkind to the traditional depiction of sex kitten stewardesses.Still, Hailey spends enough time discussing the minute detail of an airport's function that escapism is possible. The operation of a snow-clearing 'Conga Line' or the arguments over insurance machines are still oddly interesting, despite being sadly outmoded. (Interestingly, given the row over Heathrow expansion, Airport's depiction of a local citizen's group is still very relevant).Forty years on, Airport is less an example of high-tension disaster fiction than it is of well-researched world-building. It is still an entertaining read - just not for the reasons originally intended."},{"Title":"Airport","review":"If you've seen the movie you know the story. The writing is very similar to John D. MacDonald's non-Travis McGee works with an almost Tom Clancy-ish attention to detail and realism. Hailey definitely was trying for something more here than just a tidy little soap opera. Quite a number of issues plagueing airports and airline travel, some of which continue to today, are discussed in great detail with both sides of each arguement dutifully laid out. All of this around a convincing story, some of the highlights of which include a snowstorm, protesters, divorce, husbands and wives cheating on each other, a desperate bomber and a crippled jet.Who could ask for more?!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"and I was somewhat dreading this particular read in the American Literature class in which I'm currently enrolled. HOWEVER, if the reader can put himself in the mindset of pre-civil war America this is a great multi-level story. Obviously many reviewers are going to talk about the theme of slavery contained in the book. I think Samuel Clemens did a fantastic job of portraying his disdain for it. Blacks were considered almost below animals at the time. Consider the portion of the book where Huck is spinning a tale to Tom Sawyer's Aunt Sally and says that his boat was delayed becasue of an engine explosion. When she asks if anyone was hurt, he replies that a \\"nigger was killed\\" to which she responds \\"Well that's good, since sometimes people do get hurt\\" and then goes on to relate a tale of a white engineer that was killed in a similar accident. She didn't think about her response. This was simply the automatic reaction of southern slaveholders of the time. In this environment, in this society for Huck to grow to realize that Jim is a true. loving caring human being is amazing and the heart of the story as far as I'm concerned. Set aside any preconceptions that you may have about the book and give it a try!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is the American classic. It isn't simply a children's book, or a simple adventure tale, but a vision of a battle between individuality and conformity through the eyes of one of the greatest characters in American literature. The point that this book is racist is absurd. In fact, it is quite the opposite, with Twain indicating that it is more natural for Huck and Jim to be equals. Every time Huck stops along the river and enters a town, Twain satirizes the faults and gullibility of society. The ending is there to provide a sharp contrast between Huck, a strong individual and a realist, and Tom, a total conformist and a romantic. Overall, this book is a pivotal piece in American literature, and most of the points made in the book still hold true today."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book was great i read every one of his adventures.

It would be the best for those people who love adventure books and the sense of escaping pathway. By using vivid descriptive langue, the author successfully guide his readers through some very beautiful landscapes and dangerous situations. Readers not only could see themselves following the two main characters through their difficult journey, but also could move with them toward their destination, Freedom of Slavery.This was a required book in my 11th grade. Just by looking at it, I already felt sleepy. When I began to read the first pages, I felt worse. I did not understand one thing. The reason for it was, I did not read the book &quot;The adventures of Tom Sawyer.&quot; The first couple pages in Huckleberry Finn is like the second part of Tom Sawyer.

I thought this was a good book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Devoid of a mother, unloved and ignored by his father, and best friend and sidekick to a man whose skin color is reason enough for a lynching. \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\\" by Mark Twain, is about a boy set on living his life free of hassles. That, however, is not what he gets as a feigns his own death in order to escape his drunken old man, and meets up with another disregarded soul, a runaway slave who becomes his only steady friend. Together they high-tail it down the Mississippi river on a make-shift raft, narrowly escaping death, thievery, and capture from a variety of southern folk. Their experiences serve as true examples of adventure, as both discover that there is more to their character and souls that what they had ever imagined. They develop a sense of courage, acceptance, and happiness as they float their way to freedom, knowing that water always finds its way, and by following it they will too.The story of Huck shows the growth and molding of identities of both Huck and his companion Jim, with the use of eloquent diction. Twain writes in the typical language of the time period and exercises the slang and frank use of words that would be ever so appropriate of the homeless waif and runaway slave. This use of the literary device enhances Twain's theme by speaking a pure American dialect in order to paint a picture of one of the most piercing images of the devastation slavery had on those enslaved as well as the society that allowed such an act to take place. The controversial topic and writing technique which Twain uses, succeeds in relaying to the readers what his purpose was in writing the great American novel: that existence and the participation in it is short and measured, sometimes by others, but mostly by actions of the individuals themselves. Therefore, it must be taken as a continual learning process, with which understanding and growth are a byproduct to the daily highs and lows of what is known as life."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is a great classic. I can definetly see why people would call it racist. However, we have to remember when the book was written and take it for what it is worth. THis is a great adventure story and every body should read it."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I enjoyed the book, it was a really good book.I love adventures and this book was truly something to sit and read, if you like suspense and drama.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for adventure and for those who have a very good imagination."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable books I've read for years. It is packed to the gills with fast-paced action whilst still being informative and historically interesting.To judge this book as being &quot;racist&quot; for using the word nigger is ridiculous - that is the word people used."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"THE ADVENTURE'S OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN, by Mark Twain is an exciting classic about a boy and his strange ambition for never-ending adventure. His only companion, a run-away slave named Jim has been his partner in &quot;crime&quot; as they both run away from society. This novel took place in the crucial times of the late 18 century where slavery was an unjust method of deception. Jim's struggle for freedom and Huck's struggle for adventure take both of them through non-stop ventures."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"In Mark Twain's novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, a young boy named Huckleberry is living with an old lady from town named Widow Douglas. Previously, Huckleberry and his buddy, Tom Sawyer, tracked some treasure and were awarded 6,000 dollars each thus allowing them to live the good life. Everything, in Huck's life is going very well until his pap strolls into town looking to cash in on Huck's fortune. Shortly, after arrival Huck is taken against his will by pap. After Huck escapes, he stumbles upon a familiar slave named Jim. Jim and Huck become friends rather quickly due to similar circumstances, and without much hang time the two set off down the Mississippi River in order to set Jim free. While, on the journey down the Mississippi the two become loyal friends.Twain's novel relates to readers through his views on slavery, religion, and politics. Throughout the book he makes a mockery of the time in which he lived. Also, by having the main character, Huck, befriend a slave it shows how even in pre -civil war times there were people who thought people of color were the same as whites.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is highly recommended for its exciting and adventurous monologue, which can be shared with reader's young and old. This book also offers an innocent young man's views on slavery, religion and politics. So all in all, if adventure and eye tearing friendship are what you are looking for, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, in my mind is one of best American novels of all time. It did a great job making me feel like I was in the South during the 1800's because; the dialog from Huck's narrative, the way the book showed how southerners felt about blacks, and what they had to go through to be friends with a slave. Twain also did a great job with the characters, he didn't make any one character better then the other but at the same time did a great job describing the characters. For example, characters the King and Duke, Twain really made them come to life. The novel also keeps you on your toes the whole time; you never know what's coming up next, because there's a new adventure ever couple chapters. But the novel isn't just about the adventures that Huck; a young southern boy goes through. It's also about the learning experience he goes through by becoming a good friend with a slave. By reading this book I feel that you will want to read more of Mark Twain's novels and short stories. I would recommend this novel to all students who are willing to learn while having to read a book with a different style of writing."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Hucleberry Finn, by Mark Twain, is a wonderful story about the adventures a young boy could have in the 1850's. The story takes place in the states along the Mississippi River during America's early years. Huckleberry, also known as Huck, is a young boy who grew up with an abusive and drunk father. When Huck's father disappears, he is taken in by a widow who tries to civilize and instill manners in him. The book starts out with adventure when Huck and his good friend Tom Sawyer form a gang. Huck is later kidnapped by his father, but he devises an extremely clever escape. He teams up with a runaway slave named Jim and they travel up the Mississippi River in hopes of getting to the northern free states. Huck always seemed to be torn between right and wrong. One minute he feels remorse for helping a runaway slave but the next he feels bad for him. This is evident when Jim is captured later in the book; Huck is set on finding and freeing Jim. Even though The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a very controversial book it should be read by people of all ages. Not only does it allow young people to relate to it, making their reading easier, but it also, in a non-direct way, explains the way life was in the earky years of America."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The book Huckleberry Finn is a very entertaining book for everyone. It is about a boy who travels down river escaping the trials and tribulations of growing up. Although while down river he makes dozens of moral decisions and gains a friend. Huck is a boy who is fascinated with the life of murdering, and stealing. By lying, and stealing, he rescues a new friend of his. He pretends to be Tom Sawyer and helps Jim escape from slavery because Tom Sawyers Aunt owns Jim. Huck grows up in the south near Missouri in the mid 1800's and he has to face many things such as racism and the controversial issue of slavery. In the end Huck realizes that the most important things in life are caring for friends and knowing that family doesn't always have to be your mother and father. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that is filled with sudden excitement."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Adults need to read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer to realize that they should never forget all the trouble they got in when they were young.

This book has everything a reader likes: adventure, mystery, and romance.This book has the perfect amount of adventure. In the book, Tom and Huck decide to run away from home and live on an island. It was an adventure to steal all the food they needed, to actually sneak out of the house, and to meet up and sail down to the island. Also, they built a raft to sail down to the island.In the story there is a big mystery. Tom and Huck witness a murder, and they almost get killed for it.

Tom and Becky go into a cave to explore with all the other children and somehow they get lost for three days.Tom is a young kid that is confused with the world around him, so he goes off and tries to experience new things. Whenever Tom goes out on an adventure there is always some kind of consequence no matter what he does. Tom learns from his mistakes and learns to deal with all sorts of challenges."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I think the book \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is a very exciting and adventurous story that should be shared with all ages. The story is about a boy named Huck Finn who is kidnapped by his cruel and drunken dad. He escapes his father and then he travels down the Mississippi River and finds his friend, Jim. He comes across two imposters and the story just continues to keep your attention. This book is a real all American story. It is definately a story that you wouldn't want to miss reading."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Do more than read this marvelous book for yourself: read it ALOUD to your kids so you can discuss with them every aspect of its brilliant satire, wounderful use of (local) language and adept characterizations. Even better, read TOM SAWYER to them first--that way they'll be able to see the vast difference between Tom and Huck and which one grows up. . . Oh, and don't be put off by the casual and to our ears very offensive use of the word \\"nigger\\" by the characters--remember that Twain carefully selected every word in his Huck and Tom dialect--use this book to teach more than merely literature to your kids, use this book to teach history and social responsibility. Caveat: Twain's Southern dialect is challenging to read out loud--better practice!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain, reflects the development and maturity of a young man during early America. This novel includes many morals which the main character, Huck, comes across. He is an adventurous boy who has to make many adult decisions and had many pressures. Huck is being forced to be civilized by the Widow Douglas while his best friend Tom Sawyer encourages him to rebel and have a good time. All the while, Huck's drunk, abusive father stumbles back into the picture trying to use his son. The novel can be related to many different issues seen in society today such as individualism and racial problems. Narrated through Huck's eyes and literally in his own words, the book is written in a way to be enjoyed by a variety of readers. It was interesting to see a young boy escape on his own and befriend a runaway slave, defying the social norms. His attitude and freewill make him a very relatable character. This book would come highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is the second time that I have read the book and it was just as good as the first time through. I love the witty dialect Twain throws in to create a southern ambiance of the 19th century. This book was a huge piece of controversy at its time due to the fact a young white boy and a run a way slave team up to sail the Mississippi in seek of adventure. I find the book really interesting and at the same time almost weird, kind of on a Sci-Fi level, with everything involving how the two families kill each other including their children. Today's world is full of people trapped in the routine of society's standards and Huck is a perfect example of what many people want - independence and free spirit. I like how Huck, even though without a proper family oriented upbringing, is able to distinguish from right and wrong. It shows the incredible mental capacity humans have in their ability to reason."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark twain did an amazing job at making the characters come alive. Although the book is over 100 years old i was still able to laugh at the jokes and some of the situations are still relavent today (for example the whole predicament with Pap). Though the dialects used in the book were essential to the characters and the story I sometimes found them to be either annoying or downright confusing. Nevertheless, this book still deserves 4 stars and will surely stand the test of time(well...it already has but will continue to do so)"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"...sivilise me, and I can't stand it. I've been there before.\\" This is a small part of the long book of \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" by Mark Twain. This book is about a fourteen year old boy named Huck Finn who escapes from a life of abuse and sailes down the Mississippi River with an old friend. I think this book has extrordinary vocabulary like the words scour, numskull, and meek. These words in the book describe a person or an object. Although the text doesn't give much of an idea of the word's definition; it's fascinating to see the tremendous vocabulary Mark Twain uses. Also, I think this book rises in the plot and then stays there. I think this because Huck and Jim encounter a \\"king\\" and a \\"duke,\\" and they keep attempting to escape from them. A good age group for this book is grades seven to nine because this book is somewhat long with some confusing parts in it. Also, the vocabulary is for more advanced readers.

It is one of my favorite books written by one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"It's interesting to read this book 150 years after the Civil War and the Emancipation.

This book chronicles Huck & Jim's life on the river, living on a raft for several months. Huck finds out what it means to be a real friend. Tom Sawyer also shows up, and hilarities ensue.

I really enjoyed this book. Mark Twain managed to keep the boyish atmosphere of the Adventures of Tom Sawyer while adding in adult like concepts, such as decisive moral choice and honor, to create a work of fiction that many hail to be the \\"Great American Novel.\\"If you're not familiar with the story: Huck, after having found riches with Tom Sawyer, is living with the Widow Douglas and no longer leading a life of vagrancy. I won't go too deeply into the story because: a) there are a lot of plot elements and it would be impossible and b) it really is something that you have to experience through the eyes and in the language of Huck Finn (the entire story is written from his perspective and in his dialect as opposed to the Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which was written in Twain's distinct voice). Notable plot elements: Huck's escape from Pap, Jim and Huck's travel down the Mississippi, the Duke and the Dauphin and the Royal Nonesuch, and Huck and Tom's (who is present at the end of the book) contrivance to \\"free\\" Jim (you'll understand the \\"quotations\\" after you read the book).Overall, all the hype surrounding this book is well deserved.

Recommended reading!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Through its abundantly exciting plot lines and Mark Twain's humorous narrative style, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has made its mark in the timeless classics. Situated in the early nineteenth century, Twain exhibits his opinions and concerns regarding society and racism towards African Americans through the voice of twelve-year-old Huckleberry Finn. In the beginning, Huck runs away from his town in order to escape society and its many rules. During Huck's journey, he is joined with a runaway African American slave, Jim, who not only becomes his friend but also a parental figure Huck has never had. Together, Huck and Jim venture through numerous towns in southern America, encountering discrimination, racism, lies, cons, and many other injustices in society. Their exciting adventures will keep the readers constantly entertained and amused. Though filled with humor and wit, underneath the comedy, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn contains several serious messages and topics. Through Huck's character, Twain primarily illustrates the injustices in society's rules and beliefs and its prejudice towards African Americans. Twain also tackles topics such as childhood, growing up, superstitious beliefs, and moral versus intellectual knowledge through satirical and situational events. This timeless tale is suitable for people of all ages because it allows adults to reminisce their youthful years and shows children the difficulties of growing up.

Twain masterfully creates an interesting storyline while staying true to the times, setting, and language. Huck's tale of his adventure down the Mississippi will keep you turning the pages.Not only does it have a well written plot, but it creates quite a controversy. Over the years it has raised discussion of its themes: racism, slavery, morality, and society's hypocrisy. Young Huck finds himself struggling as to whether help his friend Jim, a run-away slave. His recent education and civilizing has taught him that it would be wrong to help him and he'd surely be eternally punished. However, his conscience tells him that it's the right thing to help Jim and that society is wrong.Overall this book brilliantly balances story and meaning, something which can seem rare of literature at times.

So vivid were the settings and so well-liked (or, in some cases, well-disliked) were the characters that the story pulled me forward almost effortlessly.At nearly every bend of the river, I found myself marveling at what it must have been like to have lived in such an era, in so different a world. The loss of such an idyllic world is now near total, and perhaps a foretelling aspect of this loss may have been one of the intentions Twain had in his realistic upheavals into this otherwise romantic tale. Yet by providing aspects of both romanticism and realism he has allowed us to enjoy the heart of this \\"innocent\\" era and feel the jolts of connecting it to our real world (or rather, the real world at the time of its publication, but still felt today).I was truly touched by Huck's friendship and loyalty toward Jim, and found myself turning page after page in fear of Huck's giving in to societal pressures and doing what was viewed as the \\"right\\" thing to do-to turn Jim in as a runaway slave.

I don't imagine anyone can find much fault in the story of a man's efforts to achieve his liberation from slavery in the company of a colorful wild boy, nor can anyone but a mental clod fail to find Twain's keen prose masterful, so I will take a stab here and cite the frequent use within the text of what we in our time define as a racist word as the cause of so much of the puzzling backlash against this American classic.I'd suggest that anyone who cannot understand CONTEXT needs to better his or her education, and anyone who does grasp a word's use within a context should comprehend the placement of offensive word in question. Secondly, I would point out that we cannot sanitize the past or impose the fluid morals of our own age on it: at best we can only censor what we find objectionable in ages that came before our own, and in that we begin a descent down a slippery slope of lies. Consider this: in a future age words we use daily and without an implication of cruelty or slight might come to be viewed as indecent. Suppose the word \\"dude\\" were to take on an obscene tone in the lexicon of the 22nd century. Funny, sure, but it's a good example of how times change and so do mores. Twain was not trying to demean a race by use of an epithet.So I hope this wonderful novel by one of America's brightest literary giants stands uncensored and available in libraries across our nation for many lifetimes to come. To lose sight of the brilliance of this fun, transporting book over a word we see now as derogatory is to cheat ourselves and our progeny of a fine literary adventure."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"&iexcl;mThe adventure of Huckleberry Finn &iexcl;n is a book whick follows &iexcl;m The adventure of Tom Sawyer &iexcl;n&iexcl;AI have seen &iexcl;m The adventure of Tom Sawyer &iexcl;nbefore &iexcl;A so&iexcl;AI think it is an interesting book.If you didn't read &iexcl;m The adventure of Tom Sawyer &iexcl;n&iexcl;A you may feel that it is quite difficult to catch up with what the story goes on ."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"In my school years, I wasn't a very good student. I didn't do my homework or read what I was supposed to read, etc. But growing up, after reading a few of my friends' recommendations, reading just becomes a lot more fun if it isn't work. Taking tests and writing reports sucks the life out of literature, and I have to say this is a big problem with the American public school system.But anyway, after reading this and that, I decided to catch up on classics. You know, so I don't seem like such an ignoramus about books since absolutely everyone but me has read them. So, I read 1984, Catcher in the Rye, to name a few. Then I come across Huck Finn. My high school junior class read this book, but of course, I hardly paid any attention.Racist? Sure, it's rampant with the horrid N word, but this is a book about a specific time period with slaves, and Twain captures the right feel and choice of dialogue perfectly, and sadly, it mirrors many of the guests that appear on Jerry Springer. The buzz word is just something you have to get over, it's not important to the story and it's not about hating African slaves and their descendants, but just a minor detail. People that say they should ban this book are just extremely ignorant. How racist is it for someone to help a slave ESCAPE?The story, overall, is very satisfying and enjoyable all the way through. Once you get to know the characters, you care about them and worry for their well-being. I'm not sure how I can better express what a great and well-written classic this is without quoting half the book, so you'll just have to give it a try.A word of warning, however, if you must read the Penguin Classics paperback edition of the book, DO NOT READ THE INTRODUCTION BY JOHN SEELYE. Not until you've finished reading the story. This is very important for your enjoyment of the story. While it's well-written and provides a lot of insight into Twain and the story, it's written on the presumption that you've already read the book, meaning, the ending and several important plot points are completely blown. Why would they call it an introduction if it assumes you've already read it?

It truely capture the issue of race in the post ( when Twain wrote the novel) and pre ( when the book takes place) civil war as well as our society today. Many critics argue that Mark Twain was racist, but I think that the entire book is in fact making fun of the society he lived in and showing how horrible slavery was. People who want to bann the book just because it uses the \\"n\\" word are ignorant an do not want to see that slavery really did happen. It has become one of the most evil and hated words in the english language, but during the time Twain wrote this book the word was very commonly used,;it is in the book to show the reader the how black people were treated. Although it may be a sensitive issue, people need to talk about slavery and their ideas on slavery and not supress them. If we refuse to teach the book just because of this then we are trying to ignore our history. It should be veiwewed as a chance to realize that people were wrong and their mistakes are still trying to be fixed today. Should we not teach American history of the 19th century just because there was slavery? No we must learn from our past and make sure history does not repeat itself. It is very important for people when they read this book to seperate the ideas of the author with the ideas of the characters, because these are two totally diffrent veiws. Also a person must not read this book at face value and must read between the lines to capture the underlining themes of this amazing novel.

I think it is a good book, but it is slightly difficult to read because of the old-fashioned southern dialect used by the characters. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is about events that happened a long time ago, and I really enjoyed reading this book because I like history.This book is about a boy named Huckleberry Finn, as you might have guessed. Huck lives with a widow who had adopted him after he and Tom Sawyer, his best friend, caught two murderers and found six thousand dollars.

I highly recomend you read this book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The book, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, is a timeless classic that provides a message to the reader through a huge adventure that Huckleberry Finn encounters. This is actually a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer which only helps explain the beginning of the book a little more clearly. Everything else is a new journey that Huckleberry Finn takes. There are the same characters as in the first book as there are in this book, including Huck's best friend Tom Sawyer. When I first began to read it, I got a little confused about what was going on and having a little trouble starting it, because it had been awhile since I finished Tom Sawyer. However, it didn't take long for Mark Twain to start up an adventure between Huck and Tom. They decide to start a gang where they would rob and murder people. This idea eventually dies off, but I personally thought it humorous that a couple of boys in their teens decide suddenly to begin breaking the law. It really didn't seem that they had a chance from the start to do such a thing. After this, the main story really begins to unwind.You see, Huck's dad is a bit of a drunk and one who doesn't see the importance of work. They also only meet every once in a while, and Huck is doing just fine living with a lady by the name of Widow Douglas. Every time his dad does come, Huck gets scared of what he might do to him. I find that kind of sad knowing that a son is scared of his own father. Well, it turns out that one day his dad comes wanting to take money Huck had found in the previous book. Huck's father decides that since the judge won't give him the money, he'll prove that he's really the boss of Huck by taking him to live with him in very thick woodlands in a small hut. Huckleberry succeeds to run away one night through a very elaborate scheme and finds himself on an island in the Mississippi River. On that island he meets a runaway slave named Jim. Huck had built a raft too, and both of them decide to run away together. Huckleberry Finn realized he was transporting a runaway illegally. They can only travel at night and there's always the risk that someone will catch them. Not to mention a floating house with a mysterious dead man inside, Huck Finn dressing up as a girl, dangerous currents in the river, and even sneaking on shore into people's houses for supplies and information on what was going on. Each one of these events was both suspenseful and exciting at the same time.The two were also not on the raft alone the entire time. As time passed, they are joined by two men who thought of themselves as a king and duke. The only thing they're worthy of ruling is a good way to trick people out of their money. Now Jim and Huck are involved in all of their business plans to put on shows and make money. The two men's greed towards money is so great, that they put the lives of all four passengers on the raft in danger by lying to a family who has just experienced a tragic death. They pretend to be the people who are issued the money in the dead man's will. Jim and Huck are really beginning to dislike these men and know how bad they are. Huck then devises another devious plan that has such a high risk to steel back the money and turn in the two liars.Huck also manages to get himself tangled into an even bigger mess after Jim is finally captured. He's under a disguised name, but under a name and with a family he's closer to than he thinks. The last plan he invests his time into is setting Jim free, which is the most dangerous thing he's ever done. He meets up with Tom Sawyer, and they have one last great undertaking that will keep you flipping the pages of the book. I thoroughly enjoyed this exciting novel and it really gave a message on slavery. I think there's a little something in this book for every reader who likes a good adventure that will keep you asking for more. This book is what everyone says it to be.

That is until you read into what Twain is really saying then you can see the absurdity of it all. Huck Finn lives in a time when an African-American is considered a property and not a person. The interaction between Finn and Jim is fantastic. This book is a classic because of how you'll find yourself uncomfortable reading how everyone looks at Jim. If your uncomfortable reading it then ask yourself why and maybe you'll learn something about yourself, society, and what strong a writer Mark Twain really was."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Twain's Huckleberry Finn has derived much controversy from its use of the \\"n\\" word in the dialogue as well as what some believe are stereotyped characters within the novel. As some have noted in defense of Twain, Twain's main object was to portray and depict the typical Southern dialect of this time period, and so his use of the word was to mainly show that this was a common expression used. This \\"overuse\\" of the word is most obviously an attempt at debunking the idea that people should speak this way. What some forget while reading Huckleberry Finn is that it is a satire aimed at breaking down and making fun of many of the conventions of not only the South, but other aspects of social life. Perhaps the biggest indicator of Twain's intent of facetiousness is in his \\"Explanatory\\" and \\"Notice\\" in the book's preface, where it is inferred that we are not to take everything so seriously in the book. There are many other things going on in the novel, and it is a shame that often we overlook that a classic like this has so much more going for it.For one thing, the novel is as much about growing up and striving to do good as anything else. Huckleberry Finn has this battle throughout the book, and mostly after he meets up with Jim on Jackson's Island and must do some serious soul searching to figure out what is right and what is wrong. An abolitionist wasn't thought of lightly in this setting, and so Huck is not easy to let go of society's laws. However, through much of Jim's guidance, Huck does learn morals and principles of life. Jim represents the father-figure in Huck's life, mainly because Huck's \\"real\\" Pap is an alcoholic, abusive, neglectful and mean-spirited to his son. If there ever were a case for a character breaking the stereotype idea, it would be Jim. After all, isn't it Jim who questions what Huck believes about him running away from slavery? When Huck examines ironically to himself is, and will always be, a \\"no good abolitionist\\", this admission and growth of character can be chalked up to Jim, who has already influenced Huck by then. Jim helps Huck grow up and be a more thought-provoking character. Huck gains a better picture as the novel progresses; for instance, he comes to understand that the duke and the king are not only frauds, but that they are lower than low because of their greed and callousness to the Wilks family.On another level, the novel is a lot about light-hearted fun, satire, poking fun of society and just Huck's imagination. Huck is a child who is not easy to civilize; he wants to be out in the world and living an adventure, being in a band of robbers with Tom Sawyer or adding \\"style\\" to a given situation. Huck often lives life by the moment, and has to use his \\"street smarts\\" to get out of predicaments, which might mean making up a story, faking his own death, dressing up like a girl to get information or using quick wit to escape a sticky situation. He seeks freedom and adventure, and the Mississippi River, where Jim and he spend much of their time on the raft, is a symbol for this escape.Over all, I found this to be a difficult review because Huckleberry Finn is probably one of my favorite books and Twain is one of my favorite authors. But, I think if you read Huckleberry Finn in the right light, it is an amazing read about adventure and growing up. Definitely recommended!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I have read and enjoyed \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" many times; but this recording enhances the text and makes it that much more enjoyable. The narrator, Tom Parker, does a superb job of bringing this odd assortment of strange and humorous characters to life. He does an especially fine job of pronouncing the numerous dialects that Twain put down for posterity. Hearing Mr. Parker's pronunciations and articulations brings these characters to life in all of their mid-nineteenth century motley. If you close your eyes you can picture Huck and Jim conversing as they travel on the Mississippi, lazily wasting their days and outwitting the numbskulls they encounter along the way. Parker does an especially fine portrayal of Pap Finn when he rants about the Guv'ment in a drunken stupor. His Duke and King are also delightfully portrayed in all their vainglorious pomposity.I was really impressed by how much value I received for so little cost. I laughed many times while following along with my text of the story. After all, Twain was primarily a humorist, and what's the point of reading a story like \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" if you refuse to see the humor in it? And Tom Parker's dramatic skills embellish this humor by bringing the text to life. Aside from the humor, Mr. Parker elicits the heart and soul of both Huck and Jim and shows how their views of each change as they both realize just how human and decent the other is. This is a story of some very human people from a time and a world that no longer exist. It's like reading a dream of a foreign world.This CD set is worth the money. It's a delightful and heartfelt reading of a most wonderfully compassionate and funny story about the common sense and innate humanity of an \\"uneducated\\" boy from the back woods of Missouri who discovers his own sense of morality and humanity while living by his wits and travelling up and down the Mississippi while meeting an assortment of colorful characters along the way. And, yes, it is unabridged."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Adventure of Huckleberry Finn is a wonderful book that blends entertainment and philosophy in an easy to read package. While this book can be fully enjoyed for its plot and story, the book shines for its ideas on morality as it is seen through the eyes of a teenage boy.Twain is an abolitionist, a proponent of anti- slavery and equality. Creating the character of Huck, Twain has injected his own ideas about slavery in the south into this novel. He presents his own ideas about morality though this young, and rather nave, teenage boy and his travels throughout a corrupt world. Everywhere he turns, he is greeted by an act of indecency. By leaving his home and traveling aboard, Huck matures every time he experiences an act of human kindness or malevolence. Huck struggles to understand what is right or wrong when his southern upbringing contradicts his own personal morals. At the end, Huck has learned and experienced enough to develop his own set of morals and help a fugitive slave escape, even though his action is an outcry towards southern values. Twain's novel is more than a story about a young boy on his wild adventures; instead it is a story of his growth.As irrelevant as it is to make comparisons, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a much darker book in comparison to Tom Sawyer. Huckleberry Finn contains countless lines of humor and satire but its overall ideas are deeper and gloomier as they concern human morality, especially in the context of slavery. While both are extremely enjoyable reads, Huckleberry Finn contains theological elements that make it a more serious book. Nevertheless, Twain's trademark humor and style are easily identified as he flawless weaves them together with the deeper elements within the book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Preceding The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which ends after both Tom and Huck receive a large sum of money after finding a gold stash hidden by robbers. Both take place in the small town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, sometime before the start of the civil war. This helps to set up one of the main conflicts of the book, the issue of slavery. The story is told in the eyes of Huck Finn, who's skeptical view of the world allows him to think for himself what is right and wrong based on his sense of morals rather than jumping on the band wagon and coming out upright disliking slaves and regarding them as property, as much of what the south did during those times.After being kidnapped by his biological father, he runs away and hides out on Jackson's Island and meets Jim, a run away slave. Although he has initial doubts on helping a runaway slave, he acts on what he believes to be right and team up. Throughout the story, Huck is tempted many times to turn Jim in for reward, and Twain incorporates these ideas through the characters surrounding Huck, like the con artists he is forced to join together with one time. They eventually sell Jim to Tom's aunt and uncle, and through a misunderstanding they think Huck is Tom and Tom is Sid, Tom's younger brother. Although Huck is initially surprised by the fact that Tom is willing to help Huck rescue Jim, because unlike Huck who was a social misfit, Tom was the product of middle-class society, strictly enforcing to the established rules by society. He acts as the foil for Huck through his strict adherence to rules despite moral issues while Huck acts solely through his own independent way of thinking. When Jim is \\"free\\" Huck learns that Jim had been free all along in the will left by the former slave's master. He realizes that was the reason why Tom was willing to help him. From the first book, the reader generally regards Tom as the good guy of the story, but it seems that in this novel, our view of Tom changes. He is willing to cause harm and risk lives for his own selfish motives.When all is well and over, Huck begins to see the world more clearly for himself, saying that he does not want to be civilized because it would mean losing his sense of logic and acting on cold and strict rules. He decides to go west, toward Indian territories unbound by these rules where he can decide for what is right and wrong.Twain's story is seemingly focused on Huck's \\"coming of age\\" with his discovery of the hypocrisy of the otherwise barbaric society. Where they cold-heartedly abide by rules and treat black people, who are also human as pieces of property to be bought and sold at their master's every whim.I would advise anyone to read this book because it has such a strong message and it reads well due to all the action in the story. In addition, Twain's use of foils allow the reader to see both sides of the story, albeit a little biased because it was told from Huck's point of view. All in all, it makes for one great book to read!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I first read this when I was about the fictional Huck's age. Rereading it after nearly 50 years was especially enjoyable. Numerous incidentals and turns of phrase came flooding back, yet major portions were lost to memory. This has to do with my particular literary appreciation of course, but it may also reflect on the author's construction. My memory was strong for the first half, but after Tom came on the scene it was as though I were reading it for the first time. Ernest Hemingway remarked that the book should end where Jim is betrayed and returned to slavery. That would have made the novel more a tragedy and a truer picture of 1830s America.Somehow, I cannot enjoy Tom Sawyer's machinations and contrivances to romanticize Jim's escape. I appreciate Twain's satiric style, but it went on far past my point of tolerance. Tom Sawyer is exposed not only as a twaddle-headed romantic, but as an arrogant little cockalorum, eager to toy with regular folks for his own amusement. Had I been Mark's editor, I would have urged him to abbreviate Huck and Jim's association with the King and Duke and especially shorten Tom's influence at the end. Some would say I am making too much of this. The Tomfoolery is there to allow Mr. Twain to display his unique spoofing. I get it. But why allow the brave and noble Tom to be shown as such an overweening brat?"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.\\"With characteristic humor and self-satire, Mark Twain inserted this warning into the preface of his classic American novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Perhaps he was thumbing his nose at his critics, who often criticized his writing as coarse and unsophisticated. Perhaps he was acknowledging that the book, which contains elements of an adventure story, a hero's journey and a tall tale, defies easy categorization. Using first-person narrative, Twain skillfully employs his command of language and masterful storytelling to explore the idea that true individualism means following one's own conscience, even if that means coming into conflict with society's rules and prejudices.I found this story to be an enormously good time as Twain wonderfully describes Huck and his magnificent adventure. Twain brilliantly writes of the innermost thoughts of Huck as he struggles with whether or not to accept and help Jim, a runaway slave. This is a great book that offers more than just a boy traveling down a winding river and what he encounters along the way. Twain satirical writing delivers immense insight into the society of the time. His explores the problems that existed in nineteenth century America (pre-Civil War era) with regard to slavery. Twain's comedic styles allows for a good read while subtly emphasizing the importance of personal understanding and acceptance. Twain threatened to banish anyone seeking a moral in this work, but it seems likely that his compelling themes of individualism and shared humanity contribute to the enduring popularity of this American classic."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"A vivid story of wit, growth, and adventure is provided in Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The experience of reading this novel has proved equally exciting to the plot, inducing fear, anger, and happiness as I yearned to find out the next encounter of Huck and Jim. Through a mix of satire, irony, and subtle humor, Mark Twain voices his condemnations of the faults of society: its prejudice, discrimination, and racism. This is especially expressed in his exaltation of Jim the fugitive, revealing that one's qualities are shown through their actions, not a pre-existing judgment of physical properties. The strength of friendship and individuality is also greatly emphasized in this novel. I have learned from Huck's experience that respect and freedom is not gained by following the rules, but rather gained by reaching beyond what is expected. As \\"uncivil\\" and \\"savage\\" as Huck is considered, his purity and morality outshines the rest, illustrating him as the true protagonist. The flaws of society in Huck's time are just the same as our times: a drive of ambition and greed, selfishness, and cowardice in humanity. The average man follows his peers to gain acceptance, for without acceptance, one fears their capability to function. This dependence has made us fearful and suspicious of one another, trusting no one but ourselves. A true friend discovered is a priceless jewel - a needle found in the roaring sea. They will wait for us, accept us, and most of all, converse and trust us regardless of our flaws or looks. Huck is just as we are, but successful in finding true direction and acceptance."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a great book if you are into that kind of reading. Huck is a young boy who is going through the hardships of an abusive parent. His father is a mean, nasty, cruel, and unkind person who wants Huck's money so he can use it for his own will. Huck doesn't like that idea, so he does what any boy would do: he runs away. After he runs away, a HUGE adventure unfolds on the muddy waters of the Mississippi River. He finds a runaway black man (referred to as the N-word in the book) and they set off to free him (the black man, not Huck). This book is a great book (like I said before) if you like this kind of reading. It has a lot of action in the beginning, but kind of fades off in the end. I think the book was pretty good because it was colorfully written. I really don't think that the author had a message in this book, but if he had one, then I think he was trying to say that adventures do happen, even to ordinary people."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Twain's characters are so much a part of popular culture and our national subconscious that any summary of the story would be repetitive. The book is a masterpiece - the call to adventure and subsequent journey of Huck Finn provide both a glimpse into antebellum America (the relations between whites and blacks, patterns of speech and pace of life are long gone) as well as a cold, hard look at who we are now (racially, socially, and the irrepressible urgency of being young). A classic of American literature in every sense of the word, it also is a fun read and a great story. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is one of the required books at my school for Summer Reading to gain entry into the 11-3 english class.

To float down an endless river not caring what happens next or where you are headed? Well in both a metaphorical and literal sense, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the book for you. At first thought, the book appears as a child's paradise, a sort of novel well suited to young boys who want to play &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot; or &quot;Cops and Robbers&quot;. However, these games, though included in the book, deal more with real life than at first thought. Seeming trivial pursuits in the novel possess a greater meaning and symbolism in association with the culture of America. A tale of rafts, rivers, and nature can be appreciated both for its literal sense and its deep underlying political and cultural commentary. Chronicling the life of a boy, Mark Twain masterfully utilizes literary elements such as dialect and satire along with his infamous and brilliant wit. Huckleberry is an incorrigible boy who longs to escape the strict restrictions of society and pursue a life free of woe, living off the land in expansive forests and forever gliding down the Mississippi River. Huck's adventures include interactions with a runaway slave, robbers, feuding families, and two scheming &quot;carpetbaggers&quot;. The reader is transported into the world of the 1840's where one encounters the economical and cultural conflicts of the day. It seems that as the more Huck attempts to escape the society that ties him down, the more he encounters it and the more it attains a hold upon him. Twain expresses his views on such cultural issues as the elitist yet scheming upper class through the characters aptly named the &quot;king&quot; and the &quot;duke&quot;. These characters expose the gullibility of the American public as they scam and deceive their way to economic prosperity. Twain also utilizes literary motifs as a way of revealing common facets of American culture and goals of citizens. One such motif, money, shows how some characters (for instance the king and duke) view money and material possessions as a necessity for self-fulfillment. While on the other hand, different characters (Huck and Jim) are happy to enjoy the luxury of money but are more than able to do without it and fend for themselves. These evident yet subtle touches are what make the novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn enjoyable not only for its excitement and story line but for what can be learned from these instances. Overall, I found the novel Huck Finn an exciting and engaging experience. It allowed me to kick back and relax with my body as my mind floated on a river of ideas and symbols hidden in the novel. I liked the body of the tale and the in-depth relationship the reader develops with the character Huck. It would not be surprising to find yourself speaking with a southern drawl after an hour or two of reading. I did however find some fault in the way the book was completed. I found the ending section's plot a bit too excessive and overall unnecessary. It did not, however, detract to any extent from my opinion on the book. I would give the book a three point five or four out of a five-point scale. I recommend the book to just about anyone, especially to those with an active imagination and an ability to look past the words of novels into the extensive world they are capable of revealing."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huck Finn by Mark Twain is a great American novel because it touches on all the points of our nations history. Although this book has many racial slurs it should not be under contriversy because of its use of the &quot;N&quot; word. The story takes place when the &quot;N&quot; word was used frequently. In a way it shows the positive relations between two people of different races. Huck Finn the main character of the novel uses this ofensive slur just because he was brought up that way, he doesn't know any better. Within the novel this teenage misfit gets himself in tons of trouble. This is where the comedy comes into play. Every time Huck ends up in trouble he manages to think of some clever excuse. Like when the two slave hunters ran into Huck and Jim(the runaway slave)on the river. Huck said &quot;Oh ya my father has small pocks, you can see him if you realy want to.&quot; Of course the slave hunters wanted to stay as far away from the two because the don't want to get small pocks. Mark Twain not only writes truthfully about this time period but he also critizes the human race for being ignerent and stupid. Throughout this incredible book Twain makes suddle comments about the human race just to poke fun at us. There was a two year break while he was writing this book because he was unsure of what he was doing. This was written in a time period when blacks were looked down upon as if the were not as inteligent as the whites were and Twain is having a black man and white boy out smart several white men. Twain thought that his novel would be laughed at if he continued this unheard of stoiy line. He was in such a twisted mental state he took off thoes two years to think about what he was even writing about, then continued Huck on his journy.

Lot of points were noted in this book, and I liked the way it was written.

It also commanded the colossal metaphor of the Mississippi river journey, which haunts American literature as does Melville's white whale. Toward the end, unfortunately, Twain suddenly remembered he was supposed to be writing a comic adventure for boys, and it kind of peters out. But not before it has made itself an important milestone, deft in its use of point of view and wit to handle difficult issues."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"There is a deeper genius in the adventures of Huckleberry Finn in that the book is written from the perspective of 14 year old boy who is stuggling with what he has been taught and what he learns in this adventure. Huck is fleeing his troubled family life when he comes across, widow Watson's slave, Jim. He decides that he will help him find freedom in Ciaro, Illinois. He and Jim have exciting and at times very chilling adventures. In one great irony of the book, Huck and Jim are swept past the meeting of the two rivers and carried further and further into the slave south. Huck captures the spirit of a nation struggling with his/its conscience concerning slavery. In this book, Huck considers Jim an adventure but comes to respect him as a man who he cares about and a man who cares about him. Huck learns the value of friendship and the value of mutual respect along the way. I would say that the ending disappointed me in that I felt that the reappearence of Tom Sawyer played to the lessening of the lessons that Huck learns along the way. The trick he plays on Jim and Huck for that matter softens the blow that this book should level. My review as with others I have read cannot do this book justice for the very human experience it provides.

Especially Huck Finn seemed like a very likable person with a strong identity, wit, and a soft heart. He does not want to sit and let the world rule over him, but instead test his own ideas and proves to the world that he can be better than what the society expacts him to be. And although many say it is a racially biased book because of its frequent use of N word, nobody can deny that it was a commonly used word in the 1800 where the rogue institution called 'slavery' was considered healthy and inevitable. As a matter of fact, this is a book that actually tries to tell the world about the evilness of racial prejudice not promote it.

Maybe she is right, but Twain treats Jim as a person, while Stowe treated most of the slaves in her novel as a social problem. We all know the story. Jim is a runaway slave; Huck is a runaway teen. Together they raft down the Mississippi. Yadda yadda yadda plot, and Jim is sold back into slavery by two con-men, forcing Huck to choose between what was legal in 1840 (the approximate date of the action) and what was (and is) moral. He has heard the words of religion tolerating and even supporting slavery. He knows the laws support slavery. But Jim is his friend. Jim is not property. He is a man. When Huck Finn finally decides that his only course of action is to free Jim, he signals his determination with the line, &#34;All right, then, I'll go to hell!&#34; &#8212; and thus proves Jim's humanity and his own.

My English teacher had the criticism that the book was spoiled by the last few chapters when Jim becomes a steroetypical member of his Race. I believe that in doing this Mr. Twain was trying to point out to the reader that Huck and Jim were equals only when they were alone aboard their raft and as soon as the inevitaable demands of Society are placed on them Jim is no longer Huck's equal.This is a sad indictment on the concept of Society as it was back then.

Needless to say, that after living in the states and down south for most of my adult life, I could immediately relate to the language used by Mark Twain.

Mark Twain went up and down the river for a good part of his life, and that's where he learned to relate to the mainstream America of the mid nineteenth century. So the language that he uses, should not offend anybody, because it accurately represents the sad reality of mid nineteenth century.The genius of Mark Twain is that the entire story is conceptualized and told from the perspective of 13-14 year old orphan boy, with almost no formal education at all. Yet, Mark Twain places a golden heart on this little boy, which after struggling with the brainwashing on the matter of slavery is able to see the light. A fourteen year old boy is able to distinguish right from wrong, on his own, at a time when slavery was taken for granted by white people, He was able to value Jim as a person and a friend, and not as a runaway slave.That is the most beautiful message that we inherit from Mark Twain. This message sounds coherent today more than ever. Look at a person for what they really are, and not for what their color, race, or ethnicity is. That is the American soul.I am going to highly recommend this book for the children of all ages. If you are skeptical about it, give it another chance and maybe you will be able to discover the Huck Finn that lives in your heart, and is dying to come out."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Always hesitant of the word \\"classic,\\" I picked up this book with trepidation. It wasn't required reading at any point, and some libraries still have problems with it today because of certain words and scenes. That said, I plunged right in and haven't been sorry since. This is a charming tale that will definitely take you someplace you've not been before. And isn't that what we all want?--to go where we haven't been or can't go? Though not as funny as some other of Twain's books (think \\"Life on the Mississippi\\"), \\"Huck Finn\\" is an easy read, told by a child narrator. Like other child narrated books--Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and McCrae's \\"Bark of the Dogwood,\\" Twain's \\"Huck Finn\\" uses this technique to great effect. This, coupled with a very distinctive style, not really like any other Twain work except one, makes this a highly unusual book. One must also take into consideration \\"when\\" this book was written and how new it must have seemed then with its incorrect grammar and style. Suffice it to say that \\"Huck Finn\\" will stay on my (and other's) bookshelf for a while.Also recommended: To Kill a Mockingbird, Bark of the Dogwood, Catch 22"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN REVIEW.The adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a heartfilled story. It shows one teens journey through the Mississippi River, running away from his father and helping a runaway slave named Jim, who he soon befriends, to the north. This story shows how different some people can be, though they do have hard times, but are still true friends.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, is an exciting book that will keep you guessing. The writter Samuel Clemens, pen name of Mark Twain, really brings the story alive for you. He makes his story feel so real. It wasn't like I was just reading the story, It really felt like I was there, watching Huck and Jim floating down the Mississippi River on their log raft. Mark twain makes the journey so funfilled and full of enjoyment that you can't put the book down. I had to read this book for 6th grade during summer vacation. I thought it would be a drag, but as soon as I read the first chapter I couldn't put it down...not for a second. I couldn't wait to see what was comming next because with every chapter this book gets more and more exciting until the very last page.The Adventures od Huckleberry Finn is fun, suspensful, and comical at some times. I would recommend this book to anyone, of any age who wants to get swept away in an amazing story."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"If you believe that uncivilized way of life is better then an organized planed life, then you should read this book before going to college. I am first to admit that I hate to read, but this book kept my attention till the very end. I got so caught up in how huck tries to escape from the standard ways of living.This book takes me back to when I was little and would have my own adventures with my brother. This book is one exciting adventure.This book is about being you and not living up to other people's standards. The Mississippi river is the only place where Jim hucks friend and himself can be free and make up their own rules. Another big part in this book is friendship. This book shows you the true meaning of a friend. Some of the characters in this book are huckleberry Finn other known as huck. His friend Tom and his self discover twelve thousand dollars in treasure. Huck gets adopted bye the widow Douglas and Miss Watson. Huck gets fed up with this rich life style and runs away. But Tom manages to bring him back by promising to start a band of robbers. Then Hucks father comes back to collect Hucks money but Huck refuses. In return his father takes him to a log cabin and frequently beats him. Huck escapes and fakes his own death and, runs to Jackson Island. At Jackson Island he meets Jim an ex slave hiding out. As soon as you start to read this story the plot gets you and you will catch yourself saying what's going to happen next. I really loved the way Mark Twain used southern way of speech in this story, it made you feel like real southern people were taking. I loved the plot when you think Huck is save and free he meets somebody new and an all-new adventure takes place.After reading this book it made me think about my family, I would feel so lonely if I was Huck and spent all my time alone on the river. Mark Twain feels that a uncivilized way of life is better I disagree I'm glad we have rules to follow if not everyone would do what they want and there would be chous. Imp happy to say though im glad that I live in a time where I'm free to be me."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I know most people had to read this in school so I wondered why it was so important and I finally read it after college. I know it is suppose to be a kids story but I found it to be one of the best books on morality I have ever read.The book teaches how even the most dowdy, illiterate knows that it is wrong to have another person as a slave.Huck goes through lots of experiences on his trip down the river. He learns about the envy of his father, he can't understand why the families are feuding and killing each other year after year for an old arguement. He learns how to be a charlaton and what happens to people who lie.The best part is when Tom Sawyer meets up with him and makes him and Jim follow all the rules from the pirate story and drives all the adults crazy.I really enjoyed this book and believe every teenage should read it."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain called a \`classic' a book that everyone praises but which no one actually reads. This book defies that description, and the result is a classic which is both very readable and very enjoyable. Few American authors have enjoyed such widespread popularity as Twain, and this work is, in my opinion, his best. The story is fairly simple, and the plot such that any average person could read and follow the story, yet the message the novel conveys is so deep and important that one cannot help but be greatly enriched by this book.This is the story of Huck Finn, the son of the town drunk from \`The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.' In this novel Huck helps a slave, Jim, escape from slavery, and the two of them float down the Mississippi in search of freedom for both of them. Along the way they have many adventures, and Tom even makes an appearance toward the end of the novel to complicate and romanticize things in true Tom Sawyer style.This book has much to say about the subject of slavery. The institution is so entrenched in Huck's world that it is preached from the pulpit, that aiding a slave to escape means eternal damnation for the accomplice. Throughout the novel Huck struggles with this issue, as his inner conscience (which knows he should help Jim, and which sees him as an intelligent and worthy friend) battles his knowledge of society's morals and values (which sees Jim as a mindless brute which should be returned to captivity). In many ways Huck is far more perceptive than most people in his time, because he sees Negroes as people too. Huck's final decision in the matter is one of the great moments in American Literature. He knows what it means to help Jim, but he has made up his mind, \\"All right, then, I'll go to hell!\\"I first read this book when I was young, and even then I was impressed by the story. I didn't understand most of the meaning, but the book nevertheless made an impact on me. This is the beauty of Mark Twain--he is readable for all ages."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain is rightly regarded as an icon of American literature. Of his works, Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer are the most famous, and of the two Huckleberry Finn is generally held to be the finer. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book as part of my introduction to American literature. Mark Twain had a sharp wit and his stories are rich with character, personalities, language, irreverant humor and situations. The historical aspect of the story is also interesting and important. The story gives a human-level view of Mississippi towards the end of slavery. The N-word is in common usage, but in an everyday context not as a derogatory term. The story shows some interesting and perhaps unexpected relationships and allegences. The wisdom and ignorance of the two main protagonists is a constant source of joy and humor. Highly recommended for adults and teenagers alike."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"this is an excellent and well written story. there are some truly memorable lines in this film as Huck and Tom take their adventures down the Mississippi.A wonderful read for kids of all ages, including 50 year olds."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I never read Mark Twain books and I sure missed out, because he is surely one of the finest American writers that ever lived. In Huckleberry Finn, he brought me right into the heart of his 19th century Missouri childhood and made me feel what life must have been like then. Huckleberry Finn is a wonderful character, and the book is full of elements of high drama as the boy escapes from his wicked father and goes on to a series of adventures with the runaway slave, Jim. Along the way, he meets an assortment of memorable characters, including a murderous feuding family and a couple of con men. He even gets to meet up again with his old friend, Tom Sawyer.Published in 1883, this book has a long history of being banned in schools because of its depiction of Jim, as well as the liberal use of the \\"N\\" word to describe African Americans. However, a close reading of the book will see that Huckleberry recognizes the [cruelty] of slavery. Also, Jim keeps his dignity throughout while white men show up as cruel or foolish by contrast. Jim might be a slave, but he shows a deep humanity and the reader cannot help but identify with his plight.I loved the book and found I couldn't put it down. It's certainly an adventure story as well as a journey into the world Mark Twain knew during his boyhood. There were parts where I laughed out loud, parts where I felt a shiver of sorrow, and parts where I grasped the beauty and wonder of the Mississippi River and the countryside around it. Always it kept me fascinated. And, if the ending was a bit contrived, I was glad. There is nothing like a happy ending to leave me smiling. I give this book one of my highest recommendations. If you've read it before, there is no doubt you'll gain new insights if you read it again. If you've never read it, don't miss it; it's a real treat."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book was a sequel to Tom Sawyer and continued the saga. While the racial language would be unacceptable by today's standards, that was common then and attempts to change the wording in the book should be discouraged. An excellent read."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"First off, anybody else find it amusing that we had to pick a pen name to write a review on a Mark Twain novel. I just felt that was a little ironic. As far as the story goes, Twain did a good job of crafting a well written, well researched novel, but it was missing key elements that kept it from being great. The first part of the book up to the steamboat randomly crashing into the raft was pretty good. The characters were beginning to develop nicely and we started to understand why this book was being written, as in an allegorical sense. Of course, why didn't Jim skip and a jump to Illinois from Jackson island to get his freedom, for one Twain couldn't write about the river he was attached to. After the raft everything seems rushed and doesn't fit together very well. It begins to look more like a bad night for Homer as he is reciting the Odyssey instead of an American classic. The ending with Jim in captivity and Tom acting out things is probably one of the worst endings this book could have had. Overall it was a good book, but I don't feel like it captivated me like a real classic should."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"What I liked most about this book was the sense of nostalgia it induced. The events Huck experiences may be dramatized for entertainment value, but they highlight the real sort of internal struggles we all experience as young teens. Huck battles with loyalty, friendship,and trust issues. This is one of the best pieces of classic literature I have ever had to read for school. Twain has the sort of flaire in his writing that speaks of quiet wisdome and soul. He also has brilliant insight into the human condition."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is an honest, down home critic of slavery 100 years ago. Mark Twain uses the observations of a young, homeless boy to let the reader know that African Americans are the same as white people. He has Jim, a slave, travel with Huck on a raft into the southern slave states. During their adventure, they meet a variety of crooks and very hypocritical people, including con men who pretend to be kings and dukes from Europe, a rich Christian family involved in a bloody feud, and many Christians who own slaves. I think Mark Twain is not only an great writer for his time, but also for any time, because he makes the reader see people as they really are. His open criticism of society is humorous and yet all readers get the message. I would recommend this book to all readers who can read the many dialects used in the book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I've always heard others talk about how groundbreaking \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" was, but I never imagined that it would be such a controversial, yet beautiful novel. It comments on slavery and discrimination while also allowing the reader to watch Huck Finn grow into a mature character. There's a lot of adventure and mischief present in the novel to keep readers enticed; from Tom Sawyer's love for adventure novels to the lies that Huck has to tell in order to keep Jim safe. One of my favorite parts of the novel is when Jim realizes that Huck is his only friend, and then Huck accepts that Jim is a fellow human being, and not at all as horrible as Miss Watson and other characters may have portrayed him and slaves as a whole. Rebellion is prevalent in this novel, and it inspires the readers to not take everything at face value. After reading the novel I felt that it was important to be independent in one's thoughts. The scene with the sheriff made that evident being that when we're in a crowd we are more likely to be influenced by others, but when we're alone we have that moment of sincere reason. The more you read this book, the more you realize how harsh life was for slaves in that time. It really makes you question who you are, just as Huck had to when he decided to \\"go to hell\\" instead of turn Jim in. It reminds you that sometimes, a little reevaluation is needed, and that's what I believe makes the book so amazing. It has the power to make you question everything you've ever believed in."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The look at society's assumptions about colored folk was startling. I, for one, forgot how \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" could be so entertaining: rich with Mark Twain's humor and for us now, educational about how things really were. The end, while a little disappointingly unrealistic, nevertheless wrapped up just what the title proclaims and Twain emphasizes throughout -- a wonderful adventure story."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I recently made a trip to Hartford, CT where I toured the Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe homes. Both were wonderful examples of life in the late 1800's and in both houses we got a picture of those author's lives and how they thought.I may have read Huckelberry Finn in high school, but if I did, I completely forgot it. Now I am reading it and realize the potent political messages Twain was sending about the life of the slaves, even after the Civil War, and the mentality of those from the North who were exploiting the people in the South, both whites and blacks. Written through Huck's eyes, it is a telling and explicit picture of life along the Mississippi during troubled times. I like this book and realize now why it is such a \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read a German translation of Huck Finn as a teenager. When my husband found a pristine copy at a yard sale I cracked it open and was immediately captured by Mark Twain's miraculous gift for expressing the Old South in language and decided to read it again--this time the authentic version. Not wanting to dog-ear my husband's copy, I chose to buy it for my iPhone.My favorite part of the book is the long journey down the great river that moves slowly past villages and cities and it's human drama, past foolishness, kindness, and malice alike. I was not fond of the protracted adventure of breaking Jim out and did skim a little to spare myself some of the thoughtless cruelty he is put through for Tom Sawyer's entertainment, who enjoys the adventures of complications, even if he has to create them himself. But I have no objections to this part of the book, nevertheless.The historic business of human cruelty and thoughtlessness as expressed in the enslavement of Africans is more fully captured in the uncensored version and, reading Huck Finn, I wanted as accurate an accounting of it as Mark Twain originally provided. I believe if this version is read by a child, there should be supervision and discussion as it may otherwise lead to hurt and confusion. Or perhaps it should not be read by a child. But I think this unedited version is an excellent learning tool for teenagers and adults alike. Mark Twain is astoundingly good at limning the emotional and historic space of the Old South of slavery, using the tool of local language.After reading most of the book, I found myself becoming simultaneously numbed toward and hurt by the plight and blight of slavery, getting a chance to experience my own humanity. It's hard to believe we ever did this to anyone. And I think we should not forget.

No one likes obligatory reading, and it was like water off a duck's back. Regretting that I remembered nothing of the novel, I recently re-read it, and I found it entertaining reading, and also much more for a grown-up audience than I expected. Of course the book was only started as a sequel to Twain's novel for boys THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER before being turned towards much more serious themes, such as child abuse and the conflicts in antebellum southern society. But even much of the novel's humour is intended for older readers, requiring some knowledge of European history and of Shakespeare.The book's status as one of the Great American Novels is curious when it paints so bleak a picture of America. Any signs of refined culture among these inhabitants of the Mississippi comes not even for the East Coast but from Europe. For all of Twain's love of the land--indeed, the Mississippi River is itself a character--he was clearly a cosmopolitan figure by this point. Or perhaps the praise of America is subtle, as it is a portrait of a land free of aristocracy (the characters who call themselves the \\"king\\" and \\"duke\\" are scoundrels), and the novel is written in the honest vernacular of country people.The novel cannot in any way be considered a perfect work of literature when it is an arc that soars towards quality only in the middle. The opening pages are still in the realm of children's literature, while the final section reads as a tiresome parody with far too much serendipity to be believable. For that reason I've rated it four stars."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a book that I remembered fondly from my childhood that actually holds up to another reading as an adult. Twain's wit and humor still carry the story for me as when I was a child, however, this time around, I was better able to appreciate the social and political commentary infused throughout the story. That's the magic of Twain's masterpiece: it's attraction to both young and old for both the same and different facets. For the young, this is a rollicking adventure story of an ornery youth and his escaped slave friend. It's the classic buddy tale infused with humor and narrow escapes. For the adult, There are the deeper layers of Huck's constant struggle with his own inner morality versus the popular opinion of what is considered to be right in the eyes of whites in the pre-civil war Mississippi River area.For a great escape and a look into the culture of the central United States just prior to the Civil War, I highly recommend Huckleberry Finn for all audiences."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"A set text in Yr 11 English, this book has become a favourite of mine.

In each case the author progressed from noteworthy effort to masterpiece. Huck Finn is a work of art. The funny thing is, he did it by breaking several of the \\"rules\\" in today's literature.Nowadays, aspiring writers are admonished to avoid writing dialect. According to the experts, it has all been done before and done well. They're talking about Huck Finn. Twain's book is a study in American rural dialect between the central and southern states in the nineteenth century. It is so dead-on and hilarious that you can't help but be drawn into the story.Another no-no he commits by today's standards is the preposterous coincidence. When Huck travels a thousand miles down river by raft only to show up weeks later and totally by coincidence at the home of his friend Tom Sawyer's Aunt Sally, it's beyond belief. Of course, the rest of the story is so good and well knitted that we don't particularly care, but my reaction was not \\"Aha!\\" but rather \\"Oh no!\\" Cheap plotting tricks have fallen from favor over the past 150 years.At the heart of the book's greatness, though, is characterization. Huck Finn is one of the most enduringly likable literary characters of all time, the classic unlikely hero. Tom Sawyer is a close second. And yet they are so different. Their words and actions may have surprised us chapter after chapter, but they always stayed true to the characters Twain created.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn slyly purports to be a boys book about freedom on the river. It pretends to have no moral or motive at all. This is not so. Mark Twain, in spite his opening rebuke against anyone finding a meaning in the book, is seeking to make a statement. This is a polemic against the evils of slavery. I often felt that Huck Finn parallels Twains own youth. Huck grows to see Jim as a man and a friend. Twain came from a family which owned slaves but he himself came to be vehemently opposed to slavery. Huck Finn comes from a background where slavery is perfectly acceptable. The grand climax is when Huck decides he will go to Hell rather than let his friend be sold back into slavery. He continues to help Jim. This is an amazing tale although the ending is a bit anticlimactic. One is happy that Jim is free however. He emerges as the one true man and gentleman in the whole novel. This is one of the great underlying ironies of the novel. It is often overlooked due to the politically incorrect racial slurs. The slave is the man with the greatest dignity and integrity. It is unfortunate that this point is missed. Mark Twain wrote a masterpiece. The current controversy will eventually fade but The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will endure as one of the great works of American and World literature."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I adore Mark Twain's hilariouse yet thought-provoking book. Not only does he have the talent to captivate the readers interest but also his characters actions and words have a deeper, often satirical, meaning which requires a sheer genius to produce. Huck is my personal hero because he is never short on solutions or a witty remark. I can relate to his social misfit qualities and some of his philosophys. My favorite line is, &quot;A dog will never bite the hand that feeds it and this is the principal difference between dog and man[kind].&quot; I recommend this to anyone who is looking for an easy to read yet not easy to put down book - the one you're always looking for and rarely are fortunate enough to find. ~15 yrs."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Huck Finn is, along with Faulkner's Sound and Fury, the greatest American novel. The novel is a hillarious slap at romantic chivalry, a great adventure story, an evolution of a man coming of age, as well as a plea to end slavery. I too was forced to read this novel in high school (this year), not once but twice. I am indebted to my teachers. The sinking of the Sir Walter Scott, Huck's decision to endure perdition in order to save Jim, and Tom and Huck's quioxic rescue of Jim are some of the most fantastic scenes in literature. The vernacular is well employed by Twain, not in a racist way, but in a tolerant one. As Huck travels farther into the slave country, he realizes that Jim is a man just like himself. Huck even says that &quot;I knowed he was white.&quot; Huck understands the implications of disagreeing with the orthodox barriers of the time (Walter Scott), but he knowingly violates these supposed values to set Jim free. A boat accident occurs and the response to the question of whether anyone was killed is &quot;Nome. Killed a nigger.&quot; Twain is satirizing the stupidity of this response, not advocating a racist dogma. Jim and Huck discuss the fact that frenchmen talk in a different manner from themselves, but frenchmen are still men. Huck and Jim speak differently, but both are men. This is the messege of this timeless classic. All American novels come from one novel, Huck Finn. If I'd a know'd how hard it was to write a review, I wouldn't a written one in the first place."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Even though the title of the book says \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" and the author is listed as Mark Twain on the cover, this is a rewrite by an author lacking the wry wit and humor of Mark Twain. Why the Dalmatian press decided to take a book that is so wonderful and have it rewritten in such a dry and unexciting way is a travesty. Could someone have actually thought that Mark Twain didn't do a good enough job? I bought 4 of these Dalmation Press Classics books thinking that my children would love them. All four are rewritten in the same dry, unexciting and uninteresting way.

I have listened to it unabridged on tape 3 times and hope to listen to it more. Full of humor and sadness, it is not a book for children as is Tom Sawyer. Huck is an abused youth who narrates an odyssey that he, the runaway son, and Jim, the runaway slave, have on the river. It is unfortunate that films cannot capture the Huck's narrative."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The book I chose to read for my book report was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. The conflict is man vs. society which is illustrated at the climax when Huck is forced to decide society or his heart. His action's results conclude the story. Huckleberry Finn, the main character in this story is perhaps one of the most well known fictional characters ever. His literal point of veiws provide humor and comic relief in suspenseful situations. He is definately a realist and takes everything literally. In Tom Sawyer, he appeared to be tough, yet in this story, his compassionate side is revealed. He percieves others only by how he feels society would feel about them. This is shown in his attitude towards Jim. Huck is very curious at this point in his life and in the story he is trying to determine what his veiws, opinions, and religious beliefs really are. This makes him succeptable to change throughout the story. Others look at Huck as an uncivilized person. The story does not say much about the people around him since the majority of the story is spent with only Jim and it is told in first person. He changes dramatically in that throughout the story, particularly at the climax, he is faced with many decisions where he has to do the right thing which is the wrong thing in societies eyes. I think that he becomes more secure in knowing what is right. The theme of this story is, &quot; Freedom Versus Civilization&quot;. What I liked in this story is that it had a little bit of everything. This story not only portrays the historical Mississippi River, but it also tells a heart- warming story with humor. This story makes you want to cheer on Huck when he is making those decisions. You become not a reader of the story, but a spectator of the events."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Not that Twain needs any more praise, kudos or whatnot, but I bother to write here only to point out that anyone taking issue with the \\"fine points\\" of language, political correctness (ersatz) or racial issues (contemporary or historic) has ENTIRELY MISSED THE POINT of this timeless American treasure.The entire subtext of this gem of a novel is a polemic AGAINST racism. Twain was a die hard abolitionist and fought tooth and nail against prejudice and bigotry wherever he found them. He was intolerant of intolerance. He wrote this wonderfully funny novel after the end of the bloodiest Civil War imaginable (more lives lost than in any other war we have fought) when the entire nation was wounded, suffering and in need of a good laugh. BUT he was not going to let anything pass, let anyone off the hook and was going to call out fools wherever he saw them. His genius was in putting the words in their own mouths and giving them the staqe on which to do so.The deep friendship he limns between Huck and Jim, an ignorant but sweet white boy and an uneducated but deeply loyal and sensitive runaway slave, will bring tears to the eyes of any reader who can, as it were, \\"read.\\"Twain creates such sympathy both between them and in the reader for them and their perilous situation that no one could have written a non-fiction tract, diatribe or polemic that would have better served the cause of racial equality and harmony.Fiction works through the creative processes and in the hands of a master such as Twain can work miracles. The book remains a miracle and one of our national monuments to good overcoming bad ideas and bad people. A battle won, the war ongoing. Take the time to read it and mind-mend your ways. And, for heavensake laugh, because the situation is so absurd, as are we all, so much of the time."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The curse of a novel that becomes a \\"classic\\" is that everyone is expected to read it. Every open-minded, educated, literate adult will read it, but so will every small-minded, semi-literate, uneducated ignoramus, and unfortunately these are the first to express their sentiments regarding Huck Finn. Add to this the number of reviewers on Amazon who are unable to grasp that they are reviewing a product, not a service, and a book that deserves five stars is demoted to four by the unread majority.It is ironic that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is often cited for its racist language when, in fact, it is one of the most ferociously anti-racist novels ever written in America. The language used to refer to the slave Jim is not an instance of racism as the censors would have us believe; neither is it easily dismissable as the language of the time, as many of the novel's defenders claim. Either of these positions is simplistic and does not consider the attitudes of the author himself. As a teacher of American Literature for nearly fifteen years, I have read this book countless times, and I have taken an especial interest in the works of Mark Twain. In my opinion, Mark Twain was fully aware of the connotations of the N-word. If this word did not harbor these connotations in his time, the author was certainly far-sighted enough to know that one day it would. Remember, this was a man who was fully attuned to the problem of humanity. He was also an author famous for his scathing use of irony. Why should his use of the N-word to describe Jim be taken at face value? Jim is the most noble character in the book and the only character who consistently rises above his humanity. Even Huck has his lessons to learn, and Miss Watson does not rise to the occasion until she is near death, but Jim's conscience is consistently clear. That he is referred to by the use of any derogatory term must be ironic.This novel has often been criticized for its last few chapters, and perhaps rightly so. It is unsettling when a novel that has worked so hard to develop a theme suddenly abandons this theme for a simple romp a la The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Yes, this causes unity to suffer and makes for a lopsided work, but even here we can at least appreciate the author's intent. In order to fully appreciate how much Huck has changed and progressed, we must look at him again in contrast to his friend and foil Tom Sawyer. If this frustrates us, the readers, at least it does so with good purpose. Whether or not this purpose is fully realized is debatable, but I think we would be amiss to discard the last few chapters of the text simply because we don't get it, and certainly not because it does not suit our personal tastes.Concerning matters of taste, we should approach this book neither with the eyes of the pseudo-elitist who turns up a nose at the word ain't while failing to grasp concepts of regionalism and local color that should be a part of the mind of a literate adult; nor should we approach it with the mind of the simpleton who finds a book boring simply because it contains sentences of more than five words. (Incidentally, it is a sad reflection on literacy when a fictional son-of-a-town-drunk has a greater vocabulary and better grasp of English conventions than we have.) Mark Twain uses a style of writing that realistically tries to simulate the attitudes and vocabulary of people from different regions and cultures in mid-America in the nineteenth century, and to fail to grasp this is to fail to grasp not only Huck Finn but a huge chunk of American literature written during this time.At last, I would like to offer my personal opinion that no book is perfect, but this is one novel that offers a rare balance of enjoyment, humor and significance seldom achieved by any book or any author writing in any time or at any place. That the author is American and was writing at a time that we were becoming more aware of our own corruption, hypocrisy and greed should cause us to move forward, not back. The evils of humanity will never disappear until we are able to approach them with an open, educated mind."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This Kindle version of Huckleberry Finn is great.

As the title suggests, it follows the adventures of Huckleberry Finn who is paired up with an escaped slave, Jim. This story is just as fantastic as everyone seems to say; it definitely deserves the title of being a \\"classic\\" book. Each obstacle Huck Finn and Jim encounter is captured in stunning detail by Mark Twain and keeps the reader captivated.One of my favorite things about \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is how well the humor and drama balance each other. As the two boys work through each problem there is always a slight air of humor; although there are some intense situations in this book, nothing ever gets too serious. There is an absolutely perfect amount of sly, funny comments, mostly from Huck Finn, to counteract all of the drama. \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" get even funnier and more enjoyable, though, when Tom Sawyer enters the story. His preconceived notions of everything that must be done in each situation provides endless entertainment. This book is a serious, dramatic book but has humor that makes it that much better.No matter how inventive and entertaining the storyline in \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is, though, it is still extremely difficult to get over the grammar. The book is written as if Huck Finn wrote it, with his accent and spellings. Also, the slaves' dialects are written in exactly the same way as they speak. I understand why the book is written in this way, but it does not make it easier to understand or less frustrating to read. Mark Twain wrote this book in a brilliant way; however, after a while, the grammatical errors wore on me and did take away from the story line a little."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I like the adventures of Huckleberry Finn.

The other is found in &lt;Huckleberry Finn&gt; when Huck decides against turning Jim in, even though his soul would rot in hell for it. The point is that Huck really believed that he was going to be damned for helping Jim (which was why the decision was so difficult to make), but was willing to face the consequences anyway.The major letdown of this book is that last part with Tom Sawyer. The book's tone changes suddenly; it becomes almost juvenile. Those last chapters are what's keeping me from giving this book the full five stars.As for the dialects, I had surprisingly little trouble with them even though English is not my first language.

Personally, when I read &quot;Huckelberry Finn&quot; my junior year, I thought that it was an enjoyable break from reading other early American classics, but judging from some of the reviews, others didn't agree. I don't understand exactly what was considered so &quot;boring&quot; about this novel. This book provides the reader with action, humor, and morals; what any 'classic' should do. For those who think of themselves as highly intellectual and felt that the novel didn't have a point, you may want to check your IQ, because I think your ego is in for a massive let-down. Although Twain clearly states at the beginning of the novel that he doesn't want his readers to try to find a point in his 'coming of age' story, the theme of the novel almost smacks the reader in the face. The 'point' is that friendship is more important than social standards and sometimes you have to put yourself at risk in order to save those that you care about.

It is a wonderful, easy read that will take you out of your busy world. It's almost like taking a holiday.I have read both the unabridged and the sanitized versions and I have to say that for me the unabridged version stays closest to the time and era of the book.

There was nothing before, there has been nothing as good since.\\" I wish I could have been the one to coin that description of Twain's best known work. I guess coming from Ernest Hemingway it does carry a bit more weight. \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is one of the more commonly referred to works when people speak of the \\"Great American Novel.\\" A fictional account of a young boy's voyage down the Mississippi River, Huck Finn guarantees that as long as he is around people will still care about American literature. It combines Twain's knack for humor with very real and mature social issues.The main character is of course Huckleberry Finn. When \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" . . . Huck had found $12,000 and was living with the Widow Watson. At the beginning of this book Huck is kidnapped by his Pap, who only has come back to get his son's money. Huck escapes his father and soon finds himself floating down the Mississippi River with a slave named Jim. Jim was the property of the Widow Watson and overheard her plans to sell him to a slave trader. When he realized he would be leaving the relative comfort of the widow's home he decided to escape.Brought up by a racist, abusive and drunken father, Huck at first sees the escape by Jim as totally wrong. However, as the two travel along the river enjoying one adventure after another Huck finds himself growing fond of his companion and the two form a strong bond.\\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" can only be described with one word, classic. It is one of the few novels that can be read by a child and then re-read year after year without becoming the least bit stale. Such staying power is rare and is proof positive that this book before most others most assuredly belongs on the shelves of every school library.

It can teach you to write.5. It's a great adventure story that can be read aloud to groups, or enjoyed by yourself!The Fischer et al. edition attempts to reconstruct \\"Huck Finn\\" in the way Twain probably intended. In particular, there is a section showing how Twain revised the \\"Sunrise on the River\\" passage to perfectly reproduce the sound of English as spoken by Huck --so reading this is almost as if we are listening to a tape recording of Huck talking. If you are unsure about \\"Huck Finn\\", turn to the Sunrise passage and read it aloud. Then tell me you AREN'T an admirer of this novel.As a lesson for writers, Twain's search to perfect his craft and reproduce the very sound of his characters, along with a splendid use of language and an ability to create adventuresome plot are unparalleled in American literature.

And being analytical, I want to know why something is written the way it is; I want to know the historical details behind his expression. So when I find that the Mark Twain Library has published Huckleberry Finn the way Mark Tain wanted it (unlike every edition that's ever been published, including the first!), I had to get it. Using all the explanatory notes--which are NOT cumbersome--and the glossary, and other notes about the text, I came away knowing that this book was truly what it is proclaimed to be: the best American novel ever written.Having read just about all one can get their hands on by Mark Twain, this shed all new light on what Mark Twain was really saying when I read Huck Finn this time. The humour was more obvious, the sarcasm was more justified. The book itself opens up this door, but it helps to know what was in Mark's brain throughout his writing career.Truly a must have for anyone into Mark Twain. I have purchased all that the MTL has put forth so far, and put my other editions in the yard sale box as errant texted that no longer interest me. I think any fan of Mark Twain will be tempted to do the same. Why read errant editions when one can have the author's intended, authoritative publication--with the original neat pixtures, too. I was so taken by this last reading of H. Finn that I've taken to memorizing some of the glossary terms. They are truly classic; bring'm back.I am reminded of E. A. Poe's expectation that his works be published only as originally intended. This should not need to be requested by any author. To modify an author's writings for any reason is a type of sacrilege. Of course, even Poe's books are published different than he wanted. But thankfully, there are publishers who seek to restore the only versions worthy of publication. The Mark Twain Library is doing this, and any wanta-be authority in Mark Twain will never be such with \\"Penguins\\" and other bird-brained mass-market editions sitting on the shelf, or rather, in their hands."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present in 1955 when I was eight years old. I had wanted a baseball glove and was deeply disappointed. It sat for three years, unread and unwanted. When I finally did pick it up and begin to read, I was transported in a way that was to change my life. It would be years before I would understand the meaning of such words as irony, satire and metaphor, but I sensed these things in the way I believe they were intended as I read Huckleberry Finn for the first time.I am perplexed and disturbed when I hear how thoroughly misunderstood and controversial this book has become to some, and it saddens me that those that deem it offensive fail to understand how sympathetic it was towards more positive race relations at the time when it was written.William Faulkner spoke of what was most important to writing in his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize for Literature. He suggested that the best writing deals with problems of the human heart in conflict with itself. Mark Twain's &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; succeeds in a beautiful and remarkable way by subtly illustrating the conflict in Huckleberry's mind between what he has been told by society and what he feels in the intellect of his heart.I shall always be grateful to Mark Twain for this work. It was the portal through which my young mind first grasped the immensity of great literature."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"One hundred and twenty years after its publication, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn remains the quintessential American novel. It is an amazingly well crafted piece of work, as complex or as simple as you want it to be. On one level, it is a dissertation on society, slavery, morality and the meaning of civilization. On another, it is simply an entertaining yarn. Whether you are 8 or 88, there is something here for you.At the heart of the novel is the unlikely but heartfelt friendship between Huck and Jim, a runaway slave. Both are outcasts of sort, running away from a society they cannot comprehend. It is through his friendship with Jim and their adventures together on the river that Huck truly finds himself. He is continually confronted with the question of right and wrong and he learns to stay true to himself and follow his own heart, regardless of conventional, social, or religious mores. Huck's instincts rarely fail him. And, as Huck suspects all along, he learns more on the river than he ever did in school or Sunday school.Many readers see the ending (Huck's adoption and continued \\"civilization\\") as a disappointment. I disagree. Huck has grown so much that his individuality has already been forged. Aunt Sally can't change him, no matter how hard she tries to \\"sivilize\\" him. Besides, Huck always has the option of escape.The book has been lambasted in recent years for its shocking language. But I think it is important to understand that Twain was simply being honest and faithful to the dialect, language, and social sensibility of the times. It would be unfair (and a mistake) to apply present day sensibilities and standards of political correctness (well intended or not) to this book. The language may seem harsh but it should seem harsh. There is value in that as well.It would also be lazy to infer that Twain was racist simply because he uses the \\"n\\" word in this book and because of his characterization of Jim as simple and naive. Jim is uneducated, yes, but in Twain's world, uneducated can also mean unspoiled, completely human, noble, and honest. Rather than demeaning Jim, Twain is holding him as an example of the dignity inherent in all human beings.The value of the individual versus the influence of society. The hope and opportunity of freedom versus the comfort and security of civilization. These are themes that have reverberated throughout American literature, American history, and the American psyche. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn develops those themes brilliantly in a captivating story with vibrant and unforgettable characters. It is, and always will be, an American classic."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"THE ADVENTURE'S OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN, by Mark Twain is an exciting classic about a boy and his strange ambition for never-ending adventure.

Although this book has many racial slurs it should not be under contriversy because of its use of the &quot;N&quot; word. The story takes place when the &quot;N&quot; word was used frequently. In a way it shows the positive relations between two people of different races. Huck Finn the main character of the novel uses this ofensive slur just because he was brought up that way, he doesn't know any better. Within the novel this teenage misfit gets himself in tons of trouble. This is where the comedy comes into play. Every time Huck ends up in trouble he manages to think of some clever excuse. Like when the two slave hunters ran into Huck and Jim(the runaway slave)on the river. Huck said &quot;Oh ya my father has small pocks, you can see him if you realy want to.&quot; Of course the slave hunters wanted to stay as far away from the two because the don't want to get small pocks. Mark Twain not only writes truthfully about this time period but he also critizes the human race for being ignerent and stupid. Throughout this incredible book Twain makes suddle comments about the human race just to poke fun at us. There was a two year break while he was writing this book because he was unsure of what he was doing. This was written in a time period when blacks were looked down upon as if the were not as inteligent as the whites were and Twain is having a black man and white boy out smart several white men. Twain thought that his novel would be laughed at if he continued this unheard of stoiy line. He was in such a twisted mental state he took off thoes two years to think about what he was even writing about, then continued Huck on his journy. This awesome book deserves 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is a story filled with action and adventure.

The main theme of this story is that regular society is trying to make Huck civilized, trying to teach him the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic, and for the most part, he doesn't like that. Huck would runaway to seek freedom for himself. In his adventure to freedom, he runs into Jim, a runaway slave. They would both run into different people in different situations, which were sometimes good and sometimes bad. Both of them encountered many different adventures together. Must read if you want to know what happens at the end. Would they find freedom for themselves or would they get back at being civilized? I liked this book because it is very interesting. I couldn't stop reading it because I keep on thinking to myself what will happen to Huck in his many different adventures to freedom.

I shouted at the characters, I laughed, and putting it bluntly, I just plain enjoyed myself. I see why it was banned, since the N-word was used so frequently, but considering the time and place that the story takes place, no one with any kind of common sense should be upset because of it. The book tells the story of Huckleberry Finn, and young boy and the adventures he has when he is travelling down the Mississippi River with a runaway slave, Jim. The book is a serial of the troubles and the good times that Huck and Jim have on their adventures. And what adventures they are too. From Huck escaping his father to the last adventure with Jim.

Twain in his characteristic satiric fashion constructs an avator for freedom in Huckleberry Finn, and a comment on American society in the 1800s through his beautiful idiomatic prose. As Huck winds down the meandering Mississippi, the reader is wisked away on a page-turning sojourn like no other. However, most readers will make this book more than a sojourn; this book will become a torn and tattered escape that barely rests on their bookshelves before going on another journey with another mind. A 10 out of 10, which symbolizes the beauty of literature, and the real reason why reading a book will exist long after computers become a trite household appliance- this book is transportable and 2 1/2 inches of sure beauty. No metal, no chips, just literary genius"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Without reserve, this is the best of all Mark Twain's not inconsiderable body of work. If you read *Huck Finn* as a child, you owe it to yourself to reread it; it is the kind of story that appeals on many levels and is still as fresh and delightful as ever. Mark Twain succeeds in keeping a serious thread at its core through a string of frankly hilarious adventures, passing judgement on slavery, religion, and politics. Far more than a period piece, it indures with its wit and savvy to become one of the most vibrant of America's classics"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book was read to me at a daycare center when I was 7.

While this novel is great, the quality of this particular version of the novel (Puffin Classics) is quite awful. After reading the copy a single time, at least 100 pages came loose from the flimsy glue binding. This is a great read, and I recommend purchasing a different version of the novel, even if it is a dollar or two more, just so you don't have a collection of pages scattered all over the place."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry FinnMost everything about this book was GOOD!This book had many interesting unexpected moments! It had a great blend of mystery, suspense, and surprises. All of the chapters had a great sense of imagery. Mark Twain describes every character with great detail. You can imagine what every character is wearing and what they look like. It is a great fiction book.This book takes place out in the Mississippi River where two men from different races are looking for adventure and are traveling for freedom. There is murder, a feud, and a lot of adventure. In the book you are faced with many problems like how will Jim (the slave) get freed, or how will Huck Finn find a way to get away from his alcoholic father.This book had my attention ever since I picked it up! This is a good book for young adults because of the outdoor setting and some mature words.In the end this book has a great moral and teaches you so much on how to treat others and how you want to be treated. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants an adventure!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I liked this book a lot. Huck's adventures are way cool and it was kind of hard to keep track of them all. My favorite adventure is when he and Jim befriend the two aristocats and and they have that plan to steel the Wilkes' money. it is funny when they come back and they don't get the money anyway.Thet was really cool how Tom's aunt and uncle were able to trick Tom and Huck while the two friends were thinking that they were actually fooling them. The reason i liked this book the most was i loved how loyal Huck was to Jim. I can see why he struggled with keeping him a secret and i would also be tempted to turn him in at times. i also loved how Tom was so whilling to help his best friend that he hadn't seen for so long.

I came into this book thinking that it was going to be to long and that I would not have time in my busy life to finish it. I began it on a plane ride home and I was enchanted by it. I never thought a book could take a hold of my imagination and heart the way this one did. Huck Finn was a simple young child who had more heart and common sense that I could ever imagine. I was intrigued by the mature relationship that he was able to take up with Jim and how he looked up to Jim as a mentor even though he was brought up to know that Jim was only property and a slave. The dialect that was used made it even more real for me; Mark Twain put me right in with Huck and Jim as though I was floating down that river on the same raft as them. I loved to watch Huck mature as the trip went on, he seemed to understand more and more that his lies could hurt people and some could help. The only part about this book that disappointed me in the slightest bit was when he ended up at Tom Sawyer's aunt's house. It made me feel as though the whole novel was just going around in circles and I secretly in my heart I wished that Huck and Jim would never go back and get away from society and live the carefree life of drifting down the river forever, although I know that this could not happen.

You have to have a balance control on your tape player, or no dice. I don't have a balance control, so I had to unplug first the left and then the right speaker to listen to this. That's the only way they could get the entire novel onto four tapes! Mr. Hill reads a lot slower than I do, for effect I guess, so we won't listen to this much. Maybe just when I am sick of reading aloud! But it is nice to have so when I need a substitute, he or she can just pop the tape in and not have to worry about covering the reading for that day."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Don't listen to the naysayers. This is a truly great piece of literature. On the surface, it's a great adventure story in the tradition of &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. But there are deeper issues to be tackled, issues that still can provoke lively discussion more than 100 years after the book was written. In my opinion, the central theme to the story is Huck's development of a moral code. Huck's sense of right and wrong is forged in the furnace of experience and the need for survival. The reader is put in the position of rooting for Huck to escape his abusive father even if it necessitates the use of deception, making people believe that he, Huck, had been killed. In the journey down the Mississippi with escaped slave Jim, Huck survives by use of his wits, pretending to be someone he's not (his attempt to pass himself off as a girl fails miserably), and encountering various interesting characters. For awhile, he stays with a very respectable, upright family who has one problem: they are in a feud with another family, which results in a tragic ending for all concerned. (As a sidenote, I read that section of the book the morning of September 11, before turning on the TV only to be horrified by the events of that day when America and freedom itself was so violently attacked. Why must the world continue partaking of the bitter fruit of violence?) The comic pair of &quot;royal&quot; con men who become traveling companions with Huck and Jim scheme to dupe the unwitting out of money as they travel from town to town, until Huck helps to foil their biggest scheme. Huck's moral code is continually shaped by the extent by which he values people as friends and worthy individuals. Once Jim is recaptured, Huck has to make a decision which becomes the central moral dilemma of the book: should Huck return Jim to Miss Watson, from whom he escaped, because now Huck is having severe misgivings about helping take someone else's &quot;property&quot;, or should he help Jim escape because Jim has become a friend to him? Interestingly, Huck does not debate, in his own mind, the morality or immorality of the slave trade in and of itself, but be makes his decision based on Jim's friendship, which Huck thinks is the wrong decision based on what he was taught. But, of course, Huck basically follows his heart.At this point, the book bogs down a little. There is a contrived situation where Huck reunites with Tom Sawyer, and what should have been a fairly easy escape for Jim is complicated needlessly by Tom's romantic ideals gained by his reading of adventure books. Even though I found this part of the novel frustrating to read, it does point to the difference between Huck's pragmatism and Tom's romanticism. Huck gives in to Tom too easily on this point, and the whole escape plan almost blows up in their faces. Don't allow the rather weak ending (or the liberal use of the n-word) to deter you from reading perhaps the paramount achievement in American literature. Enjoy it for the rousing adventure it is, and think about the deeper moral questions raised by this book. If any novel deserves the label &quot;classic&quot;, it's &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"dventures of Huckleberry Finn By Mark Twain 352 PagesThis book was very well-writen. It is about a boy named Huckleberry Finn (Huck for short), who runs away with his slave named Jim, who doesn't speak English very well. They run into a lot of trouble along the way which makes the book very exciting and suspenseful. Like one time they run into a bunch of pirates. That part kept me turning the pages. I think that the setting makes the story more exciting and it is an important part of the story. The setting is a very long time ago, when slaves were still legal.

It's way better than the movie, like most books are. Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry do things that would give your life such a rush. The adventures they go through and the trouble they get into is just great. Children these days can't do some of the stuff they do without being gounded for life or send to a military camp, but on thing they can do is use there imagination like Tom and Huck do in this book. This is a really good book to read and it feels like your part of the book, which is a cool feeling. This is one of my all time favorite books. I read it once already but I just want to open it and start reading it again. Mark Twain, AKA Samuel Clemens, had a taste for adventure now it's your to taste it. There are many moods to go thrugh in this book happy, sad, angry and etc. Just got to read it. There is excitement around ever corner.Uproariously funny, Tom and Huck even run away awhile, to show you how hard it is to live on your own if your a kid to see how hard it is to support yourself on you own.

It was the first story in America to be done in venecular which made it a classic and hard to read. some how his adventures are nothing but dull are semi-stupid. Huck is not a perfect character and all his flaws seem to be over looked. Jim is merely in the story because he needs to be and although he is not a brilliant person mark twain has not given the slave fair credit by making an unschooled boy half his age seem twice as smart.

I didn't get past the 12th chapter before I had to buy the Cliffs Notes (I've *never* done that before). Just thinking about the book makes me sick. Boring, rediculous, and full of cliches and stereotypes, this book made me wonder exactly WHY Mark Twain was considered a brilliant author and this one of his best books. At the time of reading this book I had a student teacher, which only made the experience worse. The ONLY thing we ever discussed in class was literary symbolism. I mean, we spent 30 minutes talking about a bowl of fruit!!!! (what did Twain mean by spending so much time describing the fruit? what does the fruit symbolize?

However, I hadn't read much of it before I realized that it was going to be something to suffer through, not enjoy.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was an extremely plotless, racist book relating the adventures of the rather tedious, annoying character of Huck Finn. Huck had recently left his hometown and went rafting down the MIssissippi with a slave, Jim. Huck is forever lying to and leaving Jim, in a fashion that made me wonder if he had ADD. The end of the novel, which had potential to make it better, made me hurl the book across the room, in a way certian to make any librarian weep.I also found the dialects that Clemmins used extremely annoying.

This book should have never saw print, much less read and loved by generations of Anerican readers. That goes to show how stupid Americans can be. Nor should it be regarded as the novel that inspired all other American novels. Nor should anybody be impressed by the seven or eight dialects employed within the novel's structure, which the fool author made up to fool us into believing people actually talked like that. The story is a couple of people floating down a river, with a number of utterly unsuccessful scenes meant to enhance and define a theme so obvious its not even worth mentioning. Then there is the structure of scenes themselves. Each uniformly the same in length and what occurs except the last where in the scene drags on and on and on and on. Then to top it all off at the end Hucleberry Fin regresses. This is worthless. Anybody who likes this novel is stupid. They have no linguistic intelligence or even logical intelligence. And yes you all should read Dean Koontz who is a better writer than Samuel Clemens ever dreamed of being. He will be our Shakespeare, never Mark Twain.

It is like calling the sand man and allowing him to sprinkle his little magic on me in broad daylight. Unlike previous reviewers, I do not care for the racist slurs or \\"problems\\" as you can call it because I think it is ridiculous to dwell on something that happened nearly a hundred years ago when such words were acceptable. Mark Twain even said and I quote:\\" There are many humorous things in the world; among them is the white man's notion that he is less savage than all the other savages.\\" So, instead of coming to the conclusion that this is a racist book, maybe some people should read up on the author to find out whether all of it is a myth or plan truth.Unfortunately, I thought that the book was a little dry and got pretty boring some where in the middle. Without a doubt I think that Mark Twain is an excellent writer, but since this book was written a very long time ago and some of the dialect is pretty hard to understand, I find it pretty impossible to understand everything that is going on without having background knowledge of basic American History (but that is just my opinion). Otherwise, I would probably never read this book again, I really do not care for it and I do not think that it is garbage either.

Also, Twain's vivid descriptions absorbed me into the book and made my feel as if I were sitting next to Huck and Jim on their raft. However, those factors definitely did not make up for the boredom experienced as I read the book. The characters were bland and unappealing, the plot was absurd and dull, and the hefty symbolism was annoying.Sure, &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; is a literary classic.

It's a stunner, a wonderfully entertaining two and half-hours of fun and thrills. I enjoyed it so much I decided to get Jack Lemmon's companion reading of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Wow, this performance is so enthralling I listened to the entire audio book in one sitting. The book is written with Huckleberry Finn as the first person narrator. Who would have ever imaged it but Jack Lemmon is Huckleberry Finn. Two time Academy Award winner Lemmon's Huck is full of pluck and cunning, mischief and excitement when he escapes from his Pap, confronts the King and the Duke and plots with Tom Sawyer. His contrition after playing the mean joke of Jim after they separated in the fog is palpable. And the famous Lemmon mannerisms are everywhere in evidence. Mr. Lemmon seems to be enjoying every moment of Mark Twain's wry and wonderful writing; he makes the characters live. I really loved this."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Have you read Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn? If not, then I highly recommend you do. Mark Twain sure knew what he was doing when he wrote Huck Finn. He was sending out a message to the world. As Huck once said &quot;Humans can be awful mean to each other&quot;. I believe that this is the message that Mark Twain wanted to get across. An ignorant little boy, Huck Finn, defies all that he knows when rescuing Jim. He even recognizes that we are all the same underneath the skin; we are all human. Huckleberry Finn is the most unlikely hero. As aforesaid, he was ignorant and unconventional. Knowing nothing, he set out into the world and had amazing adventures. He might have been uneducated but he certainly knew what was most important in life. As a literary piece, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is amazing. It drags a bit in the middle but it picks up again and has the perfect ending. If you haven't read it, read it now. It will enlighten you and enrich your knowledge more than you can imagine.

This is the &quot;darkest&quot; American novel I know of, which is probably one of the reasons that induced Hemingway to say that American literature begins and ends here. Like Conrad's Marlowe, Huck is journeying &quot;upriver&quot; into a region of the human psyche best left unobserved by any but the most stalwart of heart. His eyes are opened on the voyage. His ultimate character is shaped by what he experiences. His is a passage from naivete to wide-opened observer.What begins as an idyllic raft trip turns more and more turbulent the closer to Illinois he gets. What begins as a Tom Sawyer lark becomes more and more Faulknerian. Yes,it is a voyage from inexperience to experience. Yes, it is a quest story. Yes, it is a novel about man's inhumanity to man, etc. etc. But there is so much more at work here..Twain shared much in common with Swift. We are looking primarily at the underbelly of humanity here, not its bright spots. The ending, as pointed out by numerous critics,is problematical. Exactly what is Huck's position vis-a-vis Jim? Has all that has occured previously been given up in the moment he is counseled by Tom? Is Huck so ready to overthrow his hard-fought allegiance in order to conform to society's dictums? Twain offers no clear resolution, but this should not keep this novel from being taught in high school or college classrooms, when students are given the liberty to consrtuct their own conclusions.Personally, I believe what Twain is telling us is that we can never exhibit our true natures in society without risking being stoned to death. Conventional pressures have not really changed that much from Twain's day to the present. Just by espousing my support for this novel I am opening myself up to criticism aimed my way from the righteously correct. American society hasn't changed all that much. Religious piety and indignation has been supplanted by political correctness. Harriet Beacher Stowe, bless her, is alive and well. There are people out there convinced that Uncle Tom's Cabin is a more significant work than Huck Finn. What would Vonnegut say here?"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"For such a simple story, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn often proves to be elusive for its readers. Here are some guideposts to look out for:This story is told by Huck, and is not in the classic shape of a novel. Rather it is a precursor to Ulysses and Remembrance of Things Past, where other great writers attempted to capture the essence of our internal dialogue.Huck is also hiding a lot from himself. You as the reader can quickly see through him, though. He is trying to put a brave and positive face on a very dangerous situation. We all do that.Huck also has to face himself before the book ends. What really is important? We can all spout a lot of moral talk, but what we do is critical.If we lived in Huck's times, we would also see that there was an emormous moral dilemma. The rules of humanity were often not applied to black people. You could choose to go along and feel like a hypocrite (if you thought about what you were doing), or you could do the right thing. Sensitive people of that day often found it hard to do the right thing. If your neighbors were open-minded and you lived in the North, you might do one thing. If your neighbors were slaveholderes and lived in the South, you might do another.Also, think about the trip down the river as an analogy for going through life. How will it turn out if you just let your direction go with the current?"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is a classic youngster's tale which can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

He took a supporting character from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and transformed him into an amazing main character and narator of this book. Huck Finn's feelings of his surroundings in the book are relatable to everyone, as we have all had to deal with a phony, a friend who is in trouble, and reuniting with an old pal. Twain uses history of life on the Mississppi River and a great story to create this unforgettable book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I downloaded direct from Project Gutenberg the public domain Adventures of Huckleberry Finn with images. (pg76.mobi @ 26.5 mb, 2006 and updated last May 2011) Admittedly far larger than the non-illustrated 880 kb one, which I reckon is the one you used. But, for those willing to use the space for E.W. Kemble's illustrations, here cut and pasted into the text as if from the original as scans, as well as Hamlet's supposed soliloquy--which is hard to read, but it's there as three inserted greyish images of the original book's pages at Loc 2374-5--it may be a work-around solution. THe illustrations and chapters are listed and hyperlinked but the \\"Go To\\" on Kindle via my download takes you to the beginning or cover nearby, not a Table of Contents.Not elegant, but David Widger's \\"production\\" for Gutenberg-dot-org allows us to see it on a Kindle or e-book reader. A prefatory note mentions how this same image file of Huck can be clicked to reformat it to look better on a computer or laptop as opposed to the version I am consulting for the Kindle. Better versions illustrated with Kemble's images exist for a cost, of course. I posted this not as a review of the text itself (which may surprise those who forget how the plot falls apart towards the end despite all its earlier strengths!) to help others searching for this e-book version. It looks as if the illustrated version is the more complete e-book text, at least the one offered at PG for free.Paul Killebrew in Aug. 2011 reviewing found a flaw in the public domain text version Amazon offered as of that writing: no end to Chapter 23 and no Hamlet's marvelous mash-up of the Bard's greatest one-liners--so I wanted to mention this. I compared a printed copy and the e-text of the U of Virginia with that of the illustrated Gutenberg and they matched for Ch. 23. But the online Gutenberg text lacks the Hamlet material. I suspect the non-illustrated one via the public domain text at Gutenberg as with that offered for Kindle download in this listing may lack the material too.Any public domain text now seems by Amazon to be lumped into all sorts of media. So, evaluation of one e-book (or audiobook) appears harder and harder to carry out as the editions proliferate for newer devices. As controversy continues around how to teach this classic American story, readers may wish to have this illustrated version for portability or quick consultation, and can check it against the more stable printed editions widely available."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain is a great author, and this is a classic work of American literature, and a fun read.

Classic that will always be a classic! I wished I had read it when I was younger. The friendship between Huck and Tom is so genuine."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The following review is from my blog, Cure My Writer's Block:The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is technically the sequel to Tom Sawyer, but it can and often is read as a book on its own. It is the story of Huckleberry \\"Huck\\" Finn and his adventures on the Mississippi River as he and the runaway slave, Jim, escape downstream. Along the way they have adventures involving fog banks, con artists, feuding families, mistaken identity, and countless others. Twain takes you on a trip of the Mississippi River culture of the mid 1800's.Huckleberry Finn is a great book that is related to Tom Sawyer, but is truly a whole different animal. It has a serious, thoughtful side to it. There is definitely the trademark Twain humor to be found throughout the book, with moments that will have you laughing out loud if you try to visualize them. However, there is an important underlying story and lesson about racism, friendship, loyalty, and human decency. That is what makes this story one which I have read and reread several time since I first was assigned to read it in 7th grade, more years ago than I care to admit!There have been school districts in the past that have banned this book because of concerns about racist content. This is something that needs to be addressed. There is certainly racism in this book. In fact, racist attitudes and the use of racists terminology is a consistent theme throughout the narrative. The problem is that if you just notice that it has racism, you truly miss the point that Twain was trying to make. Yes, Huck Finn had lots of racists views that he was raised with, as were most people of that time period. He doesn't question them, because he was always told that's how things were. Even the runaway slave, Jim, sees things much the same way because that was the culture of the region. What is so amazing about this book (and what makes me weep anytime a school district bans it) is that Huck Finn, without even realizing it, grows past his racist upbringing to see Jim as a true person and friend. He still used the same racist language, as does everyone in the book (and, historically, from that time period), but he sees past the words. Here is a young man that is convinced that people who help slaves escape are going to Hell. Once his friend is in danger of being sent back into slavery, he faces an internal struggle about what he should do. He finally comes to the decision, \\"I just reckon I'll go to Hell, then!\\" Reading that statement in the book almost makes you want to cheer out loud. Yes, he still uses language and sees some things in a way that is disgusting by modern standards, but he still took that step into the light and was willing to take such a bold risk for someone that he no longer saw as a slave, but as a man and a true friend.If there is a downfall to this novel, it is the language, and I don't mean the racist language (which still makes it a little uncomfortable to read even when you take its setting into account). Twain tries to capture the colorful language and terminology of the age and region, but the spelling and liberal use of apostrophes can be painful to the brain and even more painful if you try to read it out loud. I found that I had to read quickly through a lot of sections so that I wouldn't think too much about them and confuse myself on what he was trying to say.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a time honored classic that should be on most people's shelves. The controversy surrounding it and the language issue costs it a little in its review score, though. I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I begged a grammar teacher to visit these characters!Christopher Slaterauthor of Trapped in Shades of Grey"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Tom Sawyer is a vibrant telling of life in a small town along the Mississippi River in the 1800's. Mr. Clemens paints great word pictures in a dialect of the times. Even though the offensive word for blacks is used, the reader should realize that the word is historically significant and tolerate its use as reflective of those times."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Largely plotless and oftentimes difficult to read because of the extensive use of particular vernaculars, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has, regardless, entered the American subconscious in the late 1800s and has stayed with us now into the 2000s. The work itself is a long, drawn out traveling blog of a young boy who needs to escape an abusive father, the rigors of becoming \\"civilized\\", and the confined spaces of a family oriented lifestyle. Huck Finn, not yet 14, is an inventive, creative, but also rational individual who's sense of adventure is only rivaled by Tom Sawyer. Where Tom creates plot and adventure and suspense, Huck is willing to allow life to take it's course, like the river he travels upon, and will simply adjust to the bumps encountered on his travels.Huck leaves his old life behind and begins his travels and ends his travels with Jim, a black man who, despite the time period, is the single most rational individual in the entire story. In fact, his one liners and his ability to have a sincere sense of empathy and care for Huck raises him above the other adult characters that are riddled throughout the story. More often than not, the duo will encounter murderers, swindlers, and drunkards that don't have a single redeeming quality about them to compare with the soft spoken, attentive, and motherly association that we garner from Jim.Despite being relatively without a plot the book is simply about life, namely the life of an American boy and all the adventures he can get into when allowed to roam free. That mentality is the very embodiment of our desires, our wishes to travel, explore, to understand, to live, and to feel free. Huck feels the most freedom when it's quiet, away from the noise and bustle of cities and towns, and when the river is peaceful and the sky is alight with the moon and stars. He sometimes feels alone, but rarely lonely. He accepts Jim's company and is happy to have him as a traveling companion while nature takes its course.Though it was written as a sequel to Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain creates a stand-alone story that has captured the minds and hearts of any exploratory individual, whether as a child or as an adult and it will most likely continue to captivate us for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Like many people of my age (62), I read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn as a child because at that time it was widely perceived to be a child's or young adult's book. This is unfortunate as it is not nor has it ever been directed at the young. In my rereading I discovered for the first time why it is still called the original great American novel. Huckleberry, like Twain, is opinionated and perceptive. His narration and point of view drive the novel forward. Rather than relegate this work to the children's shelves or castigate it as racist, folks should embrace this novel for what it is, a bildungsroman that shows the growth of a country as well as the growth of its young protagonist."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"In Adventures of Huckleberry Finn we see the initial paragraph introducing this story as a flashback. Huckleberry Finn, or Huck, starts to recount how he and his friend Tom Sawyer discovered a lot of money and right from the start we see a style of writing that mimics that of an under-educated youth. It is wrought with spelling and grammar mistakes, which help to develop the character of Huck and you instantly understand his education and maturity level, or lack thereof. This first person recounting of events does a lot to draw you into how Huck saw the world around him.The setting of this book is in the mid 19th Century, starting in Missouri in a small town on the Mississippi River. The locations change many times in the book as a main theme of the story is escape. Huck initially escapes life under the guardianship of Miss Watson and Widow Douglas, then he ends up having to sneak away to escape his father. After this escape he discovers the slave Jim and embarks on a journey to help him escape to Ohio to break free from his slavery.When Huck meets Jim we see an internal struggle, the conflict of the overall story. Huck wonders if he should turn in Jim, since he is someone's property after all. At this point in the story he decides not to turn Jim in and then starts his transformation.The two of them begin to build a friendship that ultimately changes Huck. You see a shift in his views on people and slavery that continues all the way through the end of the work. During this building of friendship you slowly see a shift in how Jim is portrayed in the story, from a very racist caricature of a black man to a friend and equal with Huck; from a slave fleeing captivity to a free man. We see Jim's compassion when he doesn't let Huck see the dead body in a flooded house they find, which we later discover was Huck's own father.Another interesting little sub-story within this work is when Huck and Jim get separated as a steamship floods their raft. We see Huck get taken in by a man name Buck and his family the Grangerfords who are locked in a feud with a rival family the Sheperdsons. The whole thing turns to a major conflict as Buck's sister runs away with a man from the Sheperdsons. This is a parallel to the well-known Romeo and Juliet story that we all can relate to, and in this conflict we see the excitement as Huck barely escapes alive.This story goes on to tell the story of this little adventure but much of it is little more than enjoyable reading, except for the introduction of two new characters, King and Duke. This is important because this leads to the re-introduction of the conflict, whether Huck should help Jim or turn him in. The King, ends up playing the Judas of the story and sells his information about the escaped slave Jim. This leads to the crisis and climax.Jim gets seized and help on a plantation, which we find out is owned by Huck's friend Tom's aunt and uncle. At this point we see Huck overcome his conflict. He feels that he is helping to steal Miss Watson's property (Jim) but decides that regardless of the consequence, he was going to do it. When Huck goes to investigate he is mistaken for Tom and uses this opportunity to gather his information.The story the goes into the intricate escape plan that Tom and Huck devise. We see an exciting scene where Tom is shot in the leg and Jim stays behind to help him. Jim's decision ultimately leads to the failure of this attempt and he is taken. This leads into the final resolution, as we find out that Jim was already free. Miss Watson had died and freed him in her will.This is a very fun story with a few sub-stories included. The overall theme is escape and the conflict, crisis and climax are all very apparent. The resolution of the story comes as a welcomed surprise as any reader would develop a connection with Jim just as the first person narrator, Huck, does. This is a well structured work and a very interesting read."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"People and politics never change.

But if you look a little more closely, you find that he sure knows how to use the semi-colon, and his sentence structure is picture perfect. Mr. Twain may have decided that he was going to have some fun with his charming narrator, but he sure wasn't going to sacrifice good writing to do so.The novel, as everyone knows, is a masterpiece, and works splendidly on every level. Plot, character development, theme; everything is here. Anybody reading this review has probably read the book several times and moreover has probably read about it a dozen more so it's pretty certain that my little review is not going to add much. I would, however, like to comment on something which struck me while reading it most recently, which is how richly it evokes middle America of the mid-nineteenth century. In other words, as well as being literature of the first rank, Huckleberry Finn also functions as a thorough and fascinating historical document of a time and place that every year sinks deeper and deeper into our collective memory.Here he is describing Uncle Silas' place in Arkansas upon seeing it for the first time. \\"It was one of these one-horse cotton plantations and they all look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different length, to climb over the fence with . . . some sickly grass-patches in the big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed off; big double log house for the white folks--hewed logs with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud stripes been white-washed some time or another; round log-kitchen, with a big, broad open but roofed passage joining it to the house . . . hound asleep there in the sun; more hounds asleep round about . . . outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cottonfields begins, and after the fields the woods.\\"The first thing that strikes you about this is how . . . impoverished this all is, especially compared to how we live today. And this is a cotton-field owner with a number of slaves! But this was the south: rural, poor, hot, languid. Oh, yes, we are all familiar with the palatial southern mansion from novels like Gone With the Wind; I suspect that most of the South in the 1840s was closer to Huck's description than to Margaret Mitchell's.Here's Huck's description of the town in which the King and Duke put on their first show: \\"The stores and houses was most all old, shackly, dried-up frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted; they was set up three or four feet above ground on stilts, so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little gardens around them, but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson-weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tinware . . . There was generly hogs in the garden, and people driving them out.\\" Charming, eh? Of course, we in our modern twenty-first century aren't immune to such slovenliness. Sometimes, historical descriptions remind us that things don't change much.Along with his brilliant observations of humanity and the human habitat the novel also contains breathtaking descriptions of nature, especially the Mississippi River. There's heavy timber on the Missouri side, mountains on the Illinois side, the lights of St. Louis: \\"We run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always in the dead water under a towhead . . . Next we slid into the water and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off; then we sat down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee-deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywhere--perfectly still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs a cluttering, maybe. The first thing you see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line--and that was the woods on t'other side.\\" How wonderfully evocative this is; how it makes one ache to experience such things!Again, the novel is so much more than this. I'm not going to bother with the theme and the plot and the characters--what else is there to say?--but I can not finish this without giving an example or two of the wonderful humor contained in here. Here's the charming Huck after sneaking into the circus under the tent: \\"I ain't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way, but there ain't no use in wasting it on them.\\" And when the King and the Duke run on hard times: \\"First they done a lecture on temperance, but they didn't make enough for them both to get drunk on. Then, in another village, they started a dancing-school; but they didn't know no more than how to dance than a kangaroo does, so the first prance they made the general public pranced in and pranced them out of town . . . \\"Oh, how rich this is. Rich and funny and lovely and hilarious. Read it for the pure entertainment contained in here, if nothing else."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The most charming element of Mark Twain's writings is that he masques his utter disdain at the defects and foibles of society under a superficial layer of humour. Indeed the simmering screen of wit and hilarisity so readily associated with this great 19th.century American novelist lends an air of deceit to his work. Now,humour and comic satire have always been great writers' subtle instruments to deflate the ever-expanding balloon of society's corrupt lifestyle and the gift of employing boisterous means to mirror moral decay is firmly exploited by Mark Twain in his remarkable novel \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\",arguably the best work of the author.For those who haven't read Twain's previous book \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\",a meeting with Huckleberry Finn for the first time would prove both awkward and interesting. Huck Finn,as we know from his plethora of adventures with Tom Sawyer in the aforementioned book,is a mischievous urchin always in the uttermost fear from his drunken,never to do well father. At the end of this book,we discern Huck Finn to be fed up with being,or rather trying to be,a decent,well-furnisheeeed lad and even runs away from his adopted mother-of-sorts Old Widow Douglas only to be brought back by Tom Huck takes up the funny and great tale of boyish mischiefs from there and himself accounts in his very own American dialect in a conversational tone that imbibes the readr's interest and takes him through his various adventures,misadventures,joy,agony and an innocent and gradual maturation.Huck is saturated with putting on a fresh and fair appearance and longs to escape the realm of Old Widow Douglas,Miss Watson and others propagating 'civilization' and returns to his old familiar,accuatomed ways of 'uncivilized' living. His drunken father's whim to take him back with him and his fortunes enentually proves to be a blessing in disguise as he escapes from his perpetually inebrited and cruel father only to meet with another fugitive in the shape of Jim,a \\"nigger\\" and and slave of Miss Watson. Jackson Island proves too insecure an abode to sustain life with the whole of St.Petersburg hot on their heels and so Huck and jim make a raft and flow along the Mississippi river and what \\"a raft of trouble\\" their floating journey would turn out to be.The eponymous protagonist of the novel and the frightenrd slave encounters numerous characters on their journey. Huck Finn undergoes changes in his perceptual capabilities as he decodes the latent meanings in ordinary and seemingly harmless folks' intensions. Most notably Huck and Jim meet two men,old in years but youngat deceit,and enforcrd by trying circumstances to accept them in their journey,are subjected to myriad critical moments,which when congregated,direct at the moral corruption of people. Huck and Jim have to harmonise reluctantly with these two characters in their success in fooling a whole village and then in attempting rob an innocent family of its money. Huck learns to refine the good from the evil and foolowing the echo of a pure conscience saves many a misfortune from crashing upon a number of innocents. Huck and Jim are finally successfully in absconding these two men but land up in Uncle Silas Plhep's place,two miles below Pikesville,and then the inevitable takes place. Huck is kept back under the care of Aunt Sally,Uncle Silas's wife.\\"The Adventures of Hucleberry Finn\\" reflects a typical Mark Twain---witty,hilarisity and sarcastic. This book goes much deeper and is more intense in the sense of exposing the debaucheryand sheer foolishness that society favours to live in. What the American great sketched in \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\", he finishes addind the final touches in this novel---the abject custom of slave-trade and racism. The easy and nonchalent manner in which the poor villagers are taken in by the two \\"Royal Nonesuch rapscallions\\" mirror the intellectual bankruptcy of humans in a smaller landscape. Hollow laws are mocked at and individual pecularity ridiculed. But Twain doesn't make this essentially boys' book a dark,exhaustive social novel and riddled with with comedy and fun,this novel is then added by a hint of romanticism when the representative of all boys Tom Sawyer arrives onto the scene and both enthralls and pleases te audience the audience with the implementation on his notion of heroism and style.The plethora of dialects used in the book do make it difficult for the reader to properly absorb their meanings but with the passage of time,he gets to comprehend them and finds them somewhat funny. The word \\"nigger\\" too is an utterly controversial one as scattered through the pages actually divert the major essence of the book. And Jim's marvellous escape from the jaws of death after being bitten by a rattlesnake becomes a trifle too romantic. Is it really possible to survive a rattlesnake bite that easily?Even after taking the flaws into consideration,one must ackowledge its conguency to the life of a boy undermined by a boozed father,uncompromising circumstances and bitter society. Huck finn is the eternal effigy of a street-urchin captivated within the narrow scope of civilization and in his urge to free himself from the shackles of civil codes,this \\"poor devil\\" confronts the harh realities of life and through his innocent,pure perception,learns more about the world and the umpteen dark aspects of it. His explicit desire to return to his old days of uncivilized manners is never realised as escaping from Widow Douglas,he falls into the grasp of Aunt Sally. Indeed the book ends in the rstoration of all pieces of the jigsaw puzzle and pehaps this fairy-tale gratification is a vital part of life that propels us to carry on with our own adventures."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"As a high school teacher, a question we always face when teaching the classics is... will my students think this boring, irrelevant, and inscrutable? While many of my students struggled through Hawthorne, Emerson, and Thoreau, Mark Twain's Huck Finn caught their interest more deeply.What makes this classic appealing to high school students is its taboo character, its humor, and its characters. The novel is a taboo; knowing that the book has been banned in places all across the nation rouses students (\\"oooo... they say we can't read it? I'm in!\\"). With heated issues like the use of the n-word, smoking and stealing, students are in. Further, the novel is genuinely funny, even to teenagers. Huck is honest to the bone-his observations about conventions are amusing. And the messes he gets into with Jim (among other things, dressing up like women) are hilarious. Finally, the characters are genuinely likeable-students can relate to Huck's restlessness and mistrust of authority, and can despise the rigidity of the Widow.There are many particularities about Huck that students will love. For one, he smokes and questions traditional things like prayer and Christianity. He hates school and doesn't see the point of wearing nice clothes. He sneaks out late at night. There is one scene that students will particularly find amusing. Huck has run away from the widow and ventured into town incognito to find out what people are saying about him. The thing is, he is dressed like a girl. It is hilarious to read the descriptions of this lanky boy attempting to play the part of a sweet modest girl. The students read with interest and enjoy making fun of Huck here. They appreciate his wild side.There are a few precautions in teaching this book to high school students. There are passages that border on racism-not only the use of the n-word, but many a passage that underscore stereotypes about blacks. These are indeed a reflection of the time and do not invalidate the book, but they must be approached with high school students conscientiously and explicitly. Also, the dialect in the book is hard and frustrating for many of the students."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain contained many different morales.It help encouraged me to continue to listen to my heart.

Not only is the language simple, you'll literally fall in love with the characters, each so intelligent and charming in their own way.I am very impressed with Mark Twain's writing ability. It is astonishing that the book he wrote so long ago is still so adventuresome, still so educational, still so universal today. Although I found this novel more exciting than \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" fans of the book that started it all will enjoy this too.This is an awesome read for a high school English class. You'll like the action and your teacher will like the thematic purpose! Even though America is now slave-free, \\"Huck Finn\\" reminds us of the evils of human bondage, ensuring that the U.S. will continue to maintain freedom for all.

I hate people who discredit it by saying its a racist book, by no means was it racist besides the use of the N word alot ( but that was how the southeners talked at that time ). the story many centers on how huck is struggling to help free a slave named Jim who is running away for freedom, and throughout it huck realizes its the right thing to do, even if it means going to hell for it ( so hence the quote above ). and its not only about slavery and racism, it also deals with child abuse, deceitful robbers pretending to be preachers fortune tellers and people like that, the horrors and stupidity of feuds, and also tries to tie in some light hearted good old fashion Tom and Huck type humor to keep hope alive for the characters in the book. Overall this book is basically about the horrors of human hatred and how its wrong, its supposed to be a eye opener to people to change their ways and see the truth of the matters such as racism for what they are. not at all racist, deserves way more than 5 stars, and one of the best classic books ever. A MUST HAVE"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"We all know \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is a 5-star novel. My complaint is about this particular edition of the book. The type is horizontally compressed to the extreme and the layout on the some of the pages was canted. Mark Twain and his readers deserve better treatment!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"My daughter's fourth-grade reading teacher urged that parents continue the practice of reading to their children, and specifically recommended ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN. It had been some 35-40 years since I had read the work myself, and so I relished the opportunity to read it again with my daughter.For those who have just arrived from another planet, HUCK FINN is 19th-century humor writer Mark Twain's episodic adventure tale about a good-hearted young rustic named Huckleberry Finn, who boldly and ingeniously escapes the abusive treatment of his father and sets off on a raft down the Mississippi River. Almost immediately, he is joined by a runaway slave of his previous acquaintance named Jim. The greater part of this lengthy novel consists of the various adventures they experience on the River, including an encounter with thieves aboard a sinking steamship, an escape from a bloody family feud, and, most prominently, various scrapes in the company of a couple of ne'er-do-wells who wish to be treated by Jim and Huck as the Duke of Bridgewater and the King of England. The novel is written as a sequel of sorts to THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER, but can be read independently of it.Two things stood out for me in reading HUCK FINN aloud; with respect to the language, the racial epithets and Twain's masterful attention to dialect. Let me start with the second: reading this story aloud really helps one appreciate the dialects that Mark Twain captures in the novel. Certainly, Jim's dialect is different from Huck's, but with careful attention to the language one will also notice the distinctive dialects of the other prominent characters such as the Duke and King. The first thing that stood out for me is how uncomfortable I was reading a literary work--even a classic such as this one--that liberally uses the \\"N\\" word and heaps other abuse on African Americans.This is one reason the book is banned by many libraries. In reading HUCK FINN with my daughter, however, I found that the story could be both a literary experience and a teaching tool. We could and did discuss the terrible power of words to hurt people, as well as the treatment of slaves in 19th-century America. Also, over the course of the novel, Huck Finn comes to see the humanity in Jim and sees him as a friend. Still, the novel doesn't entirely justify itself on those grounds, particularly after the humiliating treatment Jim experiences in the final chapters. Moreover, one might argue that, at least in parts of the story, Jim comes off as a racial caricature.Thus the novel does pose a challenge to the reflective and concerned parent. HUCK FINN is no doubt a masterpiece of fiction. It is, moreover, a humorous and sometimes moving adventure story (albeit one that moves at a deliberate pace compared to 21st-century YA fiction). Nonetheless, with respect to the racism that is pervasive in the novel, in reading this story to children one should be prepared to talk about its underlying social problems in the light of American history and contemporary mores.My daughter and I read this edition (Puffin Classics). It is a conveniently sized book that does not stint on font size to create a small format paperback. It would not be the edition I would choose permanently to grace one's library, but it is an excellent choice for children."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Do you need some Orwellian Big Brother to 'edit' a classic book for you? Do you want someone else to decide what you should or shouldn't read? Are you incapable of seeing a word used in a century-old context without throwing a fit over it?If yes, then this is the censored book for you.If NO, then keep browsing for an UNEDITED, UNABRIDGED version -- and leave this piece of dreck to rot.Why?First, consider the attribution that appears in this book's search result listing: \\"Mark Twain 'AND Sarah Matthews.'\\" Why is there a second name on a classic book that everyone knows had only one author? Why, because the second person is an ~Editor~ -- a self-appointed Judge of Words, a modern-day INQUISITOR who has removed parts of the original work because THEY decided that you, the Reader, don't need to see them.What parts of the original did this Inquisitor decide you don't need to see? Well to begin with, every last use of the word N-gg-r -- you know, because somebody might wet their diapers if they see that word in print in a book that's more than century old, despite the fact that black people all over this country use the same word every single day even NOW.But then, just for good measure, the Inquisitor also removed whole sentences and sections that didn't have anything at all to do with 'the N-word' -- but which might have stirred up thoughts in you that the Inquisitor doesn't want you thinking.The result is a butchered and mangled parody of the original: a pathetic, PC-sanitized piece of crap. Everyone involved in the production of this edition should be ashamed -- indeed, they should be barred from working in the Publishing industry ever again -- and anyone who rewards their censorship by buying this edition is contributing to the decline of Freedom and Free Speech in America."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It was assigned for my American Lit class this semester. The book is told in the voice of Huck Finn, the son of the town drunk. Huck starts the novel living with the widow Douglas, who wants to \\"sivilize\\" him. He won't put up with that, however, and starts on a series down the Mississippi river in which he befriends a runaway slave named Jim. I will refrain from giving any more thoughts on the book, because although I'm sure most people know the story, I don't want to ruin it for anyone."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"In Twain's most prized novel, he reveals the problems in a judgmental, racist society and shows the need for reform. He argues for an end to such acts throughout the novel with Huck's union with the runaway slave and his ultimate decision to leave such a tainted world for more free ground.Throughout Huck's travels, he struggles with the decision of whether or not he should stay loyal to his most precious and dedicated friend or turn him in just because he is a runaway slave, revealing the problems with judging people based on their skin color alone. In the beginning of the book, before Huck runs away to be alone, he would talk to Jim, Miss Watson's slave and property, on occasion, playing tricks on him with the help of his friends. But once he is able to escape society and discover the runaway Jim along his path, he decides to protect him and they band together in their journey. Although Huck repeatedly refers to him as \\"my Jim,\\" he sees him as more than property but more in the sense of him being his friend. It is only when Huck is able to abandon all the \\"ideals\\" that society had taught him that he accepts Jim as his friend, not at all associated with any means of property. He decides this one night, even willing to go to \\"hell\\" for his actions, showing how he achieves Twain's goal of ending the extensive judgment in society based on a man's outward appearances.As Huck learns more related lessons, he notices many problems that society has and decides that he does not want any part in such actions, abandoning those who do not share his views and becoming the full embodiment of Twain's wishes. Once Huck has decided that he will not dispose of Jim and return him to the hands of his owner he decides that he must break Jim out of \\"jail.\\" He finds himself once more reunited with Tom and shares his goals, amazed at the fact they Tom is willing to free a runaway slave. He thinks that Tom has changed to share his views, but is once again let down by those who were once close to him. It turns out that Tom only agrees to do this after he learns that Jim is already free. He would not have agreed to help Huck otherwise because he still believes in the fact that slaves are property. When Huck discovers this and Jim is set free as he should always have been, he no longer wishes to live in a place where people are considered property and others do not keep their promises or base their acts on faulty premises. He then decides to leave for the Indian territories--a place where he can act as he knows is right and how things in the world should be."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I first read this book (unabridged) when I was in grade school, and it is still one of my favorites. I was fortunate to discover it on my parents' bookshelf long before it ever occurred to my teachers to assign it to me.In this masterpiece of the road trip, we meet a bumptious, self-confident, self-absorbed young America in person as Huck and Jim hitchhike along its first great highway: the Mississippi River of sternwheelers, flatboats, keelboats, canoes and crude rafts. We see the vast river and its people (with all their warts, quirks and odd ideas) through the eyes of a young white runaway orphan (Huck) and his much-wiser-than-he-lets-on black companion (Jim). This is the same Mississippi River highway that Abraham Lincoln saw as a young man, when he worked on the crew of a flatboat that delivered goods from the Ohio River Valley to the seaport in New Orleans.If you can forget that it's an assignment to read, notice that each of Twain's colorful characters has his or her own authentic way of damaging the English language (dialect), and let yourself go with the flow, I think you will find this to be a wonderful story with many delightful surprises.The journalist Mark Twain's &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is to America before the Civil War as the impoverished cavalier Miguel Cervantes' &quot;Don Quijote de La Mancha&quot; is to the underside of imperial Spain at the time of the Spanish Armada. In both books we see a rough-hewn society in the midst of rapid cultural change through the eyes of a pair of puzzled innocents. To a first approximation, Huck Finn is Don Quixote, and Jim is Sancho Panza."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The temptation to teach Huck to high school students must be taken seriously. No matter the racial makeup of the class, the \\"N\\" word has to be defused before reading begins. We can explain and discuss and meltdown some of the ascerbity of the word, but unless the issue is fully resolved, the 200-plus appearances of such a slander will eventually work us back to tender. Background reading on Twain is a must. His short story, \\"Disgraceful Persecution of a Boy,\\" about a boy returning from Sunday School who stops to stone a Chinaman (in San Francisco) makes a pointed comment about the \\"teaching\\" of prejudice. This story makes good pre-reading since a reference with a similar point is made in \\"Huck Finn.\\" When a river boat has an accident, a riverside discussion goes: \\"Was anybody hurt?\\" \\"Nope. Killed a N- though.\\" This bit of dialog slipped in and overheard is painfully offensive and yet such a perfect contrast to Huck's feelings and the \\"teaching\\" he has received, both from the Widow Douglas and from life itself. Jim, of course, is the subject of Huck's racial feelings. Throughout the story, Jim is a father, brother and friend to Huck, but never a servant. He is everything, a good man tormented with love for his lost family and Huck, yet in his world, he is literally bound (by chains and threats) and so cannot come close to the dignity of African Americans of today. Huck and Jim's world requires that we board a mental time-machine and accept both the life on the raft and the values on shore as they were then, not now. Teach the book with joy after preparing with compassion."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Plain and simple, this is a book that you have to read again and again and again just for good measure. One cannot possibly appreciate modern American literature as it exists today without reading Huck Finn. Twain's style is one-of-a-kind, and his keen sense of politics and history is one that rarely exists in modern times. Get past the racial implications of this book and look at what Twain is -saying-. Huck Finn is a character who is a rogue, a modern scoundrel; however, we trust his moral judgement and are able to look inside another time and place through his journey with Jim up the Mississippi.

By modern standards, it may well be rather long-winded. Or it could just be that we have a harder time understanding the words and phrases Twain uses, which evoke images less familiar to us than they were to his original audience.What intrigues me about this is that Mark Twain himself levelled this same charge of wordiness against James Fenimore Cooper's &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot;, which were written in the early 1800s. In a famous essay, Twain picked apart Cooper's description of a woodsman making camp, line by line. Each word, each phrase, each sentence was evaluated for its value in setting the scene, and far more than half of each were discarded. At the end, Twain gave his readers his own--much shorter--rendition of the passage, then congratulated himself on having improved it greatly by shortening it.Languages and usage change over time. By John Milton's standards of the mid-1600s, Cooper's sentences and descriptions might well have seemed terse and choppy. By Mark Twain's time, the same sentences sounded long-winded. Today--80 years after Ernest Hemingway taught us to expect our vivid descriptions in telegraphic prose--even Twain can sound wordy, reading Cooper can be an enormous struggle, and few beyond English majors learn to appreciate Milton's &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; as a complete work.But we can learn a great deal about ourselves and our own times by reading popular writers from our ancestors' times. First, it teaches us tolerance, as we see that &quot;the past is a different country: they do things differently there.&quot; Second, it warns us that our own ideas, speech patterns and writing styles may also seem quaint, antiquated, ungrammatical--even boring--to our grandchildren. Learning to expect this can help us avoid taking ourselves and our times quite so seriously.Life goes on, and so does the language."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read some of the other reviews and understand that some people had an issue with the candid way in which Mark Twain dealt with the race issues.

I'd read it before, but it had been more than 20 years. An adventure story, it also deals (usually obliquely) with a lot of social, moral, and cultural issues, including (most obviously) issues of race. Twain's use of the \\"N\\" word is startling and disturbing to modern ears, but it is essential to convey the import.I remember that when I first read it, I didn't like the last few chapters very much...and I still don't. Quite unlike the first 2/3s of the book, they seem to me to be a cop-out on Twain's part. It's as though - having written a brilliant, sometimes-humorous, often-tragic commentary on life - he felt the need to dumb-it-down at the end."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book arrived in perfect condition and on time.

However it had a label on the back, stating it was used. Somewhat confusing but regardless it was a nice book with a good price. The labeling issue was just a bit troubling."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Huckleberry Finn is one of those classic books that you just can't put down. It is a very good book that is suspenseful and really draws you in. It starts off with Huck imprisoned in civilization surrounded with good manners and sophistication. Daily he goofs off with his pals Tom Sawyer and others, imagining up scenarios where there is plenty of action and fun to be had. When his father returns, Huck has to stay with him but soon escapes, faking his own death and running away to a local island to live on his own. There, he meets Jim, Miss Watson's slave who he thought was going to sell him, so he ran off. Soon after, Huck and Jim start traveling down the river as many men were out looking for Jim. They travel only on nights, surviving on fish that they catch and other vegetables that they manage to scavenge. Unfortunatly, they run into two men, duke and king as they are known, who both claim to be royalty. They end up being a nuisance, as they demand everything be done for them. Soon afterward, they arrive at a small town where a respected man has just died. Everything in his will is pledged to his two brothers, who have not arrived. Duke and King pose as the real brothers, as they are hoping to rob the family of their money. When the real brothers arrive, Huck and Jim try to evade the con men, but as they make their escape they are caught by Duke and King. They travel futher down the river, and stop at yet another town, to resupply and hopfully make some money. When Huck, Duke, and King return to the raft, they find Jim missing, apparently captured as a runaway slave. Huck goes off to try to recapture Jim, and he poses as Tom Sawyer when he stays at Tom's Aunt Polly's house. Coincidentally, Tom arrives, and joins the cause to save Jim. Tom, as he has to throw some finesse into the escape plan, makes it much longer than it intended to be, even thought it would have been quite easy to escape in the first place. after weeks, The boys and Jim make their escape, but a few days after, Jim is captured in a town a few miles below the escape point. As Jim faces death, Tom steps in and says that Jim was already free, and that Miss Watson had freed him in her will, as she had died a week or so earlier. With Jim free, Tom returns to his original town and Huck get adopted to be civilized by Tom's Aunt Polly."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"If you have really read this novel, you have heard the controversy about whether it should still be taught in schools. I read this book for my AP English class in the 11th grade, and found there to be no foundation for controversy on the subject of racism. Mark Twain was not a racist-he was only conditioned to the social standards of which were held toward African Americans at the time. Anyone who says this book had no point didn't think about the book at all. The ideas in this story range from the level of equality between whites and blacks to the individual v. society to which every conflict in this novel goes back to."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Most of the &quot;boring&quot; reviews are obviously written by people who cannot write gramatically nor well.

What are the odds of Huck stumbling on to members of Tom Sawyer's extended family? A brilliant writer like Twain could have come up with something a little more believable than that."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I have read the past several reviews printed of this novel, and have noticed that the negative reviews are because the reader simply didn't understand the book. This novel is an adventure story brilliantly disguised as a tirade against the civilization of mankind. Twain makes his political points well felt throughout the story, but what saves this novel from being a dry and boring political statement is the grandness of the adventure contained within it. Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, and Jim are three immortal characters of literature. Huck especially I will always picture as traveling on his raft, up and down the Mississippi River forever, painting a picture of America that will never be equaled, for the novel was written in a defining time in American culture, when a sense of adventure that separated us from our English ancestry ran rampant throughout our country. A wonderment prevailed, asking questions about what lay out beyond the horizon. Huck Finn defines that sense of mystery. Maybe he was the first truly American hero, and maybe he was also the last. But his words, &quot;I been there before,&quot; will be immortal."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"A young innocent boy who feels the whole world is against him. Huckleberry Finn feels he is trapped and cornered. His actions are constrained and his freedom is limited. This is what civilization has done to Huck. The only place where he can find sanctuary is the river. For Huck and Jim, the river becomes a place where the only bliss in civilization exists. Everywhere else, civilization is just a force trying to mold them into shapes that they do not want to be. What is civilization? Is it like the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons who would do anything to kill each other or is it like Miss Watson or the Phelpses who buy and sell slaves as if they were chattel? None of the characters have totally civilized characteristics. It appears as though no one wants to be civilized. Even the proper Miss Watson cannot live without her dear slaves. Whether she is good to them or not is not an issue. The fact that she does not look at them as her equal takes points off her character. How can a society consider itself civilized if they deny the humanity of large numbers of people in it? The satirical novel ridicules civilization. Mark Twain tries to look for civilization everywhere but in vain, he finds it where it is least expected. He finds civilization away from the towns and away from the busy people's lives. Civilization lies in the almost isolated surroundings of the river. There is great contrast in the river and the shore. The hands of 'civilization' drive people onto the river. People want to believe that civilization exists on the shore. But the hopeless attempts to reach civilization on the shore show that the river is a better place that is more humanized. It is only in the parts where Jim is treated as a human being where the positive aspects of civilization are shown. Civilization is not when Huckleberry Finn has to wear his nice new clothes or when he has to come for supper when a bell is rung. As Huck says in the last line of the book - &quot;Aunt Sally she's going to adopt and sivilize me and I can't stand it. I been there before&quot; ( Twain 369) Huck doesn't feel he is 'sivilized' when he follows all the proper and decent manners of Aunt Sally. Only when he helps Jim escape from his dreaded fate does he feel humane and good about himself. Instances like when he does the 'right thing' by not giving up Jim, give Huck a more civilized character than anyone else in the book. There is irony in the fact that the person who cares the least about being civilized may in fact be having one of the most civilized emotions of all the characters. He is more civilized and mature than his elders precisely because he looks at the world from a different angle. He rejects the notions on what is necessary and real and goes by feelings other than what the supposedly civilized world follows. His non-conformist nature makes him bold and civilized. &quot;..and so when I couldn't stand it any longer, I lit out. I got into my old rags, and my sugar hogshead again, and was free and satisfied&quot; ( Twain 49) Everyone lives in their own unrealistic realm. Jim wants to be a free man, the Duke and the King believe they can get away with anything, Miss Watson and Widow Douglas think everything can be made perfect and Tom lives in a world of adventure and excitement. No one lives in the real world. If they would just look around they would realize that it is not civilization they are living in. They have created imaginary worlds. Nature and the river is needed to snap them out of their beliefs and bring them to the real world where civilization exists. Even Jim started to accept the fact that it was a next to impossible mission to make himself and his family free. The rich families of the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons are in a feud. Huck Finn and Mark Twain see no sense in the killings between the families. Even for the time the book was written, when civilization was not as advanced as it is today, the feud was looked upon with amazement as to how people could kill senselessly. Both families indulge in uncivilized acts. It is certainly not expected for two families of such elite standing to follow barbarous doings. The King and the Duke hope to get away with their hoodwinking play. They believe that people would fall for it precisely because they haven't yet reached that advanced stage of social development called civilization. Both of them think themselves to be more civilized than any of the people on shore. But the reader knows just how civilized the Duke and the King are. They are nothing but mere scoundrels. And if they are more civilized than the people on shore, then those people do have a long way to go before they reach civilization. Although the people eventually see through their sneaky act, Mark Twain still does not think the people to be worthy enough to have reached the level of civilization that he pictures. The examples of uncivilized people in the book show how society thinks themselves to be civilized. This gives them a feeling of having an edge over those who are not civilized. It is this very feeling that also makes them uncivilized. This is how Mark Twain has viewed people in the book. This is his criticism of civilization. Out of a handful there lie very few that can be called civilized in the world."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Is &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; a racist novel? It certainly does not portray Jim in a very favorable light in the last few chapters especially after he had been portrayed as a warm, loving human being in the middle of the novel. But just because the book seems to fall apart after Chapter 31 doesn't make it a failure and it certainly is not a racist novel. Just consider Twain's use of Pap, of all the people he could have chosen, as the spokesman for white superiority as he denounces the black college professor from Ohio; who looks ridiculous? Pap, of course; the drunken, child abusing bum who contributes nothing to his society except bad breath after he drinks, who considers himself superior to Jim solely on the basis of his skin color. There are also many other instances in the novel that clearly show how Twain uses Huck's willingness to test things out early in the novel(remember his testing out of Miss Watson's ideas about prayer and also Tom Sawyer's story about the genie and the lamp?) to prepare us for his growth in love for Jim the black slave, whom he comes to love enough to go to hell for rather than allow him to remain in captivity. Huck gradually learns to have feelings for Jim, feelings that his society told him were wrong, and he also learns to accept the fact that Jim has the same feelings for his own family as a white person does. Huck says, &quot;It don't seem natural, but I guess it's so.&quot; Is he grudgingly admitting this here? No, no more than Twain himself is grudgingly writing about it. Is the book a racist book? Hardly. It is a book about the stupidity of racism, a major problem still in our society today, but one that hopefully one day will be wiped away just as Huck's was by the time Twain wrote Chapter 31. What happens after that chapter is a disappointment perhaps, since Jim reverts to the subservient slave he had been early in the novel, and Huck lets Tom take over, but at the end, when Huck rejects Aunt Sally's offer to adopt him and 'sivilize' him, he decides to light out for the territory; if what he has experienced in the white adult world is civilization, he wants no more of it. He is probably a lot like Biff Loman at the end of Death of a Salesman, who, having recognized the falseness of his father's dreams, rejects the crazy city of New York and heads out for his own territory. Both characters are reborn at the end of the respective works. But Tom Sawyer and Happy Loman have learned nothing from their experiences; Happy is going to stick it out in the big city and show them that Willy Loman did not die in vain; Tom Sawyer even gets shot in his game of escape but he wears the bullet around his neck as a badge of honor. Arthur Miller's &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; calls for us to reassess our values and to know who we are; but Mark Twain had Huck do the same nearly a century before."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I'M IN 8TH GRADE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS HARD TO READ BUT I ENJOYED IT VERY VERY MUCH"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Hi,I am a student in Cornwall New York.

On the one hand, Mark Twain, as a humorous writer, created a lot of fun in this book, such as the &quot;revised&quot; soliloquy of Hamlet. On the other hand, the book is a vivid reflection of the life in the 19th century.Whenever Huck went to a new place, the detailed description of this place helps me enter the world of earlier times.

What makes the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn so unusual is that it is no doubt a pleasure to read. The book makes the biggest moral issue America has ever faced its subject matter. Through impeccable character development, symbolism, and satire, Mark Twain tells of not only the coming-of-age of a young boy, but an entire nation. This seminal novel did for literature what the Declaration of Independence did for government. It chooses not to hide behind any pretexts, with its characters speaking in straight-forward language.

Twain comments on every major aspect of human society in \\"Huckleberry Finn;\\" if he missed anything, I didn't notice. Saying that Twain was \\"ahead of his time\\" here is trite - he's ahead of our time as well. Fast-forward a thousand years into the future, to the unimaginable cyborgs that will be populating the Earth then, and Twain will be ahead of them as well. It's unfortunate that he didn't anticipate future sensitivity to the N-word, as his liberal use of it throughout the book is understandably offensive to many people. It should be clear from his treatment of the \\"Jim\\" character that Twain's intention was to demolish the philosophies of racism and bigotry of his time.\\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is one of those rare books that one may reread many times, from childhood to old age, and find something different in it each time. This isn't just because we change - our society evolves as well, and each time we will read it within a different context, as in Borges' \\"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote.\\"Maybe I would give the Martian \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" but that would probably make them want to exterminate us.

I like the way Twain humanized Jim and goes in depth about his friendship with Huck. Yes, there are a lot of stereotypes in it, especially the way Jim talks and the over use of the N-word.

On these adventures Huck encounters many people that Mark Twain wants the reader to see how awful these people are, leaving Huck Finn at the end of the book not liking people. The characters are occasionally funny and thought provoking. Mark Twain uses this book to look at human nature unlike Tom Sayer which is a children's book. Mark Twain also uses alot of symbolism in the book, so half of the book is understanding and noticing the symbolism."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"An American classic, a literary work of art, these are just a couple of things that you hear about, Mark Twain's; The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This novel takes place in the late 1800's on the Mississippi river, with a young run away boy, Huckleberry Finn, and his runaway slave friend Jim. The novel takes you on their journey down the Mississippi, where the two endure many triumphs and tribulations. In the midst of Huck and Jim's struggles, a friendship between them develops. At the end Huck and Jim are caught, only to find that Jim was set free months earlier by his owner. Before this happens though Tom Sawyer comes back into the picture and Huckleberry Finn once again follows Tom into a dangerous scheme that almost gets them killed and puts Jim through hell.In my opinion I would not call this novel a work of art, for sure! It is a fantastic story and really keeps the reader's attention. Then it ends, and sucks! The whole last three chapters of this book had me so angry. Jim gets caught and Huck is going to try to get him free but in the process meets up with his very self involved, immature friend, Tom. Tom then comes up with this outrageous scheme to brake Jim out. Instead of putting his foot down and freeing Jim, Huck goes along with Tom's plan. The plan not only makes a total fool of Jim, but almost gets both the boys killed. The novel takes you through this journey and you see Huck and Jim becoming friends, maturing with each other and learning acceptance. Then comes the ending where Huck morphs back into this careless boy who is trying to JUST free a slave for fun. Twain shows you how Huck matures throughout the book, just for him regress back to a follower. It makes no sense to me. How can a person go through this wonderful journey with another and form this bond just to throw it away in an instant. It's like Twain just gave up at the end, like he took the easy way out. Maybe he had writer's cramp, I really don't know. I do know that in my opinion this book gets huge thumbs down.Anita"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain's &quot;Adventures of Huck Finn&quot; is a series of scathing social commentaries about America of the mid-nineteenth century, barely covered with a minimalist plot. The reader must be forewarned that this Twain's work is drastically different from the high adventure of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;. The reader must also be ready to grapple with the Huck's bad spelling (since the entire book is narrated from his naive perspective) and the partway-comprehensible colloquial of the dialog. In my personal experience, the book ranges from mildly engaging during the cynical criticisms, to slow as tar during the &quot;action sequences&quot; (although the action sequences are in themselves criticisms, but the humor factor isn't sufficient to overshadow the action).The plot is paper-thin, and on its own leads virtually nowhere. It mostly consists of Huck and Jim ( a runaway slave) floating down the Mississippi on a raft. This journey quickly loses its point - the pair floats past the free states and just keeps going on. Nevertheless, this premise manages to propel the reader from one parody to the next with a measure of success. The social commentaries themselves are fairly original in content and in that they fit the situations well, but the reader does eventually tire of stupid, drunken, and easily-fooled villagers and the monotonous charlatans and vigilantes that populate the book's pages. An unexciting, although insightful read."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Though it may be considered a classic novel, timeless and forever enchanting, I found myself angered as I was forced to read this book for my english class. I can understand why many rave about Twain...he captured a popular American literature style for the time period. I, however, am not a supporter of his simple vocabulary and sentence structure. Twain avoided \\"flowery\\" words, instead using words that an elementary student would use. I also understood how he wrote using a character's dialogue,but I still detested every moment of it. Reading Jim's part was like wading through quicksand, and sometimes I found myself sinking to a point I never thought I would get out of.Also, I found myself disliking the popular character Tom Sawyer. I didn't find him the least bit charming, and I really felt that he was quite the illogical, egotistical little prat. I can say that I did quite like Huck Finn, even if reading his narration was barely short of torture.I often enjoy classic novels, but I can assure you that I will never read a Twain novel again. The only reason I gave this book as much as two stars was simply because I almost enjoyed hating it, because some of it humored me so."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"There were a lot of weird mistakes/typos in the publication.

As I fisrt opened up the book I was so so curious about reading the novel because it had so many interesting things that appeared on the front cover of the book. The cover of the book seemed to be a catching title so I decided to read the book and check it out becausse mostly all my friends have read this book and asked them what the book was about they said it was a cool book so now I decided to read it.The first chapter was interesting it was about Mark he found six thousand dollars a piece in a cave and he gave the money to judge Thatcher and so the judge gave him back n his friend a dollar piece everyday for interest. Tom and his friend seemed trouble for towards this. Tom and Mark seemed to be very enthusiastic about hanging around together.I thought the first few chapters were very catching and appealing towards others. But asI kept at it reading the book I found a lot bias surrounding the book. I couldn't believe this there was so much hate and foul language in the book. My thoughts towards the book began to dread away.A book title can describe a thousand words but when siting down and reading the book I found that the book was totaly out of my league to read I was so astonished by the language that was being used and expressed at others.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn takes place on the Mississippi river and begins when Huck Finn runs away from home and ends up meeting the Widow Douglas's slave Jim. Huck finds out that Jim was running away, too, so Huck helps Jim get to the free states. One of the adventures that this book includes is when Huck Finn and Jim pick up these two men that were kicked off a steamboat. Huck and Jim didn't know these two guys were con men until they start robbing different towns money. Read the book to find out all the different adventures Huck and Jim have to over come.I was surprised how great this book was because I didn't think it would be nearly as good as The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, but it ended up being the best book I've ever read and enjoyed. I could even imagine myself on the raft with Huck and Jim traveling down the Mississippi. This book is a little difficult because it uses country accent. I would recommend this book that likes an adventure, but can handle a challenge.-Andrew"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"(sorry if i mispelled your name). At first i found this book somewhat hard to understand given the very nature of the writing style i could easily imagine a southerner sitting on a porch with a pipe telling this story to his grand kids or something word for word. Asides from this though i was quickly taken with the characters and the subtle yet distinct philosophies and suggestions that the book is filled with behind the guise of an entertaining tail of a boy's adventures down the Mississippi River. I don't understand how any critic could call this book trash or see any reason to ban it in some school libraries. Both the book and the author are very insightful into not only human nature but also into humor as demonstrated again and again by the Duke and the King. Sam Clemens also expresses his low opinion of frontiers folk who just as readily want to lynch someone as they are drinking at a pub. Overall, if you can get past the way it was written, this is a very insightful book and i reccomend it to anyone who enjoy sa good story or to someone who can read between the lines."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Adventures of Huckleberry FinnHuckleberry Finn is an entertaining but dark epic, considered a masterpiece by some and offensive by others.This novel is set in the deep South during the antebellum period. Huckleberry Finn is a boy who, after being subjected to attempts to be \\"sivilized\\" by the Widow Douglas and after being kidnapped and detained by his alcoholic, abusive father, finally sets off down the Mississippi River with Jim, a runaway slave. They strike up an unlikely friendship. When Huck was at home, he and Tom Sawyer pulled a few pranks on Jim, like taking his hat and making him believe that witches flew him around the country while he was sleeping. Now that he is spending more time with Jim, he starts to have a growing respect for him. During the entire journey, Jim treats Huck with respect, almost mothering him. Huck would later remember this, which will affect some of his decisions.While floating down river, they encounter a drifting house with a dead man inside; they came very close to being caught by a dangerous gang, and nearly being run over by a steamboat. Two men who claim to have royal blood in them join Huck and Jim downstream. These men will unwittingly test the loyalty of Huck's friendship with Jim.My opinion of this book is on the fence. I certainly am not fond of it. The dialog can be confusing at times, especially when Jim starts talking. Everyone, including black slaves and white Southerners, use the word nigger frequently. One issue with this is that Huck calls every black person he sees a nigger; is he being a racial bigot or is he just repeating what he has heard all his life? Is he wrong for saying that or can he be excused for it because that's the common word back then for a black slave.Though this book is not one that I would pick up again and again to read, I do not have a passionate hatred for it either. I find certain parts humorous. For example: to find out information from the townspeople, Huck disguises himself in a dress and a sunbonnet. Or when the old man's claim to royalty was that he was the son of Louis the XVI and Marie Antoinette. This book also brings to light how cruel human beings can be to one another. For example: When his friend Buck Grangerford and the male side of his family are killed in a feud with the Shepherdson family: They shoot Buck without a care. Huck would remember that all his life.This is definitely not a children's book. TheAdventures of Huckleberry Finn moves away from the child-like innocence Mark Twain used for Tom Sawyer. Mark Twain instead replaces it with a darker plot, with deeper characters, all the while taking a stab at slavery and the underlying flaws in human nature."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an amazing piece American literature. This book helps you to get in the frame of mind of an American living in the Pre-Civil War era. This book depicts a journey of a young boy traveling down the mighty Mississippi helping Jim, a slave, enter freedom. They met interesting characters such as the duke and the king. These characters distract Huck and Jim from their mission but do help them to realize life lessons. You can really feel for Huck and you see the progression he makes through out the book. He starts off as a very racist boy but turns into a sympathetic young man.Although this book uses words that, by some, are considered vulgar and inappropriate, this is not true at all. They truly help you to understand Huck's and many other's mindset. Mark Twain uses these words but they don't represent Mark Twain's personal opinions. Another thing I like about this book are the messages it tries to teach. Mark Twain is trying to show American's that sometimes the laws of the state and country can greatly differ from the \\"right\\" thing to do. He shows this over a period of time as Jim and Huck's relationship begins to advance. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, even though highly debated, can teach us many things about life and morals."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn is an all around good book. It keeps you wondering what might happen next. There is a lot of excitement and the book rarely gets boring. The book and the story lines are also fairly easy to follow so that one understands what is going on.One of the things I really enjoyed in this book was the way Huck acted. He looked at everything very simply. Huck was also pretty funny; like when he would talk about stuff that widow Douglus would tell him to do. Huck's practical and often socially naive views and perceptions also provide much of the satirical humor in this novel. Huck didn't like to be held down by rules. He wanted to be free to do whatever he wanted when he wanted. The only reason he stayed in school and kept going to church like widow Douglus wanted him to was to spite his Pap. In this book all the friends, Huck, Tom, and Jim all had a very good friendship with one another and they were very loyal to each other during everything they went through.The only thing that some people might not like about this novel is that it is pretty long. The book has 42 chapters, so you should know this book will take you a while to read. I also didn't enjoy the part of the book when Huck is working with the scam artists that are trying to act like there Peter Wilks brothers so they can get the inheritance money from his death. I just thought that part of the story was a little to long and wasn't too realistic.Overall I think that this was a good book. I would suggest reading it if you had enough free time to read a fairly long novel.

Through the eyes of main character, Huck, the reader is able to see how Twain is satirizing this society. Characters such as Pa demonstrate the ignorant \\"white trash\\" in the society, and the widows Douglas and Stevens are examples of the Christian women in the society. Through Huck's thoughts, the reader is able to find the irony that Huck the \\"uncivilized\\" character in the book, may have the most civilized attitude and ideas of all the characters in the story. Twain uses Huck's friendship with Jim, the runaway slave, to deal with the issue of slavery and suggest that slavery is wrong. Twain's strong take on issues in the story are evident and create a powerful novel told in an innocent manner through the eyes of a boy.Hope diz haz helped u"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"When I had to read this book, my first thoughts were, Southern life in the 1800s? Why would I care? Some people are just living in the past.How wrong I was.This book is so great and can be enjoyed by all people, with the exception of close(d)-minded inviduals. The story is about Huckleberry Finn, son of a drunk, regarded as uncivilized and morally lacking. The book is written in the 1st person point of view from Huck's eyes. \\\\To put it briefly, the whole book is about Huck trying to help Jim, a runaway slave, get free. Throughout, there are many episodes on the Mississippi River, where many adventures take place. We get to see Huck grow and mature as a person, having to make decisions and occasionally lie or dress up, yielding humorous moments often. The characterization of Jim is done very well by Twain, and we realize in the end that Jim is the most humane, caring person in the story.The ending was extremely disappointing, from the standpoint of the rest of the book. I will only say this: Tom Sawyer is a jackass. But don't take my word for it, read it yourself and judge for yourself; many regard the ending as great and an appropriate way for things to end. What's done is done, though, and the book still remains a great tale of friendship and adventure.What the book is not, is racist. The N-word is used, but that is for the effect of realism and credibility. If anything, the book is anti-racist, as can be seen in the relationship between Huck and Jim. The book, being written by Mark Twain and all, contains a lot of satire and humor, which is extremely enjoyable.May this book live on, it definitely still matters and teaches us many a great deal."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I was introduced to this book back in high-school (in Australia), where my English Literature teach (who was an American) used this as one of our set texts. Despite this, I really enjoyed it, and now, near 20 years later, I picked it up in some second hand book shop for $1.50 and got engrossed in it all over again.Mark Twain (not his real name) sailed the Mississippi river as a riverboat pilot early in his career, and the truth of his depiction of people and way of life in this novel shines through, despite the fanciful nature of the adventure. I couldn't help but get caught up in the crazy tale of Huck Finn, hopeless trouble-magnet that he is, as he struggles to get free of his troubles with the less-than-helpful assistance of a large cast of characters.The language is a joy to read. The characters are fun to follow. And although the plot isn't the most complex, the characters themselves do a fabulous job of making the simple into convoluted mayhem. Several times I had to laugh out loud at the absurdity.Even though I picked this book up cheap, it's well worth hanging onto.

Very carefully! Twain, who briefly served the Confederacy was a river boat pilot, miner, reporter, lecturer, acerbic wit, devoted family man, was the premier writer of 19th century America.In \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" Twain thoughtfully and compassionately weaved a tapestry of mid-stream American life and culture which probably did more to positively change white America's view of its black minority than any legislation ever could. He achieved all that while creating a timeless world of youthful adventure to where countless generations can escape.This wonderful volume is a replica edition that contains almost 200 original illustrations by E. W. Kemble, which conveys the raw excitement of life on the Mississippi. It should be given as a present along with \\"The Complete Tom Saywer,\\" so the reader can have access to the the entire mythos that Twain recorded."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"First off, I love this book and I was very mad to hear stuff like \\"All people who like it are stupid\\" I read one review where the person said \\"It shows how stupid Anericans can be\\" You misspelled Americans buddy! People did talk like that. I know because they still talk like that. I loved the language, and snobs who just turn their noses up and say \\"that's not proper English!\\" are obnoxious and pitiful! How is it hard to read? The bad reviewers called lovers of this book stupid when they couldn't even understand the book. Twain uses the N word so much because that's how people talked back then! Americans who insult this book are uncultured, know nothing about history and are complete snobs. I find Jim to be a kind, patient, fatherly figure, Huck to be an interesting main character and Tom to be lovable and funny. People say it's childish and that Jim is childish, but that's because the book is written through the eyes of Huck, a 13 year-old boy. You would have to be racist to call this book racist. MARK TWAIN WAS VERY ANTI SLAVERY! I'm really mad that people can be so ignorant as to want to ban this book. People say that Huck's adventure were boring, but they were not. He is a 13 year-old helping to free a slave and then there's all the stuff in between. How many 13 year-olds do you know who have ever travelled down the mississippi river constantly being hunted for, without any parents? I love this book, the characterization is flawless and all Americans should read this and enjoy it. Mark Twain was a brilliant writer and all you people who hate on this book and are mean to people who like it, I feel kind of sorry for you that you are such stupid snobs who can't even understand a dialect which is still used today.

His father is a drunk who lives slightly out of town and usually leaves Huck to his business. But Huck has recently come across $6,000 and his father just heard about it. Huck lives with an elderly widow and her sister Miss Watson and Miss Watson's slave Jim. The widow and Miss Watson are trying to \\"sivilize\\" Huck by getting him to wear nice clothes and go to church and school. Huck misses his own life out in the woods. But one day his father shows up in his room and tries to get him to give him the money he has heard about. Huck doesn't have it and so his father takes him to his shack out in the woods. Huck enjoys the fact that he is no longer being \\"sivilized\\", but he is often beaten and whipped by his father. One day Huck manages to escape and builds a raft, with which he floats down the Mississippi River. While living on an island, Huck finds the remains of another man's camp and starts to run away but then he realizes it is none other than Miss Watson's Jim, who is trying to run away so he can't be sold in New Orleans. Huck and Jim join forces and float down the river with numerous adventures and encounters and misfortunes through until the end of the book, which really has an interesting end, very controversial to some but enjoyable to others.It is important to read Huck Finn as a unique piece of literature. Some people are frustrated by its use of language, its slow beginning, sometimes an apparent lack of action, and Mark Twain's use of the confusing southern slave dialect. Try to get through the first 5 chapters and it starts to get more interesting. There are some spots later in the book where the story hits a speed bump, but if you read it from a historical perspective and have researched the area where this book takes place, it is far more easy to visualize the book and it can make it a great book to read. One of the best strategies is to read it slowly and to try to imagine yourself as a teenager alongside Huck, maybe just out of view. Another good idea is to read Tom Sawyer before Huck Finn."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The CD helped my students with the dialect.

Numerous times I laughed out loud. \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" has been called the greatest American novel ever written and I don't doubt that it is."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is one of those novels that could easily go either way in the minds of a reader. Some people find it either boring or offensive, particularly because of its excessive use of the \\"n word.\\" Others balk at the unbelievability of the plot premises (such as carrying an escaped slave south rather than north). Still others find the excessively colloquial linguistic style distracting and difficult to read. Any or all of the above could cause a person to dislike this story.I myself certainly noticed the shortcomings above (although I personally enjoyed the colloquial language and realized that the use of the \\"n word\\" was historically accurate and would have been used much as we today say \\"black\\" or \\"African-American\\"). However, I was able to largely overlook the problems of the novel and appreciate it on a more simple level: an adventure-filled journey down the river.In addition, I appreciated the central device of Huck's character: he acts consistently against his conscience, which is representative of the deplorable attitudes that were prevalent at the time. Through his actions, we see that he is not truly racist, but that society has imposed racism upon him. We see that he is impressionable, and will allow bad things to happen for a while, but ultimately he will step in and try to stop them. In this way, he is representative of the \\"innocent\\" child, whose worse qualities are always a result of others around him rather than anything innate.Overall, this book is worth reading as a parable on freedom and conscience, and deserves a place among the great American classics."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Twain's colorful and darkly funny critique of the antebellum American South is no less stinging (and no less controversial) 125 years after it was first published. Its satire of race relations, vigilantism, hypocrisy, and romanticism may remain just as relevant, but it's Huck and Jim's travels down the Mississippi River - the quintessential journey to reinvent oneself - that makes Huck Finn the decisive Great American Novel."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book has the reputation in some quarters as the greatest American novel, and now that I have finally read it, I can see why. Mark Twain's great achievement is to write a story that is so thrilling, engaging and, at times, laugh out loud funny, yet can also be appreciated on a very deep level.Huck Finn resists being \\"civilized,\\" but he proves to have a practical intelligence and an innate moral sense that is superior to that of the civilized and educated society that he stands outside of. This is most powerfully represented by Huck's friendship with the runaway slave Jim. Even though he believes, along with the rest of white society at that time, that he is doing the wrong thing by helping Jim escape, he cannot turn his back on a friend and decides that he would rather be \\"bad\\" than betray his trust. They are joined for a time by a pair of con men who are terribly cultured (or at least do a good job of faking it), and Huck is deeply impressed by them until he begins to realize the full extent of the harm they cause. This is also the funniest part of the book. The last section, in which Tom Sawyer reappears, slows things down a bit, but here, too, we see Huck's superiority. Tom is an eternal boy, always looking for games and adventure. For reasons I won't reveal here, we learn at the end of the book that Tom has inadvertently been quite cruel to Jim because of this never-ending search for excitement, and that Huck would have done better to obey his own inclinations rather than follow the lead of the friend he idolized.As in \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" Twain presents a fascinating and detailed picture of life on the Mississippi before the Civil War. He makes it easy for us to immerse ourselves in Huck's world. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain's Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn is an adventurous story of a young boy (Huck) who orphans himself from the average young man's life. This young man slips from the clutches of his drunken father and sets out for adventures of his own. In doing so, he meets with a fugitive slave named Jim. Traveling mostly at night, Huck and Jim float down the Mississippi River on a raft, while building a friendship. They travel at night trying to avoid trouble and being caught. As their luck would have it, trouble in the way of additional passengers, found them.The stories central focus is on the mischievous life of this boy after his run-away. The number of his adventures, lies and deceptions are too vast to tell, but would have to be found out by oneself. This young man did not set out to harm anyone, but rather just didn't seem able to tell the truth. One might be able to see Huck as a Dennis-the-mennis, of steam-boat days. The adventures of this young man will keep you wanting to find out what he does next!This book was well written in the sense that you could visualize the settings and almost hear the dialogs. The speech used however may slow your reading down a little in attempt to understand Jim's lingo.Although (because of Jim's dialog) I found some portions of this book hard to read and comprehend, I found the adventures to be riveting.

When I was a junior in high school, I had to get signed permission to read this novel. I never thought a book could be so controversial that something like that would be necessary. I am so glad that I read it then, and again during my freshman year of college, because I think it sends a powerful message. Written in the dialect of the deep south, Twain successfully gets the reader involved in the book. When I read this novel for the first time, I did not want to put it down. The character of Huck intrigued me. Though a young boy, he had more common sense than many people years older than him. He knew what he wanted and was smart enough to know how to go about getting it. When he befriends a runaway slave named Jim, social issues are brought up and Huck is forced to follow what his heart says, instead of what society says is morally acceptable. I enjoyed how Twain portrayed Huck and Jim's journey down the river and the adventures they shared. It was a symbol of their need for freedom. By sharing the same goals, Huck and Jim become true friends. They are beyond the color barrier and realize that a person is a person, regardless of what they look like or who they are. I think much of today's society could benefit from reading this book. It helps you put things in perspective and think about what is really important in life; what others think versus how you feel. If anyone is looking for a good novel to read, one that captures interest and provokes thought, Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is it."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I thought that this was an exciting book, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure. Southern dialect is used throughout the entire novel, and it was difficult to understand at first, but once I had read a little ways into it, the language added tremendous reality to the story. This book is about a young boy who runs away from his dad, the town drunk, and is later joined by a slave, Jim, who is running aways at an attempt for freedom. It questions a lot of the values that Americans had when it was written (before the Civil War), and it's message is timeless. It was an awesome book, and you should definitely check it out!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Huckleberry Finn, a boy in the Deep South, is living with the Widow Douglas and is finally becoming civilized, when all of the sudden, Huck's father comes back to town. He decides to take Huck back into the wilderness to live with him. He keeps Huck under lock and key, so Huck decides to escape. Huck plans his own \\"murder\\" and takes a raft down to Jackson's Island, where he meets Jim, Miss Watson's slave who ran away. Jim and Huck head up north, where they will both be free. Once there, they begin to get homesick and head back down south. On the way down, they meet two bums who think of themselves as a duke and as a king. The foursome continue down while the bums trick all the towns along the way out of their money. Eventually, being broke, the bums sold Jim without Huck's knowledge. Huck finds out, and goes to find Jim at the Phelps' farm. Sally Phelps mistakes Huck to be her nephew, Tom Sawyer. Tom later arrives and Huck convinces him to help him steal Jim back and to play the part of Sid. The two of them work out a plan to get Jim out and cause one very large headache for Aunt Sally. In the middle of freeing Jim, Aunt Polly comes and Tom gets shot in the leg. At the end, Jim is set free under the orders of his owner in her will, Tom recovers and Aunt Sally threatens to take in Huck and civilize him.I thought this book was very funny, though a little hard to get into during the first 49 pages, and some parts must be read aloud in order to understand the dialect. I recommend that this be read by everyone ages ten and up."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"As I read Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, I was in love with Mark Twain once again, because this is such a literary wonder. The protagonist, Huck, has to face many issues in his life. He has many adventures and many moral problems to face. He has to go through \\"Rights of passages\\" throughout this story, which give children great morals to follow. He is a great role model in my opinion (but not his shenanigans...). Find out about Jim, the black slave, who is caught between the social choice of Huck or Huck's individual decision on setting him free or turning him in. You just have to read this book. Many others have. Will you?"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"Come here, Huck,\\" Aunt Polly called from the front porch where she was washing the clothes, \\" Don't you dare talk to that nigger again, you hear me, Huck, never!\\"\\"Alright, I am coming I was just making a bargain,\\" Huck yelled back as he slipped the money in his pocket.My essay is on the book Huckleberry Finn. I read this book and loved it. I think this book shows a friendship between a black slave and a white boy during a time when that was considered an unusual thing.This book takes place during a time when blacks were not treated equal. Blacks were thought of as property not as humans. An example of this takes place in the down town slave market.\\" Cheap niggers, get your cheap niggers,\\" a slave driver called out from on top of the stage. Families are being separated and children are crying while they are standing in shackles and cuffs. This is hatred.In this book, there is a lot of action. Every time you turn the page somebody is getting into trouble. It even goes as far as to put on a play to rip people off.\\" Come see the Play of Nonsense, the best in the world,\\" the duke yelled to the listeners. The duke and so called king are going to put on a play. Their idea is to rip people off and run with their money. It is a smart idea but later on they pay for it. The next night the play starts. Hundreds of people walk in and hand their money to the duke. Right when the play starts, the duke comes out and announces that there have been some misunderstandings and rushes off withthe money he collected from the audience. This book's plot is awesome.In this story the main characters are laid back and have a great sense of humor. An example this happens when Huck and Jim, a runaway slave, are rafting down the huge river. Jim is in great danger, but they always have time to play tricks on other people.Also, there is a lot of dirty tricks and cheating. All four characters have a good sense of humor and a mind that is made to get into trouble. An example of this takes place when Huck fakes his own death and fools everybody while he lives on a raft for two years. He left his Aunt Polly behind to mourn about him and fooled everybody else. For a while he stayed on a little island but then decided to raft down a river. He made his own camps and caught his own food. All this to him was a fun vacation. He loved it!In conclusion, this book is awesome! My four beliefs are: there is a hatred toward blacks in this story; the plot is filled with all kinds of action; the characters are happy, laid back, and have a great humor; and there is a lot of bad trick playing and a whole bunch of cheating in this story. I think Twain was trying to show us an ideal example of friendship."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is about a boy who was taken in by a nice widow to be protected by his drunken father.

While he's running away he meets up with a runaway slave named Jim. Huck and Jim then start to have weird adventures.This is one of the funniest books ever.

Good luck kids...hey, isn't &quot;Friends&quot; on?"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The first time I read this book I was much younger. The novel was exciting and adventurous to me. It was about a young boy that escaped from his overbearing life and went on an exciting adventure down a river. It was humourous and entertaining at the time. I recently reread the novel for an American Literature class and the second time around realized there was so much more to the novel. Huck Finn is an American classic written by Mark Twain. The novel is essentially the conflict of man v. society. What seems to be a light hearted adventure story of a boy on the run, it is actually a satirization by the author of society during the time. These satirizations which are entangled within the plot and it's charaters, are a direct attack of Twain's opinion of society and societies &quot;morals&quot;. Throught the novel, Twain humorizes man's foolishness in the beleif of religion and superstition, and questions societies value of the individual and satarizes mans morality of money and time. Twain is satarizing the characters persistent beleif in superstition and a reason for exsistence and explanation of the unknown. The author is exploiting the need for a reason in life and that there is no satisfaction in just being there for no underlying and meaningful purpose. Mark Twain has also made it obvious that he is satarizing society for it's value of an individual. At a point in the novel there is a direct example of this point where the reward for a runaway slave is significantly more than the return of a man that has murdered a young boy. This obviously exploits the societies value of justice in murder, and a runaway slave. The last point is that the author satarizes man or societies value of money over a good deed. In a scene of the novel two characters would have rather given Huck and Jim money to go to a doctor rather than taking the time to assist them in their troubles. All in all, Huckleberry Finn is an extraordinary piece of American Literature and it's playful plot line and underlying truth in society has made it a classic in years past and years to come. If you take the time to read between the lines and through the adventurous plot line, you will discover thoughts and messages of an incredble piece of American Literature!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Huck Finn is a classic novel that almost every high school student has read at some point in their lives. I read it when I was young and it was an exciting novel about a boy that escaped his life and went on an adventure down a river and did what ever he pleased. I recently reread the novel for a high school American Literature class and discovered that it was much more than a childrens &quot;story&quot;. Mark Twain is a classic author who wrote a novel that is adventurous and exciting to the youngest of readers and is deep and intuitive to the most advanced readers. The author is actually satirizing the society of his time through a novel that eventually became a classic. Through his characters and their adventures, the novel exploits the faults of society and it's morals and twisted elements. Twain is satirizing societies value of a person, overbearing superstition, and it's importance of money over time. In the novel a strong aspect of the value of a person is shown when the reward for a runaway slave is significantly more than the reward for a murderer of a young boy. The characters superstition in the novel rules their lives. It seems as though they must have an answer to every question and reason for every occurence, good and bad in their lives. This includes the overwhelming need for religous beleifs and reason they ar here. Another good aspect is the fault over man to put his greed for money in front of everything else. This includes when a man feels, that instead of just offering time and help, they can contribute their money and feel good doing. Twains satirzations in the novel are also present in today's society. Which may be why the novel seems to still be analyzed and praised today. Although the novel may come across as a childrens adventure story the reality in the novel is greater than the perception. If you read between the lines, you will see a mans greater perception of the society around him and a reality of the society of today,"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I think this book is full of surprises and is very fin to read. Before I read it, I heard it was &quot;boring&quot; but after I read it, it became one of my favorite books. I Recommend reading this book. My favorite part of the story is when Huckle is forced to decide society or his heart. This story is one of the most popular stores by Mark Twain. I think Huckleberry Finn ( the main character) is very funny and brave in this story! He is definitely a realist and takes everything like it is. Tom Sawyer, Huckle's ally follows him all through the journey and keeps him company. I think story does not say much about the people around him since the majority of the story is spent with only Jim and it is told in first person.

The manner in which the novel was written caught my attention just from the start. Twain combined his distinctive dry humor with some of his exaggerations creating the Mark Twain style. The Adventures of Huck Finn was a sequal of The adventures of Tom Sawyer. Upon reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer I decided to read The Adventures of Huck Finn. The novel starts off telling us about the end of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. In conclusion Tom and Huck find a treasure so Huck is put a home living with Widow Douglas. Here Huck is'nt so happy. She is trying to teach him all of the proper ways. Soon after his drunken father finds out he has a treasure and beats him almost to death so Huck will give it to him. Huck runs away to an island where he meets a runaway slave, Jim. He and Jim become friends and decide to run away to the free states up north. They find a raft so they can travel by river. Hoping not to be seen, Huck and Jim travel by night. A little while later they encounter a ferryboat which recognizes that they are runaways. After selling Jim to be a slave again, Tom and Huck decide they must free him. In the conclusion of the book, Jim is freed because his prevoius owner had freed him just before she died. The Adventures of Huck Finn was an excellent novel. This work along with The Adventures of Tom Sawyer forever placed Mark Twain amongst the ranks of the greatest writers on earth let alone the United States. The Adventures of Huck Finn, often mistaken as a children's book, has since its creation instigated widespread timult. It and Tom Sawyer were banned in various places around the world for their &quot;questionable&quot; racist content.

Read the book again."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I can't even say for sure how many times (four? five?) I've read \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" but each time I notice something new and admire something different. Having read several biographical accounts of Mark Twain's life in recent years, however, I learned some background that explains an aspect of the book that always puzzled me: how a book that is a sequel to an adventure story for boys seems to be of a different genre entirely.Many readers come to \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" via its predecessor, \\"Tom Sawyer.\\" Sure enough, the second book opens not long after the first book, and the first chapters of \\"Huck\\" resemble the tone and style of \\"Tom.\\" Twain's initial plan was indeed to write another boyhood adventure story; he began the sequel soon after \\"Tom Sawyer\\" was published, and so we read about how Huck's low-life father desires the treasure Tom and Huck found in the previous story, about Huck's escape from his father's cruelty, and about his comical disguises as a girl and as a survivor of a wreck on the river. And then Twain set the work aside when he reached Chapters 15 and 16, in which Huck and Jim take off on their now-famous raft journey.It was three years before Twain worked on the book again, and by that time he'd decided that \\"Huck Finn\\" would not be a simple, episodic adventure tale for children. It took Twain another five years to finish it. During that period he wrote a travel book, \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" (in which he included an eventually deleted passage from \\"Huck Finn\\"), and you can see its influence on the river adventures of Huck. More significantly, the centrality of Jim to the story transformed the novel into a work on race, slavery, freedom, and life on the frontier--hardly the stuff of children's literature.This amalgamation explains why the early chapters seem to be written for kids (much like \\"Tom Sawyer\\") and why the book still resonates with so many youngsters. It develops into a different book altogether the moment Huck and Jim step on that raft, become fugitives, and eventually head \\"down the river\\"-- away from the promise of freedom upstream and toward the territory where the institution of slavery is even more inhumane. (A constant fear among slaves in Twain's later novel \\"Puddn'head Wilson\\" is to be sold \\"down the river.\\") Huckleberry Finn--both the character and the book--loses the aura of childhood innocence; as a result, Huck's journey is much less like \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and more like Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\""},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is considered by many to be the American novel; the work that most closely represents the America experience. What then makes this such a great book to read, and such an embodiment of America? Many things.First, this book addresses the issue of color racism thoroughly and subtly from multiple viewpoints. The latter includes the naive reluctant racist (Huck), the naive apathetic racist (Tom), those discriminated against (Jim), and of course the active, enthusiastic racists (most everyone else we meet in the book). Racism is examined from both the mental viewpoints; how individuals consider others of the same and different race, and from the social viewpoint; how individuals of different races interact in public and private. This emphasis on race points to the heart of American history; few other countries have struggled with skin color bias as long and as deeply as the US.The second major point examined in this book is slavery; an issue strongly related to the first. Slavery as existed in other countries was rarely as delineated along color lines as it was in the USA. And rarely was it defined as a feature of different skin colors. For example, slavery throughout Europe was used as a form of criminal punishment. Likewise, slavery in the Middle East was a side effect of military conquest of one group of people by another. Not so in America. Here it was an inherent feature of how two races dealt with each other.The third theme of this book that strongly embodies the American experience is the fractured / divided family. Walk through any neighborhood in China, India, Japan, Mexico, Egypt, Ireland or most any other country, and most of the children you encounter live with their parents, and most of the parents you meet live with their children. Unique among nations is America where many children do not live with both their biological parents. True now, this was true in the mid-1800s when this book's story takes place. Jim is searching for his family and Huck has left his. At the end of the book, they meet Tom, another boy who is not being raised by his parents. In fact, the two most stable families nuclear families encountered in this book are the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons.This leads of course to a fourth feature of this book that is reflective of America; the family feud. For a country where everyone has so much, both back then and now in the early 21st century; Americans seem to have problems with neighbors. Nowadays, everyone wants a house with big yards to maximize separation between them and their neighbors, and neighbors rat on each other to their homeowners assocation. Back then, they had feuds.The fifth topic dealt with in this book is the con. Unique to America is the role of the con artist in our history and culture. Consider Jim and Tammy Fay Baker, Robert Millikan and Charles Keating of modern times, and Ponzi of the early 1900s. In this book the reader encounters numerous cons and con artists. Huck himself cons Jim at the end of the book whereby he concocts a series of escape plans that puts Jim thru a series of ordeals, all for the naive amusement of Huck.Having read several versions of Twain's classic by different publishers; this reviewer has only praise for this version. The book itself is a great classic and worthy of anyones time and effort in reading it."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Huck is a poor boy with an alcoholic father who lives in the town of St. Petersburg, Missouri. Huck and his friend Tom Sawyer find gold in a cave and get six thousand dollars apiece, which judge Thatcher puts into a trust. Huck was then adopted by the widow Douglass and she tries to refine him. Huck's father comes to town and demands custody and the money. He can't get it so he kidnaps Huck and takes him to a log cabin. Huck escapes by faking his own death with pig blood and escaping to the river. There he meets a runaway slave named Jim. Soon they find out from a woman that her husband is seeing smoke from the island. Later Huck and Jim meet a pair of con artists that end up selling Jim to a local farmer. But Tom and Huck manage to free Jim, and Huck heads to the west. I would recommend this book anyone.The characters in this book where very interesting. Huck, the protagonist, is thirteen and hates it when people try to refine him. He likes to be on his own. Tom Sawyer, also a protagonist, is Huck's imaginative friend. Pap, the antagonist, is Huck's mean greedy alcoholic father, who later in the story kidnaps Huck and keeps him trapped in his log cabin.Huck is a rowdy boy stereotype in this story and even makes a point of that in the beginning of the book. As you start off reading, the narrator, Huck, says that he dislikes his new life of cleanliness, manners, and church. Also if Tom wasn't there to encourage him to start a new life he would have run away in the very beginning.I enjoyed reading this book because I read the Adventure of Tom Sawyer but I never knew that the Adventure of Huckleberry Finn was the sequel to that. This tied into the Adventure of Tom Sawyer because the money they made in the first book actually caused the problem in the second one. After reading both of these books I am still a fan of Mark Twain books.This is a very well written book that anyone should consider reading. It took me a while to read this book but in the end it was more than worth it.

The book is a fun read for everyone above the age of nine or ten (although it might appeal most to those age 13-20), and also has a very definite plot and multiple morals.The story begins where The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, another classic by Twain, left off. Huck is living with the Widow Douglas when Tom organizes a band of robbers, which doesn't last very long. However, the fun doesn't begin until Huck Finn's dad, a whiskey/alcohol addict, comes to town. After being \\"kidnapped\\" by his father and living in conditions similar to those of the underworld, the teenage Huck concocts an escape plan.After his escape, Huck, as the narrator throughout the story, tells of his adventures. Among these adventures was rejoining with Jim, a runaway slave on the widow's estate and rafting down the mighty Mississippi with hopes of freedom, and while rafting, stumbled upon, and contributed to an ancient feud between two families. Huck and Jim then met up with fugitives who claimed to be royalty and helped them earn money. They did this first by pretending to be a troupe of traveling actors and various other things, and then acting as a rich dead person's brothers to get the thousands of dollars in money granted in the man's will. After that, Huck pretended to be a nephew of the man who bought his friend Jim. It turned out he was acting as Tom Sawyer! Huck soon met up with the real Tom Sawyer and tried to free Jim. In the end, all became well again and Jim became free, which he had unknowingly already been due to his recently deceased owner's will.As long as you're not offended by the \\"n-word\\" used to describe African Americans, this adventuresome book will shortly be a favorite!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I love Mark Twain, and this is Twain at his best! This is one of the best American novels of all time, in my opinion. Twain is very funny and irreverent."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read this book after enjoying reading Tom Sawyer to my 5-year old. Firstly, this book also stands out for its readability: There is a flow and abundance of detail that pulls you in permanently. This is due, in part, to its being written in the voice of a kid, of course, but we should also credit Twain's efficiency with language. Twain can plot through the logistics of a story, maintaining continuity and credibility (barely), but without getting bogged down with too much complexity.The characters are real and timeless. The episode that convinced me that this was a great book happens early on: Huck's drunken, good-for-nothing dad goes on a tirade, blaming his woes on the guv'ment and the negroes. It's a perfect and timeless little slice of life and takes up barely a page. You could just see Twain thinking through all the little morals and wondering how he was going to include pieces of his philosophy in this story. Interesting thing about the Huck character: He is not learned or wise, being young, he has a quick sense, he is conniving, he lies constantly, and yet, judged from a higher plane, he seems to be morally perfect!The author's admonition to the reader not to find motives or morals in the book is obviously just ironic bunkum. This is Aesop's fables combined with Homer's Odyssey with a little Rousseau thrown in, brought up to date."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Although Huckleberry Finn was an AWSOME book the little details were really really hard to follow. I read the same part like three times and i still didnt get it. Once you start to understand it a little bit better then it gets way better. I also loved the whole conflict in the story. It really makes you think :} Also it is kind of funny ( at times) Overall Huckleberry Finn has a good Plot and good moral but if you dont pay attention you will be left in the dark :{"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"That's right folks, Mark Twain uncovered the mystery of the Lost King, son of the beautiful Marie Antoinette. He is was alive and living in America. Along with a Duke, Huck Finn, and Jim, they travel down the Mississippi putting on shows for the good river people.Huck faked his own death to escape his father, Jim ran away for fear of being sold, and they catch up with the other two. Jim talks to a hair ball he pulled from the fourth stomach of an ox to tell the future. Jim also has to dress up like a diseased Arab and stay on the raft for fear of being discovered as a runaway slave.Along with Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry makes escape plans for Jim after he is captured. Little does Huck know that Aunt Polly is on her way down for a visit and calls the whistle on the whole thing. Including the part that Jim has already been set free.This is a great book. It's unfortunate that it is not in school libraries because it contains the word 'nigger' numerous times. Maybe if people stopped being so politically correct, they could open their eyes and minds to this and other great literary works."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"Alright then I'll go to hell\\" Huck's great moment of loyalty to Jim, and decision to let that personal loyalty override the traditional conventional morality that straightjackets him is one of the great memorable moments of the book. Another is the \\" lighting out of the territory ahead of the rest\\" the near final word of the American adventurer on- the- road again, the proof that in Quixote's words it is the ' road not the inn' that matters, and it is the great going on like the river itself which is what we want when we are young. America as a dream of always going westward and the river as moving on and on with us moving along with it , and its never coming somehow to the sea. Huckelberry Finn the great colloquial classic in which Mark Twain succeeds through speaking the many dialects of his time in putting American literature in closer touch with the Everyday . He connected American Literature with the heartland a moved the whole enterprise down- to- earth in a more humorous and realistic way. In childhood it was the scary Duke and Dauphin that almost turned me away from the book. And I must admit that there were many pages which seemed to me to be there just to make me turn them faster. But in the end and somehow there is that picture of a time, of Huck and Tom and Jim and The Widow Douglas and the Judge and of America itself more American and more rural than the American of my small - town Troy, New York streets. The river rolling on with more life than I could imagine and the dreams of a different time and a different world strange to me then. O America my old home and lost country , land of my childhood and youth , where have you gone ? still rolling on whether I am there to see you and read you, or not ."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is bigger than the Mississippi, bigger than school boards that would ban it, bigger than contemporary critics who would snuff it. Read it and wonder at the loneliness of Huck Finn, the cultures and traditions that embrace ignorance and racism, the hopefulness of Jim in a society that values only him as a slave.

The main reason is because two of the other reviews quite frankly sucked. One guy even said that the book was confusing because of the grammar errors. haha wow, he must not understand the context and style that Mark Twain intentionally wrote in. durrr!but ya this is a fantastic book and Elijah Wood does an amazing job as the narrator. One of the reasons he does such a good job is because Wood actually played the role of Huck Finn before in the 1993 Disney movie so he had a lot of experience with portraying the character. but ya really good audio book for Twain's classic novel. that is all."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"If there's any book out there that needs no introduction (or review, to be honest), it's Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Yet here I am reviewing it, anyway. I must admit (not without a fair share of embarrassment) that I just now got around to reading this American classic for the first time. I never had to read it in school, and to some degree I felt pretty familiar with the novel even without having read it - that's just how popular and important Huckleberry Finn is to the social fabric of America.Nowadays, with all the politically correct liberals having escaped their Berkeley zoo and run amuck all over the nation, many of our young people are told not to read this novel. In fact, legions of voices cry out for poor little Huck Finn, that beloved rascal of literature, to be banned from schools and libraries - for the crime of using the n-word, a word commonly used by both blacks and whites up and down the Mississippi during Huck's time (not to mention numerous hip-hop artists of today). Turning a blind eye to the fact that Twain made the slave Jim a noble, human, easy-going fellow with his heart always in the right place (unlike Huck's other companions), the literary fascists contend that this novel is poison to the minds of youngsters. One can only imagine the reaction Mark Twain would have to the hysteria his book incites in liberals today (although he would certainly not be surprised, as he had to fight censorship of this book from the date of its publication).One of the great ironies of the \\"Ban Huck Finn\\" brouhaha is the fact that young people will surely find this novel much more entertaining than the vast majority of other literary classics they are asked to read. This is a very funny book, especially once \\"the duke and the dauphin\\" arrive on the scene and, later, when Tom Sawyer meticulously plans out Jim's rescue from captivity (no thanks to the captors, who didn't even try to make it as difficult as Tom says it should be). Young readers will also relate to and understand this book, a fact which should give rise to spirited discussion of it in class. Don't we want our kids to be excited about books and reading?The more outrageous the hissy fits thrown by liberal critics over the \\"dangers\\" of Huck Finn, the more important it is for everyone, young and old alike, to go out and read Twain's novel. Whenever someone tells you not to read something, it's important that you go out there and read it - and discover whatever it is the book banning loonies don't want you to know. Prove to them that you are intelligent enough to know the difference between the social values of the past and present, fiction and reality, right and wrong, etc. Think for yourself. Read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"There are very few works that come near this masterpiece of American literature (\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and \\"Moby Dick\\" are the closest in my opinion). Not only do you need to read this book; you need to read this book multiple times. It never gets old. It is so complex and multi-layered that you truly find something new with each reading. It is a shame that so many students feel \\"forced\\" to read this. Reading this book is a privilege and a delight. It is funny, touching, witty, satirical and one of the most important books that exisits. Although it was written and set in the past the themes are universal and timeless. Do not hesitate to read this book!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"To everyone who said this book was simply a children's story--you obviously don't understand this book. It is a brilliant satire about slavery and about the conventions of society. When I first read this book I didn't quite understand it either and just blew it off as another tedious book we had to read for school. But after reading it and discussing it in AP English, I discovered just how brilliant it was. Huck is caught in an eternal struggle between doing what society tells him is right and doing what he feels in his heart. It's a classic Pikaresque type novel, and a funny one at that. A lot of it's humor is in it's irony. And it pokes fun at religion, war (mobs), slavery, and society in general. I suggest those of you who disliked it should read it again. It is a truly great novel."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book was great. It had so much action.

It is a great piece of literature and I strongly reccomend reading it."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Beneath the surface innocence of Huck's narrative, this is Twain's darkest and most troubling critique of American society before the Civil War.

The cover catches your eye, but choose another publisher to enjoy this classic."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I wasn't too looking forward to the reading Huck Finn at first, particularly after glancing at the dialect of the first couple pages, but once I got started and more used to how the characters spoke, I loved the tale! Huck Finn is an extremely well-written novel that uses silly situations to explain how living was back then, and how slaves were treated. Jim is in the beginning of the book coming across as the stereotype of a slave, but as the novel continues, you really begin to see the real person, not just how Jim was &quot;supposed&quot; to be... Also, throughout the book, you see Huck mature and begin to get his own mind; among other things, Huck develops his own set of morals different from those of society... The Adventures of Huck Finn is a funny, exciting, and at times sweet book that everyone should have the chance to read... :):)"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is one of my very favorite American classics. Billed as the sequel toThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer, this book at first appears to be another innocent and light-hearted children's book. Around a fourth of the way through it, however, you start to realize that you're reading a mature and very serious social commentary that would have been especially relevant at the time of its publication. Exploring themes of slavery, poverty, ignorance, and religion, THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN is certainly no children's book (though it would be entertaining to a child).The entire story is told through the honest and innocent eyes of Huckleberry Finn, and Twain accomplished an incredible feat in telling such a complicated and serious story using a believable and childlike perspective. While at times a bit inconsistent, the entire book is written as though by a semi-literate tween, giving the tale authenticity and really making the story come to life. As Huck and Jim (two of the most loveable characters in any book I've ever read) make their way down the Mississippi, encountering very real dangers but keeping remarkably positive attitudes, the reader is treated to a fascinating glimpse of American Midwest circa 1850. Twain's ability to describe a scene to make it really come off the pages is in full effect here, another big reason this is commonly promoted as his best, most complete, book.The frequent use of the N-word, while obviously offensive today, reflects the apparently common parlance of the time, and wasn't such a shocker 130 years ago. It also served as a useful tool for Twain to make his primary point of the story, pointing out the unfairness, bigotry, and illogic of racism and slavery. And there is no doubt that this books' main focus is on issues of race, and that the moral of the story is decidedly anti-slavery and anti bigotry. Those that fight against this book, saying it is racist or anti-black, are sadly mistaken, being blinded by the use of the N-word and by the representation of uneducated and ignorant black characters. If the N-word has become so offensive that we can't stand its use, maybe we could justify replacing it with another word that carries the same meaning, but changing other aspects of the content of this book to more easily mesh with current-day sensibilities is just plain wrong. Re-writing the classics should be avoided.One of the most enjoyable reads you'll ever find. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Although Twain's repeated use of the \\"N\\" word and resort to racially-tinged humor is jarring to the 21st Century reader, this is one of only a handful of books that can be called \\"The Great American Novel.\\" Apart from capturing the spirit of the times -- of 1880s as well as of the Antebellum setting of the book via the ironic way in which Twain tells his tale to his own post-civil-war readers through Huck Finn -- Twain is absolutely brilliant in spinning a great moral drama. The inner voice of Huck Finn's good nature and of the good nature he sees in others is pitted against the moral code imposed by society. Huck's conscience mirrors society's voice, and he feels great guilt about doing something as \\"low\\" as helping a runaway slave escape. I can't think of a book that makes a better case against the hypocrisy and evil done in the name of society -- as contrasted to the grace enjoyed by man in the state of nature as embodied by the adolescent hero Huck who resists being \\"civilized.\\"The best passages of the book are where Twain delights in exploring the moral dilemmas and choices faced by Huck -- his ability to rationalize theft as \\"borrowing\\" (on the basis of his father's lessons); his guilt over helping Jim; his complicity with but ultimate rebellion against the scams of the \\"Duke\\" and the \\"King\\"; and his acquiescence with the shenanigans of Tom Sawyer by reason of his own sense of inferiority.As for the humor of the book, it is true that Twain lampoons the ignorance and buffoonery of whites and blacks alike. Nobody is spared his acid tongue. But the easy jokes about the ignorance and superstitions of Jim and the other blacks in the book does leave the modern reader feeling queasy. It's not fair to dismiss Twain's book as racist. It is disappointing that Twain is so comfortable with the racial humor of his time, but, overall, his portrait of Jim and the other slaves celebrates their basic humanity. Twain was much like Lincoln in this respect. Lincoln too has left some embarassing writings opposing full citizenship for blacks and suggesting that they be boated back to Africa. But in the end, Lincoln's insistence on accepting the humanity of blacks and the principle that all men are created equal is what put the country on the path to what it is today. To dismiss the likes of Twain and Lincoln as racists just because they are the products of their times is to ignore how truly difficult -- and heroic -- it was for them to rise above their own prejudices. One should approach the past with a better sense of empathy -- as well as with the humbling sense that 125 years from now (hopefully) our own ignorance and mistakes will be dissected by our descendants.The book is also significant for being written in the vernacular -- which is masterfully done.My only criticism of the book is the final sections, when it assumes a more farcical tone with the appearance of Tom Sawyer. This detracts from the book's previously gripping portrayal of the true horror of Jim's situation and of Huck's moral conflicts. I would have preferred to have seen Huck deliver Jim to the freedom of the North before learning of the deus ex machina of Jim's manumission in the Widow's will. The book would have been better with only a limited appearance by Tom Sawyer -- or by none at all.A great book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This version is beautiful, with lots of original pictures in it, you can really see that the publisher did not just want to create a cheap copy of the book, this one is really a success! Very nicely done, very elegant and with love to detail!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I was surprised, when reading Huck Finn somewhat reluctantly on behalf of a Ladies' Literary Club, to find it highly amusing and relevant adult fare.

Huck Finn's father is always getting drunk, locking Huck in their cabin whenever he goes out. One day Huck manages to escape and starts down the river in a canoe he found. Eventually, he meets up with Jim, a runaway slave, and they decide to go down the Mississippi River together. The book is filled with humor and adventure, like the time when Huck Finn tries to return some stolen money. In an effort not to get caught, Huck Finn hides the money in the first place he sees...a coffin! Unfortunatley, before he could retrieve the money the coffin is buried. Now, he has to find a way to unearth the money and return it to its rightful owner. All before the bandits discover what he's been up to.

Abso-f-in-lutely wonderful. It's role as the quintessential American novel is so well deserved you can't help but wonder if this is the best read you might ever have. I m currently going through all the classics of the world, and have such joys as Moby Dick, War and Peace, Robinson Crusoe, among many, many others awaiting me. However, I feel like I ve already found the love for the written word that I felt I may aquire after reading perhaps a dozen or so of the worlds finest.To the novella: He tells the tale with such heart, such character, such life that I will attest that I dont think I ve ever felt so strongly for a character as I do for Huck Finn. He is so vivid and alive and real; its absurd.Yes, it is quite racist on the surface, and during the 250 odd pages of the story you might read more racial slurs and statements than you have in your life, but in the heart there is nothing racist about this story. I ve heard it defended because thats just how it was in Twains time, and alas, that is how it was then, and the reason it is all so blatant, but there is really nothing racist about the portrayal of Jim. He is so loving and deep and pure. Surely one of the sweetest people you could ever want to meet.The charm of this story, the unending humor and delight of all the dialects and wordage, the manner of conversation and the subjects....my loves for this story are unending. Its a must read. I know you ve heard that;I know you know that. But damn it, off your ass and DO IT!Twains masterpiece, and for that matter, a masterpiece of all literature in the history of the world."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Longer than \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and just chock full of the \\"n\\" word. But the last pages, where Huck poses as Tom Sawyer and Tom as Sid, and they hatch plans, or rather Tom does, to free Jim from the Phelps, is flat-out hilarious. I laughed out loud so many times. Tom has read far too many swashbuckling adventures for his own (and Jim's) good. Twain has amazing command of all the southern dialects, including the slave Jim's speech. Jim may be free at the end, but sadly, his wife and children are not. A wonderful story all around. How much Twain loved the Missisippi is so evident in many beautiful and haunting passages of river life. A word of advice: you do need to read \\"Tom Sawyer\\" first. \\"Huck Finn\\" is really a sequel, and many characters in the first book are referred to in the second. As The Great American Novel, I still think that nothing surpasses \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", but \\"Huck Finn\\" comes in at a close second."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This Great American Novel combines escapist adventure, humor, and biting social commentary. Author Mark Twain (1835-1910) places us squarely on the raft with Huck and Jim as they float down the Mississippi River seeking separate escapes from an abusive father (Huck) and slavery (Jim). The two form a remarkable friendship despite differences in age, race, and upbringing. That bond helps them to survive unforeseen perils and unwanted companions. Huck also secretly wrestles with his Southern-bred conscience about the morality of helping a slave escape. The book's only weakness comes in the last chapters, when the common-sense Huck reluctantly agrees to a foolhardy scheme to free Jim.Censors have tried to ban this novel since it first appeared in 1885. Some disdain Huck's skepticism towards religious and middle class values; others dislike the raw use of a racial slur - ignoring the author's indictment of racism. Please. Translated into 65 languages, HUCKLEBERRY FINN invigorates with escapism, adventure, humor and humanity."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"As the many erudite scholars and their students tell us, Huckleberry Finn is representative of the sweeping influence Mark Twain has had on American literature, form and style. The Mississippi River boyhood adventure story is required reading for any 10-year old who can pull himself away from Game Cube and other modern distractions to wade into Twain's \\"life on the river.\\" Too, adult readers will gain from Twain's insight into human nature with its honesty and cruelty, ideals and reality, innocence and cynicism.I find the everlasting worth of the book to be Twain's underlying social commentary and his capturing of an era of changing values (Civil War slavery issue, in particular) in mid-19th century America. Purely as a work of literature, though, the book falls short of my (perhaps inflated or too modern?) expectations. The plot is sometimes choppy and contrived (e.g., when Tom Sawyer coincidentally reappears late in the book) and the events often too exaggerated (e.g., the many escapades of the notorious king and duke)--however superb Twain's storytelling and final wrap-up may be. Also, Twain's painstaking effort to have all characters speak in their vernacular dialects, while interesting for some adults and linguists, unfortunately poses a barrier for the younger reader, who ironically stands to benefit most from early exposure to the classic.Unlike in other well-known tales, no character in this adventure story qualifies as an all-American hero. Huck is understanding, compassionate and quite the realist, but too much of a follower to be truly a hero. Jim is a good-hearted, well-behaved \\"nigger\\" (controversial language from the text), largely a product of his lifelong enslavement, but nevertheless he seems too simple in outlook and possibly too concerned with money like many other adults we meet along the river (\\"en I tole you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter be rich ag'n\\"). Tom, while a fun-loving, determined and imaginative leader, is too concerned with sophomoric protocol and principles to embrace the broader perspective a hero should.Ultimately, by the author's design I suspect, the book leaves us with an unresolved restlessness. As Huck says at the end of the book: \\"But I reckon I got to light out for the territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and civilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before.\\" This quintessentially American, youthful \\"spark\\" is what still breathes life into Huckleberry Finn today after more than a century in our libraries."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This coming of age novel boldly criticizes slavery in America in the nineteenth century. Mark Twain brilliantly voices his opinions of slavery through the characters of Huckleberry Finn. Set in the south, this novel gives clear insight into the consuming racism and discrimination that raged throughout America in the 1800's. Twain masterfully fights for the abolition of slavery through his characters Huck and Jim. Huck, a white child is raised exposed to the ignorance and injustices of the south. Jim, an African American, is separated from his family and is forced to lead the life of a slave. Huck is greatly influenced by the racism of the south. Both embark on a journey as Tom runs from the violence of his home life while Jim escapes the cruelties of slavery in search of his family and freedom. Through Jim's kindness, wittiness, and patience Huck's views on slavery, African Americans and ultimately Jim change. It is the innocence of childhood that allows Huck's views on African Americans to change, allowing him to become a young man. Through their comedic adventures readers are kept turning page after page, but it is through their friendship that gives America a chance for a new beginning. Together Jim and Huck break down racial barriers proving that change is never too late. Together they discover the depth of humanity and the potential for self-growth through others. Twain effectively fights for the abolition of slavery through Huckleberry Finn.

Five star fer shur."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Okay, we all know the plot, so there's no sense in rehashing it; but this book has generated a great deal of heat and very little light lately, it's been banned in some school districts and attacked as racist garbage, so this review will address the question: Is &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, in fact, a racist book?The charge of racism stems from the liberal use of the N word in describing Jim. Some black parents and students have charged that the book is humiliating and demeaning to African-Americans and therefore is unfit to be taught in school. If there has been a racist backlash in the classroom, I think it is the fault of the readers rather than the book.&quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is set in Missouri in the 1830's and it is true to its time. The narrator is a 13 year old, semi-literate boy who refers to blacks by the N-word because he has never heard them called anything else. He's been brought up to see blacks as slaves, as property, as something less than human. He gets to know Jim on their flight to freedom (Jim escaping slavery and Huck escaping his drunken, abusive father), and is transformed. Huck realizes that Jim is just as human as he is, a loving father who misses his children, a warm, sensitive, generous, compassionate individual. Huck's epiphany arrives when he has to make a decision whether or not to rescue Jim when he is captured and held for return to slavery. In the culture he was born into, stealing a slave is the lowest of crimes and the perpetrator is condemned to eternal damnation. By his decision to risk hell to save Jim, he saves his own soul. Huck has risen above his upbringing to see Jim as a friend, a man, and a fellow human being.Another charge of racism is based on Twain's supposed stereotyping of Jim. As portrayed by Twain, Jim is hardly the ignorant, shuffling Uncle Tom that was so prevalent in &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; (a book that abundantly deserves the charge of racism). Jim may be uneducated, but he is nobody's fool; and his dignity and nobility in the face of adversity is evident throughout the book.So -- is &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; a racist book? No. It's of its time and for its time and ours as well, portraying a black man with sensitivity, dignity, and sympathy. If shallow, ignorant readers see Jim as a caricature and an object of derision, that's their problem. Hopefully they may mature enough in their lifetime to appreciate this book as one of the greatest classics of American literature.And for those who might be wondering -- this reviewer is black."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Back during my school days this was still not a book that was considered to be politically incorrect and so I was supposed to read it. As was far too often the case, I got by on little more than watching the movie version and never bothered to read this masterpiece. A few months ago I picked up a copy to put in my library for my grandson to use when he got old enough to go to school. Unfortunately this has been classified as a children's book and so I had little intention of reading it when I bought it.After discussing a book about President Grant and Mark Twain with a friend I decided that I should read this book and I soon found out just how much of an adventure I had been missing. Twain's well deserved reputation as a storyteller is on clear display in this book from cover to cover. The reader is drawn into the lives of the characters to the point of being really disturbed when something bad happens to them. Sure, they steal and they lie but you will love them in spite of everything.The story basically follows the adventures of young Huckleberry Finn and a runaway slave named Jim. Finn is trying to escape has father and the efforts of the townspeople to civilize him while Jim is trying to escape slavery. More to the point, Jim is trying to escape being sold down the river, which was always a worry for slaves in the upper south.There is a strong moral point to this book as Huck slowly learns to love Jim as a friend and not think of his skin color. Early on Huck is worried about helping a runaway slave and isn't sure what to do. Having been raised in Missouri, Huck has been taught that helping a slave run away is one of the worst sins imaginable and that African-Americans are pretty much worthless except as slaves. It takes a while for the truth to come to Huck but he finds that he is determined to help his friend get his freedom, no matter what. Huck ends up risking his own life to do just that.This book is a pure joy to read and I suggest you read it without looking for a political agenda. Just let the story flow and enjoy each word. The dialects used may slow you down a bit at first but they add so much to the flow of the book that they are quite indispensable. This is a wonderful story, full of youthful innocence and backwoods charm. Just one little warning though, once you start reading you won't be able to put this book down."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Finally, a reading of a classic that is worth the money.This story's narration covers a total of 9 Cds, and each disc has about 97 tracks (each track is only about 30 to 45 seconds). The good aspect of this is that it is quite easy to find your spot and, then pick up where you left off, if you happen to stop reading in the middle of a chapter. The negative aspect of short tracks is that it is difficult to skip around to particular chapters without \\"guessing\\" where a chapter might end (because there is no insert to tell which chapters are contained in each disc).Overall, Dick Hill does a superb job of reading in this unabridged version of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Hill's voice personifies Huck's narrative, and he keeps the Southern flavor of Twain's novel intact. What makes this reading particularly great is that Hill has a great ability to not only take on Huck, but other characters as well. Hill changes his voice for other characters such as Tom Sawyer, Jim, the Duke and the king, Pap and others. For this reason, this CD is a great tool for the reluctant readers in classes, and serves as a great supplement for the study of this novel.I have found that buying audios to classic to be a gamble because you never really know what you are getting, but this is one of the best I've gotten."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Not only is The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn a brilliant and funny story of an adolescent boy, it is the story of an adolescent nation: the United States circa 1885. It raises broad, moral questions whose answers still elude us today, as it addresses the question of slavery in terms that are deeply personal, moral, political, social and economic.Through Huck and the fugitive slave Jim, Twain looks at important issues of marginality, not just for people of color, but for people of all sorts who live outside of social norms, either by accident of race and class, by virtue of fate, or by a choice they have made. Some are outlaws and con men. Others are honest souls whose luck just ran out. Still others are merely independent-minded people who refuse to bend to stereotypes of race, class and gender. All share circumstances that put them outside of the societal norm and onto the road less traveled.The first great novel that was written in the vernacular, this novel has been criticized for its use of slang and pejoratives, especially for its liberal use of \\"the n word.\\" For me, it's important to remember that Twain was reflecting the language of the times and of the social class that Huck came from, as it is he who narrates the story. While I understand the objections, in the end, for me, they do not hold up if the choice is between reading or not reading this great American classic.I adored this book at age 7 and again at age 19 when I read it in college. And I continue to adore it as an adult, for each time I read Huck Finn something different and important is revealed to me. I can't recommend this book highly enough and think that there is no better time to (re)read it than on the occasion of the 125th anniversary of its publication."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"When I first read this book, I was so taken with it, that I read from chapter 18 through the end of the book in one night. I was up until 3:30 in the morning, reading ahead of my 11th grade assignment, and loving every minute along the way. later in college, when I studied the book more, closer, and with a more educated eye (whatever that means) my love for the book increased. Now, as a teacher myself, I look forward to having my students read this book and discussing it in class.But now as for the title of my review:I can't help feeling bad for people who think that this is not a good novel because &quot;we don't talk like that anymore.&quot; Are we to abandon books that are no longer contemporary to ourselves? I also take issue with people who claim that this book is a racist tirade based upon the use of the word &quot;nigger,&quot; or because the escape route Jim took was down the Mississippi instead of up river. While currently offensive, Mark Twain used the term as a literary fact that most, if not all young boys of the south spoke in such a manner. Once more, Jim explained why he was going South before he headed north. the simple fact is that if you are going to criticize a book, then you should read it. mark Twain said as much in his essay, &quot;Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses.&quot;From reading a number of the reviews of this book, I have come to the opinion that while many read the book, more than a few are refusing to give Twain credit for subtext and the use of allegory. One reviewer down the line says that the book is racist because Twain makes a young boy to be twice as smart as Jim. Upon closer reading, Twain is showing what Huck feels to be true. Huck only thinks that he is smarter. The reader should pick up on the fact that Twain writes Jim as an intuitive father figure for Huck, one who teaches a true morality as opposed to the morality of the South.Simply put, you get what you put in to the reading of this book. If you think is is going to be a boring read because you &quot;have to&quot; read it for a summer reading list or school assignment, then that's what it will be. If you think it will be a difficult read because you don't want to try and read in dialects other than your own, it will be a hard read. If you are looking to justify the book as racist because of a single word that presentism doesn't excuse, then have at it. This book can be all of those things. However, this book also has the potential to enlighten the reader, give something wonderful to the reader, and teach about the human condition."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"It's shameful and pathetic that any publisher would presume to censor Mark Twain by sanitizing Huckleberry Finn as Barron's has done. I urge anyone who loves literature to boycott this travesty of an edition."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"It amuses me no end to see so many irate reviews, obviously written by spoiled schoolkids resenting their stoopid 'ol teacher making them read this stoopid 'ol book by some stoopid 'ol dead guy.There's rich material there for a cynic like Twain, or even more for one the likes of Ambrose Bierce or H. L. Mencken. Tiny, immature, ill formed minds incapable of grasping a truth deeper than Nintendo or Playstation lash out in outrage at a genius who holds up a mirror to expose their ignorance.The fact is, this is THE American experience of the 19th century, a microcosm of the defining characteristic of our country's beginning and of our national shame and curse. How did a nation, conceived in liberty, holding self evident so many truths about Man's rights, institutionalize the degredation of Black Americans, the utter denial of their very humanity? How could the noble idealistic American eagle ever swallow such a poisonous pill?Huck's bitter determination to &quot;go to hell&quot; in order to save his friend Jim is to me the most moving and courageous moment in all literature. Huck &quot;knows&quot; that Jim is not really human, that he is mere property, that he has no rights and deserves no consideration, and that Huck's social duty is to return the slave owner's lost property. Yet he knows even more deeply that Jim is his friend, mentor, companion, and in not saving him he will lose his own soul, regardless of what his society holds to be true. Thus Huck makes himself an outcast and outlaw in civilized society, and thus he prefigures the cataclysm of the Civil War, in which this vile contradiction nearly destroyed our nation. All the blood spilled during that war, however, has not expunged our Original Sin, and we have been paying for it ever since, and perhaps always shall.So try to expand your mind, at least accept the concept that the past is not a Real World episode in period costume, that people of another time did think and talk and act differently, that what &quot;everybody knows&quot; today will surely be as ludicrous a century hence as slavery may seem to us now. Reflect, also, on the courage of those who recognized evil ahead of their time and stood up to it, even though in this case such a hero is a fictionalized semi-literate boy."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Look Inside for Collector's Library Adventures of Huckleberry Finn promised an illustrated book. We have a case of a misleading Look Inside: in reality no illustrations; very small format; awful choice of typeface. My impression that Look Inside was made from a different edition.Another thing: it's a little strange when Amazon customers review Mark Twain. Mark Twain does not need it. What is needed are reviews of different editions (quality, illustrations, scholarly or nor, paper, cover and typeface. So one star is, of course not for Huck Finn (100 stars for that boy), but for the awful edition. and misleading Look Inside.Finally, let me repeat it again: the more I read reviews on Huck Finn, the more I am convinced, they have to be separated by editions. If I am looking for a scholarly edition with illustration and a decent cover and typeface, how, in a world, can it be helpful, if someone writes: \\"Mark Twain is not for me.\\" Serious readers will seek opinions on classics from other sources, for example, from Hemingway who said, that the whole American literature had come out of Huck Finn. OK, if Amazon thinks that \\"Mark Twain is not for me\\" phrase is protected by First Amendment, and any football and beer lover has a right to put it here as an opinion, I agree. In this case, still, I think these ones have to be separated from opinions of serious book readers and collectors who are interested in differences of certain editions of classics."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Whole pieces of the text are missing from the free Kindle edition (this one:Adventures of Huckleberry Finn). So far I've noticed that Hamlet's soliloquy and the end of chapter 23 are missing."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This review isn't to give a review of one of the most studied works of the English language, but rather to detail what makes this edition special and worthy of purchase.At the most superficial level Huck is the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which had introduced us to these two icons of the printed word. After Tom Sawyer was a big hit the publisher, perhaps understandably, wanted not only a sequel, but one which logically followed Tom Sawyer. They specifically desired for the two works to sit comfortably on a shelf together. Perhaps there was a time when Mark Twain desired the same thing - more of the same crowd pleasing story telling. But I think that perhaps from the beginning he recognized that he now had the audience that he wanted for his masterpiece, so he began writing it.Even in the form which was familiar for 100 years Huckleberry Finn was widely hailed as the centerpiece of American Literature. THIS edition reveals that the masterpiece as originally conceived was even more masterly.Clemens wrote the original manuscript and submitted it to the publisher. I don't know what they thought of the book as it was, but one thing was clear: it was a good deal longer than Tom Sawyer and sitting side by side with Tom Sawyer the two books looked less like a \\"pair\\".So.... the editorial pruning process began and enough was removed from the originally conceived Huckleberry Finn to create both the originally published versions of Huck as well as \\"Life on the Mississippi\\".Now we finally get to see the \\"complete Huck\\". The missing text flows along with the \\"original Huck\\" as mightily as the Mississippi that Huck and Jim ride along in the book of our dreams.As if that weren't enough, we also are treated to original illustrations and facsimile reproductions of several of Twain's original text. I found these pages among the most enlightening of all. Almost as if he knew his handwritten pages would be looked at by posterity, Twain used a unique revision technique. Rather than erasing a word or passage he wishes to replace, he would instead line through the words in a single line, leaving the replaced word legible along with the words which would replace the revised word. By examining these hand-written lines we can see how meticulous Twain was in his word selection. In several of the passages he made slight corrections which were plainly intended to make the runaway slave, Jim, as noble as possible. It has long been a curiosity to me that this book, frequently criticized as \\"racist\\", has as it's two central characters a runaway slave and the \\"poor white trash\\" boy who decides to help him. At one point Huck is memorably torn between what the Southern Society he has been raised in says is right and what gnaws at his conscience. It is obviously an unqualified truth to Huck that Jim is uneducated and so poor that he doesn't even own himself, yet Jim possesses more humanity than any of the \\"civilized\\" southerners Huck meets. Seeing Clemens' own scrawl lets us see how diligently Clemens worked to make that distinction clear - that Jim is easily the most noble adult in the book.I agree with Mr. Hemingway - Huckleberry Finn IS America's greatest novel. Thanks to rediscovering Twain's original text (and an entertaining sequence of events which is detailed in the introduction to this edition) we finally get to read America's greatest Novel the way that the author originally intended.I cannot recommend this highly enough."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"this is my second time reviewing this book I think I was too harsh on the people who gave this one star so they scewed me. this book is not some little kiddy novel. You don't understand how amazingly intelligent this book is. The entire thing rips on pre civil war south with subtle but but genious comments about the way things were. Only one thing wrong This book is an example of realism and all through twain rips on romanticism. But is the ending truly realism. If a slave was to run away wouldn't he be hanged. If they would of hung him I think the ending would have been better. Not because I hated jim, in fact he was the best character, but because it fits better with the way twain was writing his story. I also think it would have been the ultimate lesson on how if you believe romanticism sometimes reality can be devastating. But the story is wonderful anyway. Go ahead and buy about ten copies and give them to everyone you know. they'll apreciate it and if they don't its there loss."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Huckleberry Finn, as told by Garrison Keillor, was a profound disappointment for me, a fan of all things Wobegone. As a faithful version of THE American Classic, this telling takes jarring liberities (such as changing the ending!) and leaves loose ends (Huck posing as Tom at the aunt's home is suddenly just Huck again without explanation). As a good audio narrative, forget it: Garrison's sonorous delivery doesn't make it. Very frustrating listening while driving - every word is a moan or whisper with consonants that crack and pop, so no volume is comfortable. His character voices meld together in places, making it difficult to follow the give and take between the Duke and the King. And in one spot on the river, it sounds like Guy Noir quizzing Huck! Yuck. I'd advise: pick another version, and you'll like Huck Finn and Garrison Keillor better."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I am enjoying reading this classic to my son. I read it years ago. By reading this story to him, I am finding myself excited and ready to take on a new adventure. The price is unbelievable, too."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Maybe this book should not, as one reviewer noted, be assigned in high school. But then maybe no books should be assigned to people who are quicker to judge than to understand. Stupid, boring, difficult...hardly.Well--of course it's difficult (like everything that's good), for some good reasons. First of all, it's an illiterate white boy from the deep South--of course he speaks dialect (which is not the same as &quot;he cain't spell&quot;). Second, it's tough subject matter Twain tackles. What would you do in this situation? The right thing, which is what you've been told to do--turn Jim in? Or should you follow your heart, as Huck finally does, thinking it'll send him straight to hell? What would Jesus do?I find this book a rollercoaster ride, one adventure after another. Like many other readers, I am disturbed by the last couple of chapters, but given how Huck is under the influence of Tom Sawyer, it's not unintelligible.However, I have a bone to pick with this particular edition, by the Oxford UP. The introduction by Emory Elliot is less than satifying. For instance, he claims Twain was highly original in making this illiterate character the narrator of his novel, when of course there was a plethora of for instance slave narratives, often told by semi-literate narrators. He goes on to state that Twain was the first American author to explore &quot;divorce, social strife, and violence&quot;--seemingly forgetting all about, for instance, &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin,&quot; written well before &quot;Huck,&quot; where all these issues are discussed.That said, I am happy to see that this edition features as an appendix the infamous &quot;Raftmen's Passage,&quot; essential to the plot but excised by Twain (really, by his editor), and this restores the &quot;original&quot; structure of the novel, making the turn downstream, down South, acceptable. Also, the explanatory notes are quite good. Finally, this OUP edition is worth buying for the cover alone, which has a detail from a gorgeous Homer-painting."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I can never understand why some people consider &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; to be a racist novel. It had the exact opposite effect on me.I read this book when I was about 13 years old. Being brought up in a lilly-white suburb, I was a blatant racist. I had no direct contact with black people; I only knew what I heard from friends. Reading &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; made me understand the historical prejudices that people had against black people and how it held them back. It turned my views on blacks completely around, and I still vividly remember the arguments I had with my friends about race after I read this book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"There is a reason the paperback Dover edition is $3 (green and black line drawing of a steamboat on cover) The font is way too small and the spacing between lines is non existent.

Not worth purchasing."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"A great read! Hard to believe it took me until now (age 48) to read it! I have heard many say that they believe it is a racist book but I disagree. Yes, there are slaves in the book and they are referred to with the \\"N\\" word. That is just the way it was back then and it was common to speak that way and refer to slaves that way. Throughout the book, however, they were not referred to in a disparaging way and the friendship and even love between Huck and Jim is evident throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I must start by saying that although I do have a passionate love for literature, I am much more in tune with modern day epics than classics. I have recently finished Huck Fin for the second time, the first being my freshman year of college. This time around however, I enjoyed and understood it much more. I believe that although the language is a little rough around the edges, and at times slightly distracting to me, this book is an amazing tale of friendship and growth. The two boys go through a tremendous amount of change and learning experiences that most people can only hope to endure in a lifetime. I think that the first time I read this I was put off by the excessive use of the \\"N\\" word and couldn't see through to how, in spite of a few 'stereotypical' images that twain paints of Jim, wise and mature he really was. All in all I think it's a good read and Twain is an amazing Arthur if you simply open your mind to what he's trying to do with this novel!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I understand people views of the book being racist. There are moments reading it that it can be interpreted as racism. However it is Twain trying to authenticate the story. Sadly a boy during that time would talk about slaves the way he did or for people to think the way they did in the story. Putting all these things aside the book is interesting. It takes the reader on an adventure they never would have thought about before. Twain does a good job of bringing the characters to life. At the same time he brings up social issues that were going on during that time. It opens people eyes while entertaining them. Twain does a good job of making characters that are appealing to read. Huck is funny and adventurous."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is arguably one of the most significant pieces in American Literature. Twain, in this masterpiece, highlights sensitive issues through the eyes of Huch Finn and Jim who is a run away slave. This controversy has caused many schools to ban this piece from its curriculum and has been reviewed by many as one of the most racist books of its time.Mark Twain cleverly takes us on a run-away adventure and in doing so helps us understand the exceptence of slavery in Missouri in the 1830's. Ironically, Twain depicts American Society through the scope of Hucks care giver Mrs. Watson. Mrs. Watson is religious God seeking lady who illustrates lack of sympathy for the colored race. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an important piece of literature which should be read with an open mind."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"It's not called \\"the great American novel\\" for nothing.Huck Finn is by far one of the greatest fronteir adventures ever written.Mark Twain is brilliant, witty, and real.There is nothing else like it; it's a must-read."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read Huckleberry Finn as a young teenager and beyond question this was my favorite piece of fiction (my version is 1985). I will confess I had only a limited scope to compare with as I was not a first-rate bookworm as a child; however, this will not diminish the timeless quality of Twain's work.I remember absorbing myself in this book quite fondly and having difficulty putting it down. At an age when I could closely relate to Huck's level of maturity, Twain presented his novel in such a congenial fashion it was almost as though I remember Huck as a personal friend. This is perhaps the genius of the book, a book I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Once in the Mississippi river, a boy named Tom and his slave friend Jim were going down a stream to go to the Free states to get a fresh start. It was summer time and the two boys were running away from the trouble they left behind their old life. The two boys weren't just going to the Free states to get a fresh start, they were going there, because this way Jim could be free and Tom could stay away from his abusive dad. This is the only way that Jim and Tom could find a resolution to their problems.My favorite part of this book is when Jim and Tom were going down the Mississippi and they were both asleep and a steam boat ran over their raft causing the boy's to separate from each other for a very long time. This event caused the boy's to be more united and to go through a lot more cool adventures.The message that the writer wants to show here is that it is not ok to lie, to face trouble, no mater how bad it is, and to always say the true. The things that I like about this book were that it was really exciting and there were a lot of adventures in the story. But the only thing that I would like to change about this book is that is too much trouble going on, and it makes it really hard to understand. I would recommend every one to read this book because it is really exciting and it paints a picture in your mind making the reading really exciting."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is hilarious. I laughed all the way through it. It's also very educational as it goes along with the time period of whites/blacks segregation. In this book, you see a world though a little boy's eyes and how he has to deal with many obstacles and help Jim, his slave. In his day, people weren't likely to help blacks so it's a very touching and worthwhile story/novel. I highly recommend this to all of you book-lovers. This is my FAVORITE Mark Twain book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read Huckleberry Finn just this year!

At the same time they are chasing their own wild dreams and adventures.Humour is spread all over the book and it often takes quirky turns. I can laugh at some very small bits from the beginning of the novel where Tom Sawyer makes an unsuccessful attempt to form a gang of robbers, towards the end of book where impish Tom kisses his own aunt on the lips under disguise of some other boy and Jim being supplied with all sorts of insects and snakes while in captivity.But what makes this story great is the noble theme that runs throughout the book. Society's inhuman and exploitative nature and human heart's own capacity for love, compassion and friendship, above all. As we see in the book human compassion and friendship triumphs over greed, malevolence and injustice of an unjust and small hearted society."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Huckleberry Finn, best friend of Tom Sawyer, runs away from his brutal, white-trash father for an easy-going life of floating down the Missisippi river on a raft. But just as he sets out he meets up with runaway slave Jim. Their escape and adventure they have together as with each mooring of the raft they encounter a new problem, friend, fued or foe. Each and every time Huck manages to worm out of the situation by telling huge lies so he can get back to the raft, escaping one fine mess to end up in another.Huckleberry Finn speaks volumes of the era it was written in. There's no such thing as political correctness here as the 'N' word is thrown around so casually and frequently you might have to stop yourself from repeating it after putting the book down. To justify this, one might consider that Huck and Jim are considered to be the most common and ruffian of black and white so would naturally go together like peas in a pod. Jim's role as a surrogate father cements this theory also.The only ongoing plot thread is that of Jim evading his captors. Other characters and story arcs come and go. I do realise that Mark Twain wrote the book over a period of many years so this may account as to why it has a stop/start feel to it. It does seem as meandering as this Missisippi river itself.Some have voiced dismay at the cop-out ending. But you can look at like so many movie plot-holes of today. Without suspension of disbelief or some necessary contrivances there simply wouldn't be a story or, ultimately, any adventures to tell of.It's written in many different dialects and can be a bit tricky to get ahold of. But if you stick with it, the effort will pay off. I don't consider Huckleberry Finn to be a life-changing book but it does deserve its status as a classic and has huge amounts of drama and character.This edition features a lengthy introduction by George Saunders, a lost chapter and critical reviews."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read this book recently, for my 10th grade American Literature class. I think possibly the most accurate description I can give for it is that it's a sort of pre-Civil War-era 'Catcher in the Rye'--both novels are journeys of adolescent self-discovery, told in an informal, gritty first-person narrative voice. If you liked 'Catcher', chances are, you'll like 'Huck'. ('Huck' is also lacking in most of the teenager-y whining and moaning that put people off 'Catcher').I will admit that the novel has attributes that will make it a boring or valueless read, for some. It's told from the perspective of an semi-literate Southern boy and is filled with digressions and anecdotes. It's very episodic and I can't say it has one centralized plot.Still, I enjoyed the book for the vibrant, colorful portayal of the American South, the dark humor and most of all, for the characters. Jim, the slave man, while often a figure of humor, has quiet dignity and nobility. He provides a father figure for the abandoned and parentless Huck. Huck, himself, is an utterly unforgettable character--the humble country boy with \\"a sound heart and a deformed conscience\\", he is impossible not to like. Seriously. My one complaint with the book are the segments in which Huck goes into dry-exposition and detail-mode and doesn't give his own unique insight into what's going on. Also, the end of the book, when Huck and Jim become secondary characters and the extraordinarily irritating Tom Sawyer dominates, is rather boring.Other than that, this is a solid masterpiece and probably the finest American classic I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I thought The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was a decent book. I feel that most people who read this book will enjoy and have a great time. This book contains many twists and turns that left me begging for more. Huckleberry Finn is a great character for all young boys to relate too. He is full of adventure and loves to cause trouble.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was overall a very fun and exciting book. The drama was always high and had my blood pulsing. From having an abusive and alcoholic father, to running away from his hometown, and then being captured by the duke and the dauphin, it did not seem like Huck ever got a break nor did he want one. The plot was great because it was always changing from one dramatic experience to the next. Huck never stayed in one place and was always ditching his father or Miss Watson (the widow taking care of him). While both of them care about Huck in a completely different way, he really didn't want to have anything to do with them. Most of the characters were great in the book. Each one had an important part that lead to the next catastrophe. At the end all of the characters seemed to come together and it was interesting how basically everyone met each other. Jim, a slave child, was a very important character. He became a true friend and accomplice throughout the entire book. While most of the characters played an important part, some pieces just didn't fit however and lead to boredom.Although this book was basically very good, I got confused during certain parts. The whole deal with the duke and the dauphin was stupid in my opinion. I feel that they just made the book more puzzling. They were from one town to the next tricking people and using fake names, eventually it got old. Around this time the book started to drag on and the development didn't really go anywhere; it stayed pretty dull. Also the whole deal with Huck's abusive father really didn't have a huge affect in the long run. Huck still ended up with Miss Watson and besides the beginning Huck didn't have to deal with his father.Overall I was very pleased with this book. I am the kind of kid who loves drama and adventure. Even though parts were slow and boring, they picked up. The action is intense and the humor goes very well with it. No matter what type of situation, Huck always seems to make it enjoyable. I would suggest this book to anyone who enjoys a fun book about mischief and who enjoys good laugh."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I tried to read this book in high school without much success. The episodic plot and many dialects were too much for me to handle.

It starts out in Missouri right on the Mississippi River. Huck Finn was a young boy who was adopted and was taught manners and how to live like a proper person. He never like this much and to be quite honest, he hated it. Huck's father was a drunk and one day kidnapped Huck and took him out to his cabin. Whenever Pap would leave, he would lock Huck in the cabin. Huck fakes his own death to get away from his father who abuses him. He hides on an island in the middle of the Mississippi river. While there, Huck meets a kind African American man named Jim. Jim and Huck develop a good relationship and begin on a long adventure together. They come across some tough times when they come across other people because they think Jim is a runaway slave. They encounter some con artists who sell Jim as a runaway slave. Jim was sold to Tom Sawyer's aunt and uncle. Huck and Tom device a plan to get Jim freed. Their plan works to free Jim and they realize later that Jim has already been a free man. The book ends with a good ending and Huck continues his adventurous ambitions by heading out west. I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars. It was a great book but not my perfect book to read.

We actually experience Huck's activities through his eyes, with his thoughts and the reasoning behind his actions. Twain captures perfectly the thought process of a (13 year old?) young man.

The first and last third of the book are exactly that. Huck is up to his trickery in the beginning of the book and resumes his mischevious ways with his cousin Tom at the end of the book. But in the middle, Huck has many realizations that go directly against his Mississippi upbringing. Huck learns the evils of racism and Jim's humanity, along with the value of friendship. In this part of the novel, Huck matures into a free-thinking individual, leading him to his destination as the novel's conclusion."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"Huckleberry Finn\\" reflects very accurately the thinking and culture of the time. I was shook by the part where Huck recognizes that which many adults would not for years to come: that the African American is a human being worthy of that which all humans are entitled. It is a contemporaneous account of history, albeit fictional; it is typical of many accounts of the time, told as only Twain could tell it: so vividly that you feel Huck's adventure is your own.I found this edition very well done. I do admit, however, that I spent most of the book reading \\"chile\\" as \\"chilli\\". P.S. chile = child."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I don't need to tell you what this book is about: everyone is familiar with it.

The dialects, the events, the people: they're all so priceless. A masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Quote: \\"All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn... All American writing comes from that. There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since.\\" -- Ernest HemingwayWhy has 'Huckleberry Finn' been on so many lists of banned books? Because many readers (and many people who never bothered to read it) considered it indecent and racist. Yet, even with its frequent place on the lists of America's most challenged books, it's become a classic. Although many consider that Twain's depiction of the runaway slave, Jim, was demeaning and racist, the story shows the hypocrisy of American society towards slaves and African Americans. The story follows Huck and Jim - both runaways - as they travel down the Mississippi River, with Huck slowly changing his views about blacks and working to help Jim to freedom."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This classic is worth reading several times. We need a book like this for the times we live in now...what Twain could do with politics of today!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"After reading the book after it was written some 120 years before, I enjoyed the historical concept of the book and how America played out with the bigotry and views of slavery of the times. I found the dialects and the manner of speaking in the 19th Century annoying and hard to follow, but again in historical perspective, it was a good read, slow, probably authentic, sometimes annoying, and overall a good review of Huckleberry and his black friend Jim, floating down the river and experiencing endless adventures. The larger print of this edition was great for an older reader with fading eyes. In many ways, Huckleberry is an obnoxious, rebellious character, and probably nowadays would be on medication and maybe visiting the counselors for some behavior modication. Overall, worth the time and effort to read a Twain classic."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This was the least expensive of the available editions. It was excellent as the print was large making it easy to read.It is a classic book and was well presented."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is my favorite novel of all time. Although often assigned to middle school children, this book requires a certain level of maturity to appreciate it fully. At surface level, Twain's novel is engaging. One can't help but laugh and revel vicariously in the adventures that Huck and Jim get into. On a deeper level, this novel explores a more serious theme: the conflict between individual freedom and the corrupting influence of society. Huck resists being \\"civilized\\" by the Widow Jenkins, and readers cheer him on in this regard. He is resisting what many of us would like to resist---the boundaries set by society. To be \\"civilized\\" means to lose one's self in some way; it means to relinquish childhood.This book has always reminded me of J.D. Salinger's THE CATCHER IN THE RYE because of its completely honest first-person narrator and the theme of individual vs. society. So, if you like Salinger's novel, you'll probably enjoy this one."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This one's for Huckleberry Finn. I first read this is high school and forgot everything about it a month later. A while back I read it again and now my memory is much better. This is about the travels of the boy Huck Finn down or up the Mississippi River with a slave named Jim. Huck had previously escaped from his drunkard father and from \\"civilized\\" society as well. The book chronicles their travels and the many adventures that ensue. Mark Twain was a supremely talented writer and uses his skills in an impressive way here. The attention to detail is astonishing and I felt like I was right there with the protagonists every step of the way. There is also a great deal of humor as is to be expected to Twain. And also, there is an uplifting message about the nature of racisim towards the end that could be said to be the cenral theme of the novel. Now that's what was good, so what was bad? Well, Twain goes on and on about boring minutae many times throughout this thing. Two characters named the Duke and King (I think) are introduced and are basically criminals. Almost to a letter they are boring every time mentioned, but I wouldn't call them filler though, I just didn't get into them. They get Huck and Jim into all sorts of trouble and meet their end in time. Other than the long-windedness there isn't much wrong with this novel. Alot of people have said that this is the best ever novel by an American writer, but I don't agree. Oh, one more thing. There is a certain word tossed about quite often here that some people find offensive. I won't mention it here, but most people will be able to guess what it is. Get over it people, It's just the language of the times. I'm someone who could choose to be personally offended by that word in this book but can look past it to see what Twain was doing. If you can't do that then you'll be missing out on the novel's greater message of tolerance and understanding and doing yourself a disservice in the long run. This novel is definitely one of the best ever written and deserves a go by every man woman and child."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Let's begin by noting that this is a remarkable work for two reasons. First, it's written in vernacular, from start to finish. This makes the book raw and lively, humorous, and honest. It has a far truer ring to it than a thousand other books from the 19th century. Second, Huck rises above his pro-slavery upbringing and comes to see Jim as a man and a friend.Both remarkable features guarantee this novel a place in American lore. However, a good deal of its genius is in working against the sentiments of its age. The racial politics of the day are very different, and thus the novel--like Uncle Tom's Cabin--loses much of its traction.With its humor and plain-talk it is superior to almost any American novel from the 18th century. It remains an exceedingly funny novel. Twain is masterful in his depiction of boyhood and the comedies that arise from childish misunderstandings, mischievous shenanigans, and the art of the con. And it is a vital historical document. That will never change.I do think the book has some racist and classist moments. Despite Huck's sympathies with Jim, Jim and other Negroes do not come off as terribly intelligent or well-rounded people. In Huck's eyes, Jim is a man worthy of friendship and freedom, but he is woefully nave and gullible.The lampooning of Blacks and poor Whites takes away from the greatness of this book, even if Twain's political sympathies lay with both groups. And given the changed nature of \\"race\\" in the 21st century, some of what made this book brilliant is only recovered with an effort. These are reasons to phase Huck Finn out of the high school cannon. I say this while hoping that college students, and all adult Americans, will continue to read and love Huck Finn for many more centuries."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read this book in 10th grade and it was so boring.

This is my first Mark Twain book, and it's surely to be my last, as I was sorely disappointed. While the grammar and dialect are supposed to be written realistically, I found it cumbersome. The adventures changed constantly, and if Twain had written with one adventure in mind, then my attention span would not have diminished. When Tom Sawyer entered the book permanently, I became irritated, because when he arrived, the story became prolonged and trivial. I feel I wasted my time reading this book. I do not recommend."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I really didn't like this book.

And the ending is so forced and tacked on you'd think the editor just added it on to make the book more than 200 pages. It's too coincidental, even more so than Les Miserables. Truthfully, I had to read this book for school, and I couldn't get past page 30, it was that boring. And the Cliffs' Notes put into perspective how utterly ridiculous and childish this book really is. For those who think this is a classic, I urge you to read Moby Dick, a true American classic.

Stay away from this audio publisher."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Ever since Hemingway's unfortunate comments about HUCKLEBERRY FINN the book has been required reading for the literati. Like most people, I read it as but a lad. I had finished TOM SAWYER and was swept up in the stories of lost treasure and endless caverns and Injun Joe. I thought HUCKLEBERRY FINN would be more of the same, and was disappointed to find it was about a boy abused by a drunken father who runs away in a bildungsroman where he meets all sorts of unengaging characters. Even the Duke and the Dauphin come off better in the movies than on the original page.Before continuing, I suppose I ought to give my bona fides. I have nothing against &quot;classics&quot;. They've been my principle study for nearly thirty years -- Proust, Dostoevsky, Dickens, Tolstoy, &amp;c. all are great chums of mine. I'm unafraid of dead while males (oddly enough, unlike Huck, who says, &quot;After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in dead people.&quot; I get a grim satisfaction knowing Sam Clemens is now among their number, as everyone will be who criticizes what they've produced.I've recently turned 40, and just read TOM SAWYER again for the first time in a quarter century. It's still a solid book, exciting, well-written, and funny. It's a swell book, and great for imaginative children, as it was for me at Tom's age. I'm now fighting Huck again, and it's rough sailing and choppy seas. I wish I was back with Swann and Baron de Charlus! Huck's aimless drifting down the river is less interesting than seven volumes of Proust.The &quot;racist&quot; accusation is fraudulent. Twain is careless with his use of certain verboten words, but one must not judge a writer by modern standards of racial sensitivity (as with Twain) or plot development (as with Smollett) any more than future -- and I hope more rational and well-centered -- generations that come after modern writers are dead like Moses, that some of their books are not written off simply because of the twentieth century writers' rabid obsession with sex.One reason young people don't like to read is because in schools, which is unfortunately the first place many young people face anything to read, force them into areas over their heads. Tom Sawyer's story would be a better start. It's a book written by a man who hasn't forgotten what it's like to be a boy. Huck's book is written by a man exploiting a child's voice as a mouthpiece for his own prejudices and petty dislikes. It's written above the heads of youths.Perhaps its appeal is more like MOBY DICK or LES MISERABLE. As the vision of Ahab after the white whale is more powerful than can be contained in a book, as the vision of Javert after Valjean transcends a magnificent novel, so perhaps the image of Huck and Jim on the big river simply couldn't be expressed by a writer of Clemens' fine humor but rather limited abilities."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine how anyone could read Mark Twains hillarious satire and social commentary, and so completely miss the point.

The second reason I gave it this rank is because throughout the whole book there is always something exciting taking place and plenty of action. This helps keep the reader focused and into the book. Another reason for my ranking is because even though the book is mostly serious, Mark Twain adds some comedy into the book to help reveal some of the more serious times in the book. The length of the book is just about perfect, because the author doesn't try and drag on a certain part of the story. This makes the book more interesting. Finally, the reason I didn't give this book a perfect five out of five is because of the ending. I feel that the ending doesn't fit the book. This is cause throughout the whole book there is always action taking place, and then at the ending of the book it kind of stops at a dull point.

There is also a more serious side to the novel where Twain uses Huck to learn the evils of society that the story takes place in. Through Huck, Twain tells his opinion of slavery and shares his own moral values. Because this is a realistic book, Twain can convey his thoughts and morals to readers of every level, not just highly educated scholars. Using realism, Twain lets people know how he thinks and shows that people can change. Realism is utilized to allow all people to be able to relate and understand what is going on in the novel.

I also think that he lacks good judgements, but he means well.I do not particularly enjoy this book because it is very long and boring. It uses too many confusing words and it is difficult to understand. Although this story is adventurous, it doesn't meet the needs I required for this book. It took me a very long time to understand what was going on in this book. Also, I don't really like stories that revolves around the 1800's. They don't do any interesting things and the way they talk is so vulgar."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I liked the beginning and the end, but the middle was dull"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The low rating refers to the Collector's Library format, not the books contents.

That being said, I confess I was almost (but not quite) glad that, after learning too much about the ending, I lowered my expectation to such a level that I was able to successfully suffer through it. Parents of students assigned to read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn should, I believe, preview the book beforehand.

Unfortunately this is the only thing these critics talk about when they read the book. Huckleberry Finn is more about looking at a society which did believe in the cruelty of slavery not supporting it. On the same note even today we ignore human right issues and I think this book should be taught at Secondary school level. If people are going to change their attitudes about racism this is the last time that they will do so. But as well as critise society it does look at it from a humourous point of view and will keep you interested. I personally found it occasionally a bit childish at points but it is the overall story of friendship and overcoming socities rule in the greatest of odds which will keep you interested.

For example: He ran in a dark, creepy, scarely, huge mansion. Even though I don't read that much books, I still thinks that Mark Twain books are very exciting and adventureous.

Twain masterfully creates an interesting story line while staying true to the times, setting, and language. Huck's tale of his adventure down the Mississippi will keep you turning the pages. It is very interesting because things happen when you least expect it. This is an amazing story full of adventure and fun.But of course, you will find the way the characters speak is either annoying or downright confusing. But remember this takes place in the past! It was normal for people to talk like that. Also you think this book is not good because the use of the N word in describing Jim. Although use of that word is offensive and insensitive now, it was not like that in those days. And most of the young boys of the south spoke in such a manner then. If you read this book then you will find this is really a good book. I am sure that you will appreciate this book as one of the greatest classics of American literature."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Have you ever known anyone who went back and forth between an abusive parent and a guardian that wanted you to do things you didn't want to? Neither of those choices sounds very appealing but Huck didn't have any choice except to run away.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a fictional story by Mark Twain. Twain also wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer which I recommend that you read before reading this because you wouldn't understand some of the parts if you didn't read it.Huck is not exactly a normal kid, sometimes he goes to school but sometimes he doesn't. He lives with either his father or Widow Douglas. He is not school smart but when it comes to survival he knows exactly how to stay alive when he is alone with no food or anything. He knows how to fish, makes rafts, start fires and can hunt fairly well. His father abuses him often but Huck seems to stay with him until he couldn't stand it anymore.Huck was living with Widow Douglas when his father took (it seemed like kidnapped) him away to an island where there was no one there. His father takes Huck's money and buys whiskey or other alcoholic beverages and gets drunk and beats Huck for no reason. Huck couldn't stand it anymore so one night when his father went to town and got drunk he sawed his way out of the cabin(which he was locked in) and then the real adventure began. I would definitely recommend this book. Its fun to read and nearly impossible to put down. If you like adventurous books about kids our age than you would probably enjoy reading this book.I had read a couple of Mark Twain's books and I have enjoyed each one. Reading this book made me want to read even more books from this talented author."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book has been called racist from the very begining and still is banned in many schools today for it's \\"racist\\" content. My school system believes that to. So I went to get a copy because everyone said it was so better than Tom Sawyer which was what I was reading at the time.It really, truly is.This is agreat book not only for it's numerous metaphors, but for it's evolution of it's characters. Huck and Jim are extremly passionate about their beliefs and grow on eachother so much that Huck would rather \\"go to hell\\" than see Jim back in slavery. Even though that is the main plot, two other characters play a pivitol part in the story. The are the king and the duke. At first they seem like greedy but harmless con-men but as they stay whith Huck and Jim for a while we see from Huck's view how evil and greedy people can be. It is sort of sad to see this plotline not really remembered well, becaus it is very interesting.So who is the main villian in the story? Not the king and the duke, but the system of slavery. And because of that Huck and every other white person in the book calls slaves \\"niggers\\" without any thought of remorse. Is this a racist book that uses terrible language and metaphors that try to make black people look ignorant and evil?No.This book shows a point of view in a time that we can somewhat relate to. It's unfortunate that this book is pushed away by hasty critism and is not allowed to be read is some public schools because this doesn't only make observe an age in time.

I was supposed to read it again in college, and I did read it again, even though I knew I could've passed the test without doing so. Huckleberry Finn was different because it was about a kid who thought more the way I did and acted the way I would have liked to, most of the time anyway. That's what made it great for me. Most of the characters and thinking described in this book are timeless, for good and bad reasons, and that goes a long way in making the book great literature.If you want to read more by Mark Twain, I recommend checking out A Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, and Roughing It."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it's one of the few that we've read in english class that has intrigued me to keep reading and find out what happens next.

I recommend to this to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I had previously read the book \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" during a project in third grade. I grew up very close to St. Petersburg, Missouri, where the story takes place. This made the story more interesting because I know what the area is like. I could not comprehend the story as well then as I now can, and it was fascinating to reread. It was also much better this time because I was not being forced to read it in class.The story held my focus throughout, and I found it hard to put the book down. I loved the constant action of the book. The boys were always coming up with sly or cunning ideas, as they had done in the prequel. It was quite humorous, while still creating a great deal of suspense and drama. It gives people who have grown up in recent years a chance to imagine what it would be like to grow up at the turn of the century. That is probably my favorite aspect of the book. It has an overabundance of action while remaining very believable and somewhat realistic.The main characters are my favorite part of this series of books. Huck is my favorite character because he overcomes so much adversity. He could very easily give up on life after what he put up with against his father, but continued to aspire a good life elsewhere. Also, he acted as an older brother figure for Tom and taught him a lot during their experiences. I also admire Tom because he shares in Huck's action, as well as teaches him to be booksmart. They do well in complimenting each other. They also are very cunning but stay within their morals, and I admire that. Jim is an example of how the boys were far ahead of their time and befriended not only a black man, but a slave. They were very mature, despite ignorance because of their young age. None of the main characters ever seemed to be selfish when it came to helping each other; they would always put their neck on the line for one another.Overall, I loved this book, and would suggest it to anyone. I do think, however, that males would enjoy it more than females simply because the adventures tend more to a male imagination, but it can be enjoyed by all readers."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The novel \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" exposes the reader to many interesting and funny occurrences during the pre-Civil War time. The story is about the dangerous and hazardous adventures that both main characters, Huckleberry Finn and Jim, undertake in order to escape from the problems in their lives.\\"All the best stories in the world but one story in reality- the story of escape. It is the only thing which interests us all and at all times, how to escape.\\", said the author Walter Bagehot.The adventures of Huck and Jim represent escaping from the problems they have. Jim escapes for freedom and Huck for independence. A young teenage boy and an escaped slave travel down the Mississippi River with nothing but a raft and an obscure plan about how to change their lives.

Also I like how the main character in the story which is Huck, made his own decision by running away from his abusive father.

This was for the student who would have trouble reading on his on or for the class to listen to certain parts of the book read to them."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I can't say more on the plot because it's quite obvious what the plot is just from illustrations of the novel. But on the \\"controversial\\" aspect of the novel involving the excessive use of the N word, people have to think of the time period that Twain is writing about and when the novel was published.The novel takes place in Missouri (a slave border state) in the 1830s. We use the term African-American or black now. Before that it was Afro-Americans, coloreds, Negr--s. The list goes on and on. The overall attitude was that as the terms changed the previous one was seen as more offensive than the progressive current one. Yes, that meant there was a time when the word \\"colored\\" was used by people who considered themselves progressive in terms of racial attitudes. But in the Antebellum South the use of the N word was thrown around quite easily. And persons added positive as well as negative adjectives to it. It's strange to imagine that. We today only think of it in a totally negative way. But even when Twain published the novel in the 1880s the word was unfortunately not yet out of fashion.Also consider the way Twain writes of Jim, the runaway slave. While the knee-jerk reaction is that Jim is a total vaudevillian caricature of what the perception was of blacks in the Antebellum South, his relationship with Huck Finn was something to be viewed as progressive. Remember that a decade before the novel came out; Reconstruction was over and left things a mess in terms of race relations. There was a lot of bitterness in the South over the Civil War (probably the most destructive war at the time until WWI), and a whole generation of southern white men took it personally when they were expected to be on the same level in terms of voting rights and other things with men that was formerly human property. For us today \\"all men are created equal\\" is a statement of truth provided we all have a level playing field. But for many southern whites at the time this was hard to swallow. In an aristocratic agrarian society, some men are just superior to others. And in the Antebellum South, just below poor whites were blacks. This was the way things were in their society for over two hundred years and the Civil War didn't suddenly end that sentiment among the many. But for Twain to write of a kind of comradeship between a slave and a young white boy was definitely progressive.Maybe Twain was hoping to reach a young generation raised by their bitter parents and discover that they could have friendships with blacks and not succumb to an entrenching separatist animosity that developed into the Jim Crow Era. Huck and Jim work together in schemes and have fun. This friendship (which is why Huck decides to do what he does on the journey) is what Twain emphasized in the journey down river. This was counter to the way whites were acting with and around blacks at the time (1880s).I think it's clear based on a certain reading of the novel that Twain believed whites and blacks could and should get along. While today it may not be seen as \\"progressive\\", it was when it was first published."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Everyone should read or re-read this classic. Most of us read it in school, probabaly not in its entirety. Schools struggled then and now with the use of the N word, although teenage boys in the 1830's clearly would never have heard a synonym.These adventures are a classic. The royals were a hoot, how many failed fraudulent enterprises could they invent before the inevitable tar and feathering. Huck and Jim are on the run from an abusive father and the law, respectively, and Twain shows all people have a great deal in common, in spite of theories prevalent in the antebellum era.I'm not sure why Tom Sawyer needs to show up to conclude this thing. The ending could work without him, maybe Twain not sure that Finn could carry the book or film alone."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Huckleberry Finn is a classic. Simple as that. It provides a look into what life was probably like for a 19th century boy. It was different than the life of children today, because today life centers around education. Back then, it was a regular thing to play hooky, even though they got in trouble for it when they were caught. And when they were punished, usually it was with a beating instead of \`You're Grounded!'.The book shows us how badly slaves were treated. They weren't even considered humans! It was like they didn't have feelings, and didn't see things the same way white people did. They way the slaves actually did think was odd. It was sad to see that they could slap a slave for no reason, and the slave would accept it either because they were used to it or they thought that whites were better than them.Huck Finn is rather unrealistic in the aspect of adventure. I'm guessing most boys back then didn't run off with an escaped slave to Cairo. The way that Mark Twain wrote the book was different than other first/second person books I've seen. The dialogue was very much like the 19th century southern Mississippi talk. Sometimes it got hard to decipher what a paragraph in slave-speak meant because it was so obscure.All in all, Mark Twain's writing style is different than the traditional Southern book, but that doesn't detract at all from the story. I liked it!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Wonderful book. Everybody should read it. Mark Twain is a genius.

Reading this book for the first time was a delight. Though I was thoroughly familiar with most of the story, I still found the book to be a page turner. The character of Huck, the manchild, has to be one of the most fascinating in all of literature."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was a great piece of satire, that is, all the parts I understood. This book is incredibly difficult to understand. For those of us that are literary scholars, feel free to purchase and dig away at the complex plot that at times seemed to go absolutely nowhere. Be prepared, because this story is not as fast paced and exciting as Tom Sawyer. Unlike Tom, this is an adult book that wrestles with themes of prejudice and severe elitism that plagued the antebellum south and was Mark Twain's response to the lynchings and other cruel acts committed against African Americans. So while it deals with serious issues concerning Americans even to this day, it contains half the excitement. If you're going to buy this book, devote every iota of your concentration power to it. The seemingly pointless tangents in the plot ultimately come back to enforce Twain's more important themes. The plot focuses on Huck's desire to escape civilization and eventually is accompanied by Jim, the runaway slave accused of murder. Jim has been the subject of intense controversy. I was completely turned off by his representation as a complete idiot who completely depended on his white master. Some may argue that it was in the best interest of the slave to appear ignorant so their masters would never grow suspicious of them. Yet considering that Twain once owned slaves and was a southerner himself, I have my doubts. I guess that's part of the enjoyment provided in the novel; we'll never be completely sure what Twain thought of blacks and social equality. Modern readers beware of the n-word, as it is used quite frequently. But also pay attention to the way Twain criticizes the south's complete support for slavery when in fact it was an institution that hurt the majority of southerners. I recommend the book, but devote a lot of time to it."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"All right, this is a rather subjective viewpoint. I could say, IN MY OPINION--but what's the purpose. Surely one of the best known and most readily acknowledged American classics, there is more to this book than all the tame discriptions and virulent hate mail imply. It is a rather bleak, desolate tail about two people running away from the world. The only problem is, they have no where to go. Let's ignore the so-called contoversy surrounding this book. It is idiotic, as nowhere in this book is it implied that the racist attitudes of some of the characters is a good thing. Twain was a master of dialect and speech patterns and this was, ultimately, a story about the evils of slavery and the hopelessness of many who tried to run away. Huck grows to truly love Jim. In the end, he is his only friend, the only person he trusts, the only person who has ever been good to him. Cherished characters like Tom Sawyer are distorted into manifest destiny oriented monsters, politicians of the day always trying to trick people and bend them into their will for a laugh or a selfish end. Yet Huck remains a conscientous person, seeing the evils of slavery, the cruelty of Tom's behavior, the ills of the world, the pointlessness of what his own life has thus far amounted to. A word can be used with many meanings. The controversy of this book, raging since its publication, is based solely on the USE of this word, not its context, not its implications within the narrative. This book is one of the most savage indictments of institutional racism one could ever hope to come across, yet people who refuse to read it out of fear of getting their feelings hurt or their political agendas ruffled, are missing out on this point. Twain suffered through this book. He set it aside for several years after a certain point, not knowing how to end it, getting more and more unhappy with the state of the Reconsruction. There is a rather bleak punch-line at the end of the book. Huck still wants to live his brief happiness w! ith Jim, run away again to escape society's expectations of how people are supposed to be. He thinks about &quot;light(ing) out for the territory ahead of the rest&quot;. Twain knew, by the time he wrote the book, the territory was no more, already plundered by the government and the corporate interests. Huck's next journey would be just as pointless, just as ultimately meaningless as this river ride down the Ole Miss."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I have probably read this book 10 times, but this time was different. i'm older and can easier appreciate the social commentary twain made than i could when i was a child.This book is a classic, and if you haven't read it, you should."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This novel is mainly based on a character named Tom Sawyer, who is living in St. Petersburg, after two decades before the Civil War. Tom's mother is dead and he lives with his Aunt Polly, whom Tom is very close with. Other famous characters in this novel are Becky, the girl Tom falls in love with and escapes with during their journey. The plot of the novel is based on Tom and Becky, who fall in love, become lost in McDougal's cave, and a thorough search of the cave is carried out, but the children cannot be found. At one point during, after they have been underground for three days. Tom finds an opening miles from the main entrance of the cave, and he and Becky make their way back to town. Two weeks later Tom is appalled to hear that Judge Thatcher who is one of the local judges in town, has had the mouth of the McDougal's cave sealed and later on in the novel they found Tom's good friend Joe, dead in the cave. The story ends with Tom later going back to the cave and recovering $12,000 worth of treasure. &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; is a great book, with a adventureous meaning behind it.

I think this book shows a friendship between a black slave and a white boy during a time when that was considered an unusual thing.This book takes place during a time when blacks were not treated equal. Blacks were thought of as property not as humans. An example of this takes place in the down town slave market.&#65533; Cheap niggers, get your cheap niggers,&#65533; a slave driver called out from on top of the stage. Families are being separated and children are crying while they are standing in shackles and cuffs. This is hatred.In this book, there is a lot of action. Every time you turn the page somebody is getting into trouble. It even goes as far as to put on a play to rip people off.&#65533; Come see the Play of Nonsense, the best in the world,&#65533; the duke yelled to the listeners. The duke and so called king are going to put on a play. Their idea is to rip people off and run with their money. It is a smart idea but later on they pay for it. The next night the play starts. Hundreds of people walk in and hand their money to the duke. Right when the play starts, the duke comes out and announces that there have been some misunderstandings and rushes off withthe money he collected from the audience. This book&#65533;s plot is awesome.In this story the main characters are laid back and have a great sense of humor. An example this happens when Huck and Jim, a runaway slave, are rafting down the huge river. Jim is in great danger, but they always have time to play tricks on other people.Also, there is a lot of dirty tricks and cheating. All four characters have a good sense of humor and a mind that is made to get into trouble. An example of this takes place when Huck fakes his own death and fools everybody while he lives on a raft for two years. He left his Aunt Polly behind to mourn about him and fooled everybody else. For a while he stayed on a little island but then decided to raft down a river. He made his own camps and caught his own food. All this to him was a fun vacation. He loved it!In conclusion, this book is awesome! My four beliefs are: there is a hatred toward blacks in this story; the plot is filled with all kinds of action; the characters are happy, laid back, and have a great humor; and there is a lot of bad trick playing and a whole bunch of cheating in this story. I think Twain was trying to show us an ideal example of friendship."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I am very happy with PlumCircle, LLC.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the companion piece to Mark Twain's classic Tom Sawyer. If you liked that book, you may like this one even better.It is filled with humor, adventure, and suspense. After being rescued from his abusive father, Tom and Huck take off on a rafting adventure down the mighty Mississippi. The book will keep you turning one satisfying page after the other until you reach the exciting end.As an author, I have been influenced by the humorous aspect of the writing of Mark Twain. While my outrageously funny novel, \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" is not a classic, this book surely is. Although it speaks of a lost time, it speaks to the indomitable spirit of the human experience.

It is the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Ernest Hemingway (and many others) called it the greatest American novel ever. Huck Finn picks up right where Tom Sawyer left off - Huck's abusive father appears to lay claim to Huck's fortune, so Huck fakes his own death and goes down the Mississippi River with Jim, the escaped slave.Much like Tom Sawyer, there's not a lot of plot going on here most of the time, and that's okay, because Twain's writing is extremely entertaining. Twain has a good old time mocking social conventions, and the novel is gripping almost all the way through. Hemingway was right: the end of Huck Finn is poor. After Jim is abducted and Tom Sawyer reappears, things just get silly, not to mention highly convenient (And Tom Sawyer here is just as immature as he ever was, reinforcing that no real maturation occurred in Tom Sawyer, and that that book really isn't a coming-of-age story in the truest sense).Twain has made Huck the narrator. On the whole, this works, although it gets tiresome to read Huck's dialect sometimes. Twain-as-narrator is definitely missed here. Nobody could write a clever sentence like Twain, and most of that is lost here, although occasionally Huck will turn one (and by doing so break character, but that's the price you pay).Huck Finn has been exceedingly controversial because of the extensive use of the n-word. So is the novel racist? Certainly the characters have the racism of the day ingrained in them - in that sense, it is racist. But more important to most people is whether Twain was racist; that is, whether he put his own personal racism in the book. That is harder to determine, especially since Twain has made Huck the narrator. Perhaps the fairest thing to say is that Twain was genuinely criticizing racism, but the way in which he portrayed Jim and the other characters contains some residual racism of its own.So is Huck Finn America's greatest novel? Well, maybe not.

They lived off very well without him; Huck went to school, learned to read and write and was overall happy. Then out of nowhere Huck's father returned and took Huck away. His father was a drunk and treated Huck very badly, and he had to get out. Huck faked his own death and was ready to leave his life behind in order to start over. He builds a canoe and paddled to the island on the other side of the river. There he found Jim a run away slave. They became friends and traveled up north to get a new life for Huck and freedom for Jim. Huck and Jim traveled at night on the raft and slept and hid during the day. Along the way they met up with frauds and learned many things good and bad from them. The frauds were convinced they were royalties, even though they know it wasn't true. After they stole a large amount of money from very good people Huck and Jim knew they should not associate them. They were final caught but then got away and met up with Jim and Huck down the river. From there to make some more money one of the frauds they took Jim and sold him back into slavery. Huck was furious because he had befriended Jim and saw him as a regular person, not as a slave. He went to the home where Jim was being held and had a plan for escape. While he was there Huck met up with an old friend of his Tom Sawyer. Together they came up with a plan to free Jim. Does this plan work for them? Or does it backfire in their faces? To find out read the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.This was a good book, it covered an abundant amount of topics that interest me. Some quotes that give the book a good feel as are follows, also these quotes gives you some sort of inside look to the book.\\"The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.\\" This was Huck talking about this first family.\\"It was a close place. I took . . . up [the letter I'd written to Miss Watson], and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself: \\"All right then, I'll go to hell\\"-and tore it up. It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.\\" This was Huck thinking about his friendship with Jim and whether he was doing the right thing or not.These quotes can give a feel for what the book is about and an idea if you would like some of the thing that are discussed in the book.I would recommend this book to a large group of different people. It contains a lot of material that will appeal to many different people making it easy for more people to enjoy it. It has everything from adventure, human suffering, family problems, to robbers and much more.

It was required of me to read this book for my AP English 11 class during the summer and I found it to be the most classic book ever written. I say this because it showed me the different events that young Huck experienced. Through his adventures, he was able to understand himself and where he belongs in world full of discrimination and prejudice. Mark Twain does an outstanding job in constructing the sequence of events in this book. The adventures that Huck encounters happens almost immediately after the preceding adventure. This type of plot allows the reader to stay interested in the feelings and trials that the characters had to endure. Mark Twain also related situatins that were currnet in his time and applied them to this book. After reading it, I saw how ignorant the people were and how they made such arbitrary decisions in there time. Overall, this book is highly recommendable.

It talks about the bad thing African-Americans went through. It thought me that it's ok to lie to protect a friend. You have to follow your heart because most of the time, your brains tells you what others want you to do, while your heart tells you want you want to do.

It's also a book that continues to be both entertaining and controversial (two qualities that not all &quot;classics&quot; have). I must admit: as much as I admire and am enriched by this novel, I also find its final chapters to be not wholly satisfying.Twain is brilliant in that the heroes of this book, set in the pre-Civil War American South, are two of the most marginalized members of that society: Huck, a poor white boy whose single parent is an abusive alcoholic father; and Jim, an escaped African-American slave. Their relationship is beautifully written; Twain's vision of an interracial friendship is a significant milestone in U.S. literature, and is comparable to such relationships in Cooper's &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; and Melville's &quot;Moby Dick.&quot; Twain depicts Jim as a master of African-American folk traditions.Twain evokes the vernacular speech of the American south; this literary technique has been continued by generations of U.S. writers, both black and white. Twain's merry riffs on Shakespeare are also worthy of note. I also continue to be fascinated by Twain's analysis of the twisted interrelationship among racism, institutional Christianity, and oppressive biblical interpretation.In my opinion, the novel's weak link is the plot material revolving around Huck's pal Tom Sawyer. Tom is a wonderful character, but his antics seem out of place in the structure of the narrative, and ultimately cheapen the arc of the story. Despite its problematic aspects, however, &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is one of the truly indispensable classics of the American canon. It is a crucial junction in a literary tapestry that immediately encompasses such works as &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,&quot; Alice Walker's &quot;The Color Purple,&quot; and many other great books. If you haven't yet read Huck Finn, put aside any preconceptions you might have and discover the book for yourself; if you've already read it, read it again."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a really interesting book about a boy and his adventures. The main character, Huck, narrates it. This gives it a certain amount of intimacy that it would not otherwise have. One of the things I found most interesting about this book is that Huck befriends a slave, Jim and helps him escape to freedom. This presents a large moral dilemma for him, because he does not want to be considered an abolitionist, but Jim is his friend. In the end he decides to help Jim and they raft down the Mississippi together. The description of their friendship is the best description I have ever read. Another aspect of the book that makes it all the more interesting to read is the colorful characters they meet along the way. Mark Twain has an incredible imagination and you then find yourself becoming attached to the characters as you move through the book. This is one of Mark Twain's greatest strengths. In the end I would recommend this book to readers of all ages because I think someone of any age could get something from it. Whether you read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn as a means of entertainment, to gain a life lesson, or to understand the social pressure associated with befriending a black man prior to the Civil War, you will definitely be able to gain something from reading this novel."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is about a teenage boy name, Huckleberry Finn.

School children from all over the world read this novel and write poignant essays on the evil of slavery. The various moral issues that influence the story are often ignored while the masses focus their energies on the well-known issue of slavery.I firmly believe that one cannot fully appreciate this novel without acknowledging how much child abuse influences this story. Huck wouldn't have been living with the Widow Douglas in the first place if his father were not an abusive alcoholic who neglected and abandoned his son. When Pap returned to \\"claim\\" his son, who he views as his property, the town doctor makes a half-hearted effort to protect Huck's fortune. However, none can stop Huck's father from kidnapping his son and dragging him to an abandoned cabin in the woods. Huck secretly enjoys not having to deal with the restrictive rules of society that he had to live by at the Widow's house. However, he soon tires of the ritualistic beatings that occur more and more frequently. Huck fakes his own death, and takes off to a small, uninhabited island. Jim, an escaped slave, and Huck travel on the Mississippi River and take turns protecting each other from the dangers of the world. Jim is eventually freed after narrowly avoiding death by a lynch mob. In all respects, Jim is more of Huck's father than Pap ever was.This story remains a classic novel that nearly all readers can relate to. Each generation has its own moral issues to address.

A MUST READ!Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain has done a spetacullar job creating the character of Huck Finn. Huckleberry Finn is developed into a wonderful character, and the book is full of many elements of high drama, starting with Huck's escape from his wicked father, and going on to a series of adventures with the runaway slave named Jim. Along the way, he meets an assortment of memorable characters, including a murderous feuding family and a couple of con men. He even gets to meet up again with his old friend, Tom Sawyer. All of these characters have a lesson to teach or a moral to show the reader. You won't realize it though, which is one of the main reasons the story still remains enjoyable.This book has a long history of being banned in schools because of its depiction of Jim, as well as the liberal use of the \\"n\\" word that will always make my skin crawl, to describe African Americans. However, reading of the book will quickly show you that the author had a deep rooted dislike for slavery and the treatment of African-Anericans during his lifetime. Why else would the character Jim keep his dignity throughout while the white men are shown as cruel and or foolish? The character of Jim also shows that he has a big heart and the reader cannot help but want his story to end well. Jim is only one of the characters that I mentioned earlier that will teach the reader without the reader being aware.I loved this book much to my surprise and found it very hard to put it down. If a person reads nothing else in life but one or two books, this should be one of them."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was a fun book to read. I liked the adventures he had with his friend Jim. I really liked the historical part of this novel. Since Jim was a runaway slave everything in the book changed. They both had to be carful not to be seen by anyone, so as not to be suspicious. I think that was my favorite part. I found it very hard for me to understand the dialect or language. Because of this it made it hard for me to get into the book. All in all I think this was a great book to read and give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain's seminal novel is a fine tale of high adventure, calamity, and profitable chatter. Gives you a good sense to recall your moments as a youngster, and jump right into a sense-making kids head.Huck Finn, abused by his pop and dog-tired of being \\"sivilized\\" by his Aunt, decides to pick his feet up and thrust out on the Mississippi for adventure. Faking his own death, to prevent his pop and other folk from giving him a good chasin', Huck hops aboard a raft and sets himself free.Jim, a slave Huck knows, takes to running from his owner. Eventually Huck and Jim decide to travel together (even though Huck suffers from pangs of conscience that explain that things like aiding a runaway slave are a clear path straight to hell) and head straight for Orleans--the place where Jim can claim his freedom, it not being a slave owning area.Along the way, Huck and Jim have a might good time finding heaps of adventure. This includes a Duke, not really a Duke at all, and a King, who is also not much of a real King, who are bonafide rapscallions set on defrauding the world of all of their possessions.All the while, Huck and Jim manage just fine, with an eventual ending that is happier than most.The book is as ironic as its author, and as subtly humorous and satirical of religion, 'society', being well-bred, and so on, as you could expect and hope for.Huck just can't understand what all the fuss is about with respect to things like religion, for instance. His view is that it wouldn't profit him to go to heaven anyway if folk like his Aunt were there to bother him. All the hoopla seems plain old misplaced.The contrast to this is Huck and Jim's devout belief in what the rest of us would consider naked superstition. All manner of things portend of bad luck in the novel. From touching a snakeskin to spilling salt to looking over your left shoulder at the moon, the whole lot of it is marked with the certainty of future ills.These superstitions seem to make a lot of sense to Huck who concludes that Jim must know quite a bit about such things. Each prophesy is, of course, fully revealed--being ambiguous enough to stick a cow through.\\"Bad luck\\" will be the consequence--of what sort and what kind they never say. Which is why such beliefs tend to last. Anything ambiguous enough can be read into, and confirmed.Thus being bit by a rattlesnake is what you get for touching a snakeskin. And having a hairy chest will certainly result in being wealthy--especially when wealth is defined broadly to cover both actual wealth, and relative wealth and, one supposes, emotional or spiritual wealth.Both Jim and Huck, however, hold it up as truth unconfounded and of the highest certainty. The comparison here to religion seems, in my eyes, to be somewhat obvious. The convictions of a Christian being compared to those of a superstitious and child-like lot.To Huck, the things that make a mountain of sense are a paradigm the rest of us easily sink into. The language, a crippled Southern dialect from back in the day, is addictive enough to irritate the people you are close to (just ask Ollivia, my girlfriend, what she thinks of my drawl and she'll tell ya she ain't glad about it one bit, I reckon).In conclusion, the book is a fine tale. A thread and yarn worthy of the praise and reputation heaped on it by others."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Huckleberry Finn is an American classic. I'm sure you have heard this a thousand times but I took it upon myself to find out the truth behind this statement. In my readings I found that the term classic was nearly an understatement. In this brilliant piece by Mark Twain you find young Huckleberry Finn and his Companion Jim being a little more then mischievous. They find their way traveling down the Mississippi by raft. They travel mostly by night, trying to avoid being caught. However they manage to find themselves in many troublesome situations.I really liked this book for a few reasons. One I feel like I can relate to Finn in my childhood, although I didn't have the family problems at home I was very adventurous and curious of the world around me. Second the way that Twain uses the interesting world view of Finn to tell the story makes it not only easy to follow but adds humor to the story at the same time.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventures, humor or just likes to read for that matter."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"If at some point in your life you haven't read this book then you must have come from another planet. I've personally read it as both a child, a teen & as an adult and it still has lost none of it's punch. The witty narration of Huck and Jim's adventures are truly a timeless tale. Twain is not only making fun of Huck and himself, but also the reader. After all, how many 12 year old boys in literature have captured the imaginations of so many worldwide over a span of more than one hundred years...? The charges by some libraries and school districts over the years of racism is itself ludicrous and narrow-minded. Twain is merely using the dialect and voice of his times rather than making harsh judgements about blacks. None of his other works come anywhere close to the scope and entertainment value of this one, but we as readers are fortunate to have it. Huck and Jim's journey down the mighty Mississippi river is no less than a metaphor for the journey of the U.S., it's changing culture, and it's indigenous people at large. T.A.O.H.F is especially fun as a summer read. The overall development of characters (and there are many here) also strikes me as exceptional. The beauty and lasting value of this work will surely last far into generations yet to come. More than being a simple work for the young, this book reaches out to the big kid in all of us."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I can honestly say that this was a great book. I strongly advise that if you are into adventurous books then you should give this book a try. Just the idea of running away from your old life to make a new one is so appealing to me. Sorry I'm getting ahead of myself here. You see Huck was living in a foster home, because his deadbeat dad abandoned him. I guess that you could say that it was a comfortable life, but it wasn't quite comfortable by Huck's standards (I think there was too much bathing involved). Then along comes his dad and suddenly he's living with him again. That wasn't very fun at all because Huck's father is a bit insane so Huck just up and leaves one day. He ends up traveling down the Mississippi. That's when the adventures start. He meets up with a couple of con artists, two feuding families, and travels the whole way with a runaway slave who becomes his best friend. Believe me this book is great stuff.

It's about a boy, \\"Huck\\" living in the deep south in the 1800's during the time of slavery. Huck does not fit into the life that is aunt or father or anyone else imagines for him. Instead, he lives a life based upon his everyday adventures. During some parts of this book, I was so excited, I couldn't put it down. During some other parts, I just wanted to fall asleep. The slow parts do pass by quickly and the book is worth your time.

If you want a wonderful book to read then pick up Mark Twain's Huckelberry Finn."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain is one of the world's greatest literary figures. He's taken the simple story of a young man and a runaway slave escaping their respective lives for greener pastures and has turned it into a tale of adventure, humor, and social commentary. This story has been argued over from the first day that it was published. Of course, today most people who attack or criticize this book focus on the use of the word \\"nigger\\" throughout the book. If these people could actually get beyond their own hypocrisy, they would see that Twain takes Huck out of an abusive atmosphere with his drunken, no-good father, and places him into the loving hands of one of the most caring characters in literary history, ol' Jim.Jim essentially becomes a father to Huck Finn. He loves the boy with all of his heart and often mentions to him that he can't get over the fact that Huck is trying to help him get to freedom. Sure, Jim might be rather superstitious and not the most intelligent of men, but it's in his heart where his true strength lies. Keep in mind that Jim is a runaway slave in this story. Slaves weren't given much time to read, write, socialize, or do pretty much anything to further their intelligence along, so it should be understood that Jim isn't a very intelligent man as far as booksmarts go. However, Jim knows his way around the river and uses his common sense to try and make Huck do the right thing.Huck refers to Jim as \\"nigger\\" throughout the story, as well as all of the other slaves in the book. Remember that this story takes place in a time when that particular word was used to address blacks. Does that make the word okay to use? No, but it was the word used in Huck's time. Get beyond that word, and you'll see that Huck loves Jim perhaps more than anyone else in the world. Jim is Huck's friend and mentor and either of them would die for the other. Ironically, rappers and hip-hop performers of today use the \\"n\\" word almost as a badge of honor at once and then as a derogatory term, whereas Huck simply called Jim that word because that's what he was raised to believe.Few books have caused so much controversy as \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\\" but the book itself isn't controversial, it's the idiots who can't look beyond their own noses who've made it what it is today, and I have to thank them for it. Why? Because as soon as you label something wrong or forbidden, human nature makes a person want that something even more. Tell a teen that they can't have beer if you don't believe me. Please \\"enlightened\\" individuals, keep banning books like \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\\" films like \\"Song of the South\\" and the Bible, you're only destroying your own cause."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Since the first day that \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" was published, it has been denounced with racial controversies. When released to the public, it was banned by different committees, stating the book to be racist and rude.The way Twain uses the racial term \\"nigger\\" in Huckleberry Finn, is read with offense to some people. In my opinion, reading the story with terms offensive like \\"nigger\\", made the book more realistic. The book is supposed to make people feel as if they are experiencing the times of Hucklebeerry Finn.In chapter 34, the quote \\"Tom told me what his plan was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it\\", implies that Tom still sees Jim's worth as less than his own. When Huck accepts Tom's plan, it surprised me and made me realize that even though Huck beliefs have matured, he still has alot to learn about racial equalities.I vigorously support Mark Twain for the message he was trying to communicate to his readers, through the book \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\"."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been argued as a racial controversy since the first day it was published. Shortly after it was accessible to the public, multiple committees banned the book, proclaiming it to be racist and \\"trash\\". To this day, Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is banned in several school districts.In my personal copy of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, there is a helpful and informative introduction and notes throughout the text written by Robert O'Meally. He clearly states that the intent of Twain's word usage is needed in order to properly and vividly describe the setting and tone of the book. His usage of the racial slur \\"nigger\\" can be seen as offensive, but I believe it was necessary for it to be realistic. The dialogue that Huckleberry uses throughout the book stays very true to his character, time, and place, at which the slur was used casually.Besides the usage of the word \\"nigger\\", characters in the book often loudly express their racist mentality. In the begining of Chapter 14, Huck and Jim are talking about all sorts of topics, both of them speaking their mind. Twain describes Huck's thoughts: \\"Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head, for a nigger.\\" Obviously some would perceive this to be intolerable and crude, yet I believe that Twain is simply describing the way Huck thinks of Jim. The growing friendship between Huck and Jim is the basis of the entire novel. The book depicts the way Huck feels and thinks about several ideas and concepts about life, the way he feels about his friend must be present and elaborate.I strongly support Mark Twain's the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The book wins people over with it 's dialogue, plot, originality, and capability to express a realistic story that takes place in a racist and unjust America."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a wonderful novel that is adventurous, humorous, and fun. The characters are believeable (one reason why is that Mark Twain writes in the character's dialects). The book really transports the reader into a differant time period.The story revolves around Huck Finn. Huck is an easy going young teenager who is the son of a town drunkard. He recently made a large fortune. Because of this Huck is confined by schooling, shoes, and ,worst of all, manners. Huck had enough of this so he runs away. His small town assumes that he is dead, so he enjoy's the life on Jackson's island. When Jim, an escaped slave, runs away to the island. Huck decides to go down the Mississippi River.Going down the river, Huck interacts with a variety of people, small towns, and adventures. The story is outrageous, but it doesn't matter. Huck more then makes up for it in his view of the world.I would recommend this to most people because it is a very easy read and is entertaining."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"What can you say? Yes, it's a classic. Twain in his introduction says it best, (paraphrasing) anyone attempting to find rhyme, reason, or a moral to this story will be shot. Well, two out of three ain't bad. The story hopscotches through a series of sharply drawn minis and vividly realized characters. The moral - Huck coming to accept the slave Jim's humanity and protecting him against his socially conditioned \\"better judgement\\" - is blunted by a meandering and needlessly cruel plot to \\"save\\" Jim concocted by Tom Sawyer toward the end of the novel.But how fresh and envigorating this novel must have been when it appeared, a truly American voice expressed for the first time. In true American fashion, it's style became much copied, softened, and cheapened over time (think The Andy Griffith Show some 90 years later) that it's easy to overlook how remarkable achievement it was. As a reslt, Twain is no longer a caricature for me.Jaklak sez check it out."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read Huck many years after I read Tom Sawyer. Mark Twain writes about Huck who was Tom's best friend. Here there is not too much mention of TOm though. Huck is the main character in the book. I truly enjoyed the book even though it was not as great as Tom Sawyer. Gave it a four star and its worth it."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"By reading this book, I understand that Mark Twain was not a racist. He tells the truth about what was going on a long time ago during the time of slavery. This book is anti-slavery because if you really understand Twain's point of view, he wrote this book so that many people would accept each other as equal. The young boy in the book did the unthinkable by becoming a friend with a poor slave. In the book only two people were innocent and the majority of them were lynchers, robbers, murderers,and thieves. Huck and Jim have a great sense of human diginity and sympathy. They fight for their freedom and finally got out of the mess that they were in.This book is one of the American masterpieces. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain's tale is timless. As a friend remarked, Huckleberry Finn is all things good. Tom Sawyer could grow up to be Donald Trump. John Seelye's introduction is insufferable. If Twain had been exposed to it, Seelye would have joined his hate list. Without the introduction, The book would have received the five stars it deserves."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I had previously only read this novel in a translated version (Norwegian), and after reading it in \\"proper English\\" I am quite amazed about what gets lost in translation... Among the major strengths of this adventure tale is its language, which, I must admit, also made it quite strenuous to read at times. I often had to read out loud various passages in order to understand them. In retrospect, just for this very reason, this might have been a good book to listen to on tape to fully appreciate the proper pronounciations.This classic coming-of-age story is quite good, and the characters stay with you long after the book is finished. I especially enjoyed all the delightful superstitions that Twain weaves into his characters - among the black folks as well as the white. Also, the tender relationship between Huck and Jim is delightful reading.As a sidenote, the version I was reading did not have a map and I quickly came to miss the ability to visualize the locations that were described along the Mississippi. I eventually found a different copy of the book (an abridged version, nonetheless - ugh!) which had a map that clearly showed all the action. Afterwards, I had a much better appreciation for the geographical nuances...I am glad this is a required high school text - its themes are still highly relevant, and it has the potential to start great debates about race relations - then as well as now. I almost wish that I could have read it as part of a class. This is the kind of literature (kind of like Shakespeare) that I would be able to appreciate even more if I could pause at regular intervals with some class-room discussion. However, even if you are battling it alone, it is well worth the effort.Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The classic novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, portrays the character of Huck as the average American. He wants to have adventure, live his life to the fullest, and can't seem to stay in one place for too long. The strong ties of family that are shown in the people Huck encounters on his journey and are reflective of the American way of life as well. Along the way in his adventures he comes into contact with a runaway slave, Jim. Huck goes through moral struggles in this book, but decides that Jim is his good friend and that he can't turn him in. The power of friendship and the desire to be on his own propel Huck through his adventures along the Mississippi and he proves to himself that he just can't seem to be \\"sivilized.\\" This novel brings out the adventurer in all of us and proves that Americans just can't be held down without seeing what's out there in the great wild frontiers of our lives."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"If you haven't read Huck Finn in decades (possibly when it was assigned to you in junior high), pick it up again and be amazed. (If you've never read it before, pick it up and be thunderstruck.) Hemingway wasn't wrong when he said that all American literature came from this book. It was the first novel that truly captured one strain of American vernacular (actually, several), and the character of Huck is so quinetssentially American that you're bound to recognize all sorts of American literary first-person characters who have directly followed (Holden Caulfield and Augie March, just to name two). Forget the PC issue -- when you read fiction, judge words in their contexts, not by their politics beyond the page. If you're too young to do that, perhaps you're not ready for it anyway. I was force-fed Huck Finn at 14 and remembered it with only bitterness until I picked it up in my 30s and was amazed (see first sentence)."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Want a book with an adventurous twist? Then Huckleberry Finn is the book for you. Not only is Huckleberry Finn an adventurous book, it is also can be comical and light, though the book has a grave meaning, showing the wrongs in society at the time in the late 19th century.The book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer precedes Huckleberry Finn, where in the beginning of Huckleberry Finn, Huck lives with the widow Douglas, though doesn't like the high class living, and frequently leaves to see his father, who's always drunk, or just hangs out in the woods. While in the woods, Huck meets Jim, a slave who escaped and needs to cross the Mississippi River to the freedom on the other side, in Illinois. Although this book portrays a serious meaning, it can also be funny and witty.I liked this book because it was witty and comical, though it had an important message at the same time.

A must read for any one looking for a fun read"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was one of the best books that I have read in a long time. The way the Huck lives his life is very interesting in ways that I can relate. Whether Huck is sneaking out of the house or talking to his best friends about big plans they have, it all makes sense to me. Mark Twain did an excelent job with all the characters and how they all have different problems at home or with some of their friends. He also shined in this book when he came up with all the ideas for the kids to get in trouble with, like starting a gang or running away and taking off down the river and getting caught up with con artists. In my opinion the best part of the book is right off the start when the Widow adopts Huck and tries to clean him up and get him to study and learn new things, and huck wants absolutely nothing to do with any of it. Then right when Huck gets to the point of losing it, he runs off until Tom tells him to come back so they can start their new robbery gang, which meant that Huck must return. When Huck returns the Widow Douglass' sister Miss Watson is living their now with Huck and the widow and the head servant Jim. Overall, I would have to say the this book was very well written and explained and I would have to give this book 4 out of 5 possible stars for my grade.

It is also classic American Literature. The story is about a boy named Huck, whose father is a drunk. Huck lives with a lady who wants to &#65533;sivilize him.&#65533; Eventually, his own father kidnaps him. He then escapes and joins up with Jim, a slave who escaped from Miss Watson. Jim did this after overhearing talk about him being sold. As Jim and Huck take on their journey and float down the river, they have many adventures. Huck, who did not want to help Jim escape at first, slowly realizes that slaves are people. Mark Twain jokes a lot and has funny sequences. This happens a lot during Huck&#65533;s faked death, and also when Huck and Jim cross-dress.Huck impersonates Tom and Tom impersonates Sid. Huck and Jim rescue each other a lot of times through out the story. This book has many plot twists to keep the reader busy while reading this adventure. The word \\"nigger\\" was just a way for Twain to make Jim&#65533;s world come to life. Some people think the usage of this word is crude and racist, but it is requirement while reading this book. It is also used to find out why this book is against slavery so much. Mark Twain also gave each character their own style of speech to fit their individuality and intelligence. Twain uses this voyage of Jim and Huck to emphasize some of his themes and morals that he wanted to teach the readers. Such morals are that of racism and slavery when Huck turns on Jim. Huck lies and cons, which is shown through the characters of Duke and Dauphin. You are sure to like this book if you like pre-civil war era books."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the classic pre-Civil War tale of a young boy, Huck, and a runaway African-American slave named Jim. Huck leaves because of his abusive father, and Jim has escaped his owner to become a free man in the North. On their raft, swiftly traveling down the Mighty Mississippi, Huck and Jim come across many southern towns along the river, bringing them to meet many interesting characters, and many adventures.In this book, many southern dialects are used, and although it may be difficult to read at times, the overall effect created by it makes the story more lifelike. Being pre-Civil War, some of the language is outdated, and it may be difficult to read over some of the terms and ideas used and expressed, but the only reason for their use is to show Mark Twain's overall motive of the book that proves the negative effects of slavery in the United States.If you liked The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, you'll love this book, because of their similarities in background, and the fact that they share the same main characters. Both books are Twain's masterpieces, and should both be read by all generations, young, old, and still to come."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Despite the fact that The Adventure of Huckleberry Finn has been the subject of conflict and controversy since its publication over a century ago, it has remained a favorite for a wide range of audiences. Between the rollicking humor and a series of outrageously unexpected adventures, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn could be categorized as a Dennis the Menace style epic. Mark Twain uses local dialects and detailed descriptions to recreate each of Huck's extraordinary experiences. However, beneath the quaint language and good humor that characterize small town life in antebellum Mississippi, Mark Twain reveals the horrors of the slave trade. The book has been banned in a number of schools and libraries on account of Twain's straightforward treatment of such a delicate topic. Huck's growth and development throughout the novel lead him to reject the culturally predominant attitude toward slaves and he eventually embraces Jim not only as person but also as a friend. Though the words Twain uses to refer to slaves are offensive, his portrayal of the deepening relationship between Huck and Jim is a harsh critique of the attitudes and practices of the slaveholding class. Whether it is read as a purely entertaining tale of juvenile mischief or a biting criticism of slavery, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will continue to excite and inspire audiences for decades to come."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I would recommend this book to 15 year olds and up or if you have a good vocabulary. This is a spectacular book. This book kept me in suspense almost the whole book. This book teaches you about slavery. They have a lot of people that think African-Americans should be slaves. It is an adventurous book that takes you along the Mississippi &amp; The Ohio River before the civil war. I liked the book, because most the time when I start a book I get bored with it then I don't finish it. I really recommend that teachers have this book for there students and parents have there children read this book, I hope people wont ever be prejudice."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"With this novel Mark Twain confidently changed the way Americans read as well as viewed literature. Through the careful construction of the two main characters Huck and Jim, Twain explores the questionable moral values and hypocrisy of society. Against all odds Huck and Jim form an honest relationship that rises above race, slavery, and southern society. Twain's story is told through the voice of boy who has not yet been \\"sivilized\\" by society, and is still able to live outside of convention. This novel combines the strong language that Twain has been remembered for, and a message that is as relevant today as it was in the early nineteen hundreds. As a college student who has read this book in middle scool, high school, and college, I can say that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was written for all ages and is an important and necessary educational tool."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"As you might have already known, &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; is one of Mark Twain's classics. It was written based on Mark Twain's best friend when he was a child. I have written a review on it because I think this book should not be forgotten.Huckleberry Finn is only fourteen when he runs away from his brutal father........Yet another one of Mark Twain's classics, Huckleberry Finn amazed me with its plot. On the previous book about Tom Sawyer, comes Huckleberry Finn; Tom's best friend.Young Huckleberry Finn was adopted by a widow and all was going quite well until the footsteps Huck saw on the snow...... The footsteps on the snow were in the way that his father always leaves behind. So, this means that Huck's cruel father has come back! The six thousand dollars Tom and Huck found in the previous book was safe in the bank but not anymore. Now that Huck's father is back, he wouldn't leave until he got the money.Huck's father has tried many ways to get Huck's money but fails every time. Soon, Huck's father captures Huck and locks him inside a wooden cabin in the woods. Huck's father now wanted both his son and his money.....Luckily, before long Huck plans an outstanding escape to Jackson Island and meets up with an old runaway slave; Jim. There, the two starts an amazing trip down the great Mississippi river. They're destination is freedom, Cairo; where Jim could be free. Unfortunately, while traveling on the river both of them meets many strangers and must outwit them to stay uncaught and alive.This book is highly recommended for those who thirst for excitement, action and adventures. The plot in this story is indescribable; it's full of breath-taking adventures and the way that Mark Twain could describe the feelings of a child is unbelievable.This book would be a perfect book back in the days Mark Twain wrote it; however, the slang in this book might be hard to follow for people nowadays. Even though that the slang he used might confuse us, the writing in this book is still excellent and would be recommended.Even though that I judge this a good book, I do feel that once in a while the book would suddenly skip from one adventure to the other. Overall, I do think that this book is worth reading and I would give this book; five &quot;Stars&quot;. (See the rating chart below for more details)If you compare Mark Twain's previous book; Tom Sawyer with Huckleberry Finn, I would say that Huckleberry Finn contains much more action, adventure and excitement. However, if you like more of psychology and more of a calmer plot, Tom Sawyer would be a better book for you. However, my final recommendation would be for you to read Huckleberry Finn as it is fit for the whole family to read and enjoy.If you have already read this book and liked it, I would also recommend you readingThe author of this book, Mark Twain was a famous writer and had many other jobs as well. Mark Twain was a very superstitious person since that he was born on the day that Halley's Comet was passing the earth and died when it returned. Mark Twain's actual name was Samuel Lang-Horne Clemens, he was born and raised in the state of Missouri. His father died when he was only twelve and so he left school to earn a living. He traveled around America as a journeyman printer. Later, Samuel went back to the Mississippi river to be a steamboat pilot. During the Civil War, steam boating was put to an end forcing Samuel to join the Confederate army. However, he soon extracted himself from it and became an extremely successful journalist.He was sent to the Mediterranean to do a series of articles after the war. This inspired him to be a writer and so he started to write books about his childhood which made him a fortune."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This particular edition does not claim to be abridged, but in relation to the audiobook version available on Audible.Com, there is at least one &quot;adventure&quot; (story) missing from this edition of which I'm aware.

It was a bit long for them really, especially the younger one. And yet it is a very engaging novel that had them periodically laughing, or breathless with their eyes popping out. It is at times a bit grim, and at times a bit farcical. It's also pretty hard to read aloud with all those accents and voices. But it is above all a story of resourcefulness, of conscience and of survival. And, of course, it is sufficiently exotic in time and place for modern Australians, as we are, to add an extra dimension to the enjoyment.If you plan to read it to your children, allow yourself plenty of time, be prepared to pause and discuss some of the issues (such as slavery, which we no longer tolerate and yet it was not necessarily the worst of outcomes for some people). You will enjoy it I am sure (and, yes, we had read Tom Sawyer earlier although that isn't necessary)"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I felt that this was generaly a good novel. I really enjoyed the life of huck fin. He is a very creative charctor and very inteligent. I like how he has the ability to set up a life, not be fully satisfied with it and decide to just run away and leave every thing behind.Not only is Huckleberry Finn an adventurous book, it also can be comical and light, though the book has a grave meaning, showing the wrongs in society at the time in the late 19th century. This book was also very good at showing you what life was like at the time. It shows how life was much simpler then.On a negative side i did not like how the book focused so much on racism. I do not reading about it and i would say that it strongly influinces this book. It does provide some good moral value on the subject though.Huck gets a lot done in the short period of time that the book is baised on. Huck is adopted by the well-intentioned but way too overprotective Widow Douglas(needless to say, Huck is none too pleased with the widow's attempts to turn him into an upstanding citizen). Because of this he runs away and soon after finds himself living with his abusive fauther. He enjoys this at first but eventully decides that the abuse is enough. So again he runs away and this is where he meets jim. Jim is a runaway slave and togeather as outcasts they become best friends.I would definitly reccomend this book to any age level.

Twain's imagery puts the reader right beside Huck while he escapes &#65533;sivilization&#65533; and floats down the Mississippi river with his slave-gone-fugitive friend Jim. Huck&#65533;s innocent outlook on the world is both humorous and adorable. Huck&#65533;s respect for Jim is admirable. Even though Huck was brought up with Jim being a inferior slave, he still looks up to Jim. Also, I think that although Jim&#65533;s dialect adds to the effectiveness of the book, it is very difficult to understand. I think Twain writes it a little too much how the dialect sounds. I would recommend this book to anyone. It offers plenty of excitement and surprises."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"It seems that everybody's initial reaction after reading Huck Finn is to debate if Twain was a racist or not. It's a pity because such a debate takes away from the greatness of the book. Was he a racist? I don't know, I never met the man. History and his own writing would seem to support that he was. Do I think any less of him, despite my opinion that he might have been racist? Not in the least. His racism was born out of a time when racism was the norm and rooted more in fear and culture rather than hate. Perhaps ignorance would be a better term, but I dare not call this man ignorant. I really don't think he was a mean hearted man, but being nice doesn't exclude one for being a racist. Read the book, you may form a different opinion."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Hello Fellow Readers!!!You should read Huckleberry Finn if you enjoy excitement, adventure, fun, and reading!

Jim and Huck haves lots of fun.It's really exciting for the younger generation due to how they are just boys and they have these great adventures. The writing is a bit hard to get used to due to how phentic everything is.

If you like books, you'll like this one.-Stevey"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a great book to read. It contains good literal context of what is happening around the late 1880's, which was around the time the book was published. At that time, slavery was not completely abolished and the author, Mark Twain had made a great illustration by having to hide Jim, who was a slave, when he and Huck were on their adventure. Where they had travel through the heart of America. Mark Twain also makes good little adventures that Jim and Huck run into. They go through the story going from one adventure after another, in the same time they also learn to bond as friends depsite the color of their skin. This is interesting for readers because it was rare to see blacks and whites talk to one another or let alone to even do things together. Though this book uses a derogatory word for African American, I do not find this inappropriate because during the time this book was written, this word was how people looked at African Americans. Mark Twain seems to display the social injustices that were happening America, and instead of following them he turned them around and made the bad seem good. I would recommend this book because a lot of children and maybe even adults could learn how life was like in the past and how there were social injustices. It can also show the meaning of how people can bond, regardless of his or her race, sex, or age. I think highly of this book even though it used to be banned in educational systems because of it's context and I think that this is one of the best books I have read in my life."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I think that this book is exciting but is too long. This story had very rounded off characters that you could understand.

Mark Twain was a wonderful story teller and a true attribute to American literature. What more can be said about this book that hasn't already been said? Everyone must read this American classic!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Those who would accuse Huck Finn of the atrocity of racism have probably never read this book. Yes, I am white, but the story is set up in such a way as to make Jim, the slave who is repeatedly referred to by that most forbidden of words, the most honorable and reasonable character in the book.The story follows Huck Finn, a rebellious eleven-year-old boy without a mother and with a drunken crook for a father, as he decides to run away when his drunken father returns to town after a long absence and takes Huck back home with him. As Huck runs away, he meets up with Jim, a slave owned by his best friend Tom's aunt, who has also chosen to run away, heading north and seeking a better life. As they make their way down the Mississippi River, they meet a great deal of colorful characters and, most importantly, Huck grows as a person. He and Jim develop a deep, meaningful friendship, and Huck comes to realize that Jim is a man, no matter what the color of his skin is.The book is hilarious and wildly entertaining, but is also tender and sweet. Mark Twain was truly a master author, and it is easy to see why this has been called The Great American Novel. The book never drags or fails to hold your attention. I would suggest that any child younger than thirteen or so would be talked to about the \\"N-word\\" before reading it, but I certainly do not feel that it should be yanked from their hands and forbidden. The book has far too much value to sit on a bookshelf and not be read. A simple explanation that this word was a part of the vernacular at the time the book was written but is now no longer acceptable and that only hateful people use it seems like it would suffice.Don't let this book drown in the controversy that it attracts. It is far too valuable a piece of literature to get lost in the shuffle."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This was the first classic I read. Wow, have I come a long way!!!!! Adventure is the most obvious theme of this novel, which in return leads to self-discovery. Hucks average day consists of danger, trouble, and a few screams but never intentionally only because his natural boyish interest always seems to lead him to dirty water. With trials and tribulations, something Huck finds plenty of on his great journey, comes growth. At the end of the novel, Huck goes from overlooked to the looked up to kid. All kids, and kids at heart should read this novel."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"gret novel awesome thing I love this story caus eit was free never finished it though never read the first page actually"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"If you're looking for a mindless tale of silly adventures and mistakes, this book is for you.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is one of those books. Mark Twain is an entertaining part of American history.Most people who have been raised in America know at least Huck Finn's name. He is known for his escapades in early America and his friendship with the well-known Tom Sawyer. If you haven't read the book, you've seen the movie. That might be a bad thing.How can that be bad? Because if you only watch the movies and then years later read the book, you'll be very disappointed in what you read.The movies are so different than the book is. Yes, there are many movies, but the majority veer far from Twain's original works.It also doesn't help that I am mostly used to contemporary writing which is much different that of the writings of the 1800s and earlier. The works are more description of scenes and actions than we are used to today. The style is vastly different. In fact, you might it difficult to read because of that.You might also find it difficult to read where the dialogue is written exactly the way it was spoken. When the slave, Jim, speaks, it is not in formal English. It is written as he spoke it. In reading these parts, you might want to read it aloud so you can hear what he said instead of reading it.I also found reading of Huck and Tom's actions rather difficult. I don't see boys of their age really acting that way, but that is how Twain wanted them to be. I really think the movies ruined it for me. Though I still enjoy Twain's short stories. Maybe that is where I need to stay with him.Please be aware if you have your children read the book for school. Throughout the book, the \`n' word is used. It was a part of the culture's everyday language which makes it important to use in the story. You might want to explain the use of the word then versus now before reading the book.Note: This was a free copy obtained through a public domain venue."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I remember the first time i had read this classic novel by the one and only Mark Twain...

Huck one day finds his care takers slave Jim hiding out in the woods planning his escape, so him and Huck and Jim travel down river to help Jim escape his captivity. While traveling they had many and hardships, dealing with con-men, rednecks, heavy fogs, big ships, and dressing up like a girl, typical day down in Missouri.This book is in a more classic American literature novel genre. One thing I can say is that it is accurate to that time. The characters true to their own culture. The N word is used through out so I'm pretty sure the dialog was also accurate. There were a lot of things that happen yet I was still pretty bored reading it. It was slow and when it did pick up not much happen.So even though this book is an American classic I would have to say I didn't like it much. I would give this book a 3 out of five rating and I would recommend it to people who like American history and adventure books, but besides that I wouldn't read it again.Tim W"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Any story that makes us all think about what it's like to be a lost little kid trying to make friends and find a home in an incredibly dangerous, deceitful, treacherous world has my full support.

There are many things about this book that will make it stand out in your head more than any other book. This is a very adventurous book that will keep you reading. This book will amaze you in many ways. This book is wonderful, but hard to read. If you like books with easy words that you can read quickly, then I do not recommend this for you. This book is hard to read because of their southern dialect and bad grammar. This book is very hard to read. If you can get used to thye language, then you will do fine with this book. It is a very adventurous book. There is always something crazy going on, which makes it a lot more exiting and fun to read. Not only is the whole theme and plot and characters wonderful, but there is also a great authors style. Mark Twain did an excellent job of first of all capturing the setting of a hundred years ago in the South, by making sure you got the feel and image in your mind of where this takes place. He also writes from Huckleberry Finns prospective, and does a wonderful job on trying to really become that character, and you can tell in the things he writes. Mark Twain is an awesome writer and makes it half the reason it is so good. If you enjoy books with much adventure then read &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;.

However, that's not saying much since Twain is one of the most overrated authors of all time. Anyway, the story is good and the friendship between Jim and Huck is very interesting.

All American writing comes from that. There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since.&#65533; When I first read this on the back of my book, I thought to myself, yeah right, this book is going to be the biggest snore fest, and that I&#65533;d be needing a dictionary to get through it. However, once I got into it, Ernest proved me wrong. I found the novel to be filled with just the right touch of humor that offered perspective into what life used to be like. I also felt that this novel was also a bit controversial with its dealing with such topics as racism, slavery, cruelty and injustice. Twain then balanced the controversy with the perfect dosages of friendship and loyalty. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a timeless classic, everyone should read this novel if given the opportunity."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a novel written for enjoyment, the adventures that Huck has are somewhat comical and enjoyable for everyone. There is also a more serious side to the novel where Twain uses Huck to learn the evils of society that the story takes place in. Through Huck, Twain tells his opinion of slavery and shares his own moral values. Because this is a realistic book, Twain can convey his thoughts and morals to readers of every level, not just highly educated scholars. Using realism, Twain lets people know how he thinks and shows that people can change. Realism is utilized to allow all people to be able to relate and understand what is going on in the novel. I believe everyone at one point in their life should read this novel."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the classic pre-Civil War tale of a young boy, Huck, and a runaway African-American slave named Jim. Huck leaves because of his abusive father, and Jim has escaped his owner to become a free man in the North. On their raft, swiftly traveling down the Mighty Mississippi, Huck and Jim come across many southern towns along the river, bringing them to meet many interesting characters, and many adventures.In this book, many southern dialects are used, and although it may be difficult to read at times, the overall effect created by it makes the story more lifelike. Being pre-Civil War, some of the language is outdated, and it may be difficult to read over some of the terms and ideas used and expressed, but the only reason for their use is to show Mark Twain's overall motive of the book that proves the negative effects of slavery in the United States.If you liked The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, you'll love this book, because of their similarities in background, and the fact that they share the same main characters. Both books are Twain's masterpieces, and should both be read by all generations, young, old, and still to come."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn is darker and more serious than Tom Sawyer, and also, I think, better. Many people, after reading Tom Sawyer, seem to think of Huck as Tom's little sidekick. This book shows that Huck is very much his own man. After hanging around on the streets for most of his life, Huck is adopted by the well-intentioned but way too overprotective Widow Douglas(needless to say, Huck is none too pleased with the widow's attempts to turn him into an upstanding citizen). Eventually, Huck is kidnapped by his own father, a drunk and negligent man. Huck escapes and joins up with Jim, a slave who escaped after overhearing that his owners were planning to sell him.As Jim and Huck float down the river, they have many adventures. Huck, who at first was very much against aiding Jim's escape, slowly comes to realize that slaves are people.Huck's comments about how Jim seems to be just like him or any other white person are not dumb or rascist, they are part of Huck's relearning, and breaking of the stereotypes he has grown up with.That is not to say this book is only an exploration of serious matters. It has Mark Twain's usual jokes and funny sequences, during which Huck fakes his own death, Huck and Jim cross-dress,Huck impersonates Tom and Tom impersonates Sid, and Huck and Jim rescue each other many, many times and become friends, something that Huck didn't think was possible."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Civilry\\"The Old Southern Code\\"Organized SocietyAnd ReligionAll of these are cast down and demolished by America's greatest humorist ever Mark Twain. This book primarily follows the adventures of one Huckleverry Finn as he escapes his home, his father and reality on a raft floating down the Mississippi River. On these journeys he is in the company of Jim, a house slave who at first appears to be an ignorent slave. Then we find out that this guy has a wife and a family and that he also has his own personal demons to settle just like Huck. Jim can sometimes be a bit steriotypical but even that serves its purpose in the end. In the process they discover things about each other, Jim discovers that not all white people are bad, Huck discoverers that Black people aren't stupid and savage as has been taught to him since birth. This book is a perfect example of society(and Twain in particular) triyng to come to terms with himself in the latter half of the 19th century. All this is done in the vernacular and with great humor. It is a great bookNow, this book has taken a lot of heat over the last few years for a few words that some people have deemed offensive. Well yes I agree that the word is very offensive when taken in a negative contex, however that is not what Twain wanted to exhibit. Do not draw the conclusion that since the word is in the book that automatically makes Twain a racist. If you do your research you will see that Twain was probably the most non-racist person of his era. He only included the word because he wanted hwat people would have said to be as accurate as possible. This book should not be taken off of selves just because that one word of because of the way a certain character is portrayedOverall-Great book, the only thing I never liked was the last chapter, I mean what the heck?

The novel is set in the pre-civil war era of the south. Through the eyes of main character, Huck, the reader is able to see how Twain is satirizing this society. Characters such as Pa demonstrate the ignorant \\"white trash\\" in the society, and the widows Douglas and Stevens are examples of the Christian women in the society. Through Huck's thoughts, the reader is able to find the irony that Huck the \\"uncivilized\\" character in the book, may have the most civilized attitude and ideas of all the characters in the story. Twain uses Huck's friendship with Jim, the runaway slave, to deal with the issue of slavery and suggest that slavery is wrong. Twain's strong take on issues in the story are evident and create a powerful novel told in an innocent manner through the eyes of a boy."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"When I read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain in high school, it was possibly the first book I enjoyed that was assigned by a teacher. Twain's imagery puts the reader right beside Huck while he escapes &#65533;sivilization&#65533; and floats down the Mississippi river with his slave-gone-fugitive friend Jim. Huck&#65533;s innocent outlook on the world is both humorous and adorable. Huck&#65533;s respect for Jim is admirable. Even though Huck was brought up with Jim being a inferior slave, he still looks up to Jim. Also, I think that although Jim&#65533;s dialect adds to the effectiveness of the book, it is very difficult to understand. I think Twain writes it a little too much how the dialect sounds. I would recommend this book to anyone. It offers plenty of excitement and surprises."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"As a child I always dreamed of going on adventures to new places. In some ways these dreams were realized while reading this book. I was swept into Huck's life and became a part of his adventures throughout the story. For such a young boy, Huck has many experiences that most of us will only encounter in our dreams, and this is why the book is appealing to me and people of all ages. Everyone at one point or another in their lives has longed to go on an adventure, and this book satisfies that longing. Mark Twain is an amazing writer who is able to spur your imagination, because his choice of dialect and visuals make everything seem real. At times it was a little hard to understand what was going on when Jim (Miss Watson's slave) was talking because of his strong southern vernacular, but I know that if I was there I would have a hard time understanding what he was saying. This book grabbed my attention from the moment I picked it up. I read it for the first time in eleventh grade and now as a college freshman I was required to read it again. Unlike many books that I have had to read over the years, this book was not a chore, because I fell in love with the story all over again. I recommend this book for people of all ages. If you're just looking for a good book to read for yourself or maybe even to a child, I definitely recommend Huck Finn.

After this, the Widow Douglas and Miss Watson took Huck into their home. Huck can't stand how the town is attempting to civilize him, so he ran away. After Tom Sawyer finds him, Tom tells him that he can't join his gang unless he goes back to the Widow's house, so Huck does. Tom's gang meets in a cave at night to plan their next robberies. Many of the members get bored of the fake adventures that Tom makes up off of urban legends, so the gang breaks up.Later on, Huck sees a footprint with a cross in the heel: Pap's. It dawns on Huck that Pap must have come back to take his money, so he runs to Judge Thatcher to \\"sell\\" him his part of the treasure money. In return, Judge Thatcher gives him a dollar. When Huck gets home to the widow's house, Pap is sitting on his bed waiting for him. After being infuriated by the fact that Huck would go to school, and that Judge Thatcher wouldn't give him the money, he takes Huck's dollar, and kidnaps him from the house.Judge Thatcher and the Widow both tried to get custody of Huck, but the new judge in town didn't know about Pap, and didn't want to break up father and son. Back at the log cabin where Pap takes him, Huck enjoys being able to smoke, cuss, and lay around all day again at first, but decides he needs to escape Pap's abuse.The next time Pap goes into town to buy booze, Huck escapes. Killing a pig, he spreads the pig blood around the cabin, then takes an axe and chops through the door and trashes the rest of the cabin, to make people think that robbers came in the cabin and murdered him. Finally, he takes a canoe downstream to Jackson's Island to hide out until the town stopped searching for his body.After a couple of days on the island, he meets up with Jim, who has run away to avoid being sold. Jim, being superstitious thinks that Huck is a ghost, but then Huck convinces him that he's not dead. The two end up traveling together on a raft down the river. Their goal is to reach Cairo, so they can take a steamboat up the Ohio to the free states.After a nightlong storm, an abandon house floats past their camp site. When they climb onto it, they find a dead man. When Jim goes over to see the body, he recognizes Pap; he doesn't tell Huck who it is.Huck and Jim decide that they need to go to town to get news and supplies. Huck dresses as a girl, and goes ashore. He knocks on the nearest house, and meets a woman. While talking to her, he learns that Jim is being accused of Huck's and Pap's deaths since he ran away. Then Huck learns that a search party is going to invade Jackson's Island that night, so he runs off to warn Jim.They continue to float downstream, and during a particularly rough storm, they see an abandoned steamboat. When they go aboard, they soon discover that there are three thieves aboard. Using the thieves' skiff to escape, they watch the boat until it sinks so low the water, that everyone on board would have drowned.After finding their raft, Jim and Huck continue downstream. One night, in a fog, they got separated. During the fog, they pass Cairo.Nights later, a steamboat crashes into the raft, crushing it, and Hunk Huck and Jim to jump off to save their lives. When Huck gets to shore, he is apprehended by search dogs. He is then taken in by the Grangerfords. Huck soon finds out where Jim is hiding. Then a fight between the the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons, who have been in a 30 year feud, many members of each family are killed. Huck leaves the scene with Jim, and they continue to float on the river.Soon after that happened, two strangers, board Huck and Jim's raft. These partners are a pair of robbers who are escaping from a nearby town. The first man, tells Huck and Jim that he is the \\"dauphin,\\" (the son of King Louis XVI- heir to the French throne). The second man says that he is the \\"usurped Duke of Bridgewater.\\" Since Huck is supposed to be dead, and Jim is a runaway slave, they are forced to deal with the two intruders, in fear of being turned out. The two men invent many scams, one of them being \\"the Royal Nonesuch\\" which earns them tons of money. Then the duke and the dauphin overhear about the death of a man named Peter Wilks, who has left his fortune to his two brothers. They get the man drunk, and he gives them so much information, they are able to pretend to be the two brothers. The Wilks sisters welcome the two men into their home as they present the inheritance as they are in mourning, never suspecting the hoax. The two spend their time selling all the girls' property for even more money. Later, Huck confesses to the oldest of the sisters the entire situation. Later, the real brothers show up, but lost the proof of their identity. After a spout, the townspeople decide to dig up the body to determine who the liars are.Huck runs to the raft and Jim to push off into the river, but the Duke and King are able to get on. Later, the King and Duke sell Jim.When Huck decides to rescue Jim, he goes to the house where Jim is, but the house belongs to Tom Sawyer's Aunt Sally! Huck is then mistaken for Tom. Huck then sees Tom on his way there, and explains the situation. Tom pretends to be his younger brother Sid, and together they decide how to help Jim escape.The two boys then tell the town that a group of thieves is going to attack where Jim is being held. As they run away with Jim, Tom gets shot in the calf. Huck goes to town to tell a doctor, and the doctor returns with Tom on an old mattress, and Jim in chains. When Tom awakens, he demands that they let Jim go free.Aunt Polly came to see them when her sister, Sally, told her that Tom and Sid were there. Aunt Polly informs everyone that Jim is actually free, and tells everyone That Tom is really Huck, that Sid is really Tom, and that Pap is dead."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I think this book did average for me. I wasn't really all into the book because I guess it wasn't my type. I know that's pretty selfish but other than that, the plot and everything else was great. It really is a great book. I love how Huck was always getting himself out of trouble that he started on his own. it was pretty cool how Jim got involved in the situation with the town thinking he killed Huck. I mean that was such a coincidence how Jim ended up at the same hideout as Huck. I didn't like how the book was so descriptive. That's why I thought that some parts were pretty boring because Huck would just talk about the same thing over and over until the readers get a clear picture of what he was trying to describe. This book was really challenging and funny."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain's masterpiece has withstood the test of time and has remained one of America's finest pieces of literature. I find it ironic that this book was supposed to be nothing more than a follow-up to Tom Sawyer. Huckleberry Finn definitely stands on it's own, as it's themes are much deeper and more mature than it's predecessor. I'm glad I waited \`til I was a little older when I tackled this story. As everyone knows, the southern language in the book is at times difficult and much of Twain's humor might have been lost on me had I read it earlier. For these reasons I have a hard time calling this book a children's classic.The story is simple enough. A boy in his young teens decides to run away from his drunken father and the people bent on \\"sivilizing\\" him. On his adventures he meets up with Jim, a runaway slave seeking freedom. The book follows their escapades as they raft down the Mississippi river.There are frequent racial references that may be offensive to the modern reader, but people need to be aware that Mark Twain's original intention was one of irony. Jim, the runaway at who the slurs are often directed, is depicted as an intelligent and noble man. Twain is making fun of the superstitions, customs, and racist attitudes of the south of that time."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"In this story there is a parentless child named Huck Finn. Huck lives with a lady named Mrs. Watson, and his best friend is Tom Sawyer. One day Huck figured out that he had lots of inheritance money, and his alchoholic father came to claim it. So Huck meets his father, who took him and locked him in a cabin. Huck escaped after a couple of weeks and fakes he was murdered. So Huck took off in a canoe. While hiding, he ran into Jim, Mrs. Watson's slave that had ran away, and Huck was mighty happy. Together they boated down south until they met these two cut throat rapscalions. Huck & Jim were then forced to work for them. They found out Jim was a run away slave and sold him to Tom's aunt and uncle. Huck escaped from the cutthroats, and found Jim at Tom's aunt and uncle's house. They believe Huck is Tom. Eventually Tom and Huck meet and convince the aunt and uncle that Tom is his brother, Sid Sawyer. So Huck & Tom live together, and try to break Jim out.

Then Tom gets back and is sick and tells his aunt everything and they adopt Huck, and that is how it ends.I gave this book a four because it's a great book. This book is sort of hard to understand with the southern slang, and accents. This book is great for kids who like adventures. Also it is just the book to learn what it was like in the south in the 1800's. I loved this book because of the characters and the way they acted. Also if you like books with deceiving and conning you'll love this one. so overall this is a great book. This book is a should read book, so get it."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I enjoyed reading this classic very much. The characters definitely made it a funny, interesting, and exciting book to read. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was a worthy read. This is a book I'm proud to have finished and be able to say I have read. I honestly enjoyed it. On a scale from 1-10 I would have to give it a 8.5. Mark Twain really paints a clear picture of the two main characters and how they come to be throughout the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a classic read, full of adventure, and a real true friendship lesson. This was a very challenging book but all the worthwhile. This is a book that has made me interested in experimenting other Mark Twain books. I truly think this book should have never been banned; it only prevented children from a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn is not only Twain's best work, but is considered by some, one of the greatest novels ever written. Episodic in form (as Twain warns, \\"persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot\\"), Huckleberry Finn is clearly, along with Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter and Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, one of the three most ambitious and artistically successful novels of America's 19th century.But what is it about Huckleberry Finn that makes it stand out? Most young people reading it will declare that they thought Tom Sawyer was better, and for them, they would be right. It is a difficult novel to teach. The dialect is actually difficult for some inexperienced readers. The satire and ironies are often lost on some readers, and some minorities are offended by what they think is its racist tone. That, however, is an historical irony if ever there was one. Twain's intent was to belittle and make fun of the racist attitudes of most Americans. The very fact that Jim and Huck were able to achieve a fast friendship and to negotiate together the epic journey down the Mississippi with Jim often showing superior wisdom and a right smart common sense did not sit well with some prejudicial mind sets. Today what offends is the language, in particular the use of the \\"n\\" word.But what makes Huckleberry Finn a great novel is first and foremost the indelible character of the often self-effacing Huck Finn himself and his compelling, lyrical, and ever so beautifully observed narrative. There is only one other novel in American literature that can be considered in the same league as far as first person narratives go, and that is Nabokov's Lolita. Strange to say Humbert Humbert and Huck Finn have one thing in common, an uncommon ability to make their differing worlds extraordinarily vivid through painstakingly clever and absolutely authentic voices. Both Twain and Nabokov achieved this rare veracity because of their command of language, their sense of character, and their fine ear for the nuances of speech.Sense of character is also what makes Huckleberry Finn a great novel. The characters are so real they practically jump off the page. Even the minor characters are Shakespearean in their psychological verity. It is not exactly a co-incidence that the Duke of \\"Bilgewater\\" and the \\"King of France,\\" those ornery rascals rescued by Huck and Jim, were experts in ersatz Shakespeare and various dodges. Twain knew people, and he knew them well. Too well, one might say, considering his low opinion of humankind.The effective--even rhapsodic--use of dialect is another thing that makes Huckleberry Finn a great novel. Writing a novel in dialect is a difficult thing to do well. Many have tried it and many have failed. Most writers are well advised to limit their use of dialect to the speech of their characters. But Twain was a master of dialect of many sorts, and was able to have Huck Finn narrate the entire novel in his voice while at the same time employ the various dialects of the other characters. Nabokov--although I don't think he ever acknowledged this--was undoubtedly influenced by Twain's authentic use of dialect; but because his narrator was a transplanted European professor of literature, he had to narrate in standard English; indeed a most eloquent standard English. Yet, one notices that Nabokov through Humbert took some delight in reproducing Lolita's authentic speech, her mid-twentieth century, New England, urban teenaged dialect.Finally, what makes Huckleberry Finn a great novel is its humor. Twain was a master of all sorts of humor. (He was a great public speaker and story teller.) The language of the novel itself is replete with \\"malapropisms, puns, misquotations, understatement, exaggeration, incongruities, illiteracies, and absurd spellings,\\" to quote from Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia of American Literature, p. 259--most done for comedic effect. Additionally, the yarns themselves, the \\"stretchers,\\" as Huck has it, are wondrous funny, and Huck's commonsensical take on life often contrasted humorously with what he actually saw and experienced.Here's one of my favorite passages from the book to illustrate the master's humorous style. The ragged \\"King\\" is about to divulge \\"the secret of\\" his \\"being\\" to the supposed Duke of Bridgewater and to Huck and Jim. He says, doing the \\"Duke\\" one better:\\"Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!\\"Huck writes, \\"You bet you Jim and me stared, this time. Then the duke says:'You are what?''Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin' at this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette.''You! At your age? No! You mean you're the late Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.''Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin', exiled, trampled-on and sufferin' rightful King of France.'\\"It is the sheer density of Twain's artistry that most impresses me. I wish I had room to quote the rest of the page as Huck goes on to describe how they \\"majestying\\" him so that it \\"done him heaps of good.\\" There is so much on practically every page. I know of no other writer except Shakespeare who can reveal so much in so few words, and who could use words so creatively.This is a great novel and anyone who cares about American literature has read it or will."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"An absolute masterpiece. This book should be required reading for every American schoolboy and girl. An uproarious account of Huck and Jim's adventures as they travel by raft down the Mississippi river. Jim is a runaway slave, Huck the delinquent teenage child of an alcoholic father. Although outrageously funny, Twain's work is a scathing indictment of statutory slavery. Some will be offended by the casual use of the work \\"nigger\\", but at the time this story was written the term was in widespread usage. Incredible as it may seem, people of African descent were owned by their white masters in the same way as they might own livestock. In this context, saying that one owned five or six \\"niggers\\" would have drawn no more attention than stating the same of five or six chickens."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book proved to me its title of \\"Great American Classic\\" the first time I read it. It is an American story full of adventure, good laughs, and excellent social views. Combined with a tough, yet relevant writing style that is fun to read, this novel is very enjoyable. It starts off where Tom Sawyer's story left off, and moves quickly to the huge Mississippi River, where Huck teams with runaway slave Jim to escape his abusive father. As they ride their raft down the current, they encounter many challenges that steathily frame what America has dealt with as it grew as a country. Huck must overcome moral issues of slavery, lying, deception, his misunderstanding of religion, and the fact that his new best friend is black. Despite these challenges, Huck and Jim form an amazing friendship in which they would do anything for one another. Mark Twain keeps the story exciting by continuously giving Huck and Jim new adventures and problems they must deal with. Huck grows to have a greater sense of himself and ultimately must decide between following the norm, or helping the person who needs him the most."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Huck escapes town and goes to a cabin and takes an axe and smashes the door down.

He ran down the river and threw the pig into the river. Then he gets in his canoe and goes to Jackson's Island. Huck and Jim find a dead person in a boat.

Perry claims that Twain was stumped at the point in his story (at the end of Chapter 16) when Huck and escaped slave Jim had missed in the night their connection north, via the Ohio River at Cairo, and were forced to continue south on the Mississippi River. Twain's conundrum: Why would Jim go south to get free? According to Perry, it was Twain's friendship with the former Union General and President that solved this writer's block and led to the creation of America's greatest work of fiction. Perry tells us that it was because Ulysses Grant went south to win the Civil War, that Twain determined it would be possible for Jim to go south to win his freedom. It's impossible to tell from the book that such a problem existed for Twain. The book is seamless in it's beatiful telling of remarkable adventures. \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" a gift to me when I was eight, was the first book I ever owned. I read it then and again when it was required in school (Lake Placid, New York, where the \\"n\\" word didn't make this literary classic verboten). I am glad I revisited it a third time, not only for the humor but for the beauty of the language Twain so perfectly captured. True, it was written to be a \\"boy's book,\\" but it's at a level to appeal to adults as well. If you have read it in the past, maybe it is time for a revisit."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Okay. Time to admit something: I never read Huckleberry Finn in school. I'm not sure whether or not we had to, but I never experienced this book until now, in my twenties. What a trip! I had no idea.

Not that that makes it right, but I didn't see what all the hoopla was/is about. And there are so many books that owe a debt to Twain for so many reasons: The use of child narrator voice; coming of age; humor. CATCHER IN THE RYE, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, and McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD are just a few that come to mind. Whatever you do, give FINN a chance. This is a great American classic.

All is well, Huck Finn has money saved in the bank from treasures he and his friend Tom found. Unfortunately, Huck's father, who is a money hungry drunk, comes back to town and demands Huck's money. Huck was adopted by a lady named Widow Douglas. Huck's dad tries to fight for custody once he comes back to town but fails in his attempts. He then hangs around town and harrasses his son. Finally he kidnaps Huckand takes him to his cabin. In this part of the story the reader feels for Huck. His father locks him in their cabin when he leaves and when he returns home drunk, he beats him. The reader wants to see Huck stand up to his father and do something. Then, the reader gets what they want. Huck escapes from his father by faking his own death. He then sneaks off to an island in the Mississippi while the townspeople search the river for his body.While he's living on the island he encounters another boy. His name is Jim. Huck and Jim become friends and live on the island together. Unfortunately, some townspeople saw smoke coming from the island so the boys are forced to leave.

I would not hesitate to read this book again. Although the time period and the setting set me off from reading this novel before, when I finally read it I was pleasently suprised. I really liked how Huck Finn tells the story and the humor that is put into it. Mark Twain does a great job of making you feel like you are a part of the story as well. However, Mark Twain sometimes used racism that could be offensive to some. In my opinion, this book wouldn't have a clear setting of time period if he had left it out.My favorite thing about this novel is that it is a story about a young boy and what he overcomes in life.

However, when we discussed it again this semester in the college, I realized the plot of the book and its representation of the harsh reality during the slavery period in USA.In \\"Huck Finn\\", Mark Twain satirizes a society, which has no moral issues and which is trapped between its obdurate way of thinking and the rapidly changing reality. He also exposes very important problem as showing us the way for reaching independence as a constant struggle between freedom and slavery. This struggle exists for both Jim and Huck. For Jim this is more physical struggle than mental, while for Huck it is based on mentality and experience. Jim fears the physical slavery of that period in USA and Huck does not want to be \\"civilized\\" by a society without any moral values and chooses to live his own life free and independent.Having read \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" twice, I strongly recommend it to everyone interested not only in risky and funny adventures, but also to those who think that morality is important in the humans' relationship."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will always be a classic piece of American literature because it embodies an adventure of immense scale.

He showed amazing perseverance and dedication to hard work in cutting out a hole big enough to squeeze through with the small rusted saw blade. He showed clear thinking when after making it out of the house he did not just run off into the woods where he knew he would soon be followed probably caught.

Not my personal favorite, but a definite masterpiece of American literature."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I will begin by saying that I loved reading \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" also by Mark Twain. I think it is an inspired work of genius and I thoroughly enjoyed it (see my review on that book). Even the introduction to Tom Sawyer, however, describes Huckleberry Finn as \\"Twain's masterpiece, perhaps his only great novel, morally and stylistically above the somewhat fragmentary and anecdotal Tom Sawyer.\\"I cannot agree with this assessment. I had numerous problems with this work which detracted from my full enjoyment of its many positives.First, the outline - This is the story of Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer's colorful outcast friend introduced and developed in that first book. This book recaptures his association with Tom, but very quickly Huck breaks off on his own - he runs away to get away from his drunk and abusive father who has imprisoned him in a desolate cottage. He will not meet Tom again until the final chapters of the book. He picks up on his flight down the Mississipi the runaway slave Jim, and they quickly develop a mutual bond of love, respect and friendship that transcends the social barriers between them. The rest of the book is the story of their many adventures as they raft down the Mississipi river. Central to the saga are Jim's struggle to find freedom and Huck's struggle with his conscience torn between the 'civilized' ideas he recieves during his brief time with the well-meaning widow Douglas and his own previously uncontaminated sense of right and wrong.Using the first person narration in the voice of Huck Finn is a stroke of genius, giving the story a freshness and authenticity that make even the simplest passages a pleasure to read. Each character is given a distinct local accent. The author is obviously proud of this achievement; he specifically describes his linguistic efforts thus in the preface, \\"The shadings have not been done in a hap-hazard fashion, or by guess-work; but pains-takingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech.\\"Moreover, despite the limitations on vocabulary forced by this decision, he manages to create eloquent and evocative descriptions of life on and along the Mississipi river. In fact, the Mississipi, in all its majesty and beauty and power runs through the entire narrative holding it together and effectively becoming a third major character in the story.Now for the negatives. The first is technical, and takes off where the last paragraph left off. Even for a genius like Mark Twain, it is apparently difficult to consistently maintain the speech cadences of an uneducated boy who can barely read, through the entire course of a full-length novel. And the inconsistencies show through. Frequently. This acts to intermittently spoil the very effect he is trying to create. Also, it can be a little annoying, like the voice of an American imitating a British accent that frequently and unintentionally falls back to American. I will illustrate with two passages. First, the opening lines of the book,\\"You don't know about me, without you have read a book by the name of \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\\" but that ain't no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied, one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.\\"Quaint. Honest. Beautiful.Now contrast this speech peppered with grammatical flaws with the following lines from chapter 9 -\\"The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and a good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.\\"Or these from chapter 12 (except for the colloquial word ain't) -\\"I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece and took a look, but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows ain't good to see by. Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still, never saying a word.\\"And so on. Maybe a small quibble, but noticeable.Secondly, because the story assumes quite early on a clear moral position (unlike Tom Sawyer), one begins to expect a certain degree of realism and believability in the plotline itself (which is not the case with Tom Sawyer). In Huck Finn, the childlike pranks of Tom Sawyer are replaced by elaborate and convoluted plots spanning many chapters and frequent twists that rely all too much on coincidence. The stories are funny but not convincing. This detracts from the credibility of the underlying message. Crystals of wisdom do not dissolve well in a broth of farce, and they stand out like sunburnt trees on a savannah, somehow diminished, desolate and out of place.The weight of this contradiction becomes particularly telling in the final chapters which stretch credibility to its limit and become tedious to the point of exasperation. This fact was apparently also pointed out by Ernest Hemmingway in his famous critique of the novel. He had high praise for it but urged readers to stop reading at the final third of the book, although he still mostly canonized it as a ground-breaking work of American Literature. (This last bit I obtained from a commentary on Hemmingway's review, so I cannot claim first-hand knowledge of it).Other critics have proposed that the painful slowness of the latter part of the book is a deliberate attempt to reflect the lackadaisical attitude of white people and law makers toward social change during the period. But I cannot accept that to describe a sense of boredom a book must itself be made boring - at least not in the hands of a skilled writer like Mark Twain. Therefore I see it as a shortcoming.Another inexplicable (and in my opinion, unforgivable) anomaly is that Tom Sawyer is used in the story only as a trickster and a foil to contrast with the innocent and innate honesty of Huckleberry Finn. The lovable social rebel of the first novel now takes on a darker character and in fact becomes the embodiment of a fickle and foolish system of social values. His childlike imagination is transformed into a penchant for lying and the erstwhile lighthearted pranks take on a grotesque and somber dimension. In his self-centered desire for fame and glory, Tom Sawyer is willing to put his friends at great risk and comes up with hare-brained schemes and ridiculous ideas to further his ends. I don't see why such a rare and wonderful literary character must be sacrificed at the altar of another in this wasteful manner.As to the more usual criticism of the book for its abundant use of the racially abrasive term \\"nig**r\\", I feel the author has used it for authenticity in the speech of the day rather than with any intent to denigrate. The spirit of his book is squarely anti-slavery. Still, it would probably be painful for an African American to digest the repeated use of the word.Also, the consistent portrayal of slaves as simple-minded and superstitious is hard to accept. Even Jim's character could not be fully developed because of these limitations.Yet, despite my reservations, I am happy to have finally read this great American classic, that I have long wished to tackle. Its positives still make it a worthy read."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I may be only 11, but I know a good book when I see one and this is one of them!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I just finished reading The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The book has many controversial aspects, especially on racism. The use of the N word is expressed throughout the novel and is probably the most protested piece of the book But since the action of the book takes place in the south many years before the Civil War, it would be prodigious if they didn't use the word. For example, in one scene Aunt Sally understands that a steamboat had exploded,\\"Good gracious! anybody hurt?\\" she asks.\\"No'm,\\" comes the answer. \\"Killed a nigger.\\"Huck was brought up to know that slavery is natural, but soon realizes that slavery in not natural, but is wrong. Throughout the novel he wonders whether helping Jim escape is the right thing to do. He later understands Jim is just like him. Huck would rather escape from authority than to betray Jim and Jim risks his life for the respect of Huck. Twain is not racist, but a man expressing his sympathies toward African Americans."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is a great book. I would recomend it to most junior high schoolers and older. It is like the adventures of Tom Sawyer.This book is one of my favorites I would agree with some of the other reviews that is is a little racist for a book but you got to look at the time period it took place it is the time that this was taking place so you got to understand it was research mark twain did with this book that is why it is like that."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is a real masterpiece, which everyone must read, no matter his/her age. I remember when I first read it in 8th grade at High School. I was amazed then only by the adventures of the little boy and nothing else. However, when we discussed it again this semester in the college, I realized the plot of the book and its representation of the harsh reality during the slavery period in USA.In \\"Huck Finn\\", Mark Twain satirizes a society, which has no moral issues and which is trapped between its obdurate way of thinking and the rapidly changing reality. He also exposes very important problem as showing us the way for reaching independence as a constant struggle between freedom and slavery. This struggle exists for both Jim and Huck. For Jim this is more physical struggle than mental, while for Huck it is based on mentality and experience. Jim fears the physical slavery of that period in USA and Huck does not want to be \\"civilized\\" by a society without any moral values and chooses to live his own life free and independent.Having read \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" twice, I strongly recommend it to everyone interested not only in risky and funny adventures, but also to those who think that morality is important in the humans' relationship."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This was a good book it had its dull parts like when Jim and Huck were going down the river. But overall it was a good book and I would recommend this to anyone who likes to read about a kid who has weird and abnormal adventures. I personally think Mark Twain did a better job on this than he did on Tom Sawyer. It got very ineresting in the middle of the book. I just have to say it had very poor grammer. I know it is supposed to be that way, but it took awhile to get through it because I had to sort it out."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, a sequel to Mark Twain's other famous novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, is a classic American Literature that is dated back during the pre-civil war era. This book is about a young boy named Jim. This book has many plot twists to keep the reader busy while unfolding Twain's real motives through this book. The word \\"nigger\\" was just a way for Twain to make his world come to life. Although people think the usage of this word is vulgar and racist, it is a must to read this book and to find it for yourself why this book is highly against slavery. Mark Twain also gave each character their own style of speech to fit there characteristics and intellect. Mark uses this journey of Jim and Huck to emphasize some of his themes and morals that he wanted to teach the readers. Such morals are that of racism and slavery when Huck befriends Jim, a slave, and lies and cons, which is shown through the characters of Duke and Dauphin. If you like The Adventures of Tom Sawyer or any other pre-civil war era books, than you are sure to like this great adventure. I personally give this book a four out of five stars."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a classic American novel because it encompasses many topics, and still manages to say something significant about all of them. Huck Finn is a young American growing up without a family and a home. He runs away from home to find happiness somewhere else where nobody knows him. This emphasizes the importance of going on the frontier, which in many respects is at the backbone of American society. Along the way, Huckleberry meets Jim, a runaway slave. The moral dilemmas that the main character faces concerning Jim are symbolic of the struggle between the social norm and inborn human kindness and represent Mark Twain's criticism of society at the time. All of these ideas are wrapped up in an exciting, funny plot that's guaranteed to keep you reading. Overall, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a must for anyone living or interested in American culture."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The novel of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain is the epitome of the American novel. The main character, which is the title's namesake, takes literal and symbolic journey down the Mississippi River in order to find his place in the hypocritical and stifling nature of civilization.It is out on the river that through the escapades of witnessing a murder, dressing up like a girl, aiding a runaway slave, and engaging in fraud, (to name a few) that Huck is able to establish his own moral values and code. This is embodied in Huck's decision to help his friend Jim, a slave, escape to freedom even though the code of his \\"civilization\\" would require that he turn Jim in or risk damnation. It is ironic that this sense of self and ethical standards is found outside the boundaraies of the society.Through Huck, America is personified. America is young; it is a dichotomy between the institution of the past (slavery) and the ideals of the future (equality). Hopefully, our moral code will follow in the mavericks of our literature, which challenge the current system and find our own truth down the river."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I thought that this was an exciting book, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure. Southern dialect is used throughout the entire novel, and it was difficult to understand at first, but once I had read a little ways into it, the language added tremendous reality to the story. This book is about a young boy who runs away from his dad, the town drunk, and is later joined by a slave, Jim, who is running aways at an attempt for freedom. It questions a lot of the values that Americans had when it was written (before the Civil War), and it's message is timeless. It was an awesome book, and you should definitely check it out!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is the American classic. It isn't simply a children's book, or a simple adventure tale, but a vision of a battle between individuality and conformity through the eyes of one of the greatest characters in American literature. The point that this book is racist is absurd. In fact, it is quite the opposite, with Twain indicating that it is more natural for Huck and Jim to be equals. Every time Huck stops along the river and enters a town, Twain satirizes the faults and gullibility of society. The ending is there to provide a sharp contrast between Huck, a strong individual and a realist, and Tom, a total conformist and a romantic. Overall, this book is a pivotal piece in American literature, and most of the points made in the book still hold true today."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is truly one of the great American novels, but not only is it popular with critics and academics, it is a great story for the everyday reader. I was originally assigned to read this book over the summer before eigth grade and thought it was a terrifically fun story about a young boy on an adventure down the Mississippi River, but now several years later I can still relate to it, but on a new level. This book contains fabulous social satire, excellent use of the vernacular, wonderful characters such as the Duke and Dauphin, and several lessons in morality presented by a savvy young boy who doess not realize how intelligent are his instincts. Mark Twain is a marvelous author, this being only one of his fine novels and short stories, and I envy his ability to get in touch with his childhood and create such a genuine and accurate character as Huck Finn. This is a terrific book, and I feel that anyone who has not had the privilege of reading it is missing out on something wonderful."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The book, The Advenures of Huckleberry Finn, written by Mark Twain in 1834 is said by many to be the closest and most realalistic discription of what the banks of the Mississsipppi were like at that time in history. The words Twain uses came across strongly to me, but the strength of the words is what kept me reading because it made me feel like I was a shadow of Huck, along with him every step of the way. The two main characters in this book are Jim, who is a black slave who has escaped from his owner to find family and freedom, and Huck, a thirteen year old boy who is running away from the burden of his abusive and drunken father so he dosen't have to worry what might happen when his dad comes home from the bar. Huck and Jim come across each other on a island outside of town where they become friends. Huck and Jim run all along the banks of the Mississsipppi where they are wittnesses to murder, thievery, and more. They put themselves at risk and danger so they won't be caught, My favorite part of the story is when Huck steals his dad's canoe and runs off. The next day the whole town is out on searching boats looking for Huck. Huck watches from a distance as he laughs away knowing that he put the whole town in an uproar. I believe Mark Twain wrote this book for people like us today to be able to get a little taste of how things were back then. I also believe he wrote this to make you feel like your on an adventure of your own ecscaping into a fun adventurous world where things don't matter what you do as long as you keep on reading. This book reminds me of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,&quot; also written by Mark Twain, but still has the same feeling of going out on a ride for an adventure. I think its a pretty darn good book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is my very favourite of all time.

It's not just for kids that's for sure.

Because it is our greatest novel it has been reviewed, analyzed, admired and vilified probably more than any book in American literary history.Everyone knows the story. Huckleberry Finn is a character introduced in \\"Tom Sawyer\\". He's the neglected son of the town drunk. After discovering a small fortune with Tom at the end of Tom Sawyer, Huck is given a home with spinsters. The idea is to \`civilize' Huck. That means bathing regularly, going to school, church in order to elevate him above the level of poor white trash.(Forgive me for using the term. But author is unsparing in his use of language considered to today to be politically incorrect. We'll discuss this more later.)Huck's father's paternal instincts are stimulated by the smell of money. He wants custody of his son. Unfortunately the law is on his side. Huck decides to run away. Inadvertently he takes one of the household slaves with him a runaway named Jim. They ride down the Mississippi River on a raft and sail into the annals of literature.The single largest misconception about \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is this is a children's novel. It is often given to children as a gift or taught in junior high English class. Twain was master of American dialects. His characters speak as they should for their time and place. Consequently, the n-word is used extensively. If you're the only black kid in the class, constant use of this word could make things uncomfortable.This one of the reasons this book this book keeps winding up on the banned lists. But to put this book on the banned list in the name of political correctness is short-sighted and ignorant.Another reason this is not a kids book is it tackles issues and situations far beyond the junior high level. The average 13 year old simply does not have the life experience to fully appreciate the book.Huck and Jim represent the dregs of pre-Civil War southern society. All their lives they've been reminded of this. They must always listen to the counsel of their \`betters', be it con men, childless old ladies or noble families hunting each other to extinction. Most of their \`adventures' are because they yield their better judgment to idiots.But there is a notable exception. Jim ran away rather than be sold away from his children forever. He's not as interested in freedom as much as he is in taking care of his family. Huck is conflicted because he's stealing an old woman's property. However he begins to see this \`property' as a human being.The point where Huck decides he will go to hell before he returns Jim to an uncertain future is one of the greatest moments in the history of American letters.Huck and Jim may not be the smartest people in the world. But they both show presence of mind, loyalty, devotion and love in abundance.In short, they represent the best of humanity."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I got this book for my 8 year old because he's been bored with the reading materials given to him at school. The problem with finding more challenging reading materials is that they usually have too mature content. Something not appropriate for an 8 year old. So, I decided to find some classics that would challenge his vocabulary and still be of interest to a young boy. This one is PERFECT! He loves it, it is a bit of a challenge and I don't have to worry about what he's learning at too early an age or answer questions that he shouldn't be asking just yet.Going back to some classics was one of my shiniest moments."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"Come here, Huck,\\" Aunt Polly called from the front porch where she was washing the clothes, \\" Don't you dare talk to that nigger again, you hear me, Huck, never!\\"\\"Alright, I am coming I was just making a bargain,\\" Huck yelled back as he slipped the money in his pocket.My essay is on the book Huckleberry Finn. I read this book and loved it. I think this book shows a friendship between a black slave and a white boy during a time when that was considered an unusual thing.This book takes place during a time when blacks were not treated equal. Blacks were thought of as property not as humans. An example of this takes place in the down town slave market.\\" Cheap niggers, get your cheap niggers,\\" a slave driver called out from on top of the stage. Families are being separated and children are crying while they are standing in shackles and cuffs. This is hatred.In this book, there is a lot of action. Every time you turn the page somebody is getting into trouble. It even goes as far as to put on a play to rip people off.\\" Come see the Play of Nonsense, the best in the world,\\" the duke yelled to the listeners. The duke and so called king are going to put on a play. Their idea is to rip people off and run with their money. It is a smart idea but later on they pay for it. The next night the play starts. Hundreds of people walk in and hand their money to the duke. Right when the play starts, the duke comes out and announces that there have been some misunderstandings and rushes off withthe money he collected from the audience. This book's plot is awesome.In this story the main characters are laid back and have a great sense of humor. An example this happens when Huck and Jim, a runaway slave, are rafting down the huge river. Jim is in great danger, but they always have time to play tricks on other people.Also, there is a lot of dirty tricks and cheating. All four characters have a good sense of humor and a mind that is made to get into trouble. An example of this takes place when Huck fakes his own death and fools everybody while he lives on a raft for two years. He left his Aunt Polly behind to mourn about him and fooled everybody else. For a while he stayed on a little island but then decided to raft down a river. He made his own camps and caught his own food. All this to him was a fun vacation. He loved it!In conclusion, this book is awesome! My four beliefs are: there is a hatred toward blacks in this story; the plot is filled with all kinds of action; the characters are happy, laid back, and have a great humor; and there is a lot of bad trick playing and a whole bunch of cheating in this story. I think Twain was trying to show us an ideal example of friendship."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The book was a narrative and I expected it to be a continuation of the relationship between Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn.

This includes the controversial use of racial slurs, commonly heard as a part of the daily conversation of the time. This novel is also a window into a slice of American frontier living which no longer exists, and had mostly disappeared when Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was first published in 1885.Huck and Jim's adventures are the most engaging at the beginning and end of the novel. I feel the middle loses focus somewhat as Huck Finn becomes more of a secondary player as he crosses paths in the lives of other characters.If you find the dialogued difficult to read, then I recommend listening to a good audiobook version which will capture the exact flavor of how the speech is supposed to sound."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"As one of the most discussed books in American Literature - and with over 600 reviews on Amazon alone - there isn't much that I could probably add about the virtues (and sporadic vices) of Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. All I can discuss is my own experience with the book.I'd read this book before when I was in high school, when I gave it the \\"high school\\" sort of read: giving it just enough of a superficial read to get by on whatever book report or test was required. Now, years later, I was reading it not because I had to, but because I wanted to. As a follow-up to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, I read the earlier book first.This is a very good book. Coming from an era when much literature is too stuffy and serious for many readers (especially younger readers who can be put off by such works), Huckleberry Finn and Twain's other books are accessible and fun. But is it literature, in the more high-brow sense of the word? Yes. It is very well-written and portrays the antebellum South in both its charm and its savagery. Some scenes are funny, but others are heart-wrenching.He may not have been the first, but Twain's use of dialect in this book was still rather pioneering. This leads to controversy, particularly in the use of a certain racial term, but to ignore or ban this book because of this term is to turn a blind eye to the realities of the period. Twain uses the term not because he is a racist, but to make his book more authentic.In short, this is a great book, worth the reputation it has garnered over the years as a classic."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"While the content of this book has become controversial over the years and it is no longer popular in schools, it remains a personal treasure.I encountered this book many years ago when dealing with my issues as an Adult Child of an Alcoholic. It was pointed out as a book that we might understand and deal with, and even more as one that we could learn from.Any child who has spent time with an alcoholic parent will relate to Huck's decision to go back to his father, his fear of his father, and his final decision to symbolically kill himself so that he could be free of the widow and his father.As you watch the actions of Huck, and as you read his thoughts and feelings, you can deeply connect with your own. His decision not to challenge anyone, his constant blaming himself when things go wrong, and even his subservience to Tom Sawyer when he finally shows up, all speak of a child who has not sorted out what is his fault and what is the fault of someone else.Even though it is written in language that is no longer acceptable, and even though it portrays Jim at times as less than he should be portrayed, it is still a very good case study of its time."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"A classic of American literature.

He meets up with a runaway slave named Jim and they travel down the Mississippi river on a raft. Along the way, they stop at numerous towns and get into difficult situations but always end up alright in the end.I liked this book because it was never dull and always had something new to keep me interested. There were so many different stories within the book that I was never bored. I didn't like how whenever an uneducated person would speak in the story, the words would be written as they were supposed to speak them. This made the text difficult to read and I think Mark Twain could have used this method less if not at all.One major message in this book was loyalty. The dedication Huckleberry and Jim had for each other was a huge part of the story. Early in the book Huck has problems with the \\"immorality\\" of stealing a slave form a poor old widow . However, as time passes Huckleberry says that he would rather go to hell than return Jim to slavery. They never left each other even though there were many times when it would have been easy to do so. When Jim was captured, Huck stayed in the town, lying about his identity until he could find a way to free Jim once more. Jim gave up his own freedom at one point to help Huck. They really cared for each other in this book.People should read this book because it was entertaining and fun. It was a really cute story I would definitely recommend it. It gives perspective on what life was like in the south during this time as well. It had historical facts and displayed the attitudes of the people who lived there.If someone liked this book, they might also like Tom Sawyer or any other book Mark Twain wrote.

I put off reading the book for many years because I had - a many of you may have - an inaccurate preconception of the book: i.e., \\"I don't like that kind of country humor\\", or \\"I don't like those old-fashioned novel\\", or \\"I just don't like that kind of book.\\" If you yourself have this kind of feeling about the book - let me assure you, friends, you should READ THIS BOOK. It is much, much more than that. It is a rich, stunningly accurate portrayal of the pre-Civil War South. It is also an enduring portrait of childhood. It is, quite simply, a masterpiece. Huck Finn is a character that, no matter who we are or how far removed from him we are, we can all relate to. It is also, in its use of particular American dialect, a very influential book. A quote you often see is the one Ernest Hemingway himself made about this book being the very archetype of the American novel. And it is true. Tom Sawyer was the first step, but this book is the culmination - it is the masterpiece. It is here that American literature found its voice, and stepped out from under the shadow of its neglected step-child relationship with English literature. It has a voice distinctly its own - distinctly American, and couldn't have come from anywhere else - and its immense influence on subsequent American lit is enormous, and cannot be overestimated. It is an absolutely archetypal novel. Also, its heroic portrayal of slavery was a very immediate thing as well. Its influence on such writers as Alice Walker and John Steinbeck - as well as, in some form, literally all great literature to come out America since - is profound. For this reason, and for its sheer adventure and narrative drive, it is an essential read for simply everybody."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Looking for a good book to read? Well, just pick this one up, because The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a great book. This is a very interesting piece of literature and is not like anything else I have ever read. Listen and you'll see why. This book is written in first person, and the story is told from the view of Huck Finn, a twelve or thirteen year old child of St. Petersburg, Missouri. The English used by Mr. Twain does not seem very good. He meant to write in this way, though, to give it a little more southern flavor and sound like a young teenager. The language itself makes the story interesting, and somewhat of a challenge to try and figure out what the characters are saying. Some words used, even in the first couple of pages, are \\"whippowill\\", \\"didn'\\", \\"gwyne\\", and \\"sumf'n\\". As you can see, Twain is very good at speaking in old American and southern talk. Another aspect of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the satire Twain uses. This helps us learn about the people of the time, as well as add to the entertainment value of the book by showing things that we find ignorant, which can be funny. Twain also uses satire to show weaknesses in society and look to make a point. Twain criticizes how gullible people are, how you can't trust everyone, and how some things that could be easily done are overdone. The gullibility of people keeps coming up in the book. First, they don't see the capability of everyone, especially the young. This can be seen on page 33 where Huck portrays himself as dead after using an ax and a pig to put the cabin in ruins with blood and his hair. Another instance is in Chapter 21. Huck dresses up as a girl and goes into a cabin to get some things for Jim and him. He calls himself \\"Sarah Williams\\", and even when he slips and calls himself \\"Mary\\", the lady still has no clue. Finally, she figures it out, but it takes her a while. A third and the most noticeable instance of how people are gullible is on page 132. The duke and the king, two people that come along with Huck and Jim, hold a play of Shakespeare. \\"To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin, That makes calamity of so long life....\\" The audience was wowed by these words, and have no idea that they aren't really reading Shakespeare except a little here and there. This also shows that you can't trust everyone you come in contact with. The last aspect that makes this story interesting is all the motifs in it. A motif is an idea, phrase, object, or element that keeps appearing in a story. In Huck Finn, the motifs are money, superstition, trust, and freedom. Money keeps occurring in the story. There is a reward for Jim and Pap, Huck's dad, Huck and Tom Sawyer find $6,000, he goes and sees a couple of wealthy families, and the foursome, with the duke and the king, try to raise money. Superstition happens with Jim. Huck goes to Jim to hear about his dad, Huck and Tom play superstitious tricks on Jim, and there are a number of other occurrences. Huck wants to have freedom from everyone and the town and Jim wants to be free from slavery. Trust, as I already mentioned, is a big motif. Characters find that they can't trust each other. These motifs are interesting because we all want money and want to see how people earn it, superstition is interesting to see if it is right, and we would like to know what kind of people we can trust. Also, the motifs keep us interested in the story by seeing if we can understand what they are talking about and by them giving clues to help us read the book, while at the same time keeping it challenging. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a good, well thought out, and plot-filled book. It is as good as anything I've ever read and you will have fun reading it. If you don't read anything else, read this because it is worth it."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain- The Adventures of Huckleberry FinnThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was first published in 1884 .

I mean, a kid might enjoy Huck and Jim's mischief, but they wouldn't really appreciate the quality and wittiness of this book. I also can't understand why some people say this is a racist book; the impression I got is that Twain was actually mocking the narrow-mindedness and prejudice of white society at that time. Anyway, I think this book is funny and satirical, and the characters are very well defined and charismatic; their combination of naivete and wisdom is really endearing. Okay, some of the situations are quite absurd, and sometimes Huck's penchant for criticizing everything that doesn't sit well with him are somewhat tiring, but on the whole this is a great story, and I reccommend it to everyone that can keep an open mind while reading, because I believe this book is definitely not an easy read, despite what others say, or at least not as easy as it seems on the surface."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"What I appreciate most from this book is its ability to create rollercoaster sensation, in which the reader participates aside with the characters within the novel. The life seems unimagineable but it's that very reason that makes it memorable.Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn explores the human flaws of an American society through the eyes of Huck Finn, who ultimately triumphs over societal expectations; Twain argues that in order for one to genuinely perceive flaws of a body of people, one has to be truly detached and thus objective of that group. Huck Finn is the epitome of an intrepid individual, who ignores societal expectations, when he learns that it is not he that is abnormal, but the others that are unusual. It is not until then that he truly assumes an objective stance and investigates and analyzes the slave-oriented society. Able to prevail against the initial despairs of isolation, Huck Finn ultimately overcomes through his eventual apathy towards the people's views. He does exactly what the others do not expect him to do so. Instead of diminishing, Finn firmly stands even stronger than before, an attitude that irate the rest. It is then that the individual truly undermines the established norm and understands societal flaws. Following one's moral compass, anyone can rise against and unjust conformity, upholding one's genuine beliefs.The reason you should read this book is that it becomes good source, as it is cited and referred to in allusions."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"What Ernest Hemingway called, \\"the best book we've had,\\" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is written in a southern slang that is initially difficult to follow, yet, once you learn to follow Huck's voice, it becomes a revelation of the human spirit. Huck Finn is a derelict boy on the run from his drunken, abusive father in the late 19th century. Along with his friend, Jim-a runaway slave-Huck travels down the Mississippi on a raft and learns about the ironies of life in a pious yet oppressive society. Twain uses Huck's ignorance to reveal the truths that were tearing America apart, and he does so with such grace and flare that I found myself indignant with laughter at the follies of a national doctrine. Even though slavery has been abolished, the book is still relevant today, describing a boy's awakening to the world around him, and how he-morals, judgement, and upbringing-fits into that world. A moving, fun, and insightful read, I found some of the most impressive moments in literature within the covers of this book; I hope you will too."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The book is well laid out and organized, but there are around 3 pages missing from Chapter 21.

As a kid I thought their little plots were merely amusing, but after getting out into the world and encountering the sorts of folks who make their living by ripping other people off, I could understand how any citizens of that era would have had no qualms whatever about dipping such a duo in hot tar and then feathers. The young American West must have been rife with such con artists, and their ilk was marvelously presented in \\"Huckleberry Finn.\\"And as for the word we're not allowed to say, it's amazing that \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is banned in many places for its literary use of that word in a serious work of social satire/commentary -- while a film like \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" with its own liberal use of that word, and no serious purpose beyond entertainment via plot and violence, is roundly praised.

I'd obviously read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, but not this sequel, narrated from Huck's point of view. Much of the book deals with a trip that Huck and Jim take down the Mississippi River. It's interesting, because they're bound for the North, but they end up going into the Deep South, the heart of slave country. Along the way, they meet with all sorts of people and encounter all sorts of mishaps.Huck narrates in his own voice, so it's very ungrammatical. But he's surprisingly smart; he learns how to read at the beginning of the book, and he has a lot more sense than Jim does in certain areas. And even though he is pretty uneducated, he's street smart (or shall we say river smart?) It's kind of funny, because a lot of times Huck misunderstands things. Like, at one point he says \\"I had learned all of my times tables to six times seven is thirty-five\\". Another time, he thinks the dauphin is the \\"dolphin\\", and that valet is \\"valley\\".At first, the life the two of them lead seems idyllic: floating down the river in a raft, doing whatever they want, frying fish for dinner. But it's not really. They encounter all sorts of strange things.I liked the section where they meet up with two con men, who claim to be an exiled duke and the exiled dauphin of France. They pull off all sorts of cons, and make a whole bunch of money. It was amusing, though obviously the men are criminals, and do a lot of shady things, and are eventually revealed to be pretty nasty people.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has a lot of humor in it and a great narrative voice. It is an interesting classic, though not one of my favorites, and (at least for me), not quite as good as The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.[...]"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"You know the story and the reader of this does a very nice job.

There is more to this book than than a simple story of a boy and a man floating down the river in a raft.What I loved about this reading of Huck Finn is that we were also to read Toni Morrison's Introduction to it. It was through this Introduction that I was able to see the story in a completely new light - and to understand just what was so \\"wonderfully troubling\\" about it.Morrison talks a lot about silence in the book - the silence in those moments of floating down the river, the silence with regard to learning much of anything about Jim's family, the silence with which Huck treats his friendship with Tom. Then there's the silence of Jim toward Huck - why did he fail to disclose who that man was under the cloth?This is an extraordinarily troubling book, but yes.. a wonderful one as well. It's enlightening - it shows how hard the struggle was to accept the idea that a human is a human, no matter his or her skin color. It's educational, it reminds us of where we've come from in an effort to remind us of where we should not return. It's captured history through the dialect of Jim. It's a look at two individuals escaping slavery - Jim the actual slavery, and Huck, escaping abuse at the hand of his father.I always recommend these books. Tom Sawyer is more suited to younger audiences (although I personally find Tom to be a scoundrel), but Huck Finn is a must read for teenagers and adults."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is one of the best books of its epoch!

But, I dare say we have to give Twain credit for the time period he was writing in and just what things were like back then. Essentially, he was making a political statement by writing this book. Whether we agree with him or not, we have to agree this novel is a piece of art. The way he uses literary style such as dialect and tone is just amazing. He also gives us a far deeper understanding and grasp of African American culture at this time, furthermore allowing us to appreciate what they endured. Twain brilliantly wrote about a boy who saw the world through non-racial eyes, he was not partial to whites or blacks, he associated with everyone. This concept is one I believe everyone should value because it is still something our society struggles with today. Twain had a grasp on what it means to love your neighbor, no matter what color they are. This book is amazing and brilliantly written, full of values that should be passed on for a long time. Although Twain is long gone, his essence and understanding of how the world should be is still very much alive."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"In this follow up to his classic about Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain focuses on Huckleberry Finn. The book has only the loosest of plots. The beginning follows Huck as he tries to adjust to being \\"civilized\\" and then tricks his abusive pappy into think he's dead.The book really gets rolling when Huck and runaway slave Jim take to the raft down the Mississippi River. Even then, it's episodic in nature as they get caught up in a feud and harbor two conmen, the King and the Duke. In the final part of the novel, Tom Sawyer makes a reappearance and helps Huck free Jim, who is being held as a runaway slave.Honestly, that last \\"episode\\" is my favorite in the book. It's so funny watching Tom make things ten times as complicated as needed since he wants to make this a grand adventure. I love it.This book has always captured my imagination more than the first with these characters, probably because I love the idea of rafting down the Mississippi. It's a classic adventure that appeals to the boy in me. I freely admit the episodic nature of the plot makes for an uneven read.Also problematic is the dialect writing. Huck narrates this book first person, and his schooling isn't the best, so the grammar reflects that. It's nothing compared to the poor grammar and written accents of some of the other characters, most noticeably Jim. There are times it's almost impossible to understand what is being \\"said.\\"This book often gets challenged and even banned because Twain uses the \\"N\\" word to talk about Jim and the other slaves. Considering when the book was set (before the Civil War) and written (1870's), that was the \\"correct\\" term to use. I challenge you to read beyond that because what you'll find is that Twain was trying to challenge the views of his day. Jim is the best character, and Huck's growth as a character comes from recognizing Jim as a fellow human being.This is still a fun read that holds a place as a classic of American literature. It's not often you find that combination."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I'm sure you all remember from your youthful days of yore (always wanted to say that) the colorful story of Mark Twain's, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. I thought I remembered it, albeit I was a bit rusty on the story. My current memories mostly brought on by the clips in Easy A where Olive discusses how it's not truly relevant to our time period because she can't remember any white guy running off with some \\"huge honking black guy\\". However, at the end of said movie, Olive apologizes to our dearest Mark Twain because that is precisely what happens which is where I laughed hysterically.Now, although this really has nothing to do with my review, I still found it funny. However, to get back on topic, I was asked to review this audiobook in exchange for my honest review, so here is what I've got.I loved it. I'm not much of an audiobook fan because I feel that it renders the speaking narrator as the permanent voice in my head for the written narrator of the book. This becomes annoying because much of the time I find audiobook narrators to definitely NOT fit the character they are portraying. My first introduction to audiobookism would be my mother playing Twilight in the car as we drove to Las Vegas to see my sister. I must say, that I found the narrator chosen for that book horribly dull and bland with no inflections that gave Bella Swan any good characterization, as in my head, she had always had. Many of you may debate this, as I know so many people to feel Bella is as bland as the chosen narrator made her.Nonetheless, Elijah Wood, has given me no such qualms, in fact he has done an amazing job at giving credibility to audiobooks everywhere. I do not say this lightly. But, with Elijah Wood at the helm of Mark Twain's adventurous masterpiece, I felt like I was really listening to Huck Finn tell me the story of his exploratory travels on the Mississippi River. Not only did he hit Huck Finn's voice on the dot he also was amazing when it came to Jim, the runaway slave. I really believed there were two different voices participating in the mesmerizing tale.It made me fall for the characters in an entirely different way than if I would have read it. Mark Twain's English isn't quite the English of today and I felt that Wood gave it a feeling and a loveliness that my own brain probably wouldn't have.The only complaint I have with the audiobook is not against this audiobook in particular, but the same complaint I have for all audiobooks everywhere...they take so much time to listen to. A book that would normally take me five hours to read (or less) takes a good ten to listen to on audio. However, the magnificence of technology today allowed me to download, from audible.com, directly onto my Kindle. How freaking awesome is that!!!!!!!!! (It needs more exclamation points still!!!)So, in conclusion, I recommend this audiobook to anyone who wants to feel like they are traveling along the Mississippi with Huckleberry Finn and Jim. The experience for me was overly enjoyable. Elijah Wood definitely gives it the feel it deserves and makes me believe in Huck's antic's over and over again."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Huckleberry Finn was a great literary work published in 1885 and written by Mark Twain. One of the most positive things about the book would be that the reading level is not very advanced and that it shows us a glimpse of the past. Along with the reading level not being very advanced, the book itself is extremely well thought out, and brings the stories, characters, and imagery to life. One of the negatives is the amount of cursing that takes place throughout the book. This is a negative because it is at a children's reading level and it does not add any literary value to the book as a piece of history. The ugly but I believe necessary part of the book is the use of the n-word. This is a necessary part of the book because it shows to our children and everyone the meaning behind the word. If anything it makes the reader more understanding of the troubles that the slaves when though and understand the meaning of the word a little more deeply."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"My intent was to purchase this book for my daughter.

The writing is aimed at an audience more experienced than say Tom Sawyer. We claim to have not found yet the great American novel, but, this comes close. This ought to be in every reader's library, school and public libraries, and, I'd argue, it ought to be considered an essential element in American English Literature classes.

The escapade takes Huck through a compelling series of events which relentlessly test his will, morals and conviction. Ravaged by inner-turmoil, he is constantly battling with himself over what his heart tells him to do versus what society tells him to do. The recurring theme of right versus wrong in Huck's eyes is evident with almost all of the acquaintances and relationships he has in this captivating, revealing classic.When encountering a novel it usually takes the reader a few chapters to get into the flow of the book; this is not the case in Twain's artful masterpiece. From the first chapter to the last, the novel keeps its momentum and Twain never bores the reader by slowing down the pace of the story. The plot does not become bogged-down or dull, like so many pieces of literature tend to. Huck's revelations as the story progresses regarding the black race are inspiring and even his view of the white race after spending an extended period of time with the dauphin and the duke show a side of Huck which society did not breed. Twain uses slavery, education and the hypocrisy of society as clear themes which illuminate Huck's true feelings. His intellectual state at the conclusion of the novel is far superior to what it was at the beginning and it serves to demonstrate the profound impact the voyage had on his attitude toward the human race."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The good thing is that they found that gold and now their are rich.Now Huckleberry is a good dude .the end"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"What can you really say about a classic?

Huck escapes from his fathers iron grip into the woods where he is faced with the difficult choice of befriending a slave or turning him in. The two traveling mates go down the river and work together to survive and they become extremely close. The relationship that grows throught the novel between Huck and Jim stands out in my mind. I like the part where Huck realises how much Jim means tohim and even if it means he may go to jail he will do it to save Jim. This reminds me of ignorance and how people teach their kids ignorance, but that child can still rise above and make better judgments on their own. I think that the moral is important. The fact that a child can realise and judge right from wrong better than their parents with their pure mind shows that ignorance can be stopped and racial equality can be spread. I did not like the part where \\"the king\\" sells Jim so that he can have money for alcohol. The author's message is that racism is cruel and unjust and everyone deserves a clean slate to be judged on personal qualities and actions not skin tone.

The layout is also excellent, you won't find the strange spacing or distortion of alignment that you find in some of the Kindle versions of classics. The price is perfect and the product is fantastic.As for the book, I find the novel to be extremely well written, but also a little dated. Twain is most definitely hilarious, and his characterization is top notch. His control of local dialect, and his ability to portray this effectively on the page, is without any peers. Huck's examination of his surroundings and his own thoughts on everything that happens to him is interesting and heartwarming. However, I feel that a lot of the satire is no longer as powerful as it was when the novel was written. Satire works best when the general population is \\"in the moment\\" of whatever the subject matter may be. Huck's struggle to follow his heart, while his understanding of morality in his pre-Civil War society tells him it would be immoral, is a little harder to relate to in this day and age.

But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind.

It's absolutely one of the most boring books I've ever read. It was too long and too drawn out. I've read other books and stories by Twain and they were so much better than this one. I definitely wouldn't recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I was forced to read this book for an English class, and it was an extrememly dull read. The extremely exasperating dialect of Jim is difficult to understand, and annoying as hell. Twain once again shows his bitter cynicism towards everything, with his pointless satire. The satire is not funny, how people find it funny, I don't know. It is a dull, boring, pointless,(insert negative adjective here) book, and I stand by my position that Twain was an idiot."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Personaly I didn't like the book whatsoever. I don't see what the big deal about the book is. It's considered one of America's best novels but I just don't see that. It's just a story about a stupid kid that runs away and that uses the \\"n\\" word one too many times.I addition to this i think that the book shows a lot of racism. The \\"n\\" word was used more than 200 times and it's just stupid that the author had to include all this racism in the book just to get the point across to his audience.Some people that have written reviews here might not be offeded by the racism that this book shows and I am surprised about this. It makes me angry to see that there are people out there saying how good of a book this is when there are serious issues with it."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I decided to read the original of this book after illustrating a condensed version for grade school children. I was also drawn to it after reading a comparison between it and Harriet Beecher Stowes &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; in Harper's Magazine. This book definitely has its highlights, mostly the descriptive passages of the trip down the Mississippi. But in general, it does not hang together. As pointed out by another reviewer, the pretense of saving Jim doesnt hold... directly across the river was a free state, whereas downriver the states became more and more racist with worse and worse laws. There is a good reason why the underground railroad helped escaping slaves North, not South. At various times Huck betrays his &quot;friend&quot; Jim, and the ending is deplorable. Completely nonsensical, how Jim is kept locked up while the boys play jail with him. This is not man against society, but thoughtless, racist young men cruelly playing with others' lives. Huckleberry Finn himself is often held up to be the epitomy of the free American boy, escaping from the mores of a repressive society, whereas I find him to be the epitomy of a society that finds &quot;adventure&quot; in &quot;taming&quot;, &quot;saving&quot; and just generally using for its own ends every other society and creature around. I would teach this book in schools, but I am afraid that the lessons learned would differ from the laudatory ones generally assumed to be contained in this book.An interesting fact I learned from the Harper's article was that Mark Twain himself put aside this book several times, unsure of the plot, changing the ending, and was in the end not satisfied with it.For a good book on escaping slaves, complete with realistic escapes and comtemporary language, read Uncle Tom's Cabin. For adventures, read Tom Sawyer. And to shake your head at what is enshrined as great American literature, read Huckleberry Finn."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"If your are one to thoes people who like childish exciment and adventure this book is the one for you. I mean I read Huckleberry Finn in the 6th grade and I liked it. It was exciting and some thing new! I wished that I could be just like Huck, but that was than and this is now. Times have changed I don't need to read about a little boy who run's away form is adopted family, and how he get's stuck on a raft with an Black man (Jim) who belives that he can tell the future from talking to a hair ball. But the adventure is just begining. Huck and Jim float down the river and incounter some pretty strange people, the Duke and the King of England. Both of these men are con-men, theives and not to mention they are just not nice people.

Well, I wonder why I should have to read it then, not only am I Canadian, I also have more interest, being a teenager, in the present.

That's where the good stuff ends, i'm afraid. Twain's writing style makes this almost impossible to read, by including either an overabundance of detailed description or none at all, thereby making this almost like a fun puzzle, in which you try to piece the different parts together without any instruction. Twain surely does not assist the reader in understanding what he has to say, but instead, makes everything utterly unfathomable."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I dont really like this book because lets face it, it needs some more spice.

This book is a big waste of time, it should be out-lawed from our schools, because Twain likes to use the &quot;N&quot; word a lot.

While some think this book is one conveying racism, I do not think so. Though Twain uses the word \\"nigger\\" all too often, we must not forget the fact that the setting of the book takes place at a time where it was normal to use. I am not saying it is right, however, the word usage helps the reader get a sense of the time and place where the story occurs.Throughout the book Jim and Huck are there for each other and they are pretty much the only ones each can count on. At first Huck is reluctant to help Jim and he keeps debating what is right and what is wrong. As the book progresses, Huck learns that Jim is a person and has a heart, despite what many of the time thought about slaves. Jim continually cares for Huck, for instance, when he doesn't let Huck see the dead man, knowing it's his father. Jim also continually lets Huck know that he is his only friend, by saying \\"the only white gentleman that ever kept his promise to old Jim,\\" etc. Huck ultimately decides that he'd rather go to hell than turn Jim in.Even though there may be some questionable occurances in the book, i do not believe Huckleberry Finn is racist. Jim and Huck form a loving friendship in which Huck helps Jim until the end, despite society's discouragement."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"now, before I get flamed for what I put above, let me explain. This certainly is a good book, which a great many people have and do enjoy greatly. I'm not someone who thinks this book is racist, and I understand wholly the reason for twain's use of the n-word. that being said, and maybe it's just me because I have high expectations for everything I read, but I couldn't really get into it. I understand that huck is supposed to be uneducated and maybe a little stupid, but his entire character was completely uninteresting to me. Nothing in this book jumped out and me and grabbed my attention, making me want to read further. Hemingway said that ALL modern american literature comes from this book. Now while this book may have paved the way for such classics as \\"To kill a Mockingbird\\" among others,not to mention influenced a great many writers, I think this is a crock of crap. When I read modern fiction I don't see a whole lot coming from this book. In fact, I'm happy about this. I don't see why twain had to use this book to make political statements, because fiction and politics should have nothing to do with one another. to quote one of my favorite writers, stephen king \\"If fiction and politics ever do become interchangeable, I'm gong to kill myself because I won't know what else to do. You see, politics always change. Stories never do.\\" That being said, I have made my main points for my dissapointment in this book, and maybe I have a lot to learn about literature still, but to think that as some people do, that you can't understand modern literature without liking this book, is bull."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I decided to read this book after my father asked me to.

There's something unmistakably childlike (and I don't mean that positively) about Jim; he is hardly a fully-drawn adult character.

As well as with this book, I also highly recommend: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.The Adventures of Tom Sawyer [ADV OF TOM SAWYER].Darien Summers, author of The Mischievous Hare, a children's book.The Mischievous Hare"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is universally considered Mark Twain's masterpiece, surpassing \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\". Yet Tom Sawyer's story continuously outsells Huck Finn's for the simple reason that \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" is the more enjoyable read. That does not mean that \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" isn't enjoyable, but that perhaps Twain tried too hard to impress and outdo himself that he muddled his story with unnecessary tangents.Everyone is familiar with the basic outline. Huckleberry Finn fakes his own death to run away from his abusive alcoholic father and finds Miss Watson's slave Jim has run away too. The two construct a raft and take off down the Mississippi River so that Jim can become free, an unheard of action for a white boy to take, even one as poor as Huck Finn. Along the way they face trials and high adventures, pair up with a couple of royal frauds, and find themselves in heaps of trouble when they impersonate the wrong people. Despite these setbacks, readers know that things are going to work out all right for the two main characters and that a happy ending will be had.Yet Huck's story drags on too long, especially the ridiculous plans to rescue Jim in the last several chapters; it seems as if these could have been excised to strenghten the story. Twain's humor is evident and contagious, but his adherence to local color and various dialects is demanding and downright frustrating at times. While many have claimed that \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is a racist book, because of one certain word, it is nothing of the sort, especially when its hero is championing for the rights of a poor, misunderstood slave. In fact, that storyline would have been rather revolutionary in Twain's time. While the prose and the language may be dated and sensational for our sensitive, politically correct time, it is a unique and faithful depiction of the time in which it was written."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Like many people growing up in the US, I read THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN as an obligatory assignment at school. No one likes obligatory reading, and it was like water off a duck's back. Regretting that I remembered nothing of the novel, I recently re-read it, and I found it entertaining reading, and also much more for a grown-up audience than I expected. Of course the book was only started as a sequel to Twain's novel for boys THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER before being turned towards much more serious themes, such as child abuse and the conflicts in antebellum southern society. But even much of the novel's humour is intended for older readers, requiring some knowledge of European history and of Shakespeare.The book's status as one of the Great American Novels is curious when it paints so bleak a picture of America. Any signs of refined culture among these inhabitants of the Mississippi comes not even for the East Coast but from Europe. For all of Twain's love of the land--indeed, the Mississippi River is itself a character--he was clearly a cosmopolitan figure by this point. Or perhaps the praise of America is subtle, as it is a portrait of a land free of aristocracy (the characters who call themselves the \\"king\\" and \\"duke\\" are scoundrels), and the novel is written in the honest vernacular of country people.The novel cannot in any way be considered a perfect work of literature when it is an arc that soars towards quality only in the middle. The opening pages are still in the realm of children's literature, while the final section reads as a tiresome parody with far too much serendipity to be believable. For that reason I've rated it four stars."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a novel by Mark Twain, originally published in 1884. It is the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Ernest Hemingway (and many others) called it the greatest American novel ever. Huck Finn picks up right where Tom Sawyer left off - Huck's abusive father appears to lay claim to Huck's fortune, so Huck fakes his own death and goes down the Mississippi River with Jim, the escaped slave.Much like Tom Sawyer, there's not a lot of plot going on here most of the time, and that's okay, because Twain's writing is extremely entertaining. Twain has a good old time mocking social conventions, and the novel is gripping almost all the way through. Hemingway was right: the end of Huck Finn is poor. After Jim is abducted and Tom Sawyer reappears, things just get silly, not to mention highly convenient (And Tom Sawyer here is just as immature as he ever was, reinforcing that no real maturation occurred in Tom Sawyer, and that that book really isn't a coming-of-age story in the truest sense).Twain has made Huck the narrator. On the whole, this works, although it gets tiresome to read Huck's dialect sometimes. Twain-as-narrator is definitely missed here. Nobody could write a clever sentence like Twain, and most of that is lost here, although occasionally Huck will turn one (and by doing so break character, but that's the price you pay).Huck Finn has been exceedingly controversial because of the extensive use of the n-word. So is the novel racist? Certainly the characters have the racism of the day ingrained in them - in that sense, it is racist. But more important to most people is whether Twain was racist; that is, whether he put his own personal racism in the book. That is harder to determine, especially since Twain has made Huck the narrator. Perhaps the fairest thing to say is that Twain was genuinely criticizing racism, but the way in which he portrayed Jim and the other characters contains some residual racism of its own.So is Huck Finn America's greatest novel? Well, maybe not. But it's definitely up there."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I was down in the dumps I was. Wonderin' when my Huck Finn would come, and wonderin' if it would be righ' on time. But it was, I tell you, it was."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a timeless classic that lives up to its prestigious name. It takes place in an array of locations along the Mississippi river around the time of 1835-45. The story is about Tom, a free-spirited boy, and his numerous adventures with a run-away slave named Jim.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn proceeds Mark Twain's original novel, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, but within the first page Huck acknowledges this and says reading the first book isn't that important. However, I personally recommend reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer before this book. While it is not essential, it adds a lot to the book and gives an initial understanding Huck's character.The book starts right where The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ended: Huck is struggling to fit into his new found \\"civilized\\" life with the Widow Douglas. Huck is uncomfortably forced to learn to be proper while his fortune is held for him.It wasn't long till Huck's Pap, the village drunk, came to kidnap Huck for his fortune. After living with his abusive father for a while, Huck decides to escape. One night, Huck feigns a robbery on his Pap's cabin and then feigns his own death. Huck escapes to a nearby island and decides to live there. Soon word spreads through town about Huck's death and the town suspects Huck's father, but then suspicions transfer to a runaway slave named Jim who was living on the same island.Jim and Huck set off on a raft before people could find them. They embark on a series of adventures, including boarding the ships of robbers, murder mysteries, gunfights, family feuds, great storms, mobs, con artists, and other extravaganzas. During their voyages they also come to deal with a series of topics and realizations, such as the irony and hypocrisy of \\"civilized\\" and adult culture, slavery, racism, morality, human nature, and superstition."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an excellent, easy read that shows the adventures of a young southern boy running away from home and learning a little about himself in the process. Huck, adopted by two widows who try to \\"civilize\\" him, does not like it and runs away with Jim, one of the widows' slave. They escape and travel up the Mississippi river to the \\"free state\\", encountering many adventures along the way. Huck realizes more and more along the way that Jim is \\"white\\" on the inside.I enjoyed this book because it shows Huck, who is being forced to be civilized by society, rebelling because he finds that society has some moral imperfections that are being forced upon him. Jim becomes a father figure to Huck throughout the adventures and is not a servant, which is what society has taught Huck. For example, when Jim doesn't let Huck see the dead man's face in the house floating down the river, it shows us that Jim really cares for Huck and takes responsibility for his protection. In turn to Jim's father-like figure to Huck, Huck takes responsibility to make sure Jim becomes a free man because Huck knows how good of a person Jim really is.This book is a must read for anybody and can teach everyone a little bit about learning who a person really is and not listening to what society has prejudged someone to be. I really enjoyed the gripping adventures Huck goes through and the revelations he has about the prejudiced ways of society."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I was disappointed after reading this story. Of course the message is important and Mark Twain is a talented writer, no one can deny that. However I found it difficult to read this book with the dialoge and the plot wasn't really holding my attention."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is about a boy named Huck who lives in Missouri in the 1930's where and when slavery is allowed. He has been brought up around slaves and sees slavery as being an acceptable practice because he has never really seen what goes on behind the scenes and how blacks are really treated in the United State at the time. One day Huck decides to escape from the madness of his family and abusive father, fakes his own death, and runs away. Jim, a slave friend of Huck's is blamed for the murder and runs away from the chaos of the town's reaction. Jim and Huck run into each other while being on the run early on and decided to stick together and go down the river together. A part of the reason why they decide to stick together is because Huck decides he wants to free Jim. They encounter different obstacles and adventures along the way. Through their friendship they hope to make it down the river safely together and in one piece in hopes of giving Jim the freedom he deserves and Huck is just in it for the independence and the love of being on his own with no worries or people not letting him do what he wants to do. Huck and Jim also experience many things along the way down the river and run into other people who help them with their journey and other who try to stop it. They get a better picture of how slaves are actually treated in the south and both are shocked by the mistreatment. Seeing this mistreatment of slaves and talking to a few slaves about their situations pushes Huck and Jim to try even harder at making it down the river safely and freeing Jim once and for all.The main theme of this book is friendship and compassion. Through friendship and compassion Huck and Jim go on this incredible adventure together and with compassion and care for one another they look after each other and both want the best possible outcome and result for each other. Major issues in the book include seeing slaves being mistreated, death of friends, and evading capture by the people after Huck and Jim. The style of writing is certainly an interesting one and at times I got frustrated with the way the author presented the story and how Huck and Jim talk. Both are semi-illiterate and say things in a different way then one would say things now and how one would say things correctly at the time. The \`N\\" word is used constantly throughout the book but it makes sense because it was used commonly and throughout the nation by many at this time. While it's not acceptable to be used nowadays, it was more acceptable back then. The author's description of the characters and the south makes the story an excellent one. The detail and description the author provides and even how he present the dialogue makes you feel like you are right there alongside Huck and Jim on a raft sailing down the Mississippi River. I personally think that anyone would enjoy this book and it's definitely a true American classic. Twain is a genius and this story certainly proves that. The man knows how to write ad good story that will make people think and feel for the characters and situations in the book.JLind555 says this book is a controversial masterpiece and I would have to agree with them because while it is in fact controversial with the subject matter of the book it is a masterpiece because of the overall story and how everyone who reads it gets something out of it. Justin Evans claims the book is one that is not meant for everyone, but that everybody should read it. I have to agree with this point too because it certainly isn't for everybody. Some people may not be able to handle some parts of this book, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't read it because they will learn many things from this book. Tessa says this book is dragged out and boring and while it wasn't the most exciting book in the world the entire time, it wasn't boring at all. This book is full of constant action and adventure and I don't see how anybody can claim a book like this is boring. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could see myself reading it over and over because of it's positive message and story. I give this book five stars."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"I wasn't especially impressed when I first saw this book. A is for apple, B is for balloon, C is for cow, basic stuff. The only thing interesting was \\"X marks the spot\\" instead of \\"X is for X-ray or Xylophone\\".Then I realized that I'd seen many of the creatures in Z is for zoo earlier in the book.So I re-read it. Several re-reads later, I realized that there was a tentative story in this book. Do the women and the man love each other? They write letters. Hearts are a periodic motif. The woman paints, the man explores. Do they miss each other?So maybe a toddler won't understand that. But this is an alphabet book they'll read past toddlerhood."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"This is a wonderful book for babies up to preschool. The pictures are simple at first, but the harder you look the more you see. My two year old enjoys shouting out everything she sees in the pictures. It is fun for us as parents to read as well. We try to find everything with that letter. It is kind of like a Where's Waldo for little ones."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"I love reading this book to my 7 month old. The illustrations are gorgeous for adults to enjoy and whimsical and fun for children to gaze at. Every time we read it, I find something new I hadn't seen before -- it's such an inventive book with a lovely little \\"storyline\\" and connections between pages. We'll never get bored with it!"},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"I bought this book when my daughter was 2 or 3 to teach her the alphabets. She's now 8 and we recently saw the picture cards they've created. It is perhaps a testament to the lasting impression of this book that she stopped to pick up the cards immediately and said - Mom look! She also wanted to buy the picture cards but that's another lesson altogether.This is one of my favourite books for her - the illustrations are beautiful and almost dreamlike. There's the obvious example for each alphabet but the most amazing is what you can discover on each page. A is not just for the apple but also for the ant and the aeroplane. This book can take you 5 minutes or 45 minutes to complete depending on your child and the stories that you can tell from just that one picture on each page.The book is forever special for the stories we made up so that even when she was 5 the book still formed part of the bedtime story collection. In its rich illustrations it allowed a world of stories to open up but told through hours between the parent and the child. Stories made up along the way, not always great, oftentimes disjointed but all special for what it achieved.I cannot recommend this book enough - it is so understated but just simply amazing for it."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"I really enjoy reading this book with my son because I like looking through the pictures to find all of the things that start with each letter on the page. There are several little details in the pictures that match up with each letter (such as a convertible, cows, cabbages, and clouds on the C page). My son likes to point to everything in the pictures and I tell him what each thing is. This seems like it will be really great later when he is learning letter sounds. The art is really beautiful and I have bought several books from this author/illustrator because of that."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"Keeps infant/toddler hooked on! Has multiple objects for a letter on one page like Apple, Airplane...and Balloon, bucket, butterfly, ball which really makes this book unique. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"The illustrations are so creative - each page has a preview of the letter on the next page (took me a while to realize this). Great way to introduce the alphabet!"},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"Alison Jay's books are beautiful. They are also very clever and I enjoy reading them to my baby as much as she enjoys listening to them."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"when it comes to childrens books I think a lot of times the illustrations can make or break the book, and this is one of those books where I fell in love with the illustrations. These are by far some of my favorite illustrated children's books. Though the content is simple, which is great for the little ones; it also has hidden treasures and stories on each page and letter that the older children can look for and find. Love it!"},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"WOW. Why don't more people know about this fantastic book??First, you should know that I love books. And I've started to fall in love with buying my daughter great, beautiful, special books as well. Wandering around little book stores and finding gems for her is now a hobby. And this is my favorite!Why?1. The pictures are gorgeous. I've read this 100s of times and never get tired of the art. It's not a book with pictures for kids; it's more like a book with art that kids and adults will enjoy.2. It's whimsical and surprising. There are little visual jokes in it. This makes it interesting to read 100 times, which your child will ask you to do.3. It's smart- on each page there is hidden somewhere a picture of the word on the next page (so the A page has a small bit of the B (balloon) picture in it). This makes it fun and even a tiny bit challenging- SO welcome in toddler books!!4. It helps teach the ABCs. That's always good."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"This alphabet book is a creative one, that my grandchild loves. I first checked it out at the library and it was so nice I ordered it off Amazon. The word beautiful doesn't do the illustrations justice. The pages are made of thick paper, the pictures are colorful and creatively designed. There is a simple sentence on each page that explains the letter being described in each picture. But there is more to each picture, there are other items in each picture that also start with the letter of the page. So it becomes not just a read along book, but also allows it to become an interactive book. The reader can work with the child being read to, to find the other objects that start with the letter. Lots of fun, a real keeper."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"Beautiful pictures. There are many things to discover on each page that begin with the corresponding letter, making it simple for younger children, and more complex for older kids. We are big fans of Alison Jay in our house. She's made some really nice books."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"My 2 1/2 year old son loves the pictures in the book. They are very vivid, colorful and fun! The text is very simple and fun which is age appropriate.I would recommend this book as an early, fun introduction to the alphabet."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"This is a deceptively simple book which reveals additional details upon almost every reading! Have many alphabet books which are largely simple and my little guy quickly becomes bored. Not so with this one which has many details with each picture telling almost a little story. This is a must by for toddlers and preschoolers!"},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"I am a big fan of Alison Jay. Her books are always beautifully illustrated and artistic. This book is one of my favorites. With a little imagination, you can tell a story either by reading just one page or the book."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"What a wonderful surprise! This book is by far the most original ABC book I've come across. The first thing you observe are the beautiful illustrations, then you notice additional pictures that illustrate the letter on the page and connections between pages, and finally a beautiful story unfolds that becomes more detailed every time you read the book. Amazingly simple and complex at the same time, it's a book that will entertain the youngest through the oldest of readers and grow along with them all. I'll be ordering Alison's other books!"},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"I bought this book for my 3 year-old son and he loves it. The illustrations are really beautiful and it is a sturdy book that is perfect for young children. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"I recently discovered _A B C: A Child's First Alphabet Book_ by Alison Jay. What a delight! Each letter of the alphabet is given a full page, if not a two-page spread. The text is very simple, following the \\"A is for apple\\" format. Both upper- and lowercase versions of the target letter are shown.The art, however, is extraordinary! It usually occupies most of the page with the target object most prominent. The subtleties, though, are what give this book its whimsical charm: other objects on the page that begin with the same letter (they are all listed on the last page) and the recurrence of objects throughout the book. Nearly every page contains as a small, obscure detail the object that will be prominently featured with the next letter of the alphabet. Sometimes these are embedded secondary details -- in the pattern of a plate, for example, or on the cover of a book.Jay's book contains all the seeds for the discovery and excitement that prompt a child to exclaim, \\"Look! That's just like . . .\\" and scurry back through the pages, searching for the remembered image. The suggestion of a story line is there, too, with an explorer, a map, and a treasure chest.I am so grateful to have discovered Alison Jay (both author and illustrator). _A B C: A Child's First Alphabet Book_ is the first book I have bought for my first grandchild, due to be born next month."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"For a format so simple, there is so much to see, and a story reveals itself within the pictures. I admit that I loved this book more than my daughter who was 18 months old or so at the time. She was too young to appreciate the story aspect. It is a high-quality book that I suspect children will find engaging as they grow older."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"This book and its companion by Alison Jay, \\"Picture This,\\" are two of our daughter's favorites books. The illustrations are beautiful and capture her attention. She loves pointing out all the characters and toys, especially as they repeat onto pages throughout the book. I also love how each letter page will have many things starting with the same letter that may not be immediately obvious. For example, the \\"D\\" page is for \\"Dog,\\" but the Dog is Dancing, there is also a Donut on a Dish on the table, with a Duck in the picture on the wall, a Doll on the shelf, a Doorknob on the Door, Diamond shapes in the floor, etc. The more we look at these pictures, the more we see! We've given this pair of books to several new parents with rave reviews. You can't go wrong."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"The illustrations are wonderful. Each page has a main image corresponding to the letter, but also many minor examples as well. Cow is the main picture for 'C', but there is also a cat, car, cabbage, etc.So many of the ABC books on the market today have unusual themes or exotic examples; it was refreshing to find a book with classic examples that every child can identify with.The running themes and hints as to what is on the next page make it an enjoyable book for Mom and Dad as well."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"I originally bought this for my almost-2-year-old because I wanted him to have a new alphabet book with both upper and lower case letters shown (there are not many out there besides chicka chicka boom boom). Instead it has become a favorite of my three year old who already knows her letters. The reason: this book shows the letters and has beautiful illustrations of many items in one picture that begin with each letter. Some things are easy to find in the picture and others are more challenging. It is a beautiful book that provides \\"I spy\\" and \\"Where's Waldo\\" type challenges. I highly recommend this book for the 1-5 crowd."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"We got this book for our then 9 month old and both my husband and I love reading it to him. We got the board book version since he tends to want to rip regular books. This book has wonderful illustrations and our son (now 13 months) loves looking and pointing at the pictures (and trying to say what they are). And as adults it doesn't tire as quickly as other books since the illustrations are so well done and have many hidden things to find. I just bought another copy of it for a friend of mine who is about to have her first child. I would highly recommend this for babies on up to pre-school...."},{"Title":"ABC: A Child's First Alphabet Book","review":"Both my kids (3 yr old boy and 18 mos girl) love this book.

When I heard it was coming out in real print, I knew I had to get a better copy.It's an exciting contemporary fiction story that really makes you question why you do things; I couldn't stop thinking about it for a month after I read it.

This book is a page turner from the very start, and you'll never know what will come in the next few paragraphs. Not only is this book entertaining as hell, but it also made me think about how life, and how it should be lived to the fullest.The author, Scott Kelly, has a style of writing which he can truly call his own. He is so believable and convincing when writing in first person that you start to think that these events actually happened to the author.This is definitely one of those books that you pick up, and you can't let go of untill the very last page. For me, that was about a week, and that's saying alot, since I hardly ever read. I love this book! Buy it! Read it! Pass it on!

Most of the other books I read were similar in their perspectives, but this one was definitely outside the norm. The author has some very different views about what caused the shift in childbirth assistance, and makes his case well.The Making of Man-Midwifery really stretched my thinking and challenged me to step back and view the sociology of childbirth from a much broader perspective.

I thought according to our traditions that we weren't meant to be capitalizing on our recovery. Imagine if every recovering person started writing books emphasizing their own views and opinions. I have been sober for fifteen years and sponsering people through the big book for thirteen, I feel no need to believe that I am an expert nor that I should write a book. I have spoken at conferences and at large city meetings, but that doesn't make me an exclusive member of A.A.. In fact those things keep me right sized.I don't feel that the big book needs any further elaboration.That is the problem eating at the real text of A.A. as far as I'm concerned, the founders of A.A. knew enough to keep their own personal and religious views out of the original text,thereby offending as few people as possible. Hooray for this Joe guy that has deemed himself an expert teacher of the twelve steps, but he is violating tradition eight which states, \\"twelfth step work is never paid for\\" and on page 166 of the 12&12 \\"when an A.A. talks for money,whether at a meeting or to a single newcomer it can have a very bad effect on him, too. The money motive compromises him and everything he says and does for his prospect.\\" One(especially Joe)could read the rest of this tradition and see that it fits.Then,Tradition eleven which states that \\"our public relations policy is based on attraction rather thatn promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press radio and films.\\" On page 183 of the 12& 12 it says,\\" personal ambition has no place in A.A.. In it, each member becomes an active guardian of our fellowship.\\" And of course tradition twelve on page 184 of the 12& 12 should be read through by our self appointed \\"step teacher\\" Come down of the pulpit Joe, you are just another drunk, keep your personal views between you and you circle of friends were it can be appreciated as it need be. You are not an expert, neither am I.How dare you get a paycheck from something that was given to you for free!"},{"Title":"The Steps We Took","review":"IF YOUR IN RECOVERY AND HAVE TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING THE BIG BOOK I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST READING THIS BOOK AND THE BIG BOOK TOGETHER"},{"Title":"The Steps We Took","review":"It contains much of the basic 12 Steps, but puts a different spin on them.

It really helps to clarify the steps from the Big Book."},{"Title":"The Steps We Took","review":"This book exemplifies much of what is wrong in AA today: A treatment center professional (like so many others of those \`\`on the circuit''; whatever happened to the Eighth Tradition?) gives his interpretation of the Big Book as the only possible intepretation, along with a liberal dose of muddled analysis, often erroneous historial interpretation and opinion, building on his \`\`career'' as \`\`guru'' and trading on his recovery for personal aggrandizement.Much of Joe's exegisis of the Big Book is poorly supported by the text -- the whole \`\`building a bridge'' thing, for example. He takes a few mentions of \`\`foundation'' or \`\`cornerstone'' and turns them into a fully articulated \`\`recovery'' structure. Joe and Charlie aren't particular careful readers, despite all their reading of the Big Book. But they do deserve credit for their efforts to somewhat clarify the often unclear and confusing aspects of the Big Book, particularly in the Fourth Step. They were the pioneers in the promotion of the idea that the inventory is primarily concerned with resentment, and that there is a \`\`fourth column'' in the resentment inventory. The column is never explicitly mentioned, and where it is implied, other interpretations are possible. They seem unable or unwilling to address such questons as why the 12&12 suggests a totally different inventory process using questions or if the pioneers of the program EVER used the format they suggest (all evidence, including the testimony of oldtimers, makes it clear they did not) Those adhering to their interpretation will do a pretty fair job of assessing their spiritual weak spots. In that sense, what they suggest is perfectly adequate. It's just not the last word."},{"Title":"The Steps We Took","review":"It's difficult to criticize Joe McQ's work. I purchased this item through the recommendation of my OA sponsor (another 12-step program). At first I did not like what Joe McQ was saying, after all, I didn't need him to rewrite the Big Book. But there is so much acclaim about the Joe and Charlie tapes (talks) which I have wanted to hear, that I think I should give Joe McQ's book another try. So far I've only read steps one and two in The Steps We Took.I've got to get around to listening to those Joe and Charlie tapes too. Thursdays at 7pm at 203 S.

Additionally, as the author relates his/her own personal experiences (successes and failures before and during sobriety), so the audience relates. A cold, impersonal, and literal \\"interpretation\\" of the principles of the material that was printed over 70 years in the past is not as effective as a presentation that lives in the author's present moment.

It clearly lays out the processes to identifying the personal faults associated with alcoholism and how to address them in a format that is genuinely unique, insightful, and most of all, easy to understand. Joe McQ's expertise is refreshing, yet to the point and would be a boon to all who seek help in understanding how to work \\"the steps\\".

Someone finally wrote down the directions on how to work the steps.I have purcahsed at least 25 copies of this book in the last 10 years. I also sponsor right out of it.

The contents of those tapes (which are largly reproduced in this book), changed my life forever. In this book, using clear, simple and understandable terms, Joe translates the spiritual essence of the Steps into an extremely do-able set of practical instructions, which; if followed precisely, will ensure a life free from the ravages of one's particular addiction. With plenty of worksheets and visually pleasing graphics, the process is fluid and gently guides the student along the well-worn path of the steps, to the oft-achieved destination of freedom and sobriety. I strongly recommend this book to people who are getting &quot;stuck&quot; in &quot;listless&quot; sobriety, and even more so for those who are unable to stay sober, inspite of attendance at meetings, and repeated visits ot detox's/centers.

It would be virtually impossible for me to even begin to describe how important this book is and how many times I have quoted it's content.A guy I sponsor who knew how much Joe McQ's book meant to me had the &quot;bridge&quot; in THE STEPS WE TOOK copied, matted and framed.

It's sad, though, to think that one person's need to find fault in this beautiful book might prevent someone from finding the healing that lies here.One of the slogans of any 12-step program is \\"Take what you life and leave the rest,\\" and there's certainly a lot to like in this book. It contains profound words that create a deep and long lasting healing.I found this book in my 19th year of sobriety in AA and 15th year in Al-Anon. It changed my life in ways the Big Book and the 12 by 12 never managed to. I use it with Sponsees because it provides an insightful, inspiring and illuminating view of the steps. I believe that a dynamic recovery means doing the steps over and over again and this book certainly facilitates that.Another book I highly recommend is &quot;Expect a Miracle&quot; by Kathy Freston. It's new and you can get it at Amazon. This is an equally powerful book if you're ready for it!"},{"Title":"The Steps We Took","review":"Like all Big Book fundamentalist approaches to sponsorship and life, this book is limited by the limitations to the understandings available to AA members by 1939. God did not retire at that point, and, as promised, more is being revealed.While effective for the first five steps, this book is limited to BB approaches, and so we get two paragraphs worth of Steps 6 & 7.Its fundamentalism also seems to limit Joe's willingness to direct people to other readings that would help them recognize the absolute humanity of struggling to surrender character defects.\\"The decision to live on a spiritual basis or to die an alcoholic death is not always an easy one.\\" The lesson of Step 2 applies to all subsequent steps, and certainly to Steps 6, 7, and 8. Unfortunately,the fundamentalist approach in this book suffers from \\"progress bias\\"; once we get past each step, it is treated as background, and only the step at hand is treated.This is a good reference, but not a guide to sponsorship."},{"Title":"Stone Soup","review":"This version of Stone Soup leaves a sour taste in my mouth. At the beginning I was especially disappointed that there were no polite words like please and thank you. The boy also tells instead of asking.

It is also known as Nail Soup in Scandinavia, and Axe Soup in parts of Europe. Some traditions, which is somewhat supported, place the origin of the story in Portugal. Originally the story consisted of a group of hungry solders returning from the war, who talked an entire town into providing them with an entire meal using the \\"stone soup method.\\" The version of the story told here has two characters; a young and poor wondering youth, and a somewhat poor old woman who actually has plenty that he tries to talk out of a meal.When the old lady refuses our young wondering man a meal, he of course starts with a rock he picked up from the road. After he adds the rock to a pot of boiling water, to make \\"stone soup\\" he has the little old lady hooked. He points out that the stone soup would be much enhanced with the addition of some onions. The little old lady of course has onions, so she adds them. This goes on and on like this with one ingredient after another being added at the coaxing of the young man and the curiosity of the old lady increasing as the story progresses. In the end, the young man gets a fine pot of stew, a full belly, and I suspect, after the little old lady thinks about it, she becomes much wiser.The author has done a fine job in this version of the tale and the illustrations are top notch. The artist has used detailed water colors and has captured the poverty of the youth perfectly. The depictions of the clothing alone are works of art.This is a great read-along book or one that is good for the child to read to themselves. Both test and illustrations are well coordinated.Since this version of this story was first published in 1968 it has come under some criticism as some feel it teaches children to lie and deceitful. It also shows a very uncaring and unsharing little old lady, both not good traits. While I agree that the axe version may show and teach the advantages of cooperation better; that working together, all benefit, I also feel there are lessons to be learned from this version. First, children need to learn the facts that people do lie and lie all the time. Secondly, that they should questions the overall big picture and not take everything at face value and thirdly, when you want something from someone, don't tell them how desperately they need it, but rather create the impression that you are giving them an opportunity to be part of your success. I firmly believe that we can be, and often are, too sheltering and protective of our children; to the point of hurting them later in life.I enjoyed this book. I use it all the time with children I read to and in fact, used an oral version of this tale to teach my children and grandchildren, much as I was by my grandfather years and years ago.Note that there are other and many versions of this book out. I will be the first to admit that I have read better, but still think that this one will do in a pinch.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Stone Soup","review":"Stone Soup is a classic story brought to life through the pictures by Winslow Pinney Pels. A young man, a pauper, spies a house that looks like plenty of food could be found there. The old woman who owns the house tells him to go away, she has no food in the house, no food in the garden. The young man asks her for a stone. &quot;A stone, what do you want with a stone,&quot; she curiously asks the pauper. &quot;Ah,&quot; says he, and he knows he HAS her. As the story unfolds, the young man has the woman adding more and more ingredients to the stone soup the young man is making. Completely duped, until possibly the very end, the old woman is the young man's accomplice in tricking herself into providing the pauper with a &quot;feast for a king.&quot; And what will become of the stone, read the story, and find out! You'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Stone Soup","review":"This item has become my daughter's favorite story time book. It is an amazing tale which will bring you back to your own childhood memories.

After reading the other reviews, I'll probably get the other version as well. However, that said, my mother purchased this book for me when I was six-years-old and I STILL have it. It is read almost nightly in our house to a toddler who thoroughly enjoys it. He particularly likes to point out what's wrong. For example, the little old lady tells the young man that she has nothing in her garden to feed him, nor anything in her house. My little one always says, \\"she's lying.\\" And, he also picked up the fact that the young man in the story never says please or even thank you after this lady fixes him this wonderful soup. That's really something too and I even have to add it in while I'm reading it.This is a cute book but I do suggest getting the other French classic version as well. This young man is somewhat of a shiftless fellow, not working, but just conning meals off of folks. Not too sure of the message there and it is repetitious which is good for young children. I do recommend it, however, since it is quite a cute story. Obviously, the illustrations in my 36-year-old book are quite different than this version so I will refrain from commenting on them."},{"Title":"Stone Soup","review":"Stone Soup is very fun reading. This is a great story because it keeps you interested from start to finish. This story tells of a young man who is off on a long walk and gets hungry. He goes to a little old lady's house and asks to be fed. After she turns him down he offers to make stone soup for them both. So the two boil a stone but soon add onions, carrots, beef bones, barley and many other things to make it taste better. The two then go on to share a very nice afternoon together before the young man heads out for another long walk. I really enjoyed the parts where the little old lady gathers all of the fancy things needed to make the soup. That's why I think that most other people should enjoy this book too."},{"Title":"Stone Soup","review":"In this version of stone soup they forgot the salt.

I especially love how the pieper gets the old woman to cook him a huge pot of soup, from a stone. Also she has no idea that she is making him a soup. She thinks he really did make soup from that stone. This is by far the greatest book I have ever read! If I had the choice I would rate this book six stars.

Definitely a good choice when my granddaughter could not put it down."},{"Title":"Stone Soup","review":"I personally prefer Marcia Brown's version of the original story of Stone Soup in which soldiers politely coax villagers into making a delightful soup. I think it is well illustrated and written. It is a fun tale, with a gentle sort of deception that is well meant and shows how one can teach people to cooperate. It teaches that there may be selfish people but that generosity benefits all.This version, on the contrary, has a rather morbid trickery to it. The characters are grotesque looking, thus unappealing, and this is true of their character as well. I can't see children getting much joy from this. Mine didn't. It also has a rather sordid tone to it. I don't think it is as pleasant nor as instructive.I don't believe I shielded my children from the realities of life, as appropriate for their ages and level of understanding. One reviewer praised this version of Stone Soup as teaching the harsh realities of life that we should not shield from our children. What nonsense. A well written tale, well illustrated that gives some faith in humans is not unfair to children and equips them with some sense of inner security and hope. And it's just a children's book, after all...not a lesson in life appropriate for older children. Check out the books they have for teens now: not a happy story in any of them. Rape, drug abuse, divorce...all there.No, I find this book really odd and distasteful and it falls really short of the quality of the Brown version."},{"Title":"Stone Soup","review":"I am a pre-k teacher working with four year olds.

The children love this story as much as I did."},{"Title":"Stone Soup","review":"It is fitting that I read this book immediately after reading a historical novel that featured Samuel Clemons (Mark Twain). For this story is very similar to the classic Twain story of how Tom Sawyer gets a boy to do his painting for him.A young man has been walking all day and is very tired and hungry. He has no food so he stops at the house of an elderly lady. He asks for food and is rejected. When that happens he asks for a stone instead and brags about how he can make a nutritious soup by boiling a stone. Once the cooking begins he then tells her how much better it would be if it included onions, butter, barley, carrots, beef bones, salt and pepper. The woman, amazed that a soup could be made with \\"only\\" a stone, fetches these additional ingredients. It turns out that the young man was right; the \\"stone soup\\" was in fact delicious. He then removes the stone, tells the woman that it is not completely cooked yet and proceeds on his way.The illustrations that accompany this classic folk tale capture the poverty of the boy and the old woman. Both of them are wearing raggedy clothing and the pins sticking out of the clothing of the woman's posterior was an amusing touch. I strongly recommend this book as a way for children to learn a classic lesson about life."},{"Title":"Stone Soup","review":"This is probably my ALL-TIME favorite children's book! Its witty and funny, and is a wonderful story for children of all ages.

I just couldn't really get into the characters and had no desire to read the series. These pocket books are the way these characters need to be represented. With this format, the reader has a greater chance of seeing the depth and all the turns in the lifes of Francine, Katchoo and David. We see how minor characters interact and come back again. I have really come to enjoy these books.If I had one complaint it would be in the art work. Now stop booing me. The art work is really excellent but the faces of most of woman are drawn the same. It takes me a few minutes to figure out who I am looking at and her role. Fancine is no problem.

One easily pictures this as a TV series (though, in true indie fashion, one also doubts Moore would ever consent to develop such a series). The temptation is to characterize \\"Strangers in Paradise\\" as chick lit, but that would be too dismissive. Any time a story is interesting and its characters compelling, you have something worth reading--and that's just what \\"Strangers in Paradise\\" is."},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"My girlfriend got me into Strangers in Paradise, after reading the first pocket book I was hooked. The characters are really deep and the artwork is equally as good. I recommend this series to anyone interested in relationships."},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"Katchoo and Francine are roomates, and Katchoo has a crush on Francine. Francine loves Katchoo but prefers men. David is in love with Katchoo, but she hates men. This is the love triangle that anchors this multivolume series. In volume one we learned that prior to living with Francine, Katchoo worked for David's gang boss sister, Darcy Parker, as a call girl and also was her lover. She went into hiding when she ran away from Darcy with a whole lot of Darcy's money.Now in Volume 2 Darcy has found Katchoo and forces her back into her mob with threats on Francine's life. Darcy needs Katchoo in her biggest blackmail project to date. The main theme of the volume is how Katchoo and David, with help from Francine, escape Darcy's nefarious plans.Terry Moore takes us through three different time periods in this book. The main story takes place in the time when Darcy's plans are foiled by Katchoo. Then Mr. Moore takes us back to when Francine and Katchoo first met in high school. It is in there that we learn about the troubles that have shaped their current inability to develop loving relationships. Then we find that the high school flashback is just a reminiscence of Francine who hasn't seen Katchoo for ten years and is a wife and mother in a loveless marriage. If she ever needed Katchoo's love, it is at this moment.The book ends with a short fantasy piece where Francine and Katchoo role play Zena, Warrior Princess. All in all, a delightful book with lots of twists and turns to keep you wanting more."},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"I enjoyed this first volume of Terry Moore's STRANGERS IN PARADISE graphic novel immensely. Moore tells of the inner life and times of three young friends-two female and one male-who must find ways to deal with the often frustrating realities of living and dealing with feelings in the real world.Moore creates a realistically painful, yet often humorous world that you'll want to immerse yourself in over and over again. If you enjoyed Daniel Clowes' GHOST WORLD, STRANGERS IN PARADISE is definitely for you."},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"This book collects the original 3-issue series of Stangers in Paradise, a black and white independent comic written and drawn by then unknown Terry Moore. It's an urban story about one deeply emotional and temperamental polish girl named Katchoo, a naive and sweet gal named Francine and a young boy David. Their lives are blended together and the result is... surprising. There are no superheroes in this book, but you will find all the emotions of the human spectre: pain, anger, lust, love, hate. The story is so original and interesting that one thing can be said about Strangers in Paradise: it can be enjoyed by people who dont read comic books.Too bad that the spark didnt last much, as Terry Moore went on to write predictable and cliched second and third parts of this story. My advise: buy this one and dont waste your time buying the others."},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"I am not a comic book reader.

I'd say it's really a fairly good comic book for Kevin Smith fans, though it isn't Bluntman... the friend who introduced me to it is a tiny little blonde feminist library science major, who would beat me up if I said she resembled Katchoo!"},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"This is such an excellent comic. Great stories. Fascinating characters. It's worth every penny."},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"This first compilation of Terry Moore's Strangers in Paradise collects the first three issues of the comic (Volume 1, Issue 1: Breaking up is Hard to Do; Volume 1, Issue 2: Katchoo's Revenge; and Volume 1, Issue 3: Busted!) into one volume. We are introduced to two long-time friends, Francine Peters and Katina \\"Katchoo\\" Choovanski, as well as assorted other characters such as Francine's boyfriend (well, at the start) Freddie Femur and the smitten David Qin. So many relationships! Francine is in love with Freddie, Katchoo is in love with Francine, David is in love with Katchoo, and Freddie is mostly in love with himself.The volume revolves around Francine's relationship with Freddie. The sexual tension, the infidelity, the breakup. Then, there's Francine's reaction to the situation, which spurs Katchoo's reaction to the situation, which spurs Freddie's reaction to Katchoo's reaction. It's all very cause-and-effect.The interaction and by-play between characters tends to be fairly fast-paced, with everyone reaecting to the world around them. The one exception seems to be David Qin, Katchoo's unwanted admirer, who seems to take on the role of observer in all of the drama unfolding around Francine and Katchoo.What strikes me about this comic is that it's about normal people in (mostly) normal situations. Francine tries to deal with a breakup. Katchoo and David deal with unrequited love. Freddie is a jerk... There are no magic powers. There are no fantastic worlds. It's just about ... people, living their lives.The exception to this rule seems to be Katchoo herself. Her methods of dealing with alarm clocks must make the alarm clock manufacturers of the world very happy. She seems to be unnaturally strong. She has what the politically correct might call 'anger issues.' But underneath it all, she is a friend, and a protector, willing to do anything she can to keep Francine safe, and happy, and sheltered from the ugliness of the world. Oh yeah, and she also has a felony record that the FBI won't release.Interesting."},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"While browsing in the local comic book shop, I came across this book that seems to be about two young women - one blonde and one brunette... I went and bought it... Let me tell you...I'm really glad I got this book because I enjoyed it a great deal and even LAUGHED REALLY HARD at some parts! It's a very honest adult-oriented tale all about Katchoo (what a curious name!), a very feisty young blonde who would wield a REAL gun at the sudden drop of a hat and her dark-haired girlfriend named Francine who is just so innocent and gullible she'd expect any man - even a real jerk like her womanizing boyfriend, Freddie to be sympathetic with her. But poor Francine got stood up and BADLY INJURIED as a result, so the ANGRY Katchoo decides to take the matters into her own hands! Also tagging along is an angelic-faced Japanese-looking young man who likes Katchoo so much he'd patiently take any man-bashing abuse the old girl would dish out to him! Heck, you'd like the good, funny story all about love, sex, betrayal, friendship, gender issues, and the stuff as well as the really nice artwork that even has some REALISTIC-LOOKING close-ups of the characters! Additional bonus: Terry Moore also includes a handful of rejected but amusing comic strips..."},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"In this short collection of the first three issues of the Strangers in Paradise graphic &quot;Comic Book&quot; series, the reader is introduced to the main characters of the series, Katchoo and Francine. The story centers mainly around the dynamic relationship between the two, and delves deeply into the issues of true love, trust, and friendship. It's hard to remember that Katchoo and Francie aren't real people at sometimes; while the plot is at times fantastic and a bit too action-packed to be quite real, they experience every range of human emotion, and their lives will touch yours. No spandexed, overly-endowed superheroes in this one, and the most surprising fact of all is the accuracy of Mr. Moore's perception of the female psyche. You *really will* laugh and cry with this one. The girls are beautifully drawn and accurately proportioned and the story is superb. You won't be able to stop reading. Someday, like me, you'll bite your nails down to the quick waiting for the next issue to come out and hang on every one of Terry Moore's words."},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"When I first started to read Strangers in Paradise back in 1996, I had to immediatly get my hands on every issue I could possibly find. I coulnd't stop reading this compelling story of Katchoo, Francine, David, and the rest of the deeply molded characters in this book. Terry Moore, dispite being a really friendly guy, has a great storytelling sence- verbally and visually. Although all three of the Strangers in Paradise series are wonderfull, this one takes the cake. A very deep story that will make you laugh, make you cry, and make you love the characters you are reading about. As soon as this collected edition came out, I had to own it, even though I own all of the indiviual comics. What more can I say... buy it, it's just amazing!"},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"I'd heard so many great things about STRANGERS IN PARADISE that I had pretty much assumed that it was going to blow me away. I like it. I enjoy it. But I'm also somewhat underwhelmed.I fundamentally have two major problems with STRANGERS IN PARADISE after the first two volumes. The first is the \\"action\\" elements of the stories. The second are the rather terrible poems that are inserted at various spots. I won't say much about the latter except that the poems and songs are the series \\"weakest link\\" and add nothing to the stories. As far as the action elements go, I find them perplexing. I love Katchoo and Francine and the parts of the books devoted to their everyday lives. It was said of SEINFELD that it was a show \\"about nothing.\\" When STRANGERS IN PARADISE is \\"about nothing,\\" it excels. It is charming, delightful, and riveting. I almost wonder if Terry Moore knew that he had something special, but didn't quite trust it to stand on its own. The \\"action\\" or \\"adventure\\" aspects of the books feel like distractions. I don't want to read about Darcy and Katchoo's dark past and Tambi (especially Tambi!) or any women wearing those stupid tattoos! If Tambi is part of the story, you know it is sucking.I'm going to stick with this, but I really hate Terry Moore for not trusting his characters to stand on their own. This is speculation on my part, but I think that many others who love these comics ignore the Darcy aspects of the stories. I think they ignore them. I can't. I hate the parts dealing with Katchoo's criminal past and feel that they pull the series as a whole down. I already have Volume 3 on my bookshelf and will start reading it almost immediately. I just hope that the series ceases being a somewhat unsuccessful blend of crime and everyday life stories. Katchoo and Francine are great; the thugs and criminals are not."},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"Although the cover of the book says &quot;volume I&quot; I really wouldn't wanna call it that. I think it could be better seen as a &quot;issue #0&quot; or a &quot;get-to-know-the-characters-special&quot; because basically that's what this is. Reading the book is fun, pretty good fun actually. You get to know the characters a little and see a teensy bit of how they are. Volume II though (which is called &quot;I dream of You&quot;) is REALLY volume I because there is where it all really starts. The story goes from there to where it is now. In THIS book &quot;The Collected&quot; you get to know who are gonna be in &quot;Strangers in Paradise&quot; but it's &quot;I dream of You&quot; where the story really begins. So don't see this book as the start of SiP that you HAVE to get but see it more as a nice addition if you like SiP from other volumes. If you miss this one you won't be missing any essential knowledge (like you would if you missed either one of the later volumes), but you should get it anyway because, like I said, it still is great fun to read."},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"Mr. Moores talent takes us further into the lives of Katchoo, Francine and several others in this at times funny, provactive graphic novel. A must read!"},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"Terry Moore's series Strangers in Paradise is a fantasic study of modern life and love. It's about breaking down social stereotypes and learning to love a person for who they are not what they are. It's about true friendship and how hard and how beautiful that is. It's about growing up and knowing yourself and being yourself and rising above your history. It's also an action/adventure thriller with twists and turns and plenty of surprises. There are stories within stories. It's a multilayered, many splendored thing. It's such a good read. Read it."},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"I was late jumping on the SiP bandwagon, but in the end I'm sure glad I did. If it's one thing Terry Moore is good at, is writing stories that pull on the strings of your heart. It's certainly the most unconventional comic to say the least as all of the characters seem like real people, with no superpowers to be found. Yet all of them do have a real villain- reality. The pain of a love relationship gone wrong, gang crime, brutal murders and dissapointment of dying dreams. It is also a book filled with genuine warmth of friendship, romance and happiness that simply doesn't exist in other books.All in all, I recomment this a must read for any comic fan. I do agree with what the reader below me said, that the faces of Casey and Katchoo are almost identical. But it's still a damn good book and I'm sorry to see that it will soon becoming to and end."},{"Title":"Strangers in paradise","review":"This was my first foray into the 'Strangers in Paradise' series, and what an incredible series it is. Infact, it is one of the best comic works I have come across, and I recommend it highly. I am completely excited about reading the rest of Moore's collection and was sorry when this had finished.This pocket book is wonderful value and provides hours of entertainment. I am pleased to see that the series has been compiled, it is just too difficult to find the chronology of little books, and it was the release of these pocket books that inspired me to investigate 'Strangers in Paradise.'The female characters are fleshed out, strong, very real, utterly likable and unlike the female caricatures so common in the comic genre. I particularly loved the high school portion of the work, which charters the beginnings of their intense friendship. As well the Xena story, which is also wonderful and quite funny.Moore's work has a subtle gentle humour and he is quite amazing at nagivating the female psyche. While I wished I could have read the Pocket Book 1 first, it is not impossible to start a 'Strangers in Paradise' journey with this work.But I do suggest you begin it. It is such a wonderful comic."},{"Title":"Me Baby, You Baby","review":"Lovely story with engaging rhyming verse and nicely done illustrations (though why oh why does the white baby lack a sun hat or awning on her stroller!?).

Overall a lovely little book!"},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"This is the first book I ever read by F. Paul Wilson. What a treat I've been missing! Having read Gateways and enjoyed a thrill ride like no other, I plan to read the whole series!Repairman Jack is a man without a history, skirting the edges of society, setting wrongs right. This book opens with Jack inside the home of a private detective who is using the evidence and pictures he gathered about people's personal lives to blackmail them. Jack has been hired by one such person, but destroys the evidence of many blackmailing schemes, trying to set many wrong to right. He's a fringe-of-society character with a strong conscience. You immediately take a liking to Jack.From there this story takes off at blistering speed as Jack travels to Florida to investigate a life threatening \\"accident\\" that his father has been in. Here's where you need to suspend belief, as this story takes a turn toward fantasy, science fiction. It is so well written that you don't have to be a fan of fantasy to enjoy it. The suspense and danger - you actually wonder how on earth the main characters will survive - builds to a breathtaking conclusion.It is so well written that you hate for the story to end. Fortunately there are more Repairman Jack novels to dive into. Though this is the most recent installment in the series, well after the series is established, you can enjoy this book on its own merit. Run, don't walk, to the shelves to buy this book."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"I won't bother to talk about the plot since it's covered by all the previous comments, but I do want to say that \\"Jack is back!\\" (and I don't mean Jack Bauer). I've read all the previous six Jack novels and Wilson has yet to run out of steam.This may sound strange, but I would like to see F. Paul Wilson do a Jack novel without the supernatural element, where Jack just does his \\"repairs\\" on the bad guys ala Equalizer/Godfather style. Most of his books have such subplots unrelated to the main supernatural one, and I find these quite entertaining. I bet Wilson could pull it off."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"I really like Paul's twist on a hero. Repairman Jack is quite a character! I am a little confused on the order of this series now but this one falls right in line with the last one I read (can't remember the title). In this one, he goes to see his father who is in a coma. As the story progresses, his dad recovers and finally gets an inkling of who the real Jack is. In past novels of the series, Gia, his girlfriend is the only one besides Abe who knows more than a little bit about him so this is refreshing to finally see his dad brought in, at least to a point.This story has a great plot and plenty of icky bugs, though at first, the icky bugs are real creatures forced to do the bidding of the crazy chick. Things start to get fun when the real icky icky bugs start coming out of that hole in the swamp. They are not the Rakosh, but something just as bad, if not worse.I can't really say too much bad about this story except a couple of characters die that I was cheering for. Too bad.This series is unique in the realm of horror and I highly recommend it if you are looking for something different. I can't wait until the next one comes out in paperback."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"I've read one other Repairman Jack book, The Haunted Air, and I think I'm going to be hooked. Wilson is master of characterization, giving characters believable personalities even in extreme circumstances. Jack's feelings for his father come through in doses, as he learns about his accident and meets some very odd people surrounding him...and his facing of the supernatural menace is expertly handled. No silly farce but deadly serious. Can't wait to read more Repairman Jack and other Wilson books. I read The Keep a few years ago, and it is excellent also."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"I bought this when it came out in paperback, put it aside, forgot I had it and went on to read several later books in the series before I realized there was a gap in the story line. If you're thinking that this reveals a certain ambivalence towards this long running series by F. Paul Wilson, you would be correct. The combination of high tech and numinous evil does not always ring true and Jack, the Repairman of the stories, sometimes comes off more like an urban folk tale than a real character. For the most part these issues are small and the books are always readable. But there are times when I'm not in a hurry to read them.Gateways turns out to be one of the best of the late books in this series. Jack's father, who has retired to Florida, is hospitalized with a severe coma after a mysterious traffic accident. When Jack comes south to attend his father he discovers suspicious goings on that include weird lights in a swamp and a group of weirdly talented and deformed people who seem to be tied in with the management of the gated community in which Jack's father, Tom, lived. Anya, Tom's neighbor in the retirement community befriends Jack, but he has a lot of trouble believing what she tells him.Out in the swamp is a gateway to The Otherness, a place where The Adversary resides awaiting its opportunity to claim the earth. It is the emanations from this gateway that have warped the denizens of the swamp, human and otherwise. Jack's father has been marked as a sacrifice in opening the way, and so Jack is catapulted into a struggle with Semelee, the young woman who leads the swamp folk, and who believes that she is the one destined to master the planet. It doesn't help that she has a 'fatal attraction' for Jack as well.Jack has encountered the Otherness before, but this time it is not only up close and personal, but it has a face (or two) and a larger part in the story. Jack's role in all this becomes a bit clearer. This novel works well, and the change of scene to Florida is a break from the muddled grays of New York City. If you've been staying away from Wilson, Gateways is an excellent way to get back into the larger story arcs of the series."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"I am an avid reader and longtime Amazon buyer and browser. I have read many reviews, but this is the first time I feel compelled to share my views on a book/series. I'm a big fan of F. Paul Wilson as an author and have read many of his books, including the entire Repairman Jack series. I have enjoyed them all, but I am finding the last few RJ books a letdown. When Wilson first wrote &quot;The Tomb&quot;, the first of the series, he never intended it to be a series and the book was complete and enjoyable. One of my favorite parts about reading &quot;The Tomb&quot; was the depth of description about NYC - it brought me back to what the city was like in the early 1980's before it got so clean and tourist-friendly! Wilson did a wonderful job noticing and describing all the small details of a big city.Now I find that each of the new books is less complete and less enjoyable than the previous one, because nothing ever really happens. We hear about &quot;The Otherness&quot; and see examples, but in the past 4 books, there has been no resolution or any real plot development. And the plot development that does occur seems forced and pedantic: Jack and his dad are now miraculously reunited and surpise! His dad was a sniper in the Marines - just in time for Jack to need a sniper to help him.Each book I read makes it seem like the series is meant to go on indefinitely- which does not make me want to keep reading - it feels more like a TV series than a book. My other complaint is that there seems to be very little character development of Jack himself. He seems amazingly shallow to be of the age he is and living in the biggest city in America. Yes, that is some of the charm of his character, but for a guy that knows an arms dealer and seems to be pretty good in his craft, he has a remarkably slim grasp of the world around him. While the storyline has been updated to the new millenium, the characters seem stuck in 1950's stereotypes.That being said, I know I will keep reading this series because it is interesting enough to keep me coming back and I really want to see how Wilson will address these supernatural issues. I just hope that future books start resolving some of those issues."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"See book summary above.If you liked the previous Repairman Jack novels you'll love this one. If you've not read any of them you might get a little confused as to some of the background (but you'll catch up). Either way you'll enjoy this supernatural thriller.Wilson's ability to pull you into a story is one of the things that makes him one of the best in this genre. His knack of displaying highly visual and sometimes graphic scenes is also a bonus.I don't think I've read anything bad by this author. Keep it up.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"Repairman Jack's got a family problem. His father has been in a car crash and is in a coma in Florida. Despite the fact that for the last 15 years he has had little to do with his family Jack braves a commercial flight to go down and help his dad - however for Jack there are no more coincidences, even far away from his beloved New York.This is a family centric Repairman Jack novel. It was interesting to find out more about his father, but compared to some other instalments in the series it was quite laid back. Despite that, it's a book I enjoyed and makes me want to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"One thing I've noticed from the many horror novels that I've read over the years is that there aren't too many series characters. The reason for this seems obvious; if a character is recurring (especially if he is a likeable hero sort), he is in less danger of perishing at the end of the book. And since part of the joy of horror fiction is in the uncertainty of the protagonist's fate, a series character diminishes that uncertainty. Such is the case with Repairman Jack, hero of a series of books by F. Paul Wilson; although there may be horror elements in these novels, they do not really fit into the genre. Call them dark fantasy or supernatural adventure fiction instead.Actually, Gateways is the first Repairman Jack novel I've read, which is around seven books into the series. In this book, Jack is taken away from his usual New York environment to go to Florida, where his estranged father is in a coma after a car accident. Quickly, Jack begins to get suspicious about the motives behind this hit-and-run accident, believing that the management of his father's retirement community (called Gateways) is offing people to clear space for new customers. Jack is right to a limited extent, but what's going on is actually much more sinister.The Gateways community is near a strange area of the Everglades where mysterious lights appear every equinox and have a mutating effect on the local flora and fauna. Several \\"altered: people have gathered nearby into a sort of clan led by Semelee, a young woman with completely white hair and the ability (with the use of some magic shells) to control animals. Semelee offers sacrifices to the lights, of which the latest was supposed to have been Jack's father. Eventually, Jack and Semelee will be on a collision course, while lurking in the background is the superpowerful evil entity Rasalom, who first appeared in Wilson's early novel (which didn't feature Jack), the Keep.Although in ways a standalone story, it's also evident that Gateways is actually part of a larger story that Wilson is telling, one that involves the Repairman Jack stories and another set of books called the Adversary Cycle. As Anya Mundy, neighbor of Jack's father and a woman of strange knowledge, explains, there is a cosmic war going on between The Otherness and The Ally, of which Earth is only a small part. The Otherness is the \\"evil\\" force (and the source of power behind the Adversary, Rasalom), but The Ally is not necessarily benevolent. Having read only a couple books in the entire Repairman Jack/Adversary sequence, I don't yet have a full sense of this epic story, but I'm intending to find out more.I wouldn't describe Wilson as a great writer, but instead a reliably good one. That means that you can depend on Wilson to entertain and rarely deliver anything mediocre, as opposed to someone like Stephen King, who is sometimes brilliant but is also sometimes weak. Gateways is par for the course for Wilson: a solid four-star effort and worth reading, but probably best read in sequence with the other Repairman Jack novels."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"Repairman Jack is back! This time he travels out of New York to the edge of the Everglades in Southern Florida, where his father is hovering near death following a hit and run accident. Jack moves into the Gateways, his father's retirement community, for the duration of his visit. After talking to residents and employees at the Gateways, having a few unpleasant encounters with a band of mutants living in the Everglades, and uncovering a series of suspicious deaths of the community's elderly residents, he fears that his father's accident was deliberate. He soon decides that things need repairing there too. It appears that the Otherness is back, and Jack has been drawn here to confront the ultimate evil once again.This novel is full of interesting characters. First there's the mutant clan leader Semelee who has special gifts that she is certain set her apart as a Chosen One, and who targets an unwitting Jack as her soul mate. Then there's Anya, an eccentric Gateways resident who watches over Jack and his father and whose green lawn in the midst of drought indicates that she may be more than she seems. Wilson delves into Jack's past and treats the reader to more on the mysterious man's background. And finally, there are some surprising discoveries about Jack's father that indicate that Jack didn't fall that far from the family tree. Now that Jack and his father have come to know each other better, they have a reconciliation that adds depth to the story.The Everglades, in a mingling of the natural and the supernatural, provides an exotic and colorful backdrop for this tale. Otherworldly lights appear semiannually from a sinkhole deep within its wilderness. It harbors fantastic creatures both real and surreal. The Otherness is exerting its influence on both man and beast there. There is information about its natural wonders here too. Even though I am a South Florida resident living in a city bordering the Everglades, I learned some fascinating new facts about its ecology. I recommend this as a great horror story, thriller, and source of background information on the enigmatic Jack. It is hard to put down, and it definitely deserves its 5 star rating.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"Of course, I love all of F. Paul Wilson's books.

Still she cannot get at Jack because a neighbor woman with much power is able to hold the forces of darkness at bay for the moment. When she is overcome, Jack and two surprising allies fight back knowing it could mean their deaths.Fate has something very big in store for Repairman Jack and the author slowly, novel by novel, reveals parts of the plan in which the Ally (Jack's side) battles the Otherness.

It started out with The Keep and ended with an out of print, rare book called Nightworld. Nightworld was an extraordinary book wherein the evil, reborn Rasalom, after a titanic seemingly unwinable battle and against all odds, was vanquished for once and for all, or was he?With Gateways, it seems our illustrious author is leading us back to another cataclysmic clash with this maleficent character, a reprise of sorts or maybe even a reissue of Nightworld, in which Repairman Jack played a significant part. That would explain why Jack seems to have no recollection of major events that happened in a novel written ten years ago. I suppose we will have to wait and see what Wilson has in mind, so let's get to the story at hand.Background on Repairman JackThis is the seventh book involving, the very popular fictional character, Repairman Jack, a character that has become one of the most beloved literary creations since James Bond.Repairman Jack is an unobtrusive looking guy who has slipped in under the government radar. He doesn't exist as far as the government knows. He has no social security number, no credit cards, pays no taxes, pays cash for everything always keeps a low profile.Jack \\"The Equalizer\\". If you remember the TV show of that name from several years ago, that is what Jack does. No he's not \\"The Equalizer\\" but if you've been wronged and you've got the money, Jacks available and Jack can be deadly. He can be your worst nightmare but as nightmares go everything is relative and Jack takes second fiddle in this book as he fights for his and his father's lifePlotJack's seventy year old father, was involved in a hit and run accident and is comatose in the hospital. Jack flies down to be with him and as well as to nose around to see if he can find out what happened.Well the more he finds out, the stranger things get, as Jack seems to have gotten himself involved in yet another supernatural incident involving a young woman who can control animals and older woman with somewhat magical powers.When Jack finally gets to his fathers hospital room he runs into his father's neighbor, the enigmatic Anya, a mysterious seventy-something lady of surprises. She insists that Jack stay in his dad's house so they in effect are neighbors as well. While there Jack discovers that Anya is indeed more than meets the eye.As Jack tries to investigate, his fathers accident many things don't add up, such as the anonymous call about the accident preceding the accident by twenty minutes. He also discovers there have been three unnatural deaths among Gateways residents about three months apart and Jacks dad may fit that pattern.Eventually Jack runs into a white haired girl named Semelee, the defacto leader of a strange group of misshapen young adults called the Clan, that live in the Everglades. Semelee seems to have some advanced knowledge of Jack and also seems to be smitten with Jack, much to the chagrin of Luke, Semelee's wannabe boyfriend.The next day Jack runs into a gardener named Carl who has a lazy eye and apparently no left arm. He later discovers that Carl used to be a member of the deformed group and gets him to lead Jack to the clan's secret lagoon.After a couple days in Florida, with the ostensible help of Anya, Jack's father comes out of the coma and that's when things get really interesting.ConclusionThis is a fun read. A fast moving story of about 370 pages, it may be the most interesting of the Repairman Jack novels since he debuted with the Tomb. The writing is fluid and compelling and we finally get to meet Tom, Repairman Jack's father who is quite a guy himself. You remember him, he's the guy in previous novels that thought Jack repaired appliances.And don't go away folks. The way the book ends is definitely setting up at least one sequel and when it comes to Repairman Jack, that's good news!Final rating 4.6 stars"},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"I have to agree with Kathleen Griffin's note that you should first read &quot;The Barrens.&quot; It lends appreciation to this Repairman Jack piece.Jack heads down to Florida after his father is involved in an auto-accident. There are no more coincidences for Jack, of course, and he finds more going on with his dad than he would ever have expected.The repairs in Gateways are personal and not as layered as those in The Haunted Air or Hosts (for example), but the personal information on Jack's life and the much-needed reconnection with his father make this a more-than-worthwhile read. And, afterall, it is Repairman Jack, and F. Paul Wilson doesn't disappoint here. It'll keep you going from start to finish."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"Repairman Jack is not an appliance repairman as his father has been led to believe. He fixes things that no one else can fix--things that might involve--well--going outside the law. Things that might involve going up against ultimate Evil. In this book, ultimate Evil resides in a sinkhole in the Florida Everglades, right behind the retirement village where his father was living just prior to his near-fatal accident. And of course, Repairman Jack is quickly drawn into the scene and its ever-widening net of sinister complications.Jack is one of the most intriguing characters in current literature and author F. Paul Wilson's signature character. A man with no legal identity, no social security number, he operates in a shadow-land outside the law, yet always fighting for justice. And while Jack is very good at his peculiar line of work, he also yearns for a normal life, with a normal family.So, will Evil be defeated? Will Jack figure out how to emerge from the shadows and marry his long-time girlfriend? Will he even survive? Will existence as we know it survive? You will just have to read the book to find out. Author Wilson is a great story-teller who will keep you turning the pages. I recommend this one. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"Gateways is the 7th entry in the \\"Repairman Jack\\" series, and in many ways, is the strongest one yet. For those who do not know, Repairman Jack is not a handyman but he is a fixer - of the sorts of problems that people have that for one reason or another preclude involving the authorities. Jack is smart, resourceful, trustworthy and completely moral in his own way. But his fixes frequently involve mayhem or even murder (although he tries to avoid killing people unless it's absolutely necessary), and he has a kind of a dark side that asserts itself when something or someone threatens him or one of his loved ones.From the very first Repairman Jack novel, written in 1984 (The Tomb), there has been a strong supernatural element in all the Jack adventures involving a sort of cosmic conflict between two super-uber entities of unimaginable power that are battling for control of all the universes. Somehow Jack has become a major player in this conflict that is an interesting twist on good versus evil; in Jack's universe (which is the same as that depicted in Wilson's \\"Adversary Cycle\\" that starts with \\"The Keep\\" and ends with \\"Nightworld\\") it is the Ally (that exhibits benign indifference to humanity) versus the Otherness (that wants chaos and the destruction of all life). Jack has been drafted by the Ally.Although all the previous entries in the series are set in New York CIty, in Gateways, Jack flies down to Florida to see his estranged father who is in a coma after a near-fatal hit-and run traffic accident. His father lives in a sort of retirement community called Gateways. In the hospital Jack meets his father's neighbor and friend, a spunky elderly widow named Anya who seems to know an awful lot about his father and Jack himself, and who has been watching out for Jack's dad after the accident. Jack's father mysteriously comes out of his coma, Jack finds strange little voodoo like totems around the bed and the room and we're off.Gateways reveals a lot more of the backstory of Jack's father, and his relationship with his son than we have seen before. There are also very interesting and explicit tie-ins with the Adversary Cycle and villains old and new, and many plot twists and turns. I'll say no more about the plot because I don't want to include any spoilers, but from the blurb on the back of the book I thought this was going to be on the boring side. Rather, it turned out to be one of the most revealing, interesting and exciting Repairman Jack entries yet.All the Repairman Jack books stand on their own. but they are so much richer than simple novels if read sequentially. Either way Repairman Jack and Gateways are great and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"Gateways (repairman Jack series).....This book totally blew me away!! I am an avid reader and unfortunately many books leave me wanting, authors like Dan Brown, who is a talented writer but his plots are just downright silly and absurd! This book however, is one of the best combinations or real world with 'other' world throw in to satisfy those who like to be challenged to think and get lost in another universe and entertained at the same time. It reminds me a little bit of Roger Zelany's Amber series, just more involved and grittier. The characters grab you from the first page and you can't put it down!!I went on-line and bought the first in the series before I was even finished with this book and now can't wait to dig into it and see how it started and I look forward to exploring more of this series. In short it's A GREAT READ !!!!!!"},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"Now this is the way to write terrific and superior action/adventure!F. Paul Wilson's 7th Repairman Jack novel is much better than the last one - The Haunted Air - with Jack finally getting away from New York and going into the wilds of Florida's Everglades. A fantastic setting for a fantastic romp full of misfits and witches hiding out in a secret locale in the Glades, coming out every three months to prey on senior citizens in a nearby old folks home called - Gateways.Here is probably the best all around adventure since the 1st novel - The Tomb. Jack helps his dad who is the next victim for the magical misfits of the hidden Glades, thus giving the readers an inside look at Jack's dad, Tom. And he is so much more than he seems! And eventually, he and Jack team up to battle the forces of evil during a hurricane.Gateways never lets up, never gets dull. And F. Paul Wilson never gives his fans rehash from previous novels. (Something another writer who pens the Outlanders series must learn.)But like literary giants of this genre such as James Rollins and Laurence James and Brian Lumley, just to name a few, F. Paul Wilson always seems to deliver all-new material with each and every new novel. Never rehash!There is much mystery and suspence here to balance the action and adventure, with rich characterizations of both Good AND Evil. Something you don't often find.The plot and pace reach and peak finale here, with Jack finally cementing his estranged relationship with his colorful dad, revealing his identity and the truth of his revenge upon his murdered mother. Great stuff, this!If you love top-notch storytelling, along with ever-growing characterizations, as well as hair-raising action and adventure with touches of sci-fi-horror-fantasy, then this series is for you.But according to the sales rankings, the high-mark reviews, it seems that the vast majority of people already know. And that my wife and I are the late-comers. But better late than never, eh?Hollywood and/or cable TV conglomerates really outta take a look at this awesome series, and think about making it a major motion picture movie event. It would make a mint!We can't wait to read the next installment of Repairman Jack."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"F. Paul Wilson continues his enormously popular Repairman Jack series and tells his readers more about Jack's family history in the seventh exciting volume, Gateways. Repairman Jack is absolutely the most intriguing series character running today -- a mercenary with no official identity but a solid moral foundation, he \\"fixes\\" situations that are outside the realm of normal legal channels and that generally involve some supernatural elements. And I wait eagerly for the release of each succeeding entry.When a hit-and-run puts his father Tom in a coma, Jack is the only family member available to go to the Florida Everglades-area retirement village where Tom lives (also called Gateways) and find out what happened. There he discovers odd animal behaviors, and learns more about his father than he ever expected. He also learns even more about his role in the plan to defeat the Otherness, and how he has increasingly less control over the events that surround him. And he finally meets the Adversary (the enigmatic \\"Sal Roma\\") face to face.He also meets two women who have major influences on what happens: Tom's friend and neighbor Anya, who knows more than she lets on (and has an even more important role as the story progresses); and Semmelee, a young, white-haired zoomancer with ambitions that can only get her into real trouble. These two will help and hinder Jack in their own particular ways as he faces his biggest and most important repair job yet.Kudos to F. Paul Wilson for crafting a nearly perfect thriller that can stand on its own, and also manages to continue a larger story within its pages. Also for threading environmental concerns within Gateways in a way that is only noticeable if you are looking for it. Some authors would make their agenda too heavy for the story to handle, but Wilson's subtlety lends a lightness to those sections, so you can see the mutant creatures as something that humans have caused, or simply as horrific obstacles that Jack must overcome -- much like in Hugh B. Cave's The Dawning. Meanwhile, more people die and Jack really learns what it means to have coincidence removed from his life. (Lesser kudos to Wilson for also managing to write, so far, two novels involving various of Jack's family members without once mentioning their last name. That must have required a lot of work in itself, especially since I didn't realize it until I was finished with this one.)Gateways felt a little long in spots (though The Haunted Air is one hundred pages longer), but there is that extra layer of emotion present (as Jack's relationship with his father takes center stage) that makes it into more than just a pure thriller. Abe, Gia, and Vicky hardly appear at all, which makes me believe that a lot of cutting was required to even get it down to this manageable length. Seven novels in, however (with heavy revisions on at least two Repairman Jack-related books), Wilson has not lost any steam. In fact, I would say that, with the larger story working toward its conclusion, the books from this point on can only get even more exciting."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"This entry in the Repairman Jack series doesn't feature quite as many of the usual set piece where Jack helps people get even, but it doesn't need them either. The strength of this book comes in the exploration of Jack's relationship with his father, which is brought about when Jack's elderly dad is injured in a car accident in Florida. The Everglades makes for a great setting in this latest battle with The Otherness, while the colorful cast of characters and action-packed adventure make this book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"Warning: You should first read Wilson's brilliant short story &quot;The Barrens.&quot; The novel will impress without that background, but with it there are greater depths and the mention of nexus points are more ominous.Jack reluctantly encounters his family when his father, recently relocated to a Florida retirement community, is in a terrible car accident. After supercilious years of looking down on his father as an innocent unacquainted with &quot;real&quot; life, Jack discovers a ruthless, extremely self-disciplined, and honorable man. This Korean War veteran and Marine sniper is his father -- and unrealized role model.The Everglades are wonderfully evoked here, with touches of Zora Neale Hurston's lush description. The novel picks up the pathos of the &quot;clan&quot; of nexus-deformed persons trapped by their &quot;home.&quot; Carl, the only one to escape to near-normal life, is touching and charming.Anya is a great creation, and her dog Oyv is perfect. Apparently she'll turn up in the future -- but could Wilson bring back Oyv too?"},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"I found this one to be much better than the last one I read in the series. Repairman Jack is back and intent on taking the battle to The Otherness. He is still not convinced that he is a chosen warrior despite mounting evidence.

( the animal themselves are not bad..Semelee makesthem be that way.)"},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"I love this series! Along with The Haunted Air, Gateways is my favorite Repairman Jack book. It's set in my homestate of Florida. It was a hoot to see Florida through the eyes of someone (Jack) who had never been here before. I also enjoyed the interaction between Jack and his father. We learned so much about Jack, the man he is and the man he could have become if circumstances had been different. This was a wonderful addition to an already great series!"},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"This was a delicious blend of frightful supernatural and contemporary crime-buster. I am reminded often of Pendergast from Preston and Child's thrillers. I enjoyed how Gateways took the story out of the city and set it in the Everglades - it gave the series a new flavor and brought in a sizzle of adventure (hurricanes! crocodiles!) that we needed!"},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"If you have been reading the Repairman Jack novels, you don't need to read any further...in fact, you are probably already putting this one on hold for yourself or checking it out (if it's on the shelf). If you are new to the series or haven't heard of it yet, this is a good one. Jack's story started in The Tomb way back in 1984. At one point it seemed to have ended (with the world as we know it) in Nightworld in 1992/1993. But Wilson (thankfully!) has decided to go back and fill in the missing years of Jack's life between The Tomb and the beginning of the Nightworld trilogy. This is (I believe) the sixth of those fill in the blank novels. Jack is fix-it man. If someone is blackmailing you, you call Jack to...take the pressure off. He is an &quot;invisible&quot; man. He has no social security number. He looks like your average Joe. But he's an amazing fighter and arms expert. Since The Tomb, though, he has been running in to supernatural problems. It helps to read the books in order, but it's not 100% necessary. In this installment, Jack leaves his beloved New York city (and his near complete anonymity therein) to fly to Florida to check on his Dad who has had a run in with--well, I won't spoil anything, but I will say it is connected to Jack's main adversary &quot;The Otherness&quot; Check out the series if you haven't. Stephen King is the president of the Repairman Jack fan club. If you read one, you'll be a member too!"},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"This here is 7th Repairman Jack novel, and the first to leave the New York City area Jack makes his home ground. Responding to a emergency with his father, Jack travels south and gets involved with deformed Southerners. Excellent ending to this one, while Jack fights the Otherness in the midst of hurricane Elvis."},{"Title":"Gateways","review":"For those new to this series, Repairman Jack is a man who doesn't officially exist. He has gone to great lengths to have no social security number, no tax records, etc. When people have a problem, he's available to fix it. For a price. Gateways is a bit of a departure from the norm as Jack heads to Florida after his father is injured and fallen into a coma. Rather than working for a client, Jack investigates his father's accident and soon learns that there's a lot more going on than the police had suspected. Aided by his dad's mysterious neighbor, Anya, Jack struggles against a clan of deformed criminals and their shamanistic leader.Gateways is a bit shorter than many of the Repairman Jack novels and the benefit is a leaner story with few lulls. Things move along at a good clip and the climax is definitely satisfying. The characters are solid, if not spectacular. Jack's father is pretty interesting as he shares his military background and even proves helpful to Jack in his confrontations with the bad guys. The villains were somewhat disappointing, though. Semelee, a witch woman who can control animals, is more of a petulant adolescent than a worth adversary and her bodyguard/boyfriend Luke is a completely generic muscleheaded buffoon. The Adversary puts in an appearance, a high point to be sure.Wilson knows how to tell a good yarn, but he has some idiosyncrasies that I dearly wish he'd address. First, he inserts social commentary into his novels that is so blatant that he might as well have a banner line proclaiming \\"We interrupt this novel to bring you the following public service announcement!\\" Thankfully, this book's dissertations on the state of the Florida Everglades and the problem of old people's fear of becoming a burden to their children were relatively brief but Wilson badly needs to stop his rants or learn how to integrate them into the story much better than he currently does. He has a few other quirks, like using a kind of gutter English for the third person narration of the scenes involving Semelee, that are also distracting and unnecessary.Overall, Gateways wasn't a bad read. It was a definite step backward fromThe Haunted Air : Repairman Jack (Repairman Jack) (Repairman Jack), the prior book in the series, but is mostly solid. There is good action mixed with supernatural elements. Jack is tough as nails, but his sense of honor and decency make him easy to root for. Established fans should be happy with Gateways, but newcomers might do better to start withThe Tomb (Adversary Cycle/Repairman Jack)so they can see how Jack got his start."},{"Title":"THE AMATEUR GENTLEMAN","review":"Jeffrey Farnol is not much remembered, but he seems to have been popular at the time he was writing. I read this book because I heard that Farnol was an important influence on Jack Vance, a science fiction writer I like.This book concerns Barnabas, a young (about 22) son of an English innkeeper who inherits a substantial fortune. He decides to try to join London's fashionable world, and has some success for a while. He becomes friends with a Viscount, has a stumbling romance with a Lady, gets into tons of fistfights, does some horse racing. Eventually, it is discovered that he is only an innkeeper's son, though, and he loses his place in the fashionable world. I think you get the idea.The first part of the book went slowly, and so did the last part. The middle was more interesting to read. Overall, the book was well written and enjoyable."},{"Title":"THE AMATEUR GENTLEMAN","review":"The young Barnabas has just inherited a vast sum of money from his uncle's death.

It's everything you need if you&#65533;re just starting out in the Jewish kitchen or in a kitchen in general. The only real complaint I have is that the recipes are very basic and that there aren't enough to go around. Also, many to the recipes take longer to make than listed in the book, especially when you first start making them.

It seems the author got in a jam trying to include the old favorites, but not wanting her recipes to be the same as in other books. Instead of deciding up front to give recipes that are new and modern, but in the spirit of traditional holiday cooking, she tampers with the traditional ones, not to good effect. This leads to recipes that are neither here nor there.For instance, she says about her recipe for Jewish apple walnut cake, \\"This style of apple cake has long been a popular Jewish dessert\\", and then gives a recipe full of orange juice and zest, omitting the traditional sour cream or buttermilk, and not even baked in the traditional bundt cake shape. All the orange flavor overwhelms the taste of the apples, and ruins the cake, IMO, and the texture is wrong. Whatever her cake is, it has never been \\"a popular Jewish dessert\\".Traditional cheese blintzes are hard to make these days, and almost impossible if you are kosher because the pot cheese that was used is almost unavailable outside non-Kosher Polish ethnic food stores. It was a little softer and drier than present-day farmer cheese, and cottage cheese is even worse--much tougher curds & much more watery. It is understandable that she added some (non-traditional) cream cheese to the farmer cheese to make the texture more like pot cheese, but what is the purpose of including cottage cheese in the filling, which moves it in the wrong direction? And why create an extra step to making the thin crepes by melting butter and trying to mix it into the batter, when the crepes can be quickly cooked in a buttered pan? No one I knew ever did it that way.And the potato-onion fritters known as latkes have always been served w/ plain applesauce. They are wonderful like that, and the lengthy prep they need make them a particularly appreciated, seasonal treat. Her recommended cinnamon-flavored applesauce clashes w/ the oniony latkes. They are seasoned only w/ salt & pepper, so spiced applesauce just tastes wrong, as though you put it on top of hash browns. Mind you, I love spicy Morroccan chickpea tagines, so I have nothing against spices. It doesn't work in this context. Less important is that there is no purpose to the baking powder in the latke recipe.There are occasional errors in technique, like telling the cook to core peppers after they are grilled instead of before. These make cooking harder than it need be.These are just a few examples of the many additions that are not improvements, done, I think, to change the recipe from those readily available online, put there by home cooks. I advise you to use those, and any advice you can get from an experienced Jewish grandmother. Furthermore, all the gilding the lily she does makes already labor-intensive recipes even lengthier. Be aware that these are mostly holiday and special occasion recipes (including the Sabbath), and most women won't want to spend the necessary time on a weekday to prepare them.Though she does explain kashrut, the recipes often suggest non-Kosher cheeses, and include dairy in some side dishes that are often eaten alongside meat or poultry, so an inexperienced reader planning a Kosher meal needs to be careful.The underlying problem is, w/ all the nostalgic Jewish recipes available online, there may have been no need for a book like this, and the author spoiled the recipes a bit in trying to justify writing it."},{"Title":"Jewish Cooking For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"A complete waste of $$$, very few recipes.

However, one really needs to read White Wolf first to fully enjoy the many characters on this journey."},{"Title":"White Nights (Leisure historical romance)","review":"Up until I read my first Susan Edwards book, Summer of the Eagle, I've always disliked western/native american related romances. Not because of the culture or race, but because the few that I had read before I found to be very lacking and boring. But Ms. Edwards writes a fantastic, romantic, and adventurous story that just happens to be set in a western era, in this case the long trail to Oregon, the land of opportunity back then. You'll find yourself pulled right into the story, and you won't be able to put it down until it's over!Ericia and James' story is a very touching one, and I found myself sighing with pleasure and even about to wipe away a stray tear or two. Their love is strong, true, and not just based on the sexual things, like some relationships. Don't get me wrong-- the sexual aspect of the love story is important and enjoyable, but it's not everything. Though the love scenes in White Nights are steamy and tender, they also show you the emotions behind their connection. Their love starts out as more of a sweet, pure love and it's a while before they do more than kiss, something that would usually bother me or make the story slow, but in this case, it only adds to the over all goodness of the book.Challanges and road blocks create a rocky path for their love to travel on, but they still manage to over come it in the end. White Nights is more than just a book about love, it's also about family and friends, moving on and starting over. Ericia's husband, Birk, is a real bas**d, I'm sorry to say but it's true. He abused her and their small children, he treated her without respect, and he didn't care one bit about any of them. Because of this, both Ericia and the children have been scarred by the father's action, and they are scared and shy, until James shows them that he loves them all and he wants to be part of their family, that he will take care of them forever. The change doesn't happen over night, but watching the children warm up to him and come to call him Papa, along with the charming love story brewing between him and Ericia, makes the story that much better.Though I wish I had the first couple of books in Ms. Edwards White Series, so that I could have read them in order, it is not necessary to do so. You could go out and pick up this book right now *Though you'd better hope your library has it, since almost all of her books, this one included, have been out of print for a few years now. I was lucky to find most of them at my used bookstore in town.* and you wouldn't be lost. However, you may find yourself becoming interested in the various other character's lives and love stories, some of which have already been written and some that have yet to have their own story, and want to go back and read all of the previous ones right away. I know I do! I'm especially interested in reading Wolf's story, but I haven't been able to find it yet...4.5/5 STARS! An amazing western based romance that is filled with sparks and tears, love and adventure, family and life. A simple story line made so much better by the characters, diaglouge, and gentle love story."},{"Title":"White Nights (Leisure historical romance)","review":"This time it is Eirica Macauley's story! The emigrants of the wagon train saw Birk Macauley drown and his body washed away. However, with all the abusing he committed against Eirica, even as she was eight months pregnant, and his three small children, no one was going to miss him! Eirica vowed to continue to Oregon, claim land in her own name, and raise her children with love. They would never fear a man again!James Jones had fallen for Eirica before the wagon train had even began. Since she was married, he kept his distance. That did not stop him, his sister, and a few others from secretly protecting Eirica and the kids from Birk. Now that she was a widow, James let his feelings known. Eirica, having tasted freedom, was determined never to fall into the trap of marriage again! James had his work cut out for him.Birk was very much alive though and was catching up to his wife and children. No matter what happened, it was always Eirica's fault and he planned to make her pay! Revenge! With murder on his mind, Birk and an old drinking buddy were making evil plans for many of the people who dared to be helping his wife, his property!*** Once again Susan Edwards has written a story guaranteed to please! This story shows how hard it was for the emigrants and all the dangers they faced! The story had me cheering one moment and holding my breath the next. Susan Edwards is able to bring alive more than just the main hero and heroine too! All Eirica's friends have their own personalities and histories! Each tale in this series is a stand-alone story, but those who follow the series get to see cameos from other books. This interaction makes the stories all the more real! A winner! ***"},{"Title":"White Nights (Leisure historical romance)","review":"Another story of the Oregon trail in 1856. If you read White Wolf, you won't want to miss this one.

She is never going to trust a man again, to give another man the power to hurt her and her children.James loves her. He wants to make a home with her and her lovely children and some of their own. He aches for her and can't live without Eirica even though she is pregnant of her fourth child. He is determined to win her trust and her love.They will find several obstacles to their love, greatest of all that her husband Rick is not dead but determined to take her back.I found love and courage and sacrifice in all these wonderful families that had the same goal: reach oregon and have lands of their own and settle down."},{"Title":"White Nights (Leisure historical romance)","review":"The book picked up about a month after White Wolf with great ease. You really feel for Eirica and her past and James and his daunting challenge of trying to help her move beyond that past and work for a future together. Very Highly recommended but reading White Wolf then White Nights works best but both are a stand alone story in itself."},{"Title":"White Nights (Leisure historical romance)","review":"I am shocked I didn't find this book interesting. I tried and tried, but I lost interest almost immediately. The reviews are great on this, but I couldn't seem to find what they saw that I missed.The story dragged to the point of yawning. Too much details on how to make beans and bacon on an open fire and too much conversation about nothing between secondary characters made me cringe and want to flip to the end to find out what happened to Eirica.I liked the promise in the storyline, but felt like the author wasn't concentrating enough on the main character of an abused and broken woman who was trying to start her life over with 3 kids and one on the way. The male lead of James Jones was too tame and boring for me and found him non-essential to the story.I really wish I could've enjoyed the book since everyone else did, but I am sorry to say I found it terribly lacking but will try this author again to see if maybe I missed something this time.Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"NASCARFor Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))","review":"NASCAR for Dummies is definitely a &quot;must read&quot; for any NASCAR fan. It is the perfect book for those who are new to NASCAR... and is packed with information which even a veteran fan will appreciate.You'll find in-depth information about a variety of topics, from car tech to how qualifying works... from how points are awarded to what some of the rules and regulations are. You'll find information about all of the different NASCAR Series, how sponsorship works, how to contact your favorite driver - or even get an autograph. There's even advice and tips for attending races in person.The book is also loaded with NASCAR stats on different drivers, tracks and some of the sports history.The best part about this book is that it is not written by a bystander, rather, it is written by one of the top drivers in the sport. Mark Martin is able to provide you with a view of NASCAR which I have not seen in any other book thus far."},{"Title":"NASCARFor Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))","review":"Mark is an awesome driver and now he's written an awesome book! I've been a NASCAR fan for several years and this book helps answer some of the questions I've had about the sport. Mark gives info on tracks, drivers, rules and how a stock car runs. I recommend this book to all NASCAR fans, male or female, those new to the sport or those who have been following it for years. GO MARK!"},{"Title":"NASCARFor Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))","review":"My boss once jokingly told that's what NASCAR is about: turn left and hit the gas.Then I went to the Alllstate 400 at the Brickyard and now I've read Mark Martin's NASCAR FOR DUMMIES. It's looking a little more complicated than fast left turns.The author's enthusiasm for the sport of NASCAR racing is contagious. As the driver of the Viagra-sponsored car #6 in the Nextel Cup series, he ought to know what he's talking about from the inside out and about 188 mph.Chapter 1 ('NASCAR Racing-the best sport around', pp. 9-24) tells you how men (well, mostly men) driving cars that look vaguely like your father's Taurus ended up racing them around oval tracks in front of millions of spectators and television viewers and why you couldn't possibly not be excited about this. Like most professional sports, NASCAR has acquired corporate sponsors. It is arguably the most logo-plastered sport in the world, a fact that Martin explores in 'The Big Business of NASCAR' (ch. 2, pp. 25-34). Martin convinces you that that's a good thing, and before you know it, you know the primary car sponsors as well as the drivers and their car numbers.The rest of the book takes you from zero to sixty in a fairly easy stretch of reading. If, like me, you started this book after attending a race or two and just getting at toe-hold on the sport, you won't end up an expert. But you'll be in good shape to understand the basics of every major area of the sport and to learn more as your exposure grows.Mark Martin is not a great writer, but you don't buy the Dummies series for great writing. You buy Tolstoy if you want great writing. What Martin effectively does is lets you know that there's a whole lot more to NASCAR racing than you thought when you got yourself into this, but that you can learn a fair chunk of it pretty quickly. It's also organized as a handy reference book for when you need to go back to look up a topic you breezed over a little quickly on the first go-around.I bought this book because there's a strong NASCAR culture in the company I joined. My boss sponsors the 18, driven by Bobby Labonte. See, I knew how to say that right. You can too. Buy the book."},{"Title":"NASCARFor Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))","review":"I bought this book in 2004 when I first started getting into Nascar, and even back then it was a little outdated. Now, with all the changes in rules and even teams, its more than \\"a little outdated\\". One of the chapters includes a list of drivers to watch for in the future, including Champion Matt Kenseth and Dale Earnhardt Junior along with some drivers who barely race now. Even the information on tracks is past tense by now. For instance, we went to Lowe's Motor Speedway and followed his information on where race shops were located, only to discover that 90% of those had moved to different cities/locations. There are some basics in here that the newbie might appreciate, but be warned that it isn't up to date."},{"Title":"NASCARFor Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))","review":"As a die-hard NASCAR fan since 1984 I hate to admit all the things that I learned from this book.This book is great at explaining the NASCAR scoring system and how the purse is divided not to mention all these bonuses that are available even if you have the best finish using a brand of motor oil.This is a must buy book for old and new NASCAR fans."},{"Title":"NASCARFor Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))","review":"I wanted to learn about NASCAR and knew nothing about it... and this book did a good job of introducing it to me. My one complaint is it doesn't talk enough about what's going on in the actual races, and I still feel a little lost about what exactly is happening on the track, how exactly the race works, and what specific strategies the drivers are using. A little more on the actual racing and this book would've been perfect.

And he is the author of this book, \\"NASCAR for Dummies.\\" First, let's put it on the record: NASCAR stands for National Association for Stock Car Racing, founded way back in 1947 by Bill France. Some of the series associated with NASCAR: Sprint Cup (once known as Winston Cup), the premier series; Craftsman Truck Series; Nationwide Series (once known as the Busch series); etc. (See Chapter 3 for much more detail).This volume, structured as all \\"For Dummies\\" works, features a discussion of the many features of NASCAR that the neophyte would want to know. \\"For Dummies,\\" if the reader is not familiar with it, \\". . .are written for those frustrated and hard-working souls who know they aren't dumb, but find that the myriad. . .of issues. . .make them feel helpless.\\" Some examples of what is covered:Chapter 2 examines the business of NADCAR, focusing in the critical financial support of sponsors. It costs a lot of money to build cars, hire and train crews, pay for drivers, and so on. Sponsors pay, for example, to have their decals prominently displayed on the car. Souvenirs, too, are big business (shirts, caps, and so on).Chapter 6 looks at the nature of the race team. The owner \\"is the boss.\\" Owners include Joe Gibbs (Hall of Fame football coach of the Washington Redskins), Richard Childers, Jack (The Cat in the Hat) Roush, and so on. The Crew Chief is a critical actor, making race day decisions as to when a car should pit, hoe many new tires should be added, how the set up the car even before the race. Then, the rest of the team--pit crew (tire changers, tire carriers, gas man, jack man, catch can man--See Chapter 10 for a lot more detail); engine specialist; tire specialist; engineers; fabricators; engine builders; etc. In short, there are a lot of employees here, getting back to Chapter 2, showing why lots of money is needed. Chapter 7 looks at another key person on the team--the driver.There are a lot of chapters in this book; the above stands as a mere sampling. In passing, a few other key chapters if one wants to understand more about NASCAR: Chapter 9--race day strategy (pit stop gambles, tough calls such as 2 or 4 new tires [fewer tires lead to a quicker pit stop]); Chapter 16--greatest CASCAR drivers (e.g., Bobby Allison, Jeff Gordon, Rusty Wallace, Cale Yarborough, Richard Petty); Chapter 13--the tracks (from short tracks like Martinsville to the superspeedways at Talladega and Daytona Beach).So, want to know more about NASCAR? Here's a good starting point."},{"Title":"NASCARFor Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))","review":"I bought this book because my son is a fan of NASCAR, of which I knew nothing until I bought the book.It is very interesting and informative.The information is also of the type you don't realize you need.

Specifically, that of the Dziga Vertov Group's (Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin) wildly experimental films. Save for \\"Tout va Bien\\" (bless you Criterion!), these films are rarely seen. I'll probably never have a chance to see \\"Vent d'Est\\" or \\"British Sounds\\", but thanks to Colin MacCabe's book, I can read about them.The books features many great stills so that one can get a sense of what the film looked like. MacCabe, author of \\"Godard: A Portrait of the Artist at 70\\", provides astute analyses of these often difficult films. The book itself is rather small and the print is tiny, but that in no way diminishes its significance. It is the most detailed study available on the Dziga Vertov films and provides vital insight into Godard's future works. Films such as \\"Numero Deux\\", \\"Hail Mary\\", and \\"Prenom: Carmen\\" build off of principals started during this experimental time in the late 60s and early 70s.

That is not the case with \\"The Guest of Quesnay\\" which was originally serialized in \\"Everybody's Magazine\\" between November of 1907 and April of 1908. Tarkington moves the story out of Indiana, and more importantly moves away from the good man up against the bad world theme which had become much too repetitive.The scene of the action moves to Europe, where Tarkington had based a couple of his shorter novels (\\"Monsieur Beaucaire\\", and \\"His Own People\\") though this story isn't anything like those. The story is told by an American who is living in France and who dabbles at painting. The story is one which is cleverly crafted, dealing with the narrators, friends, acquaintances, and the famous and/or notorious figures which exist for purposes of the story. While Tarkington probably gives too many hints as to where his story is going and the surprises along the way, as he often did, it is not nearly as transparent a story as many of his others. That, along with it not having the same basic theme makes this one an interesting read and one of his books to read if you are interested in his best works.Of the novels which he had written up to this point, I would rank this one second only to \\"The Two Vanrevels\\", and I would also consider his collection of short fiction based on his political career \\"In The Arena\\" to be slightly superior to this work. This would be the last novel for Booth Tarkington for several years, until \\"The Flirt\\" which was published in December through February of 1912-1913. In the interim, he published a shorter work titled \\"Beasley's Christmas Party\\" and a couple of plays titled \\"The Man from Home\\" and \\"Beauty and the Jacobin\\"."},{"Title":"Beyond Today: Words of Wisdom for the Road Ahead","review":"I have a hard time thinking of all the bad things that happen and how hard life is for me right now, and this book helps me to look &quot;Beyond Today&quot;.

A review of the CTV infrastructure then serves as an introduction to cable modems, with emphasis on the DOCSIS standard. The book is rounded off with a short chapter on the current competition in the US between the two technologies.It is helpful that examples of commercial products implementing technologies described are given wherever possible. I feel that the information in the chapter on DSL can be consolidated, as it seems certain that some DSL technologies will not see commercial use, and there is much in common amongst the various flavours which merit shared treatment.

I still don't know the answer to that, and after a while I didn't care as I found my interest waning as yet another innocent virgin or wanton hussy (or sometimes both) ended up in the papal bed.

Whoever is an open minder or wonder about the teachings of the church should read this book. The Catholic church is going under a struggled to keep its believers and this book tells us why. The writer tells us about the influence Queens had over the popes and how poorly Popes were following the church's own rules (orgies,murder,money,same sex lovers...etc.) just to have the power the position of a Pope had. However, somethings have change within the church now our days. Priests are still longing for a normal sexual life while keeping their faith to God and their preaching, but since celibate is still a mayor rule for priests, they find themselves commiting crimes involving children and honest belivers. Nothing is being heard about orgies anymore or about homosexual popes or about queens ruling over popes. On the other hand, I must recognized the work the two privious Popes have done for the church and its integrity. I just hope that the next pope follows the truly believes of Jesus for the sake of us and reforms the Catholic church. I truly enjoyed this book because I was on guilt stage for being lesbian and not following the bible or attending mass.

Others may find that a weakness in the lack of endless &quot;scholastic&quot; efforts to document every work by reference to &quot;previous scholars.&quot; Well, for the minority among us who are &quot;academia,&quot; that may be of interest. But for the ordinary reader, there is sufficient substantiation, and the book retains its vitality instead of succumbing to mind-numbing scholarly endedavor.

If one isn't a hidebound statistician, or a blindly faithful Catholic Cleric, then this book will be a great source of wondrous information, with relevance to the religious events and practices of the past centuries as well as to the present day's less than presentable (reported and unreported) practices of many of the Church's selected clergical leaders. By all means, everyone should read this book, in the interests of presentation of all the facts, whether they agree with the book or not.

Overall, I thought it was a wonderful read. I've read quite a few salacious history books, but not any on popes until now. Overall, I agree with the latest reviewer, that a lot of it is speculation, hearsay or gossip, but on the other hand, that's also one of its best features.It does have a slow start, starting with the foundations of Christendom and sex and stewards of the early Church, but once it gets into the medieval and Renaissance periods, things really kick into high gear. There are some popes that are definitely given a bit of extra weighting compared to others, so it does make for a somewhat imbalanced read once you get about three-quarters of the way through. (You'll wonder - \\"Why am I still reading about Alexander VI, six pages later? In the third chapter, there were at least 30 popes!\\")Overall, I thought it was enjoyable, but probably not very factual. If you like gossipy, salacious history of figures of power, (or popes at least), then I definitely recommend this book. If you're extremely picky about rumors or gossip and want 'just the facts', then you'll probably be wanting to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Sex Lives of the Popes","review":"It may be the 21st century, but things in the world of the Catholic clergy haven't changed much. Although the title is Sex Lives of the Popes, it really covers not only the popes, but also their entire supporting cast as well.One of the chapters lists four questions posed to every priest about to be consecrated a bishop:Have you sodomized a boy?Have you fornicated with a nun?Have you sodomized any four-legged animals?Have you committed adultery?I guess that about sums it up. And, after reading the book, every one of them was a liar. If they got rid of everyone who answered the questions honestly, there would be no one left!As Pope Innocent IV put it, \\"When we came we found three or four brothels. We leave behind but one. But it extends without interruption from the eastern to the western gate.\\"The nuns weren't any better. In France, convents were known as palaces of pleasure.The popes were no different from the kings. They craved power and materialism, and they even had an army. Religion had nothing to do with it.

We know Dennis and Rosemary and were in the Raleigh congregation at the same time. We left sooner though when things started falling apart. He does a good job explaining what happened to him. I'm glad he's found his way back to his spiritual roots, as we have. Different roots but orthodox nevertheless. It's so much easier to read the Bible now, isn't it Dennis?! I'll bet anyone who has been caught up in a cultish organization will find this a very familiar story."},{"Title":"The God That Prevailed: One Man's Search for Spiritual Truth from Catholic Seminary to Herbert Armstrong's Cult, and His Amazing Return to His Faith","review":"Unlike Dennis Embo, I was not a \\"cradle Catholic\\", but I can relate to just about everything else he discusses in his book.One, Dennis tells us of his frustration with the lack of strong, positive teaching by the church during his teen years. I was not a regular church-goer as a child, but as a teen looking for direction in life, the churches I attended were either too strict and demanding (like pushing conversion now! down your throat because you might die on your way home after rollor-skating with a church youth. I'm not kidding! These things happen in the American Mid-West!) or so liberal that one of them said we ought to have a loose-leaf Bible to add and subtract whatever we wanted from the Scriptures.Dennis's experiances in becoming a member of the Worldwide Church are simular to mine. We both heard the World Tomorrow radio broadcast in our mush-brain teen years. Both of us ordered the free literature in mass quanities. We eagerly devoured each issue of the Plain Truth magazine to \\"understand\\" what was really happening in the world. And both of us failed to do wide reading on the subjects the broadcast, the magazine, the books and the booklets discussed. Like most kids, we were very narrow in our focus, and the literature the church put out, in my opinion, encouraged that narrow focus. We were encouraged to read news magazines and to watch world events, but this actually encouraged the narrowness of mind. For the church's gloom and doom prophecy teachings discouraged trust in the basic institutions of society and made you believe the Worldwide Church was your only hope in this world and the next one.The cocooning of a committed member from his former life is very well described by Dennis. Weekly Sabbaths, yearly holy days and annual festivals, activities such as Spokesmens Clubs, garage sales, youth groups, singles groups, and parties were designed to replace the social life we lost when we became members of \\"God's Church\\". As long as a person was a \\"true believer\\" this tactic worked to keep the Flock in the Armstrong sheepfold.However, a wolf called reality had a tendency to trouble the sheep with the inconsistencies of life in the Worldwide. In my time, (1973-81) it was the moral scandals, financial impropriaties, and the hypocritical way that all of these problems were handled that troubled and drove a lot of us away from the chuch. In Dennis's time, it was the massive change of church doctrine from sabbatarianism to a mutated form of evangelicalism that caused massive disenchantment and splitting from the Mother Church in Pasadena. The honest, truely committed members who have sacrified so much to belong to \\"God's Church\\" were not going to buy the shuck and jive job Joe and Co. was giving them. They have been taught by the ministry and Mr. Armstrong what to believe. They left for the newly formed spin-offs. Others just drifted away, not knowing what to do. A small minority of us went back to Protestantism. An even smaller minority of us became Catholics.This is where the book really picks up steam for me. There are many converison stories by ex-Armstrongites who converted to Protestant Evangelicalism/Fundamentalism, but now we're starting to see some conversion stories that tell about ex-Worldwiders coming into the Catholic Church. Dennis's story about reverting (and my converison) are about the same. Both of us were forced by inconsisties we saw in Protestantism to take a long look at the scorned Catholic Church. We both found that the Catholic Church could prove it's claims of being the church founded by Jesus Christ. It has an unbroken history going back to 33 A.D. It's doctrines have been the same thoughout it's history. No Pope, in his offical capacity, has ever taught false doctrine. The church has had moral scandals and problems with heritical teachers, but it has always triumphed over them in the long run. We both realized that Protestantism could not be remotely compared to the Church founded on the Rock. The Protestant churches had no history prior to 1517, their leaders have always taught heresy, and their churches have always fallen away from even the smallest bit of Catholic truth that they had.Yes, I like this book. It speaks to me in a very heartfelt way. I went through some experiances that parallel Dennis's. I recommend this book to any one interested in history of Armstrongism, but I especially recommend it to all ex-Armstrongites, for they need to know that the Catholic Churh is the pillar of truth they have been looking for all their lives, rather than the so-called \\"Plain Truth\\" of Herbert W Armstrong and his clones."},{"Title":"The God That Prevailed: One Man's Search for Spiritual Truth from Catholic Seminary to Herbert Armstrong's Cult, and His Amazing Return to His Faith","review":"Among the many books that have been written about (or as a result of) the Worldwide Church of God's transmogrification from an aberrant fundamentalist seventh-day Sabbatarian adventist sect into a generic, uninteresting, shrinking American evangelical Protestant denomination, there is one title in particular that has been of greater interest to me. That is Dennis Embo's \\"The God That Prevailed,\\" which tells the story of his spiritual journey from Catholicism to Armstrongism to Calvinism and finally back to Catholicism.One reason for my interest in Embo's book is that, although we have never met, he and I have been in contact with each other via email since Fall 2001, a few months after his return to the Catholic Church and more than a year after my conversion to Catholicism. Past affiliation with the Worldwide Church of God and conversion (or in Embo's case, reversion) to Catholicism are things that Embo and I have in common, which is the other reason for my interest in his book. There is much about Embo's story that is very familiar to me, and will be familiar to anyone who has ever been a member of the pre-1995 WCG, whether or not one is now a Catholic. Indeed, there probably is much about his story that will be familiar to anyone who has belonged to any aberrant, apocalyptic, authoritarian or totalitarian sect.The book's title is a deliberate echo of Richard Crossman's \\"The God That Failed\\" (1950), which told the stories of six ex-Communists and how they went from their initial enthusiastic conversion to Communism through a gradual awakening to the fact that Communism is evil. For them, their \\"god,\\" Communism, failed. Although Embo tells a similar story of ardent devotion to Herbert Armstrong's religion followed by a gradual awakening to the errors and evils of Armstrongism, the \\"God\\" of his book's title is not Armstrongism, but is instead the Christian God. Thus, Embo presents his story as one of alienation and loss followed by redemption and restoration, the eventual victory of divine grace and love. It is appropriate, then, that Embo would close with the well known passage from St. Augustine's \\"Confessions,\\" \\"Late have I loved you, O Beauty so ancient and so new . . .\\"Embo's story begins in the 1950s and 1960s, starting out with a description of his upbringing as the oldest of six adopted children in a fairly typical American Catholic family in Detroit, Michigan. At one time, he was drawn to the Catholic priesthood, and even spent a year in Catholic seminary before abandoning Catholicism and converting to Armstrongism in 1971.Embo describes his attraction to Herbert Armstrong's religion as an ill-advised and misguided attempt to quench his thirst for truth. As a student at a Catholic high school during the chaotic and confusing years after the close of the Second Vatican Council, he had a genuine and felt need for guidance and instruction in religion and morality. Instead, he came to young adulthood at an ostensibly Catholic school whose teachers seemed proud of the fact that, as their 1969 school yearbook said, \\"Religion was not taught\\" in their religion classes. They were teachers who seemed unconcerned and, again, perversely proud, that (as that yearbook said) \\"many were left still confused\\" about religion after having taken their religion classes.Now, if a high school geometry teacher beamed with pride that at the end of the school year hardly any of his students could tell a theorem from an axiom, you would know something was terribly wrong with that teacher's philosophy of education, but at that time in Catholic schools all over the United States and all over the world, content-free religion and theology courses were all the rage. But in Dennis' case, as in the case of many of his generation, the shallow and inadequate religious education that he had received in Catholic school only left him yearning for truth and a sense of certainty, often setting the stage for their seduction by religious hucksterism. In Embo's case, he thought he found truth and certainty in the WCG. But truth and genuine certainty are among the many things that Armstrongism promises but is incapable of providing.After converting to Armstrongism in 1971, Embo spent more than 25 years as a member of the Worldwide Church of God. During the years that he was a WCG member, he found and was reunited with his birth mother, and also got married to a WCG member who was also, like Embo, a lapsed Catholic. The WCG's doctrinal reforms of the early to mid-1990s enabled him and his wife to reconsider and to explore religious questions that they wrongly thought they had settled when they became Armstrongists. Consequently, in the latter 1990s they embraced evangelical Protestantism, and then five-point Calvinism, leaving the WCG to join a Presbyterian church. Finally, and very unexpectedly for them, in 2001 they rediscovered their Catholic roots and returned to the faith in which they had been born and baptised and raised.Among the most moving and effective parts of Embo's book are his account of the relationship he had with his birth mother (who died many years ago), and his account of the close and loving relationship he has had with his adoptive parents and grandparents. Although, as he shows, his commitment to Armstrongism at times hindered his family relationships, Embo's story has a happy ending, for in his case love triumphed over all.One of the main themes or threads running through Embo's story is the centrality and importance of family. Indeed, it seems to me that much of Embo's story is about his \\"roots.\\" That is, it is about his family, about his genealogy, about the faith in which he had been raised, about his connectedness to his loved ones, and about his need for, or his search for, connectedness with God, who is the \\"root\\" of us all. Embo compares his journey through Armstrongism back to Catholicism to that of the prodigal son returning at long last to his Father's house. In light of these things, it only makes sense that Embo would be so interested in finding his birth mother, and yet would in no way desire to sever or even to weaken his family ties with his adoptive parents. It also seems very fitting that his reversion to Catholicism would roughly coincide with his genealogical research into the medieval origins of the Embo family of Belgium. In that respect, I am again reminded that John Henry Cardinal Newman, who was a convert to Catholicism from Anglicanism, famously wrote that \\"to be deep in history is to cease to be a Protestant.\\"Without a doubt, Embo's book is probably going to be the most accessible or meaningful to those of a Catholic or Armstrongist background. Nevertheless, \\"The God That Prevailed\\" can have something to say to almost anyone. For Catholics, Embo's story may be profitably read as another Catholic conversion story. For any Christian, his story may be profitably read as a narrative of loss and redemption. For current and former Armstrongists, Embo's story will provide one more helpful perspective on the experience of life in the WCG both before and after the death of Herbert Armstrong. But Embo's depictions of family life and of his experience of growing up as an adopted child in a loving home are things that can speak to any human heart."},{"Title":"The God That Prevailed: One Man's Search for Spiritual Truth from Catholic Seminary to Herbert Armstrong's Cult, and His Amazing Return to His Faith","review":"Once I picked up \\"The God That Prevailed,\\" I had difficulty putting it down. Dennis Embo's spiritual odyssey from Catholicism to Armstrongism to a deeper Catholicism parallels my own journey from liberal Protestantism to the Worldwide Church of God to evangelical Protestantism. From his quest for spiritual truth to his search for his birth mother, Embo weaves the threads of his life story into a fascinating allegory of God's sovereignty and faithfulness.Embo's story not only provides a glimpse into changes in American and Catholic culture during the past 50 years but also illustrates how God can lead us in ways we never would have imagined to draw us closer to Him. In my case, the book came into my life at a fortuitous (divinely appointed?) time when I needed to be reminded that despite our differences, Catholics and Protestants worship the same God and serve the same Jesus. I'm glad that I read \\"The God That Prevailed.\\""},{"Title":"The God That Prevailed: One Man's Search for Spiritual Truth from Catholic Seminary to Herbert Armstrong's Cult, and His Amazing Return to His Faith","review":"This book is about Dennis and how his search for truth as a young man took him out of the Catholic Church in which he was raised into a small fundamental Christian church for over 20 years (the Worldwide Church of God, or WCG). When WCG then dramatically changed its doctrines Dennis enthusiastically embraced those changes. But in a few years the changes came too slow for Dennis so he then left WCG in his search for truth among various ministries. Just as he thought he had found his new church he took an unexpected turn and returned to his Catholic Church roots.Why would I want to read a book like this? I am not a Catholic and have no desire to be one. Like Dennis I was a member of WCG and also left WCG some years ago interested in finding truth but we had different reason for leaving and have taken different paths since leaving. I left WCG because Joe Tkach was making changes I disagreed with and because I found the Tkach changes to be far from honest. I wasn't against many of the changes. I knew that changes were needed and had personally given Joe Tkach, Sr. an 8 page letter regarding needed changes when I visited Pasadena for the feast in 1990 (I had been at AC with Joe when he first came there as a married student my freshman year in 1966). After leaving WCG I meandered quickly through several of the splits from WCG but as I did that I also did considerable research into why these changes took place and what the Bible actually teaches and I found that Herbert Armstrong was definitely wrong about many things he taught (which I once believed). So I have distanced myself from those who just want to replicate WCG in most ways. I have however come to realize that the Bible teaches some things that we were taught in WCG and so I continue to observe the seventh day Sabbath and God's feast days (that's the way the Bible describes them). I have also come to see that the simplicity of Jesus Christ does not require membership in some \\"True Church\\". I believe that we will all be judged one day as individuals before the judgment seat of God rather than by our membership in a particular church-the proverbial \\"True Church\\". So why would I want to read Dennis' book?There are several reasons I wanted to read this book. First, I too was a member of WCG for a good bit longer than Dennis. So the experiences of a fellow member interested me. Second, Dennis and I were both members of the same Raleigh congregation for several years. I then moved to a nearby sister congregation in Rocky Mount, NC where I stayed in touch at frequent combined services and activities, so I know him as a friend and Christian Brother. I wanted to get to know my friend a bit more so this book gave that opportunity. Third, we were both in WCG during the tumultuous and unprecedented doctrinal upheaval that WCG went through in the 1990's. The total change in doctrines of a church of this size is unprecedented, and it had and continues to have serious ramifications in the lives of all those who were members during those years. Many families and friendships were torn apart by the changes and those changes will continue to impact thousands of former members for years to come. They were times of stress with many losing their faith. One author speaking about such stress rated losing one's faith equal in stress with losing a mate. Dennis' experiences through this time were of special interest to me since we lived through these trying spiritual times in neighboring congregations. Seeing how others coped with the changes helps me understand what I went through. And finally, the title intrigued me and my curiosity was aroused to see who this \\"God that prevailed\\" is. I hoped the book would reveal him.Some of the experiences of Dennis' early life were similar to mine while others were quite different. He grew up a Catholic, while I grew up a Lutheran-our early years sound similar regarding religious training and thinking. It included church schooling and catechism training. I too was interested in becoming a minister and served as an altar boy.I enjoyed reading about his early life and his struggles as he came into WCG. I could identify with his efforts to learn \\"the truth\\". His tale of how he came into WCG and how he now views the things he was taught (mostly that all he was taught was wrong and was the result of being enticed into the cult of Herbert Armstrong) sounds similar to what I've read in various other books describing the problems in WCG. If you're looking for more details and specifics about the problems in WCG this book does not give that. Most of the descriptions of WCG given by Dennis sound like he is parroting Joe Tkach and his successor Joe Jr. in giving reasons as to why they had to change the doctrines in WCG. There were many congregations all across the country and each one had its own pastor with his particular personal interpretation of what was disseminated from Pasadena so there may have been things done in Dennis' congregations that I did not personally experience. However, I was part of WCG for over 30 years in various congregations in California, Kansas, Texas, Florida and North Carolina over those years (as well as visiting other congregations during business trips). I don't recall anyone ever coming to \\"enforce\\" tithing (even during those times when I didn't tithe as the church taught). Dennis includes quite a number of seemingly minor issues some of which I am puzzled by because they simply were not part of my long experience; others I fully agree were wrongly taught. Dennis' picture of WCG gives the impression that the many wrongs with WCG were the dominant theme in church each week. It was simply not so. We were given many sermons on Christian living and on becoming Christ-like. Many of us learned to serve and did so often and regularly. Dennis makes it sound like the Waterhouse sermons were almost a monthly event when in fact his long diatribes (I endured two that were over 3 hours long) happened only every 8 to 10 years as he traveled to every congregation around the world. So to say the least, those issues that bothered him (while certainly being a strong theme in one way or another) were only a small portion of what was taught. Many of us developed a strong relationship with Jesus Christ in our many years in WCG under Armstrong. One of Dennis' seemingly minor gripes about WCG was not using the name of \\"Jesus\\" enough. I have to wonder at how picky someone is getting when they are bothered by the use of \\"Jesus Christ\\" as opposed to simply saying \\"Jesus\\". When I read the way the apostle Paul spoke he often referred to \\"Jesus Christ\\" rather than the single name \\"Jesus\\".I accept Dennis' version of what WCG was like for him. He paints a darker picture than I think he and many of us experienced or he probably would not have stayed with it for over 20 years. However, I must point out that there are two large aspects of problems in WCG that Dennis almost totally avoids for obvious reasons. One is that WCG had a hierarchy of leadership from the top down. This continues even to this day by those who brought the changes so much liked by Dennis. Dennis blames Armstrong for being a \\"one man show\\" but blames only Armstrong instead of showing that Armstrong was only the top of a hierarchy that was abusive and oppressive. He does not show the problems with hierarchy as practiced by WCG (not surprisingly patterned after the Catholic Church and still practiced by that church). The other huge problem in WCG he only briefly alludes to is the sexual scandals involving the Armstrong's. Of course when one goes from a small church with a few sex scandals among its ministers to a large church with horrible sex scandals among its priests it's not prudent to mention those \\"truths\\". Not one word is mentioned about the fact that the Catholic Church has just come through great media scrutiny for its homosexual abuse of young children by priests. Nor is there any mention of the many not so highly publicized illegitimate babies fathered by their (not so) \\"celibate\\" priests. In this book in a section titled \\"Scandals test our loyalties\\" Dennis and his friend reminded themselves that the WCG scandals did not matter as long as they were in the \\"True Church\\". It looks like Dennis has kept that mindset now that he is once again in the only \\"True Church\\".In his book there is an interesting mix of Dennis' church past and his personal past. It was interesting to read about his meeting with his birth mother as well as other personal information that at times touched me personally as I knew some of the individuals he mentioned-I went to Ambassador College with some of them. I hoped for more such personal stories and names of individuals whose lives we both knew. His account of meeting and marrying Rosemary certainly sounded very much like the Dennis and Rosemary I got to know when we were part of the Raleigh congregation. It sounds like his parents were very caring and loving people and I would have enjoyed hearing a bit more about them. His treatment of his last years in WCG were too brief for me as I was hoping for better understanding and more detail of the people who helped shape his outlook. I looked for more about why he welcomed the changes and how he dealt with those topsy turvy days as doctrine after doctrine was being changed. He gave a few short glimpses when I had desired more.He did a good job in showing how he then meandered towards the Reformed Church before reaching what he seems to think is his destination of the \\"true church\\". He gave quite an account of the various books and tapes that influenced him. It would have been much more helpful to read more of the actual thinking that influenced him. It was not enough to know who influenced him to discard the idea of Sola Scriptura. It would have been much more effective had he shown us more of the reasoning behind his new found approach. His story is certainly a familiar story among those searching for truth. Many of those humans who search for \\"the truth\\" seem to feel strongly that it can only be in one particular organization. That has lead Dennis back to his roots in the Catholic Church. May he find rest from his searching. Much of Dennis' story seems to indicate that he is still very disgusted with himself for allowing himself to be so led astray from the \\"true church\\" he has now returned to. I hope that writing this book will prove to be healing for him so that he can get over his disgust and anger at the past. I appreciate the effort Dennis put into this work and I hope that it will provide some closure to him.As I progressed through the book I kept looking for the \\"God that prevailed\\" in what Dennis wrote. Occasionally I would see glimpses of what Dennis apparently meant by this. The final quarter of the book clarified who this God really is in Dennis' mind. I read various statements by Dennis as he soured on the teachings of WCG that it bothered him that \\"As for religion, Armstrong was self-taught\\". He became really bothered by the lack of legitimate and accredited theology degrees by Armstrong and his ministers. What mattered to Dennis more and more were well educated theologians and their writings. \\"Unlike Armstrong these men had legitimate degrees in theology from established, accredited schools of theology, Bible colleges or seminaries.\\" As he found more qualified teachers his old ones dimmed in importance. After listening to various radio ministries \\"...Rosemary and I had grown so used to the depth and variety of teaching from theologians of the caliber of ...Sproul (radio teacher with a ThD after his name) that our pastor's messages seemed tepid by comparison.\\" As Dennis looked for a new Reformed church to attend what mattered to him most in his new pastor was \\"More importantly in my mind, he had studied under the R. C. Sproul...\\" As Dennis looked into the Catholic Church he found \\"...a Catholic conversion story from a man of his caliber: highly educated (in terms of theological background)...These people had some solid theological education behind them as well.\\" Once back in the Catholic Church, Dennis said \\"...we were delighted to discover that Father Jerry not only held a doctorate in theology but also a JCD (doctorate in canon law).\\" With so many strong statements along those lines it became obvious who is the \\"God that prevailed\\". Apparently it is the God who has the most educated priests and teachers in theological seminaries.How would I rate this book? If you have similar reasons as I did for reading this book you should enjoy it. It was easy to read and it was interesting and educational. On his history of WCG and what it was like to be part of that church I would rate the book below average because it was not an accurate picture of life in the church but rather a list of gripes garnered mostly from the leaders who changed the doctrines of WCG. On his personal life and how it has molded and shaped his thinking I would say he did a good job giving us insight into his personal life. I enjoyed getting to know my friend a little better. On his reasons to journey back to the Catholic Church I would say that he did a very good job detailing his journey back once he left WCG although I would have liked more of the reasons rather than just titles of books and authors. I would also have enjoyed more detail on the how's and why's of dealing with the changes within WCG before he left there. I don't advocate long books but this book was a bit too short. As we got to the point that Dennis finally left WCG I began to wonder how he got to be a Catholic since he seemed headed toward Calvinist reformed theology and we were almost at the end of the book. It was easy and enjoyable to read and moved along well. I'm glad I read the book."},{"Title":"An Embedded Software Primer","review":"I developed an introductory embedded systems class for university graduate students, and searched for a book that would provide both introductory and low-level information, with the assumption that students may come from different backgrounds in engineering and computer science. Based on my own industry experience, I wanted a book that started at the metal and explained the fundamentals so students learned from the ground up. This book fit the bill. It begins with the important hardware concepts and ties them directly to their applicability to embedded systems, and then jumps into timing diagrams, interrupts, buses and memory in a straightforward manner.The book continues with different types of software architectures and operating system services, with hard examples that are easy to understand. A very important chapter covers debugging techniques. Since a large chunk of time is spend debugging embedded systems, it is important to see that directly addressed in an introductory book. The only topic missing was really basic software programming, which is necessary for those with little software experience. But this does not detract from the topics covered.I taught the chapters of this book a little out of order, addressing the development tools and debugging techniques (later chapters) earlier in the process. Simon provides a chapter dependency flow chart that assists in different learning paths.The book was a wonderful launching point for tying learning with designing embedded systems in industry. It was well received by the students, who had had absolutely no idea what an embedded system was, even though we discovered together that they all owned tons of them.Very well done!Lisa SimoneIf I Only Changed the Software, Why is the Phone on Fire?: Embedded Debugging Methods Revealed: Technical Mysteries for Engineers"},{"Title":"An Embedded Software Primer","review":"This book hits most of the major points in embedded software programming, clearly and concisely.

If you adopt it as a career, there are many things you will need to learn over time: architectures of multiple processors, a variety development tools, RTOSes and a lot more. For the most part the book stays clear of the specifics of all of these. However, it does teach you the fundamentals of all of them. The information about hardware interfacing, processors, interrupts, shared data problems, RTOS based design, and common mistakes is sufficient to get a new-comer started quickly. In my early days, I spent hours, sometimes days, chasing bugs similar to those this book teaches you to avoid.In short, the book is just what says it is: \\"What you need to know to get started with embedded systems development\\".

In one place, the author argued that the distinction between a microprocessor and a microcontroller is vague. This, to some extent, is true. However, one can easily say with much confidence that the major difference between the two is that the latter has I/O, memory, and other peripheral devices integrated together. Thirdly, the C! language introduced in the book is nothing but the equivalence of the standard C/C++ comment structure - This could be confusing to beginners. Lastly, but not the least, the book mentioned quite a few RTOS in its scattered examples: I think it would be more illustrative to concentrated on just one RTOS (such as VxWorks), since no one is familiar with them all. I would really like to see these points be incorporated into its upcoming hardcover edition.

Author has done a very good job explaining how to protect shared data using mechanism provided by a RTOS. The communication between interrupt/task and among tasks are also discussed thoroughly.Unlike the other reviewer, I found the use of the C!! language in this book a very clever way to abstract away the hardware dependent code from the point being discussed.

The author's explanations are clear and concise, yet thorough enough to accomplish the book's purpose. I also appreciated the examples he gives, which were very appropriate and helpful; while some people complained about his use of the imaginary \\"C!\\" language (basically, C with a certain amount of \\"magic\\"), I found this helpful because it allowed him to omit certain things that were irrelevant to the overall example (for example, do we really care about the specifics of how to read data from an obscure device from the 90's that we'll never actually use?).This book presents a great overview of the basic techniques, problems, and tools of embedded software. If you are just getting started in the field, this book will speed up your learning curve dramatically and help you avoid a lot of headaches and mistakes.With that said, this book does assume that you have a certain knowledge base. For example, while this book does review the basics of digital logic design, this chapter is intended as a review, so if you don't have any background in the field you may have trouble following it. It also assumes that you know the C programming language (again, if you don't know this, you may have a very hard time following this book).Some people also complained that this book is \\"too basic,\\" but I disagree. While this book certainly won't make you an expert on the topic overnight or cover some of the more advanced or specialized topics in the field, it's not really intended to - that's why it's called a \\"primer.\\" This book is good for people who are making the transition from desktop programming to embedded software development or are otherwise just starting out in the field, but it's not intended for people who have been in the field for the last 20 years (unless they want to review the basics again, which isn't a bad thing to do).My one complaint (and this isn't really the author's fault) is that this book is a little out of date at points, since it was published in the late 90's. For example, the author's treatment of ROM seems to assume that it's still commonly used (it's not, and I'm not sure exactly why you'd still want to use it for most applications).

The Frasers are a large lively family headed by Rosamund, whose husband has abandoned the family to pursue his creative life in France. The Blacketts and their three daughters live a tightly constrained, very conventional existence controlled by totally egotistical Mr. Blackett. E. H. Young depicts the interaction of the two families, and the rich inner lives of these very ordinary people with humor, understanding, and the sort of moral vision shown by Jane Austen. Selfishness and generosity, cold hearts and loving ones, courage and its opposite, all appear in these people. At the end of the book the Munich agreement has achieved \\"peace in our time,\\" and there is peace of a kind in the two households; but I hated to leave them, wanting to know how they would be affected by the dark years ahead.E. H. Young is a writer who deserves to be rediscovered. Her wit, ability to create fascinating characters, and clear judgement of what makes ordinary life rich and meaningful are a delight."},{"Title":"Chatterton Square","review":"Set in the months leading up to WWII, Chatterton Square focuses on two people living across the street from each other in Upper Radstowe (based on Bristol). There are the Blacketts: Mr. Blackett, a domineering, selfish bore who stifles his very Victorian wife, and their three daughters, especially Flora and Rhoda, who live under the thumb of their father. Across the street live the Frasers, with no discernable man at the head. Rosamond Fraser is a mostly carefree mother of five children growing to adulthood, who lives with her old childhood friend, Miss Spanner. All of the action is set around the eponymous Chatterton Square, yet it's always referred to as the Square, never by its full name.This is one of those novels that are frequently described as \\"character driven.\\" As far as plot goes, there's not much to this book; for most of the novel, the characters sit in breathless anticipation waiting for something to happen, for the war to start (especially worrying for Rosamund, considering two of her sons could potentially participate). Where the author excels is character description, but she does it very subtlety; instead of saying that Bertha Blackett is Victorian in her mannerisms, the author says that Bertha is one of those women who should have been wearing a bonnet and bustle. With her meek, mild demeanor, constantly demurring to her husband, she's an interesting contrast to Rosamund, who's faced with a very 20th-century decision. But somehow, the two women forge a friendship together, despite Herbert Blackett's disapproval. Herbert's character lacks the comedy that many bores in fiction possess, but he's still a well-defined and interesting character.Another thing that EH Young does very well is depicting the various relationships between her characters--married relationships, young people courting, friendships between two middle-aged people (especially interesting is the dynamic between Rosamund, Bertha Blackett, and Piers Lindsay; equally interesting is the friendship between Rosamund and Miss Spanner). EH Young depicts all of her characters and their complicated relationships with wit and insight, and I found this book to be a joy to read because of that. Because this book was written in 1947, after the war had ended, there's a fair bit of foreshadowing with regards to the war, but other than that, I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"My spiritual aeroplane","review":"Read by Augusta E. Stetson to her students in 1919 at a rehearsal of The Oratorio Society of the New York City Christian Science Institute, this little work is a poetic and exalted description of an ascension out of material sense into the firmament of spiritual understanding, with Christ, Truth, as Pilot.

Kohlhammer, 2002). This book is the outcome of a proceedings of the international symposium \\"Zoroastrian Rituals in Context\\" held at the Internationales Wissenschaftsforum Heidelberg, from April 10-13, 2002. The book is a collection of papers by a majority of the greatest scholars in the field of Zarathushtrian studies, and in particular Zarathushtrian rituals and liturgical ceremonies. From setting the definitions of rituals and initiations in religious, geographical, historical and social contexts, nearly every minor and major Zarathushtrian ritual and liturgical ceremony is discussed and debated at some length. Thus this book serves to provide a valuable reference source for Zarathushtrian rituals, both for the novice and advanced students of Zarathushtrianism and I recommend this book most heartily to every Parsi and Zarathushtrian for a careful study of these papers. As usual the publishing house of Brill has to be thanked profusely for publishing for us in excellent style and format a valuable book on Zarathushtrianism in one of it's excellent monographic series."},{"Title":"A Time for Peace Between Muslims and the West: Between Muslims and the West","review":"This book covers the history until present of all the nations involved in the Middle East political situation, even Israel.

Every sentence has a special and important meaning. It left quite an impression on me."},{"Title":"Nothing Above","review":"Sandro Levati's Nothing Above is a compelling and unique story that reveals how one's imperfections are one's greatest opportunity. Written about a protagonist born with no wings into a world of the winged, it shows how the wingless one divines the humdrum, ordinary, everyday pattern that the winged fly in every day and charts a new course for himself.

It was written for kids, but it is a fine read for adults as well. It is realistic and gritty, in a way that more horse books should be - reminding us all that horses are hard work, and that there are plenty of disappointments along with the thrill and the glory when it all goes well.The Monday Horses is set in an A-circuit hunter-jumper stable, following Cassie as she gets a catch ride on a top pony and rides in in pursuit of a Horse of the Year award.

From cleaning and caring for the horses to riding in shows, this showcases the darker underbelly of competetive horsemanship when she finds out that a feisty pony named Riddle she shows has been drugged to improve his performance and make him more manageable.this is an underrated gem!

I first read this book when I was 10 or 11 years old and was showing my own pony. I never competed at the level that they did, but I can still see the images in my mind that this book created for me and I remember some of the text word-for-word. I am now in my 40s and I was recently cleaning out some boxes in the attic at my mother's house when I came across this book--I was overjoyed!!

Joe: A Real American Hero!)","review":"This trade paperback takes place in the time that the G.I. Joe team had been disbanded and Snake Eyes was living a quiet life with Scarlett and the two are soon to be wed. Snake Eyes has taken on an apprentice, who will be the last pupil to be trained in the Arashikage clan. Ophelia is a young woman and quite capable and after going through her training with T'jbang and Nunchuck, she is ready to undergo her final trial with Snake Eyes.Meanwhile, Sean Collins, the Son of Wade Collins, a former...and reformed...member of Cobra's Crimson Guard has joined an elite special-ops unit called the Hammer Team. They are given the assignment of capturing the former Cobra Terrorist and mercenary code named Firefly, who is recruiting operatives for a mysterious third party. The Hammer Team sets the trap for Firefly and are joined by Snake Eyes and Ophelia. But the operation is botched badly and Firelfy kills Ophelia and escapes.Both Collins and Snake Eyes are guilt-ridden, blaming themselves for the tragedy. Snake Eyes calls off his wedding to Scarlett and escapes to his retreat in the wilderness. Collins soon shows up and offers to become Snake Eyes' newest apprentice. Collins takes on the name of Kamakura and learns the way of the Arashikage Ninja. Eventually Firefly is tracked to Tokyo as Snake Eyes, Kamakura, and Other Joe members again go after the Merc only this time another surprise awaits Snake Eyes...a foe from his past!One of the great things that Devil's Due has done since taking over the G.I. Joe comic license is to personalize the various characters and give them some depth that they never had under Marvel's guidance. Previously they were one-dimensional characters distinguished mainly by their code names but writer Brandon Jerwa has fleshed out these characters, and made them real by giving them a human side. The silent Snake Eyes can speak volumes with his eyes and expressions and there is true heartbreak when he cancels his wedding to Scarlett. The Sean Collins character is an interesting one as he is seeking double redemption for the death of Ophelia as well as for his father's past with Cobra. He literally gives himself to Snake Eyes in a move of ultimate honor.\\"Master and Apprentice\\" is well paced and balances action and drama as well as any Joe tale I've ever read. The art by Sunder Raj and Stefano Castelli is darker and grittier than many other Joe tales and complements the story perfectly. The book also features bio pages on the major players in this story which serve to give it even more depth. This is one of Devil's Due's best G.I. Joe stories yet.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"Aficionados of O'Brian's seafaring novels from the Napoleonic Wars all have their favorites. Of the 20 Aubrey/Maturin novels, this one may be the best in many ways. Captain Aubrey's career seems on the fast track (maybe fast tack, given the theme)in this episode in which he takes the rank of Commodore and sails a small fleet to wrest Mauritius from the \\"foul and most foreign French.\\"His companion, Dr. Stephen Maturin comes into his own in this episode, showing his full talents as an intelligence agent and giving an idea of the resources at his command. There are setbacks, of course but the combimnations of land and sea warfare are engaging. Many of the other staple charcaters of the series also really begin to bloom in this installment.If you have come this far in the series, do not hesitate: buy this adventure and sail forth. May the weather gauge be with you!"},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"\\"The Mauritius Command\\", the fourth in the Aubrey/Maturin series of novels written by Patrick O'Brian, shows Captain \\"Lucky Jack\\" Aubrey several years after the events chronicled in \\"H.M.S. Surprise\\" in wedded bliss, but alas, without much of a fortune to support his growing family. Indeed, he is no longer on active command, but a Royal Navy captain on half pay. Stephen Maturin arrives bearing salvation in the form of a special mission to the Indian Ocean, along with Aubrey's temporary promotion to Commodore in command of a small squadron. What follows is one of the most exciting installments in the entire Aubrey/Maturin saga, and the start of an extended story arc which will take their fight against Napoleonic France and its allies throughout much of the Indian Ocean and the adjoining portions of Southeast Asia. Once more Patrick O'Brian delivers the goods, with his excellent, lyrical prose that seems more at home with the likes of Jane Austen than with contemporary authors of fiction."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"Jack Aubrey's dreams of success in the British Navy get a boost when he is assigned as the Commodore of a fleet near Mauritius. But, along with the glory of the management post, comes the hellish torture of responsibility for the actions of several captains less capable than Jack.Aubrey and Maturin finally fully join their mental forces in the attempt to understand just what makes each captain in the fleet tick. Each at their own level (Maturin's rather deeper), they form a concept of the other personalities they must work with. And Aubrey ultimately finds that even the best planning can be brought to nought by one committee or another...This book also gives us a gently amusing glimpse of Aubrey's life on land as a married man. As with all the Aubrey/Maturin books, this is by turns amusing and thoughtful, as well as realistic and picturesque."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"The 4th novel in O'Brian's series of Cpt. Aubrey and Dr. Mautrin has Aubrey made acting Commodore in command of a small flotilla seeking to disrupt the French presence off the coast of south Africa and make an amphibious landings on two small islands off Madagascar. Both charges challenge Aubrey's considerable nautical skill.As Aubrey's responsibility grows, he soon finds so do the complications of command as he quickly learns a complaining crew is much easier to handle than managing the egos and navigating the political waters of senior command. The interaction between Aubrey and his peers, the infighting, manipulation and machinations between officers (those directly under his command as well as those above him) make for particularly riveting reading, every bit as interesting as the battles at sea.I am continually impressed with O'Brian's ability to keep the stories fresh: as readers become better acquainted with Aubrey and Maturin, the plots become more complex and larger, and one's understanding of the characters becomes deeper. In _The Mauritius Command_, the ante is upped further by basing the story on true events in the Napoleonic wars. The series is every bit as good as fans would have you believe. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"I've read through the Aubrey-Maturin series before, and it is without a doubt my favorite series of book. This is the first hardcover of them that I have purchased: I intended to start my own collection rather than check them out from the library.I use the past tense because, instead of being a quality hardcover, the Norton hardcover edition that I purchased is of poorer print quality than an average paperback. The words are fuzzy and indistinct: it looks as though it were printed at draft quality on a circa 1995 printer. The poor contrast provided by the subpar paper further hinders readability.I'm afraid that I must recommend PO'B fans to search elsewhere--perhaps a used bookstore--to obtain this excellent series. It is a shame that excellence of O'Brian's writing is not matched by its presentation in this hardcover edition."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"At the beginning of this book, we find our heroes, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, living the domestic life in England as they are without a ship. Fortunately, this does not last long. This book is a thrilling retelling of the taking of the Islands of Mauritius and Reunion in 1810 by the British from the French. The story itself is largely true, although the characters are fictional replacements for real-life counterparts.What I think sets O'Brian aside from most writers is his ability to make the less active scenes just as descriptive and interesting as the fiercest battle sequences. You feel just as much a part of the book during sequences that describe the irritation of being stuck for days without wind as you do during the storming of an encampment on Reunion Island. While I think all of O'Brian's books do a great job at giving the reader a sense of what life was like in the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, the vivid descriptions in this book caught me more than in the previous books (all of which I enjoyed).Aditionally, while I agree with others that have said that the Aubrey/Maturin books are not \\"action\\" books, I must say that the battle descriptions in this installment go above and beyond those in previous books. I get the sense that this is about the point in the series where O'Brian really hit his stride, and I can't wait to make my way through the rest of the series.As I've said in past reviews, these books really should be read in order. I cannot say that a reader could not pick up The Mauritius Command and enjoy it wihout having read prior books, but I do not think he or she would really fully enjoy the book without the benefit of its predecessors."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"&quot;The Mauritius Command&quot; opens a few years after the end of &quot;HMS Surprise&quot;. Jack has discovered married life to be very different than he imagined, &amp; longs to be back at sea. The arrival of Stephen Maturin (&amp; mushrooms) stirs the household to a frenzy.This humorous beginning shows Patrick O'Brian's masterful abilities. In a few deft strokes, the past years are filled in with no heavy exposition or flashbacks, &amp; the events to come are put into motion. Aubrey faces many new challenges in the course of &quot;The Mauritius Command&quot;, having to learn to sooth battling egos, command while refraining from fighting, &amp; create a fighting machine from almost nothing. His faithful follower Tom Pullings plays an expanded role in this tale as the captain of a transport &amp; deus ex machina, while Stephen Maturin's political abilities overshadow his medical duties.This is one of the most exciting Aubrey/Maturin novels, a real &quot;Boys Own Life&quot; type tale, full of gunplay, cat &amp; mouse feints &amp; hearty comradeship. The most exciting aspect of it is that it all really happened (of course with different protagonists!). Learn about a forgotten campaign of the Napoleonic wars &amp; enjoy yourself in the process!

The characters have lost their steam, and the writing itself seems rushed and distracted, unworkmanlike. The plot is all ahoo, as Aubrey might say, the entire enterprise being a long, tedious and half-hearted series of naval maneuvers and sorties with a minimal amount of human spice to them. Still, as ever, there are brilliant characters which one wishes were grasped onto with greater commitment by the author; instead, he seems to lose interest as he goes--as if the whole thing were dashed off while waiting for the turkey to finish roasting."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"AS A CHILD I READ ALL OF THE HORATIO HORNBLOWER SERIES AND I NEVER THOUGHT ANYONE WOULD EVER MATCH HIM.

Each installment seems to outdo its predecessor, thus giving rise to the suggestion made by others here that in this book O'Brian really hits his stride.In THE MAURITIUS COMMAND, Aubrey is awarded a commodore's pennant; his career continues to rise. Maturin's career as an intelligence officer and master of political influence is given prominent place as well.There are the requisite actions at sea, some of which do not feature Aubrey centrally. There is less of the romance novel aspect that slowed the story down in POST CAPTAIN.Aside from the usual attention to historical details in describing life in the turn-of-the-nineteenth century Royal Navy (at least from the standpoint of the officers), O'Brian continues his mastery of verbal and nonverbal interaction between characters. One gets a real feel for what these men are like in the way they respond to one another. What's more, O'Brian has a light hand in it; his humor emerges at the most opportune times.THE MAURITIUS COMMAND stands alone as a book better than the previous two novels; this novel has both a clear beginning and a clear ending.

This series of adventures, is the best I have come across and patrick O'Brian, pens it to perfection"},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"For this installment of the Aubrey/Maturin series, author Patrick O'Brian went to a little-known historical skirmish that took place between Great Britain and France (as usual!) over the ownership of a couple islands in the Indian Ocean, including Mauritius. As O'Brian points out in the introduction to the book, there was little need to embellish (i.e. fictionalize) the events, since this was such a little-known event and because there was plenty of drama to be had in what really happened (basically, the real-life commodore is changed to Jack Aubrey).The book contains all the details we come to expect from an Aubrey/Maturin novel - as appreciaton of the tactical and strategic situations, the politics of the Royal Navy, the way seniority and authority are handled, descriptions of ships, etc. But like with any well-crafted prose, such expository details never feel like exposition, but serve to immerse the reader in the world of the Napoleonic-era Royal Navy. And its never at the expense of the action or the advance of plot points. As for the novel itself, it's just as interesting and engrossing as the previous three novels in the series thus far. The resolution may not be as satisfying in the traditional sense, but historically is a happy ending indeed - carrying the dispatches after a victory may not sound like a big deal, but the captains of such ships were often feted as much or more than the actual captain that won the battle (in this case they are the same person at least). At any rate, the adherence to the overall historical timeline gives the novel a greater authenticity, even if it isn't quite the most satisfying way to script an adventure novel.There's really little else to say - if you've read any of the novels in this series you'll know what to expect. That's not to say that they are getting boring or repetative! They are each fresh and exciting in their own right, and I'll continue through the series looking forward to each new adventure. If you haven't read one of these novels yet.... what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"The Mauritius Command is a first rate piece of historical fiction. Patrick O'Brian deftly weaves this swashbuckling nautical tale into the historical account of the British retaking the Mauritius Islands. Lucky Jack Aubrey, with a little help from Stephen Maturin, becomes a Commodore and leads his squadron of ships into battle with the French.A new father, Jack Aubrey leaves behind his wife to venture out to the Indian Ocean. His wife, Sophie, lost her dowry and story begins with Jack hurting for money. So the opportunity to have command and be back on full pay is most welcome. Commodore Aubrey's command is complicated by the personalities of his subordinate commanders. Maturin comes out of the closet and works his espionage in the open.With victory just within his grasp, Admiral Bertie arrives to take command and the credit away from Jack. Despite that setback, Lucky Jack stills finishes on top.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"I have read the prior three novels in O'Brian's masterful Aubrey/Maturin series, and thought the first three were uniformly excellent. After a layoff, I returned to the series and while I enjoyed The Mauritius Command, I thought there was somewhat of a slip from the first few books of this 20 novel series.The novel opens promisingly, with Aubrey suffering in a less-than-ideal domestic situation. His mother-in-law lives with Jack, his wife Sophie and their cranky daughters, and his efforts to manage a farm are comical in his ineptitude. When Maturin visits, and Aubrey tries to show him around and put a brave face on his domestic struggles, the comedy inherent in O'Brian's writing comes shining through. While Jack (and the reader) itch to get to sea, it is there that O'Brian seems to lose control of the story.Aubrey gets an order to go to the Cape of Good Hope, where he is sent on a mission to dislodge the French from the Mauritius Islands and help set up a British Colonial Governor by the name of Farquar. As is usually the case, despite great achievements in the past, Jack is shackled and insufficiently rewarded by his superiors in the admiralty, and his supposed connections, through his father in the Parliament, are of little help.O'Brian seems to assume a good bit of nautical knowledge by the reader, and this landlubber sometimes got a little lost in the naval warfare scenes. The most engaging aspects of the novel seemed to me the differences in character, and the seething one-upsmanship among the various ship captains under Jack's overall command including Captains Pym, Clonfert and Corbett. The problem was, just when the author whets your appetite for some great internal conflict or drama between the brutal Corbett and the popular Clonfert, Corbett is sent from the area.Moreover, the final battle scenes are almost thrown together in summary form, as if the culmination of the mission did not really concern O'Brian as much as the hassles of getting there, and so there was a bit of a letdown at the end. I look forward to the next novel (Desolation Island I think), but have to be luke-warm in my praise of this one. I give it a fairly generous 4 stars, 3 and 1/2 if I could."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"Weird mixture of hilarious, historically based, way too real. Picked one up on tape to stay awake during a couple of hours' trip, have both read and listened to them ever since.Fortunately there really are twenty-some in the series.

This one is pretty big on military history (the names have been changed to suit the series!)."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"I'm reading these books in series and I've just recently finished The Mauritius Command. I've given all the books in this series 5 stars. The title of my review suggests that this book is a departure from the first three. This is true, but I do not want to overemphasize that point. We get here all the things we expect from an O'Brian Aubrey novel. What is different is simply the amount of time spent on the various actions. In this book, I missed more of the intimate moments between Maturin and Aubrey, playing their instruments, fretting over money, and so forth. However, this does well perhaps to put us in the mind of Aubrey for this adventure.Readers of the other novels will not be disappointed here. And of course, the quality of O'Brian's writing cannot be overstated."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"Based on the eight O'Brian Aubrey-Maturin books I've read so far, Mauritius Command has the most military excitement. Jack Aubrey's skills as a military strategist are put to a test- author O'Brian tutors the reader on naval strategy during that last great era of fighting ships of sail. Splendid!"},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"I had given up on this series after the last book (HMS Surprise) because I was getting lost in the seafaring terminology and there was a bit much of the love-lorn simpering in the tale. The Mauritius Command restores my faith in this series. It's a great tale of derring-do in the Indian Ocean, its based on some actual events and actual ships and overall the tone is very convincing. The women folk are left back on land, and only intrude to an acceptable level of letter writing etc. My (paperback) edition contains a valuable afterword by Brian Lavery who describes the actual ships on which the tale is based, and gives a worthwile overview of the seafaring terminology. I still won't be able to distinguish a fore topsail yard from a quarterdeck, but at least Lavery is reassuring that they are meaningful terms.Jack Aubery continues on his lucky career in the British Navy, almost - but not quite - achieving lasting fame and fortune; this being more necessary now that he has a wife, three children and a mother-in-law to support. For me, this book develops Stephen Maturin more - he is still secretive, reflective, reassuringly Irish and intellectual, however he develops a melancholia which is only temporarily suppressed by his furtive diplomatic activities. O'Brien moves Maturin one step closer to Sherlock Holmes by hinting at his opiate use during the story"},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"not quite as good as the first three in this series, in my opinion. The quality of O'Brian's writing is as good as ever, with wonderful dialogue and descriptions. O'Brian does move the development of his main characters Aubrey and Maturin forward; Aubrey has mellowed and aged a little and now has the joys and burdens of having a wife and kids. It seems to me from this book that O'Brian did not intend for this series to continue on for nearly as many volumes as it did. For example, the Mauritius Campaign took place in 1810, only a few years before the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The previous book, HMS Suprise, seems to have taken place approximately five years before; a lot of prime war years were wasted. This book develops some interesting characters, particularly Captain Clonfert. The problem with this book is that a lot of time is taken up with our heros sailing here and there without much exciting happening. The ending is somewhat suspenseful, but not as much so as the previous three books. All in all, it is still a very good book but the series loses just a little of its freshness and originality."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"This is the fourth book sequentially and the second I've read of the extremely popular Aubrey/Maturin series of historical novels.After a brief and interesting look at Jack's less than blissful connubial life with the wife he married at the end of \\"HMS Surprise\\", O'Brian whisks us off to the Indian Ocean, where French frigates based in Mauritius have been making havoc with the ships of the East India Company, so central to England's economy, not to mention the private wealth of many of it's most powerful people. (One merit of the books is how they show us that, even if another conflict is known as the First World War, the Napoleonic Wars were in fact fought on fields and seas throughout the world.) Aubrey is lifted to the rank of Commodore and given the assignment of defeating the enemy vessels and, if possible, capturing Reunion and Mauritius.The ups and downs of the campaign , which O'Brian states are based closely on history, make for a good story. But the Aubrey/Maturin characters are not as developed as in \\"HMS Surprise\\", and the potentially interesting characters who are introduced aren't given enough space to live up to their promise, with the exception perhaps of the foppish but courageous Lord Clonfert, a captain in Aubrey's squadron. His rival captain Corbett, a sadistic disciplinarian, isn't on stage enough to emerge as an individual, nor is another rival captain, Pym.O'Brian obviously has a vast knowledge of the ship designs, tactics, methods, slang, even cuisine of the Royal Navy he describes. But he shows little mercy for the reader who is unlikely to share his expertise. Thus one of the points of a story like this, to show Jack Aubrey using tactical resourcefulness to salvage a difficult situation, falls flat. Aubrey's maneuvers are described fully enough, but O'Brian fails to explain why a given decision was made. In the absence of authorial assistance, the numerous description of how various sails are manipulated tells us little indeed.The story ends rather suddenly; just when it seems to be really taking off, it's all over in a few pages."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"THE MAURITIUS COMMAND, the fourth novel in the series by Richard Patrick Russ (1914-2000) writing under the nom de plume of \\"Patrick O'Brian,\\" is a distinct improvement over one of its predecessors, POST CAPTAIN. Russ/O'Brian seems to have abandoned his annoying experiments in writing techniques and has settled down to, more or less, a simple, straight-forward narrative style, which is imminently more readable.As in earlier volumes, this book does not continue precisely where its predecessor left off. However, in this case the missing events are easily understood and reconstructed in the reader's consciousness. We do find that Jack Aubrey's marriage to Sophie is not precisely fulfilling for him; not surprisingly, we find that Aubrey's first love remains the sea and that he is not exactly the model of a perfect spouse. Of course, if one reads the author's real-life biography, Russ/O'Brian was far from a perfect husband, and one wonders whether he has somewhat patterned Aubrey after himself, but let us not read too much into that.Soon, Aubrey is called to sea again, and the maritime action resumes and continues throughout the remainder of the book. Unlike POST CAPTAIN, this volume does not ramble for pages and pages about Aubrey's floundering on-shore life, thank goodness.If one has a creative imagination, he could actually begin with THE MAURITIUS COMMAND, but the reader will certainly have a more complete appreciation of the characters if he has begun with the first volume, MASTER AND COMMANDER, and has approached each successive volume in order (POST CAPTAIN, then HMS SURPRISE, and only then THE MAURITIUS COMMAND). Perhaps we should consider each novel as an additional chapter in one extraordinarily lengthy book. This is not necessarily a criticism, just a caution to a reader who might be tempted to sample Russ/O'Brian's work by starting in the middle of the series.The author does engage in some character development, and, by this fourth book, the person of Dr. Stephen Maturin has become more complex that we suspected at first. Not only is he an unusually gifted physician, but it seems as though he has shadowy political connections and is as instrumental as a \\"secret agent\\" as he is as a doctor. While this certainly provides a most interesting twist to the character of the good doctor, I sense that Russ/O'Brian is learning about his creation at the same time we are. I do not feel that he prepared us for this sort of complication in Maturin's nature. While I enjoy the increased complexity in the doctor, I am not at all sure that the author intended this from the beginning but suspect that he may be developing his characters by whim rather than by intent.THE MAURITIUS COMMAND keeps the reader entertained throughout its length, but, after having now read four books in the series, I feel that Russ/O'Brian is a somewhat superficial writer who realizes that he should paint some complexity into his characters to keep them from becoming mere stereotypes but does not quite understand how to do this. As a writer, he is certainly superior to the authors of what we used to call \\"dime novel bodice-rippers,\\" but he is far from displaying the skill of a C. S. Forrester or a Herman Melville.I would suggest that the Aubrey-Maturin series of maritime adventure books is decent entertainment but that the novels are not especially memorable. I also find myself wondering whether the surface action, that is, the plot or superficial story line, may not become repetitious and boring before one reaches the end of the multi-book series. I'm actually hoping that Russ/O'Brian will mature more fully as an author as he accrues more experience in writing the future volumes. We shall see how he handles the fifth book, DESOLATION ISLAND, next."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"Some critics have referred to the Aubrey/Maturin books as one long novel united not only by their historical setting but also by the central plot element of the Aubrey/Maturin friendship. Having read these fine books over a period of several years, I decided to evaluate their cumulative integrity by reading them consecutively in order of publication over a period of a few weeks. This turned out to be a rewarding enterprise. For readers unfamiliar with these books, they describe the experiences of a Royal Navy officer and his close friend and traveling companion, a naval surgeon. The experiences cover a broad swath of the Napoleonic Wars and virtually the whole globe.Rereading all the books confirmed that O'Brian is a superb writer and that his ability to evoke the past is outstanding. O'Brian has numerous gifts as a writer. He is the master of the long, careful description, and the short, telling episode. His ability to construct ingenious but creditable plots is first-rate, probably because he based much of the action of his books on actual events. For example, some of the episodes of Jack Aubrey's career are based on the life of the famous frigate captain, Lord Cochrane. O'Brian excels also in his depiction of characters. His ability to develop psychologically creditable characters through a combination of dialogue, comments by other characters, and description is tremendous. O'Brien's interest in psychology went well beyond normal character development, some books contain excellent case studies of anxiety, depression, and mania.Reading O'Brien gives vivid view of the early 19th century. The historian Bernard Bailyn, writing of colonial America, stated once that the 18th century world was not only pre-industrial but also pre-humanitarian (paraphrase). This is true as well for the early 19th century depicted by O'Brien. The casual and invariable presence of violence, brutality, and death is a theme running through all the books. The constant threats to life are the product not only of natural forces beyond human control, particularly the weather and disease, but also of relative human indifference to suffering. There is nothing particularly romantic about the world O'Brien describes but it also a certain grim grandeur. O'Brien also shows the somewhat transitional nature of the early 19th century. The British Navy and its vessals were the apogee of what could be achieved by pre-industrial technology. This is true both of the technology itself and the social organization needed to produce and use the massive sailing vessals. Aubrey's navy is an organization reflecting its society; an order based on deference, rigid hierarchy, primitive notions of honor, favoritism, and very, very corrupt. At the same time, it was one of the largest and most effective bureaucracies in human history to that time. The nature of service exacted great penalities for failure in a particularly environment, and great success was rewarded greatly. In some ways, it was a ruthless meritocracy whose structure and success anticipates the great expansion of government power and capacity seen in the rest of the 19th century.O'Brian is also the great writer about male friendship. There are important female characters in these books but since most of the action takes place at sea, male characters predominate. The friendship between Aubrey and Maturin is the central armature of the books and is a brilliant creation. The position of women in these books is ambiguous. There are sympathetic characters, notably Aubrey's long suffering wife. Other women figures, notably Maturin's wife, leave a less positive impression. On board ship, women tend to have a disruptive, even malign influence.How did O'Brian manage to sustain his achievement over 20 books? Beyond his technical abilities as a writer and the instrinsic interest of the subject, O'Brien made a series of very intelligent choices. He has not one but two major protagonists. The contrasting but equally interesting figures of Aubrey and Maturin allowed O'Brien to a particularly rich opportunity to expose different facets of character development and to vary plots carefully. This is quite difficult and I'm not aware of any other writer who has been able to accomplish such sustained development of two major protagonists for such a prolonged period. O'Brian's use of his historical setting is very creative. The scenes and events in the books literally span the whole globe as Aubrey and Maturin encounter numerous cultures and societies. The naval setting allowed him also to introduce numerous new and interesting characters. O'Brian was able to make his stories attractive to many audiences. Several of these stories can be enjoyed as psychological novels, as adventure stories, as suspense novels, and even one as a legal thriller. O'Brian was also a very funny writer, successful at both broad, low humor, and sophisticated wit. Finally, O'Brian made efforts to link some of the books together. While a number are complete in themselves, others form components of extended, multi-book narratives. Desolation Island, Fortune of War, and The Surgeon's Mate are one such grouping. Treason's Harbor, The Far Side of the World, and The Reverse of the Medal are another. The Letter of Marque and the ensuing 4 books, centered around a circumnavigation, are another.Though the average quality of the books is remarkably high, some are better than others. I suspect that different readers will have different favorites. I personally prefer some of the books with greater psychological elements. The first book, Master and Commander, is one of my favorites. The last 2 or 3, while good, are not as strong as earlier books. I suspect O'Brian's stream of invention was beginning to diminish. All can be read profitably as stand alone works though there is definitely something to be gained by reading in consecutive order."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"The Patrick O'Brian naval series of books are an acquired taste. If you love the first book, chances are that over the next few years you will find a way to work through the entire series. I do not recommend reading the book on its own. The true joy is seeing the transformation and progression of the two main characters.The books are not for everyone, the writing style differs from what is found in 21st century adventure novels. The language is deep and the sentences are carefully crafted. While the books appear on the outside to be simple naval adventure tales, they are really deep studies in character development of a British naval officer and his best friend/ship surgeon/intelligence operative.The Mauritius Command is one of the best books in the series. Almost the entire book takes place at sea. A few of the earlier book got bogged down whenever the lead character, naval officer Jack Aubrey, steps onto land, but at soon as he takes to sea the books take on a whole new life.While the characters speak of honor and duty, the author makes no attempts to hide the rough, cruel, and violent life aboard British naval ships during the early 19th century. While not a quick read, if you are willing to invest the time and energy, the Mauritius Command and all of the books in the series are well worth you time."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"The opening of THE MAURITIUS COMMAND finds &quot;Lucky&quot; Jack Aubrey married, poor, and bored. He is without a command, on half pay, and doing no more than tinkering with his telescopes. Happily, his particular friend Stephen Maturin comes bearing glad tidings: an assignment leading an expedition to capture the French-held islands of Mauritius and La Reunion just east of Madagascar.Unlike the previous novels, where Jack commands a vessel usually unattached from joint maneuvers, he here commands several ships. Unfortunately, the Commodore (as Jack is temporarily called) has a problem: the captains of the three primary ships are troublesome. Lord Clonfert nurses a long held jealously of Jack's fame and success, and has a tendency for self-promotion and showmanship. Pym is solid, but in the end lacks judgment in battle. Corbett is the polar opposite of Jack in regard to discipline. While Jack believes in discipline, he staunchly believes that brutality and frequent punishment is both cruel and counterproductive, leading to an unhappy ship. Corbett, on the other hand, is a savage disciplinarian, and keeps his crew on the edge of mutiny.All of the novels in the series have their unique appeal, and this one delights in its chronicling the course of a single campaign, a campaign that O'Brian notes is based quite closely on real events. The novel is also superb in its setting in a locale of which most readers will be utterly unfamiliar. It is also fun because more than in the previous novels, Stephen Maturin plays a more prominent role as an intelligence officer, and his work on the islands in fermenting rebellion against the French is as crucial as Jack's role in leading the military expedition.I would caution anyone tempted to read O'Brian to start with the very first novel and work from the first to the last. I deeply love these books, but they do not stand alone."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"At the end of the previous novel in the series, Jack Aubrey is returning home to England and marriage to his beloved Sophie, dreaming of the rosy future.Here in the opening chapters of The Mauritius Command is that future, and they are some of the most sustained humorous scenes of the entire Canon. Poor Jack - marriage isn't quite what he imagined it to be!But all too soon we are away on another cruise with Stephen Maturin, this time with a temporary promotion to Commodore, and the flying of a broad pendant to mark the fact. There's glory for you!The bulk of the novel concerns the more or less historical campaign to win back Mauritus from the French, and it is here that I venture a word of criticism, for Patrick O'Brian bound himself a little too tightly with the actual history and has to resort to some literary strategems to keep up with the sometimes confusing action.But that's by the by and along the way we meet some fascinating new characters, revisit some happy old ones, and spend a reasonable amount of time doing the things that make a Patrick O'Brian novel so well worth reading.I enjoyed this book very much, hence the five star rating, for even a Patrick O'Brian book a trifle off his usual pace is a very good book indeed.It is a good self-contained adventure, very rare in this series where a journey quite often takes four books or so to come to a conclusion, and it comes with the necessary maps at the beginning and an excellent essay on Jack Aubrey's ships at the end, including extracts from the plans of the dear old Surprise.An excellent read and the pleasure is enhanced by the marvellous Geoff Hunt painting on the cover."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series seems to get better with every book. I found the first, Master and Commander, hard slugging and gave the series a second try based on recommendations and the publicity following the author's passing. It has been well worth the second try.Unfortunately, The Mauritius Command reveals the second strategic error that the author made in writing the series. The first error was starting it in 1800 leading to some historical crowding later on. Similarly, the author has let several years slide since HMS Surprise contributing further to the crowding. I have read that the author regretted his timing of the series although in fairness too him it wasn't obvious that Aubrey/Maturin would catch on and that he would ultimately complete 20 novels covering an 18-year period. The novel itself has few flaws and is well paced.Jack Aubrey has spent the intervening years in wedded bliss although his circumstances and life away from the sea have not been kind to him. Not only is Jack Aubrey married but he also has twins. The opening pages make me wonder what married life would have been like for Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth had Jane Austen written a sequel to Pride and Prejudice. The allusions are there and the writing is good enough for O'Brian to pull it off.The Mauritius Command really picks up when the duo return to the sea bound for Capetown and a campaign against the French held islands of La Reunion and Mauritius. Aubrey is to fly a Commodore's pennant and administer a hiding to the French. However, he has to deal with an untrustworthy admiral, captains with varying abilities and fighting spirit and personality conflicts. The tension builds steadily and there is more action than in earlier novels. The conclusion is anti-climactic although it is very neatly tied together.The Mauritius Command was published at roughly the same time as Kent's Passage to Mutiny. Both are examples of the authors at their peaks. O'Brian is clearly the better writer of the two but he doesn't deliver the action the way Kent does. Still if events didn't happen as O'Brian relates, he did a superb job of catching the flavour of the times. He was a great author and The Mauritius Command demonstrates this thoroughly."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"The opening of The Mauritius Command brings us some changes, especially for Captain Jack Aubrey, who finds himself in the improbable role (for him) of husband and father of twins. Unsuccessful and hapless in his domestic life, he immediately jumps at the chance to leave England and take over a new command. Off the coast of Africa, Jack is promoted to commodore, putting him in command not just of his own ship but of a small fleet. In the course of the book, Jack stretches his abilities to the fullest as the British vie with the French for possession of several small islands crucial to controlling the India trade.Of course, Dr. Stephen Maturin is on hand too. His facets as doctor, naturalist, and spy all come into play in the course of the novel. The previous novel, H.M.S. Surprise, involved incredible physical suffering, loss, and rejection for Stephen so it was nice to see him get a break in this installment. However, Stephen is still haunted by what has happened to him. A dark current runs through him that no doubt will resurface in future books.The overriding issue explored in this novel is leadership and what it means to be a good leader. Jack has to deal with two very different captains serving under him, one of whom is a silly and vain man who is kind and familiar with his men and thus beloved by them. The other is a brave commander who exercises brutal tyranny with those under his rule. The weaknesses of both men lead to very different disasters.In spite of the battles and some serious turns of event, The Mauritius Command involves more action and comedy and less angst than H.M.S. Surprise, making it a lighter read."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"This fourth novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series shows more narrative unity than the first three, which is partly a function of Jack Aubrey's now-exalted rank. As a newly promoted commander in a small sloop, and even as a post captain, he was at the beck of more senior officers. Now, as commodore in command of a squadron of several ships-of-the-line and lesser warships, plus a small herd of transports and Indiamen crowded with troops, he has reached a position of high command, with orders to capture the French outpost islands of Mauritius and La Reunion in the Indian Ocean. As Dr. Maturin privately notes in his diary, Jack was probably happier as a junior officer, with only his own ship and men in his direct responsibility; now he must manage other ships's captains at one remove, deal diplomatically with the Army, and oversee the installation of a new British governor. O'Brian hews closely to historical fact in narrating this little-known but complex campaign, and he also delves more deeply into the psychology of the supporting characters -- especially Lord Clonfort, a not unintelligent but very unhappy young commander apparently afflicted with bipolar disorder, who constantly seeks the approval of his own subordinates as well as his seniors. As true historical fiction, this volume is, for me, the most enjoyable in the series yet."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"It's now part of literary legend that J.K. Rowling wrote the final chapter of the final book of her beloved Harry Potter series well before she wrote even half the novels. She knew how the story was going to end, and she said that allowed her to keep a tight rein on the characters, and resist the temptation to let the series spin out of control.One wonders how Patrick O'Brian was able to keep his beloved characters, \\"Lucky Jack\\" Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin, under such control over a series almost three times as long as Rowling's. \\"The Mauritius Command\\" is the fourth book in this amazing series, and O'Brian shows a deft command over both his subject matter and his characters. Often, by the fourth book in a series, the characters start to grow dull. Not only does the reader get the sense of retrodding the same ground, the author has to somehow overcome the sense that his characters are invincible.O'Brian avoids both of these pratfalls with apparent ease. \\"Lucky Jack\\" may be lucky at sea, but he finds new and innovative ways of getting in trouble on land. Now, not only is he ashore with no ship and on half-pay, he must contend with his recently destitute mother-in-law and a brace of twins - girls, no less. Dr. Maturin arrives with the promise of a command and a daring mission - to take two French-controlled islands off Madagascar. Soon Aubrey is at the helm of a ship, but in addition to his usual cares and concerns, he must now cope with being a Commodore, commander over several ships, including several whose captains carry several tragic flaws. These various scenarios allow Aubrey to experience fresh troubles with which he has no actual experience, and wonder whether his old tactics will see him through.Dr. Maturin continues to grow as a character, as well as in practical significance to the storyline. In \\"Master and Commander,\\" he was basically a bystander, an observer of the naval action around him. Now, his role as an intelligence man (read, spy) becomes more important as he plays a vital role in helping the British governor assume his station . . . including playing a game of propaganda warfare against the French. Maturin also gets a few chances to practice his amazing surgical skills, breaks a few bones, and is confronted with his \\"dedication\\" to opium.Not quite as funny as previous books (no drunken sloths to be seen), but with a little more action, \\"The Mauritius Command\\" is a defining book in this series. Even though this book, according to some, can be read out of sequence, I disagree since Aubrey's (temporary) promotion to Commodore falls in line with the other books."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"Of course there is historical and nautical detail and accuracy galore, but the real richness in this novel, like all of the Aubrey/Maturin series lies in the characters, with all their depth and eccentricity, and how they react to this relatively obscure amphibious campaign. No one beats O'Brian for richness of character. All the history and detail is icing on a very tasty cake."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"The fourth in Patrick O'Brian's wonderful seagoing series. O'Brian does not disappoint as Captain Aubrey and Stephen Maturin do battle against the French in the Indian Ocean. Here the plot turns on psychological profiles. Aubrey commands a squadron of ships, and each captain is a different study: Pym steady but unimaginative; Clonfert vainglorious, insecure, and unpredictable; Corbett daring but brutal; and Colonel Keating steady and brave. And there are Aubrey and Maturin, separately and together, musing upon the different elements in each of the captain's characters. As the action progresses, each captain is led into crisis, and each benefits and suffers by his particular choices.In some respects \\"The Mauritius Command\\", at 348 pages in the Norton edition, may be too short. Clonfert is the captain we come to know best, the others are not as fully drawn because we spend no time aboard their ships. Also, the final assault on Mauritius is reduced to a few throw-away lines on the last page, as though O'Brian turned away from the book, unfinished, and simply chose not to write the last two chapters. The book is a good one, O'Brian's intentions are clear. The captains' stark choices are grounded more in their personalities than the circumstances of the struggle. Their fates are sealed long before they join Aubrey in the Indian Ocean. \\"The Mauritius Command\\" is a thrilling psychological study."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"O'Brian is a superb writer. Start at book 1 and work your way through. Don't let the archaic language get you down; the language you don't understand just adds some texture."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"This book is best savored in the audio format.

Thoroughly enjoyed it. Particularly happy to find the book so quickly in Amazon's used collection. I'm working my way through this series, and using Amazon makes it easy to get the books I need that aren't readily available locally.This book, in connection with the others, offers a deep insight into the British Navy's operations at the turn of the 19th century. As a maritime lawyer this gives substance to the English admiralty law's treatment of seamen as wards of the court. The absolute power of the ship's master and the focus of maritime life as taking prizes and deriving wealth from that is something we have no modern corollary for. Admittedly, the sailing terms are a challenge in the beginning, but as I work through the series, I've learned a lot about sailing and how dangerous and difficult life at sea was."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"As the Wars of Napoleon continue unabated at land and on the high seas, Captain Jack Aubrey languishes in England with no ship to command; no missions to accomplish. Fortunately for \\"Lucky\\" J. Aubrey, and the reader, Stephen Maturin, his erstwhile companion, ship's surgeon and naval intelligence agent arrives on the scene with a new command for Aubrey and a mission of the greatest importance to the Royal Navy. Two strategically critical islands in the southern Indian Ocean have been seized and fortified by the French navy, and turned into bases of operation for a handful of Bonaparte's frigates preying upon the British trade to and from India. Captain Aubrey, given the temporary rank of Commodore, is dispatched to take command of a squadron, coordinate with an expeditionary army regiment gathering nearby, and capture Mauritius and la'Reunion; as usual answering to the contrary \\"at his own peril\\". Stephen Maturin traveling with his old friend again is instructed by naval intelligence to utilize his own unique skills as an operative to bring the initiative back to the British forces. It is these islands, Mauritius and la'Reunion that provide the martial backdrop of this latest adventure in the Aubrey Maturin Series.The novel is one of O'Brian's better, which is saying a good deal- starting with this story's predecessor, \\"HMS Surprise\\", O'Brian begins to reach his real stride as the author of this much beloved series. Both Aubrey and Maturin are showcased, and their adventures are thrilling to read. Putting Aubrey to the test, he is given a squabbling set of Captains to manage, Army colleagues to coordinate and senior Admirals to dodge; not to mention the French frigates and ground forces as his adversaries. Stephen Maturin for his part deals with the intricacies of subversion, as well as his usual recollections on human nature, life at sea, and a growing addiction to laudanum- an opiate.Exciting, interesting, thought-provoking, at times funny; any Patrick O'Brian book is a good read, and this is one of his best."},{"Title":"Mauritius Command","review":"I enjoyed the whole series of these books, and was so enthralled I read them one after the other this summer.

His only allies are a roan mustang who'll die before he tires, and a 16-year-old half-Mexican, half-Apache girl who becomes his companion for the last leg of the run to Lampasas.Of course since Button is telling the story in first person, you feel pretty sure he's going to somehow elude or destroy his enemies, but the suspense comes in seeing how he does it and how many narrow escapes he has in the meantime--while also having to grow up in a big hurry, since, as he admits, his father and brothers have tended to baby him a bit. He's never even fired a gun in anger in his life. Yet by fast thinking, outrageous good luck, and the help of a very honorable old Mexican and the unexpected side-switching of one of the gunmen, he succeeds in saving his family's fortunes and sees their killers dead--although, disappointingly, it looks as if the power behind them will never pay as he should. Will Henry, an award-winning author who was very well known in his day, has a distinct and unmistakeable voice and sometimes an almost poetical style, although Button's and May Otero's more-or-less love-at-first-sight seems a bit improbable to me. It's not a great Western, but it's satisfying and written without any desire to shock, as many of the newer examples aren't."},{"Title":"Spiritual Journals: Genesee Diary, Gracias, the Road to Daybreak","review":"This journals give us a glimpse of Nouwen internal struggle and spirituality.Each of the entries is like a portal of what God was doing in Nouwens life.

A hail of minor shells could not have given her upper works a more broken, torn, and devastated aspect; and she had about her the worn, weary air of ships coming from the far ends of the world - and indeed with truth, for in her short passage she had been very far; sighting, truly, even the coast of the Great Beyond, whence no ship ever returns to give up her crew to the dust of the earth.\\" TyphoonConrad is a master of observation. His novels and short stories aren't great narratives and dramas so much as they are depictions of the mind and the human spirit. In Typhoon, to be sure, nothing really happens: a coastal ship with a bizarre captain encounters some \\"dirty weather knocking about\\" and barely survives. Except for the ending, it's \\"The Perfect Storm\\" without the A-List cast.The relationship between Mr. Jukes, the first officer, and Captain McWhirr, the distant and preoccupied ship's master, is the story, such as it is. The Captain is infuriatingly obtuse, choosing to trust his own judgment rather than the experience of others:\\"Captain McWhirr, took a run and brought himself up by an awning stanchion.\\"A Profane man,\\" he said, obstinately. \\"If this goes on, I'll have to get rid of him first chance.\\" \\"It's the heat,' said Jukes. \\"The weather's awful. It would make a saint swear. Even up here I feel exactly as if I had my head tied up in a woolen blanket.\\" Captain McWhirr looked up. \\"D'ye mean to say, Mr. Jukes, that you ever had your head tied up in a blanket? What was that for?\\" It's a manner of speaking, sir.\\" Said Jukes,Stolidly.I cite another paragraph of Conrad's simply for the beauty of his language (which, after all, he didn't learn until he was 20 years old):\\"The Nan-Shan was plowing a vanishing furrow upon the circle of the sea thathad the surface and the shimmer of an undulating piece of gray silk. The sun, paleand without rays, poured down leaden heat in a strangely indecisive light, and the Chinamen were lying prostrate about the decks. Their bloodless, pinched, yellowfaces were like the faces of bilious invalids.... The smoke struggled with difficulty out of the funnel, and instead of streamingaway spread itself out like an infernal sort of cloud, smelling of sulphur and raining soot all over the decks.\\"Another reviewer has taken other critics to task for panning Conrad's work. I won't bother: it's enough for me to know that Conrad is ranked among the greatest of writers of English. From his novels (Nostromo, Lord Jim) to short works (Heart of Darkness; The Secret Sharer) he is a universally acknowledged master. -Philip HenryFIVE STARS *****"},{"Title":"Typhoon and Other Stories (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"The stories in this book are sea tales in Conrad's tradition of pessimistic, psychological fiction. Typhoon is particularly good, but the other stories are interesting as well. If it seems like Conrad is just writing adventure stories, well, that's just not true. He's writing about the most important themes, and setting them against a backdrop of exciting seafaring and travel.If a reader finished Heart of Darkness, and enjoyed it, then that reader might want to pick this book up next, and give it a whirl."},{"Title":"Typhoon and Other Stories (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"This Penguin edition assembles 4 stories that were first published together in 1904, and written in nearly the same sequence. 3 were first published in magazines, 1 not. The reasons why 'Falk' was not able to find a magazine publisher are attributed either to its inconvenient length, or to the upsetting subject of canibalism.The stories share several themes: the sea is there, even when the action is on land, and so are ships and the people who spend parts of their lives on them. Alienation is in all, being a stranger, being expatriate, as is the reverse of the medal, xenophobia, condescension, racism.One common theme is 'imagination', twice for the alleged lack of it, twice for the obvious overabundance of it.Best of the crop is Typhoon, which I have reviewed separately and longer. A funny adventure story, as I see it.The other long story is Falk, which is actually 2 for the price of one. The main story, the frame, is a farce about expatriates in Bangkok; inside the main story, the title hero tells the narrator his adventure on a Danish steamer that went adrift in the Southern ocean, leading to the horrifying experience that some readers found disgusting.2 shorter stories are set in Kentish villages near the sea, and both deal with strangers. Amy Foster is the far better one of the two stories, dealing with a shipwrecked man from Eastern Europe who gets stranded and is treated like an animal until he slowly manages to establish a rudimentary foothold in a hostile environment. The title hero is a domestic helper who is the first to show pity for the 'madman' and even falls in love. Tragically, she is not fully able to discard the prejudices of her countrymen. (Is there an autobiographical component here? John Stape, the Conrad biographer who wrote the introduction, thinks not. I guess he is right.)The last story (To-Morrow) is maybe the least remarkable piece of writing from Conrad that I know, and quite forgettable."},{"Title":"Typhoon and Other Stories (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Conrad is a genius. His works are among the great works of world literature and these stories are among Conrad's best.I read the paperback Modern Library edition of Typhoon and Other Stories. This is a good edition. It is very nicely produced and printed. The introduction by Barry Unsworth is useful and this edition also includes an author's note and short bio of Conrad. The notes by Nels Pearson are a bit odd and some are distracting. He makes questionable literary comments and defines some obvious terms but leaves many others undefined. Two stars for the notes."},{"Title":"Japan's Political Marketplace","review":"This was one of my textbooks for a class in Japanese politics, and while some of the tables and charts might seem superfluous or overwhelming to someone with little background on the subject (like myself), the book's first two chapters make up a particularly good summary of Japan's political structure, discussing briefly how culture plays into it, and how voters and the electoral systems are organized.Each of the ten chapters also has a conclusion that clarifies the content of the chapter, which I found an effective tool for understanding the denser material -- the many factions of the Liberal Democratic Party (Japan's main ruling party), and how its conservative leaders have been able to maintain power relatively uninterrupted in Japan."},{"Title":"Broken acres","review":"Broken Acres is a moving story of the courage, faith, and compassion of poverty-stricken children who lived on a tobacco farm. It is a heart-warming story of kind and caring kids who figured out a way to earn money to help another child with health challenges.I had the honor of reading the manuscript before it went to print -- when it was a long continuous roll of paper called a galley proof. I was asked by John F. Blair, Publisher, to create the book jacket design along with four black and white illustrations. I was in total shock when the book came as a large roll of paper. It was strange not having pages to turn. I read the manuscript in one sitting marking the passages to be considered for illustrations.When I finished the manuscript, the floor was a sea of paper. I had never before read a book without pages. I did not know how to re-roll the parts I had read. They fell to the floor. I stood up and found myself knee deep in the looped and curled paper. In that moment, I felt I was standing in the tobacco field with the children. Excitement welled up from within. The manuscript was alive. The author's words created visual images with clarity. I felt confident that I could do justice to the written word with my style of woodcut illustrations.The next day I enjoyed reading the story separate and apart from selecting passages for possible illustrations. It is a heart-touching story. With enthusiasm and great pleasure I immediately created a small edition of the cover design and four illustrations. The process of carving the images in blocks of wood flowed smoothly. The color separations of the book jacket design matched up perfectly. For me this meant the author's words and the artist's illustrations were synchronized and in harmony.Many years later I met the author. We were guests in a public school where we each talked about our parts in producing the finished book. Children responded with eager anticipation. Each child had a book that we both signed. It was a great joy touching children with the content of the book as well as the personal discussions of how Broken Acres came to be written and illustrated.Broken Acres is an unusual story written with sensitivity and insight. It gave me the feeling of being in the tobacco fields working with the children toward a common goal. I saw life through their eyes. I recommend the book for easy reading, good imagery, plus a unique and moving story. It is not only a book for children - but also one that can be enjoyed by readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Still Point Dhammapada: Living the Buddha's Essential Teachings","review":"P'arang (the Buddhist name of author Geri Larkin) does what very few other writers are able to do these days: Write a compelling, sometimes humorous, always fiercely insightful book that's hard to put down.In fact, I finished The Still Point Dhammapada: Living the Buddha's Essential Teachings in just two evenings -- and I'm sure I'll refer to it repeatedly in days to come.The purpose of the book is two-fold: (1) It includes a very smooth-flowing, inclusive-language rendering of the Dhammapada, and (2) Interwoven with the Dhammapada is Ms. Larkin's observations about everything from what it's like to provide a haven for the folks in downtown Detroit, to daily struggles to abide by the Buddha's teachings to meetings with everyday (albeit fascinating) people.P'arang's tone is always self-effacing, earthy and compassionate. Real. Sincere. She comes across as someone you'd like to chat with over a cup of tea.For the record, I'm a Christian. Yet, I have recently become fascinated by Zen and have read many books on this ancient worldview. Why? Because I appreciate its philosophy of &quot;mindfulness,&quot; which means to be fully awake and aware of life and to relish every minute, every thing, and every person along the way.Zen is a simple worldview, yet it can be as deep and vast as you'd like it to be.So it's no wonder I enjoyed Ms. Larkin's book so much. Her writing exemplifies what Zen has to offer.If you're wondering how Zen Buddhists live their lives, you ought to consider reading The Still Point Dhammapada. It's one of the best books I've read on the subject -- although I don't think Ms. Larkin's goal was to write an apologetic for Buddhism. I think she just wanted to share her observations and comments about life as a Zen Buddhist teacher. Take 'em or leave 'em.I took 'em. And really enjoyed The Still Point Dhammapada. I found it to be a wonderful peek into the world of Zen Buddhism from someone who knows it well. I highly recommend it -- along with The Still Point Zen Buddhist Temple web site."},{"Title":"The Still Point Dhammapada: Living the Buddha's Essential Teachings","review":"Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike: read this book!! The Still Point Dhammapada is moving and wise - the translations of the Buddha's words are simple (in the best sense) yet, of course, profound. Equally compelling are the stories from the streets around the Still Point abbey and temple. There are lots of stereotypes about Detroit - and Larkin & co. add voice and vision so that readers can really get a feel for the life of the neighborhood and the practice of \\"guerilla kindness.\\" But don't mistake this for some pollyanna-ish text; the stories are alternately heartbreaking, funny and gritty.

This is not an introduction to meditation practice itself (that territory is amply covered elsewhere) but a look at a young community of practitioners findings its way, and the Way, in 21st century Detroit.This community worked together on an adapted translation of the &lt;i&gt;Dhammapada&lt;/i&gt;, a much-beloved collection of sayings of the Buddha which provide day-to-day, moment-by-moment encouragement that it is possible to let go of greed, anger, and delusion, and live a life that lists to deep awareness and compassion like a current that carries an empty boat.This is not merely a literary project, however. This version of the &lt;i&gt;Dhammapada&lt;/i&gt;, which breathes with fresh language and terms easily acceptable to new students in the United States, comes to us through the personal practice of the members of this community, whom we get to know through the short, anecdotal chapters that follow each &lt;i&gt;canto&lt;/i&gt; of the text. Ancient wisdom, and the bumpy business of everyday life, interact in something almost approximating parallel text.So it is a window into a process, a process by which a new Zen community matures, and by which an American Buddhism is slowly taking form.

I believe Ms. Larkin's version is a bit too watered down.For example, in Wallis's version in the first chapter he translates a section as follows:Some do not understandthat we are perishing here.Those who understand thisbring to rest their quarrels.As far as I can figure out, Ms. Larkin has this same section as follows:So many people fail to realize thatin quarrelingwe ourselves are destroyed.Those who recognizethis truthrestrain their quarrels.Personally I find Wallis's (who has a Ph.D. in Sanskrit and Indian Studies from Harvard) translation much richer yet still very accessible."},{"Title":"Joe R. Lansdale And Timothy Truman's On the Far Side with Dead Folks","review":"Joe Lansdale is one of the best horror writers in the business today and it's great to see someone putting out comic adaptations of his stories. His graphic and visceral style is well-suited to the comics. This tale is based on a classic Romero-esque zombie story he wrote called \\"On the Far Side of the Cadillac Desert with Dead Folks\\". It's sort of a Dawn of the Dead meets Omega Man type story. Lansdale provides an introduction in the book that features are by Tim Truman, best known for his Grimjack series for First Comics back in the 1980's. Lansdale touts Truman as the finest comic artist in the business. That may be stretching things a tad bit but Truman is very good. Oddly though, while the full page illustrations in this book by Truman are quite gorgeous, the actually story art is somewhat bland and has a rushed look to it. It's done strictly in black and white with out any grays or even zip-a-tone to give the art and depth or shading and Truman's usual fine line work is missing.The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where a virus was released causing the dead to return to life to feed on the living. Pretty standard stuff there. A bounty hunter enters a desert strip club where they actually have nude female zombies as the entertainment. Their mouths are sealed shut so they can't bite and the sign outside advertises them as \\"perfumed and maggot-free\\". Nice...The bounty hunter is after a murderer named Calhoun and after a brief brawl, he takes his prey into custody. While driving through the desert they're attacked by a tank-like vehicle and captured by a band of zombies and fanatical nuns who serve a man who calls himself Lazarus. This man, we discover, is the one who actually created the virus that spread throughout the world. He's now using the blood of those not yet affected to try and find a cure. Lazarus has found a way to control the zombies and they now worship him as a God. With the help of one of the nuns who knows Lazarus is mad and wants out, the three escape into the desert for the final, grim climax to the story.Like much of Landsdale's work, this is a raw, bloody, and bleak tale. There's no heroic figures here to root for. The story is short but intense. The idea of lap-dancing zombies is thoroughly bizarre but probably quite accurate if a situation like this ever came to pass. Using a Disney-style theme park as the lair of Lazarus and his zombies was a nice little dig as well. I'll give the story five stars but I still think the art could have been a bit better, especially having seen Truman do so much outstanding work over the years. This one is definitely for mature readers.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Joe R. Lansdale And Timothy Truman's On the Far Side with Dead Folks","review":"and hang with the Dead Folks! On the Far Side with Dead Folks is a faithful adaptation of Joe Lansdale's classic zombie story On the Far Side of the Cadillac Desert with Dead Folks. It is vintage Lansdale, vulgar, funny, and, odd as it sounds, achingly humane. A mixture of the Romero Mythos (the original story was written for the anthology The Book of the Dead) and pulp men's adventure yarn, Dead Folks tells the tale of a tough bounty hunter that captures one bad dude, only to run into a crazy cult on the way back to collect his reward. Things get a bit complicated after that. Of all the Lansdale adaptations that Avatar has done, Dead Folks gets my vote as the best. Highly recommended to Lansdale fans."},{"Title":"Joe R.

The main action takes place during a freak, intense wind storm the eskimos call a \\"williwaw,\\" it whips down off the coastal mountains and causes havoc, freak seas, etc. Gore Vidal, in this, his first novel (1946), creates a wonderful Joseph Conradian feel as tensions mount aboard a army transport ship making a weekly run. I don't want to spoil the ending. There is (I thought) a very CLIMACTIC moment when the tensions among the crew rise to their heights just as the williwaw hits, and - something happens. The serious tone and cool style of this book I found admirable. As a war novel I liked it as much as the ver different Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22,\\" and the lyrical, Tennessee Williams-like John Horne Burns' novel \\"The Gallery,\\" while I liked it more so than Mailer's \\"Naked and the Dead\\" - which I liked for its themes and observations, I just wish Mailer could have (in my opinion) skipped the repetition and saved about 400 pages."},{"Title":"Williwaw","review":"The copyright page of Gore Vidal's \\"Williwaw\\" notes that the novel was first published in 1946. In a preface Vidal describes the background of this novel. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II and, at age 19, became first mate of an army freight-supply ship based in the Aleutian Islands. He worked on this book while on night watch in port. \\"Williwaw\\" is similarly set in the Aleutian Islands during that war, and focuses on the passengers and crew of an army freight-passenger ship that is skippered by a warrant officer. The story follows the ship's perilous passage between islands. Vidal sheds light on the book's title in his preface: he defines williwaws as \\"sudden devastating winds that come without warning down from the island mountains.\\"Vidal has crafted a gripping wartime adventure. He masterfully charts the crew's struggle against the harsh, and potentially deadly, Aleutian environment. Equally compelling is the tension and conflict that build among the crew members. As the story develops, Vidal creates vivid portraits of the Aleutian Islands and the sea around them. The story is rich in details of the crew's daily life and routine on board the ship, as well as of their recreation in a seedy port town.Overall, Vidal's prose style in the book is very clean and matter-of-fact; I found it a very effective mode for this particular story. His portrait of the wartime Army is full of satiric touches that are sometimes subtle, sometimes funny. Ultimately \\"Williwaw\\" struck me as having a dark, almost nihilistic vision of the human condition. But it's a darkness that I found thought-provoking, and not repellent. Through his plot and characters Vidal takes such basic concepts as love, religion, heroism, and justice and seems to strip them bare. \\"Williwaw\\" is, in my judgment, not only a solid adventure tale, but also a unique and compelling contribution to the canon of American war fiction."},{"Title":"Williwaw","review":"A straightforward story set in an unusual place, but not that compelling. Nothing much happens for the first half except inane conversations between bored men who don't see much action in the frozen islands off Alaska (probably true to life when various men are thrown together and have nothing in common except their life on board). Interest mounts as the ship at sea is hit with a storm. It ends rather abruptly, though, and can't really be described as a war story."},{"Title":"Williwaw","review":"This is the first book by Gore Vidal that I have read. I was looking for another book of his, Julian, in Kindle format and ran accross Williwaw. I am happy that I found Williwaw.

Ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. The weak get strong and the strong get complacent. I marvel at the depth of understand that Vidal had at age 19 when he wrote this story. I now appreciate his gift."},{"Title":"Williwaw","review":"I hadn't read anything by Gore Vidal since MYRA BRECKENRIDGE back in the sixties. It was only when I read his recent obituary that I learned of his obscure first novel, WILLIWAW, written when he was just twenty years old. When I found out it was somewhat autobiographical, about his wartime experiences aboard a US Army Transport Service ship in the Aleutians, I was immediately interested. The copy I read was a well-worn paperback Signet reprint edition from 1968. The book was first published in 1946, perhaps one of the earliest novels by a serviceman to come out of WWII. A slim volume, not even 150 pages, not a whole lot really happens in it. There is a jealous competition between two shipmates for the affections of a Dutch Harbor whore. There is a death, yet whether it is in fact a murder, remains questionable. Vidal's omniscient point-of-view gives the reader a fairly in-depth look inside the thoughts of several of the book's characters - Evans, the skipper; Duval, the chief engineer; Martin, a mate; Bervick and others. And there are the three passengers too: Major Barkison, a rank-hungry career officer who dreams of unlikely glory; a Catholic chaplain, a former Maryland Monk; and a green young Lieutenant, the Major's assistant. All of the characters are finely wrought and fully developed. The writing style is extremely Hemingway-esque with its terse clipped declarative sentences and tight-lipped macho dialogue. In the author's note to the Signet edition Vidal acknowledges this, and more -\\"But young novelists are imitative; they must be for they have not lived long enough to know who they are or - perhaps more to the point - who those others in the world are. I was certainly influenced by Hemingway, as many critics noted. But I was even more influenced by Stephen Crane, which only one critic noticed.\\"If there are flaws in WILLIWAW, I would have to say one is its redundancy. I mean you can get pretty tired of characters mulling over weather possibilities for pages and pages, even knowing that weather in the Bering Sea can be pretty dangerous, which is, of course the crux of the story. A \\"williwaw\\" is a native term for a violent storm in that region. The other flaw would be the lack of any real action. It takes nearly a hundred pages for the storm to arrive. There is a passage on page 96 that kind of echoed my own impatience with this -\\"Martin yawned. The monotony of waiting was beginning to get on his nerves.\\"Mine too. I nearly gave up on the book a few times. But the description of the storm and its aftermath and the toll it took on ship, crew and passengers was, I suppose, worth waiting for. And when I consider, as I did continuously while reading the book, that its author was only twenty years old, well, it's really a considerable accomplishment. Vidal himself says, at the end of his author's note: \\"With the finishing of this book, my life as a writer began.\\" And what a writer's life it was.- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, BOOKLOVER"},{"Title":"Williwaw","review":"Williwaw stands on it's own as a sea novel in the tradition not of Conrad, but of Steven Crane (as Vidal himself acknowledges). The story concerns members of the crew of an Army freighter in Aleutians at the close of the WWII. Lonely, disparate, the crew's conflicts work on the ship as it carries a priest, a major and his aide across the Being Sea during storm season. Somewhat typical of the new wave of WWII novels, Williwaw moves through the thoughts of each character, though with less depth (and distraction) than Mailer or James Jones. The main trouble comes between Bervick, the 3rd Mate, a sergeant, and Duval, a Warrant Officer, the boat's chief engineer as they fight obliquely over a woman. Each character's self-delusions, especially the superstitions of sea-going men, are explored to good effect. The Storm itself is rather brief, but dangerous, and rendered with a sharp economy that Vidal would abandon in his later historical novels. Certainly one of his better works, with little agenda besides telling the story."},{"Title":"Williwaw","review":"I have to give some background behind my 5-star rating. My father was in the Army Transport Service during World War II and ran boats similar to the vessel central to this story in the Aleutian Islands during the war. In fact, he and Gore Vidal may very well have crossed paths. So I have an interest in this story that many may not. I also worked on boats in the general area so I could very much relate to the story. But if one has an interest in the sea or the war in the Aleutian Islands, this is a worthy read."},{"Title":"Williwaw","review":"I ordered this book because of the title. I have been familiar with Gore Vidal's work for a long while but never discovered this title until doing research for a novel set in the Aleutian Islands during World War II (Paul Radford's Alaskan Exile). What made Williwaw particularly useful to me was the fact that Vidal served in the Aleutians during this period and communicated the feel of the place far better than most of the documents I was using. However, the story is well written and I find reading Vidal's earlier style refreshing. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Divided Houses: Gender and the Civil War","review":"Divided Houses: Gender and the Civil War is a collection of essays pertaining to the crisis in gender relations that accompanied the Civil War in America. As a collection, the essays present a narrative that chronicles the various impacts on gender that affected men and women, the North and the South, as well as slaves and non-slaves. What emerges is a cohesive body of text that is informative, illuminating, and instructive. The themes most explored in this volume are those of empowerment through abolitionism. In The Civil War as a Crisis in Gender Relations by Leann Whites, the two groups most perceptive of the gender crisis were Northern feminists and black abolitionists. During the Civil War, the public status of motherhood increased. This leads to another theme that will later be explored in following essays, that of the State as family. In this first essay, Leann Whites argues that the Civil War created circumstances for gender equality, both diminishing white Southern male masculinity and increasing black manhood. Ideas of manhood during the Civil War are further investigated in Part II and in Reid Mitchell's Soldiering, Manhood, and Coming of Age: A Northern Volunteer. The journey from civilian to soldier was mirrored in the transition from boyhood to manhood, and the constitution of manhood evolved as a delicate balance of masculinity and manly restraint. During the Civil War, the body politic as well as the army assumed familial ties to facilitate solidarity. Despite the changes in notions of manhood, for the black male population the \\"empowerment\\" was not always beneficial. Jim Cullen's Gender and African-American Men details how conceptions of black manhood changed during the Civil War, with the mastery over one's own body leading to mastery in warfare. Despite being placed on some of the most dangerous fronts, black soldiers endured low pay and high disease in exchange for their mastery over their bodies. In Part III of Divided Houses: Gender and the Civil War, the themes move from issues of manhood to those relating to women. In Arranging a Doll's House: Refined Women as Union Nurses author Kristie Ross writes about female volunteers on hospital transports, and she draws from the familial theme by presenting the hospital transport as the rearrangement of a doll's house to appear domestic. Ross also reveals a sense of agency for women volunteers, claiming that many felt \\"...an eagerness to seize an occasion to escape the routine pattern of their lives and a familiarity with genteel standards of household organization.\\" (101) Lyde Cullen Sizer's Acting Her Part: Narratives of Union Women Spies also deals with the issue of female agency during the Civil War, but Sizer further examines the repercussions women felt depending on whether they were white or black. For white women spies, their efforts were more dramatic than substantial, whereas for black abolitionists like Harriet Tubman the cause and consequences of being a spy were much more realistic. Sizer's essay is also an attempt to place female spy narratives in a literary context from which they have been excluded. Of all the essays in Divided Houses, none is more colorful and titillating than Michael Fellman's Women and Guerrilla Warfare. Through his dramatic prose, Fellman explores how peacetime morality was subverted through guerrilla warfare, with male guerrilla fighters attacking traditional values while physically attacking women. Fellman, doubtless, is presenting a form of psychological history by claiming \\"there was also an additional element here of bad boys acting out against a nagging, smothering mother.\\" (151) For many Kansas guerrilla regiments during the Civil War, the \\"freeing\\" of slaves was an act of defiance rather than a moralistic pursuit. Guerrilla warfare finally reinforced the need for love, security, and family. The fourth part of Divided Houses closely examines dynamics on the Southern homefront. Peter Bardaglio's The Children of Jubilee: African-American Childhood in Wartime explains how prior to the Civil War, slave children were age-segregated but not gender-segregated. With freedom as a concept first emerging for many slaves during the Civil War, play activities among children became more gendered. Martha Hodes's Wartime Dialogues on Illicit Sex: White Women and Black Men further draws on the theme of black male power as a political issue emerging during the Civil War, which consequently led to sexuality itself becoming a political issue. With most yeoman farmers at war, the homefront became a location for \\"illicit\\" sex as well as the performative stage for class discord. The Southern states were not the only ones to feel the impact on gender relations that the Civil War created: Part V examines gender issues on the Northern homefront with Patricia R. Hill's Writing Out the War: Harriet Beecher Stowe's Averted Gaze. In Part VI, essays examine how the politics of Reconstruction became gendered, with Northern women beginning to campaign for the vote and new labor opportunities for African-American men and women. In spite of these advances, however, the ruling classes in the South still attempted to exert authority and black women were still subjected to southern white male violence, as evidenced in Catherine Clinton's concluding essay, Reconstructing Freedwomen. Divided Houses: Gender and the Civil War is a combination of various historiographical methodologies; cultural, social, psychological, intellectual and political, which simultaneously present a coherent and evocative study of wartime's affect on gender relations. In addition to mapping themes in gender relations during war, narratives of women's undertaking of professional and managerial duties while men were fighting in the Civil War provides a historical anchoring of the themes of female labor that were to arise again during the First, and especially Second, World War."},{"Title":"Divided Houses: Gender and the Civil War","review":"This book was a requirement for my class and pretty darn interesting.

Reading the introduction allows you to see \\"The Man Who Spoke to Animals,\\" through the eyes of his beloved son, Christopher.Lofting served as a combat engineer in the Irish Guard, one of the British Army's elite regiments. While in the trenches he wrote home to his children, Colen and Elizabeth, subsequently creating Dr. Dolittle.

Dalene's book is unpretentious and accessible to any enthusiast or beginner. The method is clearly shown and applies to all flowers alike with some minor variations. Her photos are beautiful and one can clearly see what to aim for when making the flower. I don't expect to be shown or told how to display the flowers nor what beads to use, nor where to buy them as these issues are for the beader to experiment with. I have been beading for about a year and love it. I have used a Russian and a French book extensively and never had difficulty finding and trying various types of beads as well as sizes--thus that Dalene leaves this as a choice to the beader is to permit creative license and experiment by the beader. I personally prefer the Russian, or Danish method as many call it, but that doesn't mean that I never make use of the French method and Dalene's book certainly gives the beader many opportunities and flowers to try and to strive for in regards to her perfect bending and tight wiring method. I am delighted that one more source of beaded flowers has been made available to us, especially as many of the &quot;Bibles&quot; of the likes of Nathanson and others of 30 years ago, are now out of print. I would recommend this book for it's patterns, for it's photos of finished items, and also simply as a source of ideas for one's own work or patterns. I commend Dalene for commiting to publishing when she sells her patterns on line for a reasonable price and also her booklets of patterns and I feel sure that she made more money for herself that way than this--but we her audience of beaders will be forever grateful for her most generous act--that of sharing her own intellectual property and for under $20!! The book is also very pleasing to the eye and worth looking at to see how varied beaded flowers can be--look at the picture for e.g. of the bleeding heart flower."},{"Title":"French-Beaded Flowers","review":"Dalene Kelly has put together a beautiful, informative and helpful book. Upon deciding to take up the art of French Beaded Flowers, it was frustrating to not have current and resonably priced resources available to begin learning to make these beautiful creations. As my intent was to start with full-size flowers rather than miniatures, the publication of her book was greatly appreciated.I have purchased and read Dalene's French-Beaded Flower book and made flowers from three of the patterns. As one new to this craft, I was not sure if this was something that would be beyond my abilities. However, I was able to work through the patterns and come up with very pleasing results. I appreciated the way Dalene used color suggestions and left actual color choices up to the individual. This allows some creativity on the part of the user even though they are following the flower design of the writer.The clear photographs are beautifully done with vivid colors. Dalene has included a good variety of flowers, some more challenging than others, which appears to be designed for a wide range of talents. Although experienced beaders can skip over the well written basic instructions and general information about bead sizes and wire guage, new beaders will find this section extremely helpful. I also appreciated the website references which were included at the end of the book, but will note that people without computer access will not be able to take advantage of this information and including addresses and phone numbers of these resources would have been helpful for them.I consider this book the perfect beginning of my beaded flower resource library."},{"Title":"French-Beaded Flowers","review":"This book stinks! When I first saw it, I was impressed w/ all the diagrams - until I realized that the same diagram was repeated on each page to pad out the book. It omitted essential information (such as which size/cut beads are best for different areas of the flowers/leaves)and seems solely designed to make a buck. Don't waste your money; instead, buy Virginia Nathanson's recently reprinted masterpiece, Helen McCall's paperback, the forthcoming Beads in Bloom, the gorgeous Italian book translated into English, etc. They'll provide much better directions (to say the least), much more variety (and ways to display them), essential info Ms. Kelly omits, etc.I was on Dalene Kelly's beaded flower mailing list when someone posted that there was a negative review here on Amazon, and said that, although she hadn't seen the book, Dalene was her friend, so she was going to post that that review wasn't helpful, and post her own glowing review of the book she'd never seen, and recommended that everyone else do the same. I see that they have. That sort of garbage taints Amazon's reviews; people should be able to post sincere reviews based on actually seeing the book, not post something glowing just because the author is a friend. I use Amazon reviews to decide whether or not I'd be interested in a book (which I may want even if the review is negative, if the complaint is clear, and doesn't involve something I care about), so making up things just to help the author hurts everyone, since people like me will stop buying books by unknown authors if we think the reviews are tainted by friends/family who haven't even seen the books they're raving about.I honestly believe that this book stinks, and that you'd be much wiser to buy one of the growing number of outstanding books on this subject. This author seems to just want to make a buck, period, and is more interested in selling books and getting new students to join her classes than in teaching people to make beaded flowers. At best, this is the paint-by-number version of flower beading, leaving you dependent on the author for everything you do. The other authors provide tools with which to adapt or even create your own designs. Don't waste your money on this one!"},{"Title":"French-Beaded Flowers","review":"This is a wonderful new book on the French technique of making bead flowers. It thoroughly discusses techniques, tools, materials and supplies, using clear graphics and complete explanations. The flowers Ms. Kelly demonstrates cover a wide range of difficulty. The beginners' projects like the delightful Trillium and the lovely Shamrock work up quickly, and lead the artist through the basic techniques used in the great majority of more advanced projects. More complicated projects like the Oriental Poppy, with its challenging spoked and layered center, satisfy the more advanced beader. Ms. Kelly also offers instructions in corsages and bridal veils! There is plenty of bright, close-up photography of finished bead flowers. All in all a very satisfying new book. Thank you Ms. Kelly! (This reader is a 30-year+ veteran of creating bead flowers, and has won many blue ribbons locally and several ribbons internationally for her bead-flower work.) Rosemary Topol"},{"Title":"French-Beaded Flowers","review":"While these weren't the first beaded flower patterns in my collection, it was the first book...and I've never regretted my decision to purchase it! It is a wonderful resource, with clear patterns and assembly instructions. The fact that she gives general recommendations for colors then leaves the actual color selection up to the crafter/artist is commendable. (I very rarely use recommended colors in patterns, preferring to go my own way and trust my own color choices. I am most appreciative of the fact that Ms Kelly doesn't try to &quot;hold my hand&quot; when it comes to my creative choices.)I am currently designing my wedding bouquet, the bouquets for my brides maids, as well as the corsages for the mothers/grandmothers in the wedding party...So far, with the exception of the beaded wheat I'm working on, everything I'm planning on using has come from this book! (As an aside, Ms Kelly does have a beaded wheat pattern available, just not in the book. However, I had already found another pattern to use before I discovered that...) The biggest problem I've had is trying to determine which of her patterns to use, if I don't limit myself, my bouquet is going to be to heavy to carry!"},{"Title":"French-Beaded Flowers","review":"I have several other beaded flower books. While I wouldn't consider Kelly's to be the utmost book for the beginner (for that I'd recommend &quot;French Beaded Flowers I: A Guide for Beginners&quot; by Helen McCall), I've found it to be great as an intermediate-advanced flower beader.The photographs of the flowers are very nice, and more importantly, they are large close-ups that help the reader figure out how to make the flower. There isn't much suggestion as to colours used, but I actually prefer the &quot;suggestion&quot; of the picture and then to make my own choice based on availability of beads, cost, etc. That's part of being a creative person; knowing how to tailor a pattern or design to your own whim. And I've done that with a few of Kelly's flowers; where I wanted it to look slightly differently, I simply altered the count. That's not something a beginner could do.The best part about this book is it shows how to make some really neat flowers, many of which can be altered by the experienced flower beader to create &quot;natural&quot; bouquets. This really is more of a pattern book than a how-to book, and I quite like it for that purpose. I even took it on holiday with me to keep up with my flower beading addiction!Comparing this to the old Nathanson et al books, I like this one better. I am visually oriented, and having a large, colour picture to work from is ten times more useful to me than overly verbose, confusing instructions. People who require lengthy word explanations may have some trouble with the patterns, although honestly, they don't seem difficult to me at all. Sometimes I don't even bother to read the assembly instructions because it's obvious from the picture.As for words like &quot;hemostat,&quot; sure, Kelly uses some technical words for technical objects. I didn't know what it was, so I looked it up and learned a new word and got a hint about something that might be of great help to me (haven't got one to try it yet). I don't see any problem with introducing new words to people in a book; authors shouldn't have to define every word they use, since that's what dictionaries are for. I appreciate that Kelly doesn't write down to me, but rather shares her tips for assembling the flowers.Get this book if you want some cool new patterns to try. If you're a beginner, get it after you've made a few flowers to get the basics down. Either way, it's excellent for diversifying your bouquets."},{"Title":"French-Beaded Flowers","review":"This is a &quot;must have&quot; for the bead artist interested in expanding their beading talents to the art of flower making.

Ms. Kelly's work is creative and pleasant to the eye and she does a very good job of representing real flowers with her patterns. This book is not an &quot;introduction to beaded flowers&quot; so it is not expected that she would detail some of the more rudimentary things ... nor is the intent of the book to be a &quot;guide to interior decorating&quot; (i.e. how to use the completed flowers/projects). As far as the extreme cost of glass beads ... &quot;ameemeemeemee&quot; again is obviously not an experienced or avid beader herself or she would be aware that quality beads are actually cheaper than they have been before and more widely available.

It does assume a certain knowledge of French beading, but I believe that the author intended to reach that market.

I fail to understand or sympathize with the previous reviewer's negative over-reaction. I have used Nathanson's books as well as Wasley's and several of the older authorities.

This book, in conjunction with the Bible (Reimann recommends one to read this with one hand and the Bible in the other) are guideposts for a meaningful life.Not a \\"God loves you and all is well\\" type of book, there are many passages of tough love, that keep one on the right track, and I often have the experience of it answering a question that is on my mind.

There are various editions to chose from, and mine is a small leather-bound volume using the NKJV for its Bible quotes, with a foreword by Charles Stanley, who as Reimann's pastor, was the one who recommended the original Chambers work to him.The back of the book has two useful sections, a Subject Index, and a Scripture Index.As the end of the year approaches, I'm looking forward to reading this on a daily basis for the second time, and every year thereafter; its teachings are invaluable, and I believe this is a truly inspired work, that will guide and nurture all who read its truth."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"You'll read \\"deeper\\" books, but few as consistently challenging. Chambers speaks, in one-a-day bites, about the devotion a Christian must have to be obedient to God. These aren't \\"sound bites,\\" but morsels of a very meaty meal. Catholics and Protestants both will find Chambers pointing the way to Heaven, and helping us know how to live out Christ's plan while still on Earth.A verse accompanies each day, and these ought be looked up to see the fully context. Have your Bible and a notepad next to you.Chambers is candid to say the Christian life is difficult, but encourages us that this difficulty should challenge us, not scare us away. Maybe Chambers might like the slogan \\"A few good men,\\" except this time referring to future converts?For people who like the \\"Daily Bread\\" booklets, check \\"My Utmost\\" out. Like the DB series, each entry will take you just a few minutes to read, but plenty of time to ponder.Use this together as a discussion step with another person, your spouse or small group. Figure out why Chambers places the standard so high -- does Scripture agree? And once you figure out the answer for a given day's passage, now what? What is your response?I read an entry and realize I've got a long way to go, but feel glad I'm on the road.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.com"},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present and in the month and a half that I've been reading it on a daily basis, it continues to speak to my spiritual condition in a way that's almost eerie. Not every day hits but those that do shock me back to my faith journey and remind me about where I should be focused. How could He/he (God and Oswald Chambers) know so accurately what I need to hear? As a committed Quaker (Religious Society of Friends), I have been surprised to find that &quot;My Utmost&quot; transcends the unfortunate Christian political divisions and meets us as followers of Christ. This book had become as central to my daily routine as brushing my teeth but far less rote!"},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"If it wasn't for Oswald Chamber's wife, MY UTMOST FOR HIS HIGHEST would never have been published. After Chamber's death, his wife collected some of his writings together into this devotional book. Praise God for such a woman of noble character.MY UTMOST FOR HIS HIGHEST is one of the best daily devotions around. Chambers doesn't mess around with wishy-washy, look-at-the-Jesus-in-my-pocket Christianity. Instead, he delves deep into the essence of what it means to be a Christian. Chambers knew the importance of a moment and this book is full of wisdom in living a life pressed out to the best, giving one's utmost for His highest. There isn't another daily devotion to compare."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I received this book as a gift for tutoring a student in mathematics. My daily actions have been guided by the words of Oswald Chambers in &quot;My Utmost&quot;. I find myself reading this book at the best of times and at the worst times of my life. It is truly an inspiration."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I have the hardcovered 1994 version. This is the second year I am reading it. Last year on the Sept.11 tradegy it spoke deeply to my soul as well as on the 12th. I guess that's why when I was in the book store 2yrs ago in the spiritual section and asked God to guide my hand to the book he wanted me to get he made this one of the two books. It has the date ex:( July 20) on top of each page with a quote from the bible. Then you have a couple of paragraphs that are deep and meaningful that teach you. Below that is 2 lines of a prayer request from the author. This book has been around since 1935. It's worth buying."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"As a Bible teacher, missionary and chaplain, Oswald Chambers' love for God is shared in this book in a way that is both inspirational and challenging. Avoiding &quot;formula&quot; Christianity of the &quot;pie-in-the-sky-by-and-by&quot; genre, Chambers calls his readers to a determined and purposeful abandonment of the things of this world, and to a habitual and concentrated identification with the suffering of Christ for the sake of the world, with a view toward the joy that is set before us.Having been originally written from about 1910 to 1917, the style of these short talks may necessitate more meditation on the part of the reader than more contemporary books would, but the gems of thought contained therein will more than reward those who will make the effort.If you want to be called to the next level of discipleship and commitment to the cause of Christ, this book of daily devotionals will certainly be a great source of motivation and encouragement."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"This volume offers daily scripture and meditations on our relationship with Jesus Christ. In a short devotional format, Chambers brings us face to face with the person and work of Christ and the claim He has on the lives of those who have trusted Him. An absolute for those who desire much more than an MTV style relationship with God. Areas for personal notes allow you to record your own thoughts on the same page."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I have never been a fan of \\"daily devotionals\\" but I needed a kick in the butt in my life. I have been slacking in my Mass attendance and had trouble finding 'Christ in me'. No matter how hard I tried and prayed, I found God to be someone up there, not someone in my life.I was the type to look up canon law when I had a question and obey the commandments because I am supposed to. I wanted to know God was in my life but could never grasp it. This book was able to do this for me.My life has changed in one week. I now enjoy attending daily Mass, looking forward to it, and receiving knowledge and guidance from it. I am learning to know God and actually mark my calendar to find time to quietly read and meditate on the daily reading in My Utmost for His Highest.I only wish I had known of this book earlier. I have never found a book that has changed my life as much as this one has."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"This is the best devotional book that I have ever read. I go back after a few years and use it again for another year. It has depth that makes you stop and read it again to gather more insight."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"An excellent daily devotional. Concise. Profound. Truly gives you commentary you can use every day on your spiritual journey. A great way to start every day!"},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"The copy I have, I received as a gift from my church, and actually I had been wanting one of my own. I used it religiously every day for a couple of years, day by day, along with my daily bible readings. This devotional certainly helps keep one focussed on things that really matter to God, things spiritual, eternal. The entry that really spoke to me the most was the one of March 31, a day significant to me in that it was the day my great grandmother Molly Hamilton Summers died. She was, to me, the epitome of true christian virtues. No one can even think of anything bad to say about her. She never cursed, never said bad things about anyone, never manipulated, never deceived. She is still a legend in our family which is a little strange because she didn't really do anything spectacular or significant in worldy terms. She died a decade and a half before I was born. I actually bought that copy from the christian bookstore that I was browsing in so moved by what I'd read.Funny how the Spirit works, I guess at the time I was feeling judged, incompetent in my prayer life, and in my day to day walk with Christ. That entry has the heading Heedfulness vs. Hypocrisy in Ourselves, the verse from the bible, I John 5:16. Oswald Chambers writes \\"If we are not heedful of the way the Spirit of God works in us, we will become spiritual hypocrites...He reveals things so that we may take the burden of these souls before Him and form the mind of Christ about them...It is...that we rouse ourselves until God is able to convey His mind to us about the one for whom we intercede.\\" Important stuff, because if we cannot do that we're not really reflecting the crucified Christ who died for all sin and for all time, and maybe one is not born of the Spirit of God if we cannot pray that way.Oswald Chambers died of appendicitis in 1917 in Egypt serving Australian and New Zealand troops during WWI. And as his widow notes in a short foreword in my copy, these entries were compiled from various lectures and talks he gave several years before he died."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I am an avid reader of devotional guides, and even something of a collector of them; I have works from the Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox traditions. All have something valuable to offer but none have offered so much to me as this one. Whenever your faith seems tepid and the church seems heavy on rules and devoid of zeal, let this book remind you to turn your face to God, trust in his Son, and receive his Spirit. If there could be no Bible, this book alone could teach the world faith.If anything seems to be absent from Chambers, it is what we might call \\"practical\\" or \\"concrete\\" guidance to life in the world. But that is because he expects God will reveal such things to you in His time, and for him to provide specific counsel, which may not be correct for you in your circumstances, would be rash.Please accept my recommendation that you avoid the so-called updated edition and get an edition of this book with Chambers' unaltered words. Chambers wrote with a clear, strong voice, filled with encouragement and benevolence. He was a man sure of the message he had to preach, and thus spoke free of artifice and affectation, yet with precision and warmth and eloquence. Struggle a little with his elegant diction and older turns of phrase rather than let his jewel be dimmed."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"My Utmost for His Highest was given to me over ten years ago as a gift. Since then, I have read it year after year, day after day, and it is brand new each time! God will speak to you in this amazing book.

After the Bible, this is the best gift you could give someone you love."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"i cant believe its 9.99! to buy it paperback is only five dollars, i have several copies. i will say that this book is 100% God inspired, he challenges you everyday, to serve the Lord with all of your heart. im just dissapointed that they would charge so much. dont think oswald would approve either."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"This book is a traditional religious Christian book. It has daily devotionals that are based on scripture. It is applicable to many situations and many people would find it inspirational.
