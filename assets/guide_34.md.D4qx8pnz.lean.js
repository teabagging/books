I keep it at my desk at work and have been reading it during short breaks and laid back moments. Because the daily entries are short, this devotional is accessible to even the busiest schedule.Moreover, Chamber's insights and his ability to encourage are unsurpassed. An invaluable read."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"Richard Halverson, former chaplain of the United States Senate, said of My Utmost for His Highest, \\"No book except the Bible has influenced my walk with Christ at such deep and maturing levels,\\" and I must agree with him.Like Halverson, I have tried several other daily devotionals, but none have come close to being as insightful and challenging as this. This is a devotional for those who want to stretch and grow spiritually, who would rather go through the pain of a 'spiritual workout' than stay spiritually soft. Be prepared to roll up your sleeves.Each day begins with a passage from scripture, then leaps into a lesson that I find to be just the right size - a very compact punch of wisdom that takes very little time to read, yet resonates for the full day and beyond.Wherever you are in your spiritual journey, this will provoke and equip you to take the next step forward.Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I've never found a book so thrilling by the depth of a single pages' topic each day as it relates to the bible.

Part of the power of this devotional classic derives from the wonerful way Chambers says things. This version is stale and flat compared to the original.

Honestly, I just think that this book is an extremely difficult read for a 21st century American, wonderful spiritual depth notwithstanding.To further explain the situation, I have been trying to read the classic edition in the original text. Though Oswald Chambers has some intriguing things to say, I felt myself struggling many nights to decipher his points or intentions.Ultimately, I would suggest that the average reader would probably benefit from an updated version of this classic devotional. With two false starts, though, I'm not sure if I'll ever get myself to give this another try.My critical sentiments are obviously in contrast to the vast majority of the previous reviews, and I admit that my inability to understand this book is probably as much a product of certain spiritual shortcomings as anything. In any case, I'll stick with C.S. Lewis as my preferred dead British author, who makes his ideas jump off the page."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"There are many people who are fans of this devotional. I am not one of them. The main (and, perhaps, the only) theme to this book is to put aside every other consideration but the service of God. Superficially, this sounds good, but the author (like many extremists) forgets that we serve God in our daily life in mostly indirect ways-simply by the performance of our duties as workers, spouses, parents, children, and by being friends to each other. &quot;Pushing aside every other consideration&quot; seems to be a good formula for fanaticism and for losing our well rounded and fully developed humanity. I once heard a saying that, in effect, stated that &quot;Mr. so-and- so was so holy he was useless&quot;. And, most probably, unbearable to all those around him, also. I think poorly of devotional books that urge me to push aside the world and the people in it to make room for God and His service. I figure I am put here for a reason and that reason can't possibly be to choose God as opposed to the people He created and put me in the midst of (as if one had to choose one or the other!). That suggests that all of these people are mistakes and distractions, an appalling suggestion. Thanks, Oswald, but I prefer meditation books that give me the inspiration and strength to carry on in the world with the notion that God cares a great deal about what He created-and wants me to care also."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I have the daily devotional book, and I decided to get the calendar version for my mom.

It is amazingly just as alive today as when it was written a hundred years ago. I was unable to get enough of it, and I went through the book twice.

I hope you will be blessed too!"},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"This is simply the greatest Devotional ever written; this update makes it even more readable than ever. I carry mine with me everywhere I go and have been reading it for years. I bought this little vest pocket edition as a gift for someone else in the hopes that it would help them on their daily journey with God as it has helped me. It is amazing that Oswald Chambers writings are so timelessly strong and clear; now nearly 100 years since they were first placed in a book form by his wife nearly a century ago. It is no wonder this is the best selling Devotional in history.Two other wonderful Devotionals you should consider are \\"Streams in the Desert\\" by L.B. Cowman (edited by Jim Reimann), Zondervan. Interestingly, this Devotional is almost exactly as old at Chambers book. It is also very strong and meaningful, being a collection of great messages by a number of pastors and writers, and then edited together (along with some poetry) by Cowman. This, incidentally, it the second best seller in Devotionals (for good reason).A third recommendation is the new \\"The Message: Solo New Testament\\" by Eugene H. Peterson. I believe this devotional will become another great classic. It is wonderfully easy to read with powerful, thought-provoking ideas and suggestions following each day' short passage from the Bible (taken from the \\"The Message\\" Bible)."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"There have been many \\"ah ha!\\" moments while reading through this devotional. It does not supersede my Bible reading, but I have grown immensely from this devotional. I am a Youth Pastor and have purchased many of these books for my youth group kids and they are in love.

This is astonishing, considering the author sat under the preaching of the great C H Spurgeon, heir to the Reformed Puritan tradition. It is mystical, even gnostic or pelagian in many places. There is no mention of a church, of the sacraments. Instead, the Christian &quot;worker&quot; is portrayed as an isolated self-made spiritual giant. The influences are clearly Wesleyan with references to entire sanctification and the second blessing. Spurgeon's meticulous teaching is rejected through Chambers' confusion of the classic Protestant doctrine of justification with sanctification. The substitutionary atonement of Christ on the cross for the sins of God's people is strangely bypassed - instead the crucifixion is depicted as a mystical &quot;higher life&quot; example of how individual Christians are to live. There is much practical wisdom, but READ WITH DISCERNMENT!"},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"This wonderful book is an excellent devotional and inspirational masterpiece, but I don't quite understand why it isn't offered in the original language at a much lower price, such as $0.95."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"If you truly understand Oswald Chambers you will understand my one star rating. I love this book. But his goal was never intended to be an author but to assist Christians with building their relationship with God.If his words lead you back to your Bible he (and his wife) has accomplished his goal. If not, then his life was a waste.I used to think that everyone should read his works. In fact, I wanted to buy several copies to give away. But I am finding his writings are not for everyone. I think a lot of it has to do with where you are in your relationship with God - it is a life long process.Personally, I will read this little book everyday till I die. Every year brings greater understanding. If this book finds its way to your hands then thank God for it. But more important is for Christians to read their Bible!"},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I was disappointed that the book cover was well worn and not Used - Like New.

If and when I ever do, I'll be sure to get back to you!"},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"Because I had a hard time keeping up my devotional every day. As an atheist humanist, I opened up to this book when I heard that George Bush read it every morning. One of my Christian friends also urged me to read it.But I had a hard time accepting what I read. I felt that despite my views on God, which are pretty open minded, you really need to have a desire to improve your faith in God in order to get into this book. That was not my goal. Rather, I was hoping to learn how to better myself, get in touch with Jesus, and improve my character and discipline. Perhaps this book is for some but not others."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"Anyone wanting or needing a daily devotional to learn about he workd of God should have this book.

Happy reading."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"This devotional book inspires people to want to be better people for Jesus Christ. Jesus is magnified through the pages of this book thus one is convicted of sin in their life. The book leads one to desire to read the Bible to learn more about the scripture being discussed. I recommend this book!"},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"At first the day by day 'lessons' or sermons may be nice but as the years go by and you grow in knowledge and closeness to GOD, you will cherish the wisdom and the TRUTH in this book. While varying religions may have theirsprinkle or emerge differences, (dance or don't dance), The truth of God's word is Universal. This book will beyour daily companion. It doesn't preach AT you. It speaks to your heart. Since 1994 I've read the page per day, it has become my family calendar (son did x on this day, year, daughter did y, someone's birthday etc) I write in margins and don't mark this one in the content as some years one thing is VIP and the next another one will be. There is not one wasted word in this entire book. 365 days a year you will be grateful that you have MY UTMOST FOR HIS HIGHEST.

Oswald Chambers pulls no punches as he leads you day-by-day through an entire year of Bible-based teaching (with even an extra day thrown in for a leap year), mostly excerpted from his lectures given at the Bible Training College from 1911-1917.I've never been so blasted with good, solid, Christ-centered teaching in my entire life. Chambers's point throughout is simple: it's Jesus or bust, folks. Get with the program or not only will you miss out big time in this life, but also in the life to come.His style is direct, his words laced with power. Why? Because he's preaching the Word, solid and true. Not ever have I been so challenged by a daily devotional as by this one. Most out there are just fluffy thoughts for the day. Sure, some are Christian in nature or even Bible-based, but most just don't get to the meat of it. My Utmost for His Highest does. This is one of those books that are meant for those who want more, for those who take, or want to take, their Christian walk seriously.This book amplifies what it means to be a Christian. A real Christian, first century-style. The kind of Christian God wants.If you're looking for a book to change your life, one that will amplify what the Bible says, then grab a copy of this ASAP. If you're looking to just sit in the drudgery of the same old, same old, then don't bother.But then you'll be missing out. Big time.Highly recommended reading.A.P.

I am buying another. It accompanies my bible. Any Christian who is serious about their walk with the Lord would be wise to consider the words in this timeless book. I prefer the old edition, with the original words and the author's prayers, as it is how he wrote from his heart and I like that better. It is difficult to understand, only because he speaks on a level that is so deep spiritually that you have to really think about every sentence you read, and feel the pangs of having the truth lovingly drove home to your heart. A must have for any true believer. It's self-discipline incarnate, he doesn't let you get by with anything.I'm not sure this book should be read by a non-believer who wishes to remain a non-believer. It may shaken the view, as it is an exquisite challenge. That's why it is almost 100 years old and people still buy it today."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I like the devotional myself. I, however, ordered it for my eight year old son. The specifications of the book say it is for ages 4 to 8. As he is a very good reader, I thought this would be appropriate. I was worried it might be a bit below him. I also ordered what I thought was a version for adult readers, so that we could talk about what we learned while we had breakfast. Unfortunately, the editions are the same. Given the description, I thought the version I ordered for my son would be written at the appropriate level. The type is a little larger in this edition and some of the Bible translations are a bit different here and there. Otherwise, they are identical. In other words, it is written at a level well above an eight year old's ability.I got him Gotta Have God for 10 to 12 year olds. He loves it. He can't wait to read it each day."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"Each day you read a page and get closer in your walk with the Lord.

Beacuse of this, this book can be used year after year, as one revisits each daily topic to gain a new perspective on it.

Buy it...what'd'ya got to lose?Note: I believe this is an updated version where the language is revised for the modern reader.

Or do you say, \\"I am not willing to be poured out right now, and I don't want God to tell me how to serve Him. I want to choose the place of my own sacrifice. And I want to have certain people watching me and saying, \`Well done.'\\" It is one thing to follow God's way of service if you are regarded as a hero, but quite another thing if the road marked out for you by God requires becoming a \\"doormat\\" under other people's feet. God's purpose may be to teach you to say, \\"I know how to be abased...\\" (Philippians 4:12). Are you ready to be sacrificed like that? Are you ready to be less than mere drop in the bucket-to be so totally insignificant that no one remembers you even if they think of those you served? Are you willing to give and be poured out until you are used up and exhausted-not seeking to be ministered but to minister? Some saints cannot do menial work while maintaining a saintly attitude, because they feel such service is beneath their dignityI hope this excerpt have blessed you as it blessed me and if you don't understand it feel free to email me so the enemy won't snatch it away from you.

This revised version is more comfortable to work with and, as a result, I read it every day.Through this work, Oswald Chambers challenges me as a Christian to abandon myself to Jesus Christ and follow wherever He chooses to lead me. It reminds me that, rather than following the call of the world, I must surrender to a Higher calling. In the daily readings, I am both encouraged and challenged to the reality that the Christian life is not meant to be easy, but the rewards, both here on earth and in the hereafter, are wonderful beyond my comprehension. Following the path chosen for me as a modern-day disciple, I need Chamber's reminders of Jesus's teaching as well as the Bible's instuction. I believe there is no better source as a companion to the Bible than this daily devotional.I encourage anyone interested in being a practicing Christian to try a group like the one I belong to. The guidance received is truly remarkable and a confirmation that God wants to be an intimate part of our daily lives. All we need to do is let Him.

I remember seeing a copy of Oswald Chambers' book on my dad's bookshelf, and I was given a copy of book in 1979 by my Sunday school teacher and Bible study group leader when I was a senior in high school attending a Bible church. It would make a great gift for any Christian you know who is looking to spend more time with God in His Word every day.It is still a perennial favorite among Christian devotional books, and I think there are a number of reasons for this. First, Chambers wrote in a simple format: one verse from the Bible, followed by one page of devotional writing. This simple format makes My Utmost for His Highest very easy to use and to keep up with. The second reason this book continues to be a favorite is that Chambers writes simply, forcefully, and practically. There is also a directness and power in Chambers' words that touches his readers.For these reasons, My Utmost for His Highest has become a classic. Anything that encourages people to read their Bibles, reflect on God's Word, and attempt to live by it is a very good thing. However, such devotional books are, ultimately, very limited. Scripture is meant to be read in its entire context, and not chopped up into single verses. Reading My Utmost for His Highest has benefited me, but as I've gotten older it always leaves me wanting something that goes more deeply and broadly into Scripture.Having said all this, I'm truly thankful that Chambers doesn't sugarcoat the Christian life but clearly communicates that it is a difficult one.

This classic edition is my favorite edition and it captures Oswald Chambers at his very best. Though it uses some King James English it embodies everything that Chambers believed. I once tried the \\"Updated\\" modern edition and I was disappointed that the messages was watered down and quite dull.

I was ecstatic to receive this beautiful leather bound copy. I love everything about this particular edition EXCEPT the updated text.In the Introduction, the book's \\"re-writer\\" James Reimann states: \\"What you hold in your hand is the culmination of approximately 1800 hours of research and editing. It is not a paraphrase of the original work, BUT COULD BE CONSIDERED A TRANSLATION OF IT\\" (emphasis mine). A translation? Huh? Why? This is utter nonsense. Oswald Chambers was a poet. He was a lover of poetry. He was an artist with words. I find myself actually being angry at this guy James Reimann. Who does he think he is? How presumptuous can a person get, to think he can improve on the language of a man like Chambers?I understand the need of newer translations of the Bible, but that is entirely different. This is a so-called translation of English into English. \\"My Utmost for His Highest\\" was FIRST published less than 100 years ago! (In America, 1935) The language used in the original DOES NOT need to be updated. Quoting from \\"Abandoned to God\\", an excellent biography of Oswald Chambers:Chambers was \\"KNOWN IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA FOR HIS UNIQUE VOCABULARY AND POWERFULL CLARITY OF EXPRESSION.\\" !!!I find it grossly presumptuous for James Reimann to think he could improve it.1800 hours of editing? What a colossal waste of time!Otherwise, the rest of the book is perfect. The smallish size (4-3/4\\" x 7-1/4\\" x 3/4\\"), the very readable typeface and font size, the beautiful leather cover, everything. I would pay twice the price for the same thing in the original language.Update: It seems we are going to be forever cursed by the updated edition philosophy. This morning I was reading a new collection of several of R.A.Torrey's booksPower Filled Living. As I read, I thought the language seemed a little \\"off\\". As I checked the fine print in the front of the book, I found:\\"This new edition from Whitaker House has been updated for the modern reader. Words, expressions, and sentence structure have been revised for clarity and readability. Although the more modern Bible translations quoted in this edition were not available to the author, the Bible versions used were carefully selected in order to make the language of the entire text readily understandable while maintaining the author's original premises and message.\\"And here,Complete Works of E. M. Bounds on Prayer, The: Experience the Wonders of God through Prayer, it says: Eight classic explorations cover every aspect of prayer in a readable way.\\"In a READABLE WAY??? I have the books in Bounds' original language. There is NOTHING unreadable about Bonds, or Torrey, or Chambers, or any of the great men of God of the past.If any publishers are reading this, PLEASE STOP RUINING THESE GREAT WORKS OF THE PAST!!! What's going to happen a few years form now? Are these books going to need revising again? So you're going to have a revision of a revision? Does that make sense to you? Somewhere along the line, subtle meanings are going to be lost, and all we are going to have left are the mediocre thoughts of these modern \\"translators\\" who totally lack the gifting of the great authors of the past.Note to publishers: STOP SCREWING AROUND WITH OUR LITERATURE!!! What you are doing is TOTALLY unnecessary. The astounding thing is that these works are just not that old. But really, even works that actually ARE old do not need any revising. On my desk as I write this is a book first published in 1692, \\"The Gospel Mystery of Sanctification,\\" by Walter Marshall (1954 edition). I won't say it's not harder to read than many modern works by modern authors, but so what? It makes you think. It forces you to put effort into understanding. Once you put forth the effort, you're not as likely to forget what you've read.Thankfully, Amazon's used book finder allows us to much more easily find older editions printed during a more sensible time."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"'My Utmost For His Highest' begins every calendar day with a short biblical quotation and then follows with inspirational, yet very practical descriptions of what it truly means to live one's life as a Christian. Oswald Chambers is a master of clarifying what it means to do the Lord's will as opposed to what many Christians or self-described religious persons believe the Lord's will to be. It takes effort to discern the difference between, &quot;Thy will be done&quot; versus &quot;My will be done&quot; when we deceive ourselves into believing we are doing the Higher will when in reality we are only serving our own little egos. &quot;My Utmost For His Highest&quot; is truly a beacon of inspiration for Chrisitians navigating their way into a truly honest relationship with themselves and with the Lord."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"5 stars for content of this timeless classic. 0 stars for no formatting, which, in a 365 entry daily devotional, is ESSENTIAL !!! What were they thinking of to miss that, and at $9.99 a pop? How come I'm the only reviewer to mention this?"},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I am so glad this has finally made it onto the Kindle. However I am sad it is the updated version. Even though the original version is out of copyright, couldn't someone upload it? I would pay for it. I just love the original language so much."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"\\"My Utmost for His Highest\\", a book of devotional readings for each day of the year, is a perennial Christian classic with three recurring themes encompassing a triune God: Abandoning all to God, our Father and Creator; looking always to Jesus, our Saviour and brother, and becoming broken bread and poured out wine to nourish others through the work of the Holy Spirit.Although accessible to all readers and not overly academic, the daily scripture verses are cross-referenced with other embedded verses and important Christian concepts, revealing the comprehensive depth of Chambers' biblical knowledge.Throughout this collection, Chambers addresses one of the most challenging perplexities of a Christian journey: What will be God's part, given as grace, and what will be our part, as earnest striving, in living out our faith. The July 7th entry in particular addresses this balance.There is material for fruitful meditation and discursive prayer on each page; one of my favorite pages is the entry for May 19th, \\"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\\"A favorite quote from the book for me would be the conclusion of March 18th:\\"Be serious with God and leave the rest gaily alone. Put God first literally.\\" In my life as a Lay Carmelite I have found that advice works well: There is freedom and joy in taking all of life lightly, except for the one thing necessary-- an ever increasing love for God that fuels a deep desire to be constantly in His presence."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"&quot;My Utmost for His Highest&quot; is daily bread, hot and fresh from heavenly ovens!This was the first devotional I read after I was saved and have rediscovered its relevance, convicting power, and probing insights.I gave a copy to my best friend in June. He told me that he started reading it from January 1st, 5 days at a time, because he didn't want to miss anything God had for him in the previous months!That's the it is with Utmost - every day brings the Word of God in an interesting, very personal and amazingly relevant way to the reader. This is a precious gem for the believer."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"This book was first placed in my hands in 1973, and I have worn out that copy, rebound it, and worn it out again. I have read it almost daily since my friend gifted me with her copy, when a new one could not be found. I am continually blessed by Mr. Chambers' sensitivity to the Holy Spirit's teachings. I know Jesus loves this book also!"},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"Each morning I read this book, I find myself drawn to a place of accountability and yet filled with a desire to worship and commune with my Lord. Oswald Chambers has a way of opening the reader's eyes to the plan that God has for each one of us individually. Combining this book with reading the scriptures included for each day has expanded my morning devotional time to a depth and breadth I could not have imagined before."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"This is a classic. Not only is it more portable than the other editions, but it uses the original text that Chambers intended and therefore retains its full meaning. In my opinion, it's the best \\"Utmost\\" edition out there."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"One of my favorite books, this is second on my nightstand next to the Bible. A daily devotional, &quot;My Utmost for His Highest&quot; is broken down into daily one-page lessons mostly drawn from lectures given by Oswald Chambers at the Bible Training College, Clapham, during the years 1911-1915. Reading each page is like sitting in on a short philosophy lecture, very spiritually and intellectually engaging... Give it a try and see for yourself.Britt GilletteAuthor of &quot;Conquest of Paradise&quot;"},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I picked this edition to review because at under $4.00 it is the most sensible resource a Christian can own beyond the scriptures. No other author knows how to help you \\"fix your eyes upon Jesus\\" better then Oswald Chambers. Utmost for His Highest is the timeless benchmark for daily devotionals. Follow my advice and get this little book...you can thank me when we meet in heaven!"},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"Probably the best daily devotional out there next to the Bible itself. Great for those beginning to have quiet time with Christ once a day. Allows one to read and ponder a significant truth, within about 10-15 minutes. This serves as a good launch point for those just beginning to make a commitment to spend time with the Lord everymorning."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"This guy is awesome - what a great man of the Lord. He's a great writer and inspiriational is too little a word for his work."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"This is the devotional to have. It is accessible and understandable (especially in the contemporary update). I've read it each year for the last 3 and learn something new each day. Since there are versions for just about every taste, why not get a few to give as gifts. The teachings in this book are as relevant for today's Christian as they were in Chamber's time."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I had heard of this book so many times that I felt the Lord leading me to get a copy. Oh how He has blessed me through the daily readings. The somewhat archaic language and deep concepts forced me to truly meditate on the truths and dig deeper into the Bible to begin to comprehend. I am reading it for the third time and seeing things that I missed in the first two readings. God really uses the book in my daily quiet time to reach into my heart."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I'm embarrassed to say I didn't know anything about Oswald Chambers until I came across this book at a reduced price and bought two copies, one for a sick friend and one for myself. What a blessing it turned out to be for both of us!The one-page essays, one for each day of the year (even February 29!), are deeply thought provoking and can be the basis for a daily meditation session. Be warned that the essays can be challenging. For example, Chambers pressures readers to consider whether we are trying to \\"perfect\\" ourselves as some kind of model Christian that God can display on a trophy shelf we imagine He has, rather than truly trying to perceive and submit to His will? Or are we interfering with God's will by trying to be an \\"amateur providence\\" who helps people through their difficulties by telling them what we think they should do rather than leading them toward Christ so He can tell them what they should to do?For those who don't want to follow the day-by-day format there are two indexes referring to the relevant essays: one by subject or key word and the other by Scripture verse. The Scripture verses are from the New King James Version translation.I HIGHLY recommend My Utmost for His Highest to Christians of all persuasions as an aid for contemplation, encouragement and spiritual growth. This is a rare devotional book that you'll want to keep and refer to or reread frequently."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"In my humble opinion, Chambers' gem is the best devotion ever published! This is my 15th straight year with this title and every year I learn something new. Chambers' insights are as relevant now as they were when originally written in the early 1900s.Admittingly, the updated version makes the devotion easier to digest as opposed to the original language. The format is excellent and has a good flow: brief heading at the top, a Bible verse, a one page summary for each day, and a date. The daily devotional will pierce your soul and make you really think about your walk with Jesus.I've tried other summaries and they pale in comparison to My Utmost for His Highest! Highly recommended - be ready to highlight and make notes. The devotion is an excellent supplement to the Bible."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"This book speaks to the depths of your soul. Everyday I feel its profound effect on me. I'm gratefull for this book."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"This little book has impacted my personal Christian walk more than any other book besides the Bible.Mr Chambers has managed so well to sublimate his life to the control of the Almighty that I continuously sense God's Holy Spirit speaking through the pages Mr Chambers wrote.It's as if God reaches through the mere two paragraphs per day and grabs me by the lapels saying &quot;I want YOU! I want ALL of you! Just trust ME to take care of your every need...&quot;I deeply appreciate this call to a whole hearted Christianity in today's pluralistic society. Oswald Chambers is an author whose work I will read and re-read into the foreseable future."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"It's great to have this book available for the Kindle, but it's a bad port. Daily readings run together (not separated by pages like the 'real' book), hyphens are all over the place inappropriately, and the text looks like a bad photocopy.

But I bought it anyway because I found some really great quotes in it. And I found it to be immensely helpful. Living the Christian life isn't necessarily easy, and Oswald Chambers makes it painfully obvious and says we have to rely on God. My friend Ree said \\"Let the beatings begin\\" when I bought it... but it was encouraging. And a bucket of cold water in the face when I've needed it. It's been really good and really helpful, because though God loves us unconditionally, it's easy to forget that and think that we have to do Christianity all by ourselves. Oswald Chambers knows that's not true, and he reminds me of it every time I crack his book.It's actually a devotional written by his wife, who wrote down all of his sermons in shorthand while he was preaching them and then put sections of those sermons into devotionals. And he's one of my favorite kinds of preacher. When he writes something, I can either confirm it in scripture or in my own experience. And that's awesome.Like this quote from yesterday's devotional: \\"We are not taken up into conscious agreement with God's purpos, we are taken up into God's purpose without any consciousness at all. We have no conception of what God is aiming at, and as we go on it gets more and more vague.\\" When I read it I laughed because even though it disagreed with what had made sense to me, I knew it in my heart to be true. And that's typical Chambers. He says stuff that sounds wrong, but you know it in your heart to be right. Well, most of the time. But that's anything. As Rob Bell says inVelvet Elvis: Repainting the Christian Faith, \\"God has spoken, and the rest is just commentary.\\""},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"Each lesson is an eye opener for me.

Some of these devotionals felt like a daily chore, but I look forward to my time reading &quot;My Utmost for His Highest.&quot; Oswald's straightforward devotion to the word shines through in the pages of this devotional. I am looking forward to reading this book year after year as I grow in my faith, and in my understanding of the Bible. It is comforting knowing this book will help in my daily walk."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"Other than the Bible, MY UTMOST has had far greater impact in my life than any other book. From his simple presentation to his understanding of deep truth, Chambers presents the living faith in Jesus as impossible without the lifelines of intimacy with and absolute surrender to Him."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"First, I must admit that I am not a big fan of devotionals. The few I have used before picking up &quot;My Utmost for His Highest&quot; have been rather shallow, and almost had a hallmark quality to them (easy verse, followed by flowery discussion, ending with God loves you). So, I was hesitant to spend a year going through Oswald Chambers book when it was recommended to me by a friend.I am certainly glad that I did because it far exceeeded my expectations. Over the last year, Oswald Chambers has challenged me to pick up my cross daily, and follow Christ with reckless abandon. Chambers does not pull any punches, and he speaks plainly about the sacrifice that is required when we make the daily decision to follow Christ, no matter what the consequences.At times you may question the intensity of the faith Chambers is describing - does God really expect &quot;My utmost for His highest&quot; on a daily basis? But, in the end I think you will become convinced God is always looking for our obedience, and willingness to fight the good fight for His kingdom.If you spend a year going through this book, I think that you will be blessed, and more importantly, challenged to take your faith to a higher level. Therefore, I recommend this devotional for any Christian looking for a resource which can make a daily impact on your Christian perspective, and outlook on life. I now understand why this book is consider a classic devotional by many in the Christian community."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"Of course, there's no substitute for having a devotion with the Word of God itself. But, right after this, one of the best things to help jumpstart your devotional is a good devotion book. My Utmost for His Highest is an obvious classic that you ought to consider. I personally have gone through it in three different years (the last time, 2 years ago), and I am considering it for the year 2001. Chambers has some keen insight that needs to be considered. If you struggle with mere reading through the Bible as your devotion, then perhaps this might be the ticket to beginning a daily commune with the God of all creation."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I am not a fan of devotional books, since I believe that we shouldn't drink below the horses. I am smart enough to read and understand the Bible on my own, and I don't want to get caught in any intellectual ruts. Moreover, most devotional books seem like mere mush or breadcrumbs when compared to the Bread of Life.However, this little devotional book by Oswald Chambers absolutely blew me out of the water! He has a piercing intellect and power of expression that man, indeed, most preacher lack. So much of the pap, tripe, and mushy \\"Godtalk\\" that makes up the spiritual feasts chokes and gags me. This book, on the other hand, gets to the heart and core of serious discipleship. Discipline is the essence of discipleship.Although this isn't a quote book per se, but it has great thought gems:\\"You could read volumes on the work of the Holy Spirit, when five minutes of total, uncompromising obedience would make things as clear as sunlight.\\" (10 October)\\"If we do only what we feel inclined to do, some of us would never do anything.\\" (25 April)I think one of the deepest quotes is:\\"If we obey God, it is going to cost other people more than it costs us, and that is where the pain begins. . . If we obey God, it will mean that other people's plans are upset\\" (11 January)Admittedly, Chambers is British, so the wording can seem more like a contraption than clear conviction, but I think all good things are worth working for. By the way, the Briticisms are great in understanding Shakespeare. The British have better diction, pronunciation, and far more wit than we Americans.This book is also commendable for having a leap-day entry. Most devotionals skip the skipping day. I think this one detail illustrates the care that the editors have given this book."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"This devotional is heavily based in scripture and an absolute must read for any christian seeking a closer walk with Christ. a bit wordy, but well worth it."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I have read Oswald Chamber's \\"My Utmost For His Highest\\" for many years now. In my humble opinion this is the finest devotional one can purchase today. Chambers is amazing in his insights into Scripture and the Christian life. I am ever amazed how I will open to today's date, read the devotion and find that it was something that I really needed to hear (and something that spoke to my situation). I'm also impressed with how 'time-less' this devotional is. I've read it for years now, and yet it is ever fresh and new. Chambers is not a light-weight. His devotions are not cotton-candy (all fluff and no substance). Chambers always challenges us to truly give 'our utmost for His Highest.' Thus, Chambers daily dares us to truly examine ourselves, assess where we are in our devotion to and walk with the Lord. That's what I really like about this devotional--Chambers challenges us to 'grow-up' in Christ and live our lives' each day in a way that truly glorifies God.As far as product quality? The leather bound edition is really nice. It has proven to be sturdy and has held together well for 13 years (my hard-back edition did not fare as well. It was coming apart by year 2). The paper is thick and allows for marking or underlining using colored markers.I have also found that this makes a great gift for friends. Buy one and get a spare for a friend.

It'll last you for years and years and years and years..."},{"Title":"My Utmost for His Highest: Selections for the Year- The Golden Book of Oswald Chambers","review":"I use this book every day to help keep my mind focused on God.

What a blessing it turned out to be for both of us!The one-page essays, one for each day of the year (even February 29!), are deeply thought provoking and can be the basis for a daily meditation session. Be warned that the essays can be challenging. For example, Chambers pressures readers to consider whether we are trying to ?perfect? ourselves as some kind of model Christian that God can display on a trophy shelf we imagine He has, rather than truly trying to perceive and submit to His will? Or are we interfering with God?s will by trying to be an ?amateur providence? who helps people through their difficulties by telling them what we think they should do rather than leading them toward Christ so He can tell them what they should to do?The Scripture verses are from the New King James Version translation.I HIGHLY recommend My Utmost for His Highest to Christians of all persuasions as an aid for contemplation, encouragement and spiritual growth.

Having heard of this book and Oswald Chambers for some years, I finally picked it up and used it as a daily devotinal read.I was often \\"lost\\" the first time through. Though it says \\"Updated Edition in Today's Language\\" it is still a hard read at times. Frankly, more often than not, it \\"seemed like Greek to me...\\" Yet, on occasion, some rare truth, a ray of light, broke through, and I kept on reading.Now, after reading it every day for several years, I have to say that no single book other than the Bible has influenced my faith more than \\"My Utmost for His Highest.\\"It is a good and rare work, not always easy to read, but, like a great pearl, alway worth the price.I am a better person for having read and studied this book.

I came to this site hoping to find someone who was also challenged by the extreme views that I perceive Oswald to have on a few topics. I'm not experienced or life-qualified enough to state if he's right or wrong...only that I found him to be overly ascetic sometimes. And context is such an important issue -- for example, when Jesus was speaking of his coming to 'set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother' -- I think this was hyperbole -- why would he design human beings to live and love inside of a family setting only to ask them to rebuke that family?

I have had no luck with devotionals. They all sound nice, and encourage you to delve into the Word, but they have never helped me really grow. There's no challenge. My Utmost for His Highest genuinely challenged me. It's not sugar-coated. He's very direct, and clear, and doesn't allow you to settle. Most devotionals give you a sense of \\"I'm not where I want to be, but hey, God loves me!\\" I know that's a little extreme, but that's the idea I usually get. The joy and encouragement from this book lies in the idea that, while most of us probably don't have an incredibly strong relationship with God, there is hope, because He seeks us.

In this book he traces the ideological development of nationalism from Kant, Herder and Fichte, claiming that nationalism was invented when Fichte gave his Addresses to the German Nation in the early nineteenth century. Kedourie unfortunately places far too much emphasis on Kant - who was much more concerned with the individual than the community - and not enough on Hegel. Kedourie also neglects such important writers as Rousseau and Mill and does not attempt to trace just how Fichte et al. influenced specific nationalists. Nevertheless this is a well-written polemic against nationalism from someone who dealt with it first hand."},{"Title":"How to Run Your First Marathon","review":"I bought this book in 1982, a time before liquid carbohydrates, heart rate monitors, and tempo runs.

I bought this book in 1985, when I was training for my first marathon, Los Angeles 1986. It promised a bunch of things, namely \\"don't worry too much about distance, run for time\\". That is perfect barney-bait.By the time I was at 20 miles, I'd begun to hate the day I'd imagined that the author knew what he was talking about. OK, I finished--walked the last 2-1/2 miles to a 3:55. After I was able to think about marathons again, I found Joe Henderson's \\"Run Long\\" book. It had everything this breezy pamphlet did not. I trained out of Henderson's until 1992, then ran with Jim O'Brien's track club at Cal Tech.Subsequently I went on to finish over 25 marathons, before getting into ultras [50k on up to 100-miles].

Of course, the Outer Banks are hardly deserted--the locals have printed up Wege's infamous photograph of a packed stretch of Coney Island with the caption &quot;Nags Head, circa 2000 A.D.&quot;--but there we are on an island for seven days, my husband experiencing near death in the waves while I read. Sometimes we stop these pursuits and prowl the beach. Mostly we live as if we're the last two people on earth (which is easier in the off-peak season).I've learned that not every book is right for this way of life. The perfect desert island book has to celebrate the place you are in, not transport you. It should offer a tinge of society, because, after all, a human is a social animal, but it should not make you yearn achingly for what has been left behind nor should you be so repelled by it that you will never fit in again when you leave the island (you always leave the island). It should have some narrative sweep to withstand the competition of the seascape. It should make you think, at least a little: you want the stress to wash out to sea, not the little grey cells.Cape Cod by Henry David Thoreau is the benchmark by which I've chosen beach material for several years. it is the quintessential celebration of littoral life. If you are on the beach, you appreciate it all the more; if you are not, well, at least you know vividly what you are missing. There is drama, as in the specter of villagers racing to the shore at the news of a shipwreck. There is information, as in what part of the clam not to eat, how the Indians trapped gulls for food, how a lighthouse really works. There is Thoreau's contagious respect for solitude, his occasional crankiness, and that magic trick of his that can suck in high school sophomores and get them through his books without so much as a whimper.There is one flaw to Cape Cod: brevity. It lasts about a day and a half on the Robinson Crusoe plan. This is not to say that it does not withstand re-reading, it does, but at some point after you have committed it to memory, you may wish for the collected works of Shakespeare and move onto the Bard's beach play, The Tempest."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"This hardcover edition from Peninsula Press is unquestionably the best available edition of Thoreau's Cape Cod, for these reasons:1) While all other editions are based on Thoreau's journal entries from only his first three visits to the Cape, this edition includes an epilogue compiling Thoreau's notes from his fourth and final visit, in which he traveled south to Chatham and Monomoy.2) This is the only edition to translate the many, many Greek and Latin phrases Thoreau includes throughout the work, and it is also the only edition to provide illustrations, maps, and sidenotes in-text.3) This is the only indexed edition ever created.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for fans of both Cape literature and Thoreau in general."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"You will forget about the outside world when you read this; nothing but sand, wind, and water. Plus some natural history, local folklore, a few shipwreck tales. Typical Thoreau; he finds beauty, interest, detail in the wilderness. The desolate landscape will help to clear your mind. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"Thoreau visited Cape Cod in 1849, 1850, and 1853. These trips formed the basis for a series of essays, several of which Thoreau published in magazines. After Thoreau's death, the essays were gathered together and published as \\"Cape Cod\\" in 1865.Thoreau's \\"Cape Cod\\" is different in tone in theme from his earlier books. The tone is leisurely and light. Instead of solitude or the wild woods, the picture that remains with me from this book is that of a long walk, or, as Thoreau puts it, a \\"ramble\\" through the sand and dunes of Cape Cod. The book is picturesque, full of humor and wry observation. Thoreau unforgettably describes the ocean, in its storms, vicissitudes, and moments of peace, the fish and the fishermen, the sands, birds, plants and lighthouses of Cape Cod, and the people. I have visited portions of the Masachusetts coast, but I have never been to Cape Cod. Thoreau took me there in his book.The book is arranged into ten chapters. It opens with a description of the shipwreck of the St John on a rock off the Cape. Thoreau then describes a ride by coach across the Cape. But the heart of the book lies in the following chapters in which Thoreau with a companion walks the 30 mile beach from Nauset Harbor to Provincetown with many stops and diversions along the way. I felt the salt air and saw the fishermen and the sandy beach as I walked with Thoreau.The most vivid characterization in the book is in the chapter \\"The Wellfleet Oysterman\\", as Thoreau describes a grizzled, taciturn, and ancient native of Cape Cod and his family who offer him hospitality for the night. Another memorable chapter involves the description of the Highland Lighthouse, no longer standing, and its keeper. The stops with the Oysterman and the Lighthouse punctuate Thoreau's long walks through the day over the beach and his meditiations about and descriptions of what he finds there.Thoreaus walk ended at Provincetown, on the northernmost portion of Cape Cod, with its wood walkway, shanty houses, and ever-present scenes of fishermen, boats, and drying fish. Thoreau offers what I found an affectionate portrait of these hardy fishermen and their families. Following a description of what he found at Provincetown, Thoreau offers a great deal of historical background on the exploration of the Cape, from the Pilgrims reaching back to earlier French, Icelandic, and English explorers.Thoreau's \\"Cape Cod\\" is a worthy companion to his books describing his experiences inland, on Walden Pond and on the rivers and woods of New England and Maine. It is beautifuly written with unforgettable descriptive passages. It made me want to get up and go from my life in the city, and over 150 years after Thoreau wrote, wander and walk for myself along the dunes and sands of Cape Cod."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"This is a comment about the edition rather than the book:I bought this edition based on the review about the very helpful index. Please be careful about what edition you are actually buying. Many of these reviews are about different editions. I bought the BiblioLife paperback book with a picture of the green bicycle on the cover. I just received it and there is NO INDEX.It looks like the original text from an original printing (with smaller physical dimensions) was photocopied page by page and put into this paperback book. This will do the trick but I am a little disappointed and wish I had bought a different edition.It is confusing on amazon because when you click \\"look inside\\" it shows an index, with a tiny note saying the \\"look inside\\" refers to a different edition."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"This book details the flora, fauna and people that Thoreau found in Cape Cod in the 1850s. Thoreau organizes the book around a single trip to Provincetown, although much of the material that he uses in the book came from various visits to the Cape, and to the ocean in general. He starts with a description of a shipwreck at Cohasset, then a stagecoach ride from Plymouth, then a walking trip with a companion along the outer shore to Provincetown. Along the way, he describes not only the plants and animals he encountered, but also the people who he met. The book finishes with a lengthy academic historical account of the discovery and mapping of the Cape.I found this to be the most humorous of all Thoreau's work. The character sketches he provides in this book, sharpened with his trained eye for observation of natural phenomena, are legendary. The cultural description of the Cape and its environment is quite fascinating for those interested in the history of daily life in 19th century Massachusetts. As Thoreau describes the desolate, treeless desert that made up the far reaches of the Cape, one begins to comprehend what it meant for an economy to be based on wood and whale oil for fuels. Thoreau stresses how valued driftwood was for residents of the Cape, as one of their main sources of heating and cooking fuel. Doubtless, he would not recognize the Cape today with its lush new forests. Or its Wal-Marts--switching to an oil economy has brought mixed blessings for the Cape. For those who think Thoreau to be a humorless didactic philosopher, this book shows a very different aspect of Thoreau as a writer."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"I'm not sure why Amazon identifies Josep Moldenhauer as the author of this book which is in fact written by Henry David Thoreau.Cape Cod is made up of his rambling observations he ambled about the Cape with an unidentified \\"companion\\" during the 1850's.I was looking forward to an evocative description of the unspoiled Cape which, even today in its over commercialized state, is redolent with romance, timelessness, and above all with the sea. Instead, the reader is exposed to dithering minutiae, delivered in a style that often borders on the unreadable.Here, for instance, is what must be one of the longest sentences ever written in the English language. It deals with the act of looking into a house on the beach through a knot-hole in the door. Hold on - you're not going to believe this.Here goes...However, as we wished to get an idea of a Humane house, and we hoped that we would never have a better opportunity, we put our eyes, by turns, to a knot-hole in the door, and after long looking, without seeing, into the dark, - not knowing how many shipwrecked men's bones we might see at last, looking with the eye of faith, knowing that, though to him that knocketh it may not always be opened, yet to him that looketh long enough through a knot hole the inside shall be visible, - for we had had some practice of looking inward, - by steadily keeping our other ball covered from the light meanwhile, putting the outward world behind us, ocean and land, and the beach, - till the pupil became enlarged and collected the rays of light that were wandering in that dark (for the pupil shall be enlarged by looking; there was never so dark a night that a faithful and patient eye, however small, might at last prevail over it), - after all this, I say, things began to take shape in our vision, - if we may use this expression where there was nothing but emptiness, - and we obtained the long-wished-for insight.Can you believe it?This monster sentence says that they looked into a house through a knot-hole, and since it was dark it took some time for their eyes to adjust, but eventually they were able to dimly make out the interior. That's it! And yet it contains not less that 207 words, twenty-four commas, seven dashes, and one semi colon.Anyway, apart from this sketchy style, Cape Cod is eminently forgettable."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"Cape Cod, by Henry David Thoreau, a book reviewReading Cape Cod is like visiting with a distant relative or a fond acquaintance. Thoreau, who we have all heard about for most of our lives, rarely lectures or preaches on these pages. The chapters ramble through a Cape Cod of yesteryear and are comprised of articles and journal entries from Thoreau's walking holidays in 1849, 1850, 1855, and 1857. He describes the countryside, the tame and wild vegetation (complete with botanical names), architecture, people, food, farms, ships, fishing, economic activity, and everything else that presents itself to his view.While Thoreau waxes poetic, and even philosophical, from time to time, this reads like a casual travel log, albeit from a very learned and intelligent scholar. The text includes quotes in a variety of languages, including Latin, Greek, and French, which are not all translated. Those looking for uncommon quotes are sure to find a few juicy tidbits. If you are looking for encouragement for reading the Christian Bible, exhortations against organized religion, or beautiful thoughts on nature and solitude, you will definitely find them here.What I found most fascinating, is the ecological destruction that had already occurred in the area. Some native shellfish had been nearly wiped out, and \\"seed stock\\" was being imported from other areas. Trees no longer reached the height that they had originally grown, crop land was no longer as productive, and erosion was enough of a problem that the government had stepped in with programs and regulations. Thoreau documents that the people blamed \\"Providence\\"--meaning the Creator--when their crops or natural resources failed them. It seems it never occurred to them that their own actions might be detrimental to their environment.Thoreau also documents the thinking about the ocean and its resources back in those days. Even he sees the ocean as nearly infinite and unlimited. This thinking is reflected in the fisheries and especially in the take on what they called \\"blackfish.\\" The \\"blackfish\\" is a small whale, or perhaps a dolphin, with a blunt shaped head. Schools of these creatures are chased aground by men and boys in small boats. They are then murdered for their blubber and left to rot. Thoreau asks one of the \\"fishermen\\" if the meat is good to eat, and the fishermen replies that he prefers it to beef--when it is fresh. Thoreau's only comment on this waste is that the poor soil needs the nutrients that this \\"manure\\" supplies.The edition that I read, which was arranged with notes by Dudley C. Lunt and was published by W. W. Norton & Company in 1951, contains a history of Cape Code in the appendix. This history, written by Thoreau, is rambling and disjointed, but worth reading. We all know that we have been sold a bill of goods in regards to Plymouth and the Pilgrims. A close reading of this history emphasizes just what a good sales job it was. The first thing that really grabbed me is the fact that three prior successful, permanent, European settlements had been established in North America (before Plymouth); one in Florida,--one I believe he said--in New Mexico, and one in Nova Scotia. (The one in Florida I have read something about before. When doing some research on the first Thanksgiving I ran across an article about a Florida town that claims it was celebrating Thanksgiving before the Pilgrims even thought of coming to the \\"New World.\\") Thoreau also documents early Viking and French visits to the area, and quotes texts that claim European people had been fishing in or near Cape Cod for many hundreds of years before \\"America\\" was \\"discovered.\\"Anyone researching the history of the East Coast, New England, or early contact between the two continents will find this a rewarding read. Thoreau sites the documents he quotes and others that may contain valuable information. However, you don't have to be a scholar or a student with a project to enjoy this book. Anyone with an interest in sustainability, history, botany, or the writing of Thoreau will be enriched by the time spent between these pages."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"(My review is on Thoreau's Cape Cod rather than this specific edition).While some literary critics seem to slight this work by Thoreau, saying that it is not as \\"powerful\\" as his other works, etc., I personally find this one very enjoyable. Sure, it does not have as much \\"philosophizing\\" as other books by him, but it is full of humor and very fun to read. The part where he describes the old man spitting into the hearth is particularly hilarious. The part about him sleeping in a lighthouse is also very funny. It lets us experience the more jovial side of Thoreau. This is probably one of the easiest to read among Thoreau's books.Published posthumously, this volume is surprisingly consistent and complete (unlike \\"The Maine Woods\\" which is chopped into three different parts), it gives one the feel of walking along the entire cape, although the materials are quarried from several different trips. One only wish Thoreau had lived longer and had seen the West, imagine him taking a trip in the Sierra! Oh, well, meanwhile, we still have this one to enjoy."},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"Love it....Love it!

This book is one of my favorites.I even pre-ordered this CD....Why don't they say this on the description?"},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"I am slowly getting through the book -- too much else going on. So far, it has been a pleasant read as Thoreau points out and comments on people, geography, history of the Cape, and events that occur, e.g., a shipwreck -- to which many people not directly connected to the tragedy don't seem to care a 'hoot'. The book was recommended by a friend who is an English professor as we in a book group were discussing 'The Thoreau You Don't Know' by Robert Sullivan -- which most of the group enjoyed and learned from. The recommendation came up after I mentioned I was reading 'A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers' which I retitled 'An Infinity on the Concord and ...'. That has to be the most boring book I ever read next to 'Vanity Fair'.So far, 'Cape Cod' is written in a relatively lively style compared to other Thoreau writings I've encountered. It has been enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Cape Cod","review":"I have the Princeton Classic edition (1988; 2004), but the text is essentially the same. Thoreau is at his best here in his descriptions of nature and the people inhabiting this (then) difficult place. The book really is a paean to the Sea...Thoreau is awed by its power and beauty. Much of the work tends to be descriptions of the sea or its influence on the land. More than once he mentions that one is never far from the noise of the breakers or the winds. He also discusses man's influence on the land (usually negative), yet how mankind is still dwarfed by the power of the sea. Even if you are not a Thoreau fan, read this. It makes for a good read on a cold winter's night."},{"Title":"Popular Culture: An Introductory Text","review":"This is a perfect book for college courses, especially American Studies for foreign learners. Most of the articles can be adapted for discussion and students' individual follow-up. For example, \\"How Much Can You Swallow?\\"--an analysis of an advertisement: students discuss the analysis and bring other ads for interpretation. Some texts are slightly outdated (the publication date is 1992), but even this can be turned to the teacher's advantage. For example, students could \\"update\\" the information on computers as icons (from \\"Living in the Material World\\") or show how attitudes to weight and gender have developed since the 1990s (\\"One Size Does Not Fit All\\")."},{"Title":"Popular Culture: An Introductory Text","review":"This book is so intriguing.

Brava, Mariah!"},{"Title":"Priceless","review":"Renowned underwater salvage expert Gordon Chandler asks marine archeologist Dr. Sam McGowan to join his team. In the past, Sam has rejected such offers, but this time the job entails salvaging a sunken paddle boat that his great-great grandfather used as a blockade runner during the Civil War. Desiring to learn more about his family tree and to work with the great Gordon, Sam accepts the job. In 1864, his ship sank off the Carolina coast due to a nasty storm. Since Gordon is busy on another project and his son Jared is also tied up elsewhere, he places his daughter Rachel in charge.When Sam realizes that Rachel runs the project, he becomes upset. However, he soon realizes that she is more than just a nepotistic selection. She proves she is an expert in her own right. Soon, Sam and Rachel begin to fall in love with one another. However, when they uncover an allegedly unknown treasure on the sunken ship, they find their lives in jeopardy. If they survive, they may learn that their hearts contain the greatest treasure of them all.Fans of romantic intrigue will find Mariah Stewart's latest novel to be a PRICELESS gem. The story line is fast-paced and filled with action. However, it is the tidbits on underwater salvaging and the Civil War blockade running blended within the plot that provide an exciting authenticity to the tale. Sam and Rachel are a wonderful couple and the secondary characters help propel the story forward. Ms. Stewart remains one of the sub-genre's leading lights.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Priceless","review":"This book was good. I enjoyed reading it. When I read the back, I had high expectations of it being like &quot;The Reef&quot; the treasure hunting and all, But it was typical.

This book is OK, but not vintage Stewart. She tried too hard to make a mystery and didn't spend enough time with the hero and heroine. Plus, I'm from the same area where the story is set, and she made it feel like a travelog, not a real place, which isn't like her usually. Come down and visit, Miss Stewart! Better yet, bring back the Enrights in your next book!"},{"Title":"Priceless","review":"I must admit that this is my first book by Mariah Stewart and it was excellent. I really enjoyed the story and the little bit of history that the book entailed. It was different from the typical love story in that it had a bit of mystery. I must also admit that the mystery did not stump me. I had it figured out after a couple of chapters, but it was still fun to read and see if I was right. The only thing that I would have wished for was a little more/better description of the physical settings in the book, such as the house that was being restored and the &quot;plain&quot; ancestor who comes back as a ghost. On the whole, it was a good book, which I finished in one day, if that tells you anything. I couldn't put it down!!!!! Recommended very highly!!!!"},{"Title":"Priceless","review":"Have enjoyed all of Mariah Stewart's books. Best to read them in order though.

Sam and Rachael fall in love while working the site for the owner of Eden's End. When They spend a week-end there, Rachael sees a ghost and valuable old family dairies are found.

The writing was flat, the characters uninteresting and under-developed, the mystery a bit lame. I skimmed two-thirds of the novel,(there was nothing to hold my eyes on the words!) and still managed to get the gist of a story that left me wondering where all these excellent ratings had come from.

This was the first Stewart book I have tried---I'm not sure I'll try any others. The conversation of the characterters were extremely stiff and unreal.

There's non-stop action with plenty of \\"first person shooter\\" potential, characters tend toward the one-dimensional, and the colors come straight from a box of Skittles (as does the apparent sugar buzz).It makes a fair read, if you want simple adventure, and might appeal to aficionados of the early-1980s or late-70s game.

Yet, these were pictures taken almost 100 years ago, long before the Angkor ruins became as famous or as exploited as they are now. The book appeals most to those who have seen the actual ruins. After my recent trip to Cambodia, I delighted in looking over these old photographs, comparing in my mind my travel experiences with those depicted in the book. I was amazed by their similarities, as well as their differences. I almost wished I could have travelled back in time to 1909 to actually witness these awe-inspiring ruins before the advent of mass tourism and commercialization. This tome allows the reader to do just that.It is a must have for those who have visited these ancient sites and loved them. The quality of the book is very high and the images are superbly reproduced."},{"Title":"Ruins of Angkor Cambodia in 1909","review":"An absolutely beautiful book at a great price, sent safely, quickly, at economically. Many thanks!"},{"Title":"Ruins of Angkor Cambodia in 1909","review":"This is a reproduction of a book printed with only 500 copies in 1909. When these photographs were taken Angkor was still a remote location visited by only a lucky few. The main temple of Angkor wat was still unrestored and in quite a different state from what you see today.The photos reproduced here are all of excellent quality and large size. If you have visited the Angkor temples then this book is wonderful to browse through and compare to how different they are now that the temples have been restored and cleaned up (and swarming with tourists). Even places like Ta Prohm which tourists like to think as still in pure jungle would be surprised at how much has actually changed from these photos.If you have ever visited Angkor, or have any interest in the monuments then this book is one you should have a look at for its wonderful and rare images of a lost world."},{"Title":"THE TREASURED WRITINGS OF KAHLIL GIBRAN","review":"I don't believe all readers would share the response I had, and this would be a shame, for rarely have I been so moved. This contains poems, short prose and stories- Some are beautiful parables, some are narratives of his past, others include gentle condemnations of harmful passions or yearnings for a better world; all (excluding, perhaps, the letters) are worth reading for any sort of audience, revolutionary or romantic, religious or humanist, idiot or intelligent, and so on.Some parts of this book seemed unreal. So wonderous was the flow of words and the manifestation of Gibrans mind that I felt tears at the incredible beauty of the whole, I even shuddered in joy brought about by the realisation that this work of art exists- kind of like when first reading the Brothers Karamazov, seeing a Michaelangelo, or viewing a spectacular film of nature (Blue Planet, Pattagonia and the like); one is left in awe."},{"Title":"THE TREASURED WRITINGS OF KAHLIL GIBRAN","review":"\\"I know that the principles upon which I base my writings, are echoes of the spirit of the great majority of the people of the world...\\" (656)-Kahlil Gibran in a letter to his cousin, Nakhli Gibran, in 1908.\\"The Treasured Writings of Kahlil Gibran\\", is a compilation of three other books of Gibran's treasury of writings, that each contained several books in one volume. They were: \\"A Treasury of Kahlil Gibran\\" (1947), \\"A Second Treasury of Kahlil Gibran\\" (1957), and \\"A Third Treasury of Kahlil Gibran\\" (1965). A total of ten books in all, this volume contains earlier books by Gibran such as, \\"Tears And Laughter\\", and more mature and widely acclaimed books such as, \\"The Broken Wings.\\" In addition to the beautiful prose, verse, and imaginative stories, there is also biographical information and letters written by, and to Gibran. This is perhaps the most comprehensive book of Kahlil Gibran's writings, and one of the most informative about the man himself.Philosopher, artist, and poet; these are some of the titles that are used to describe Kahlil Gibran. In order to fully describe this remarkable man, and this book, \\"The Treasured writings of Kahlil Gibran\\", one must reach beyond a mere title and use words such as passion, purity, and even divinity. To read this book is to realize this was a mortal man who sincerely understood the difficulties of being human, and yet often looked into the tender eyes of the divine, and shares his belief that he can see this light in the eyes of others.\\"The riches of the spirit beautify the face of man and give birth to sympathy and respect. The spirit, in every being is made manifest in the eyes...\\" (488)To absorb the depth of Gibran is to discover your own soul's longing for light and life, for beauty and joy. It is to hear the cries of your own heart's ecstasy as a friend, companion, and lover. With his writings, Gibran seems to gently take us by the hand, and listen with us, for our own whisper of echoing spirit."},{"Title":"THE TREASURED WRITINGS OF KAHLIL GIBRAN","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend and she never got it back.

He'd addressed the heart and mind on subjects with great story telling power. My original copy of his book is so old that it is falling apart, and so I bought this collection in order to share his words with others without concern for the condition of the book. I read a few pages to a young lady in one of my classes and she went out and bought her a copy, too.

They end up taking on a role of responsibility in the organization and organizing the other missionaries. One scene that vividly stands out in my memory is when she and her husband are marching to an unreached area. They pass a person in the field. She calls out to the person something about Jesus, because she doesn't have time to stop. All she can do is hope that the Lord makes Himself known to that person.An interesting note: after I read this book, I sent it to a missionary friend of mine.

I knew very little about the subject when I sat down to peruse this book and was surprised at the amount of information I gained. The pictures are magnificent - they're eye-catching and fun and would make this book enjoyable for kids any age. The little \\"Fun Facts\\" and \\"Fun Exercises\\" that go with most of the dollhouses are great little highlights. The directions on how to build your own green dollhouse at the end is a perfect addition and will hopefully be used by many. This book would be great to have in the schools and used by teachers. Building a green dollhouse following the books guidelines would make an engaging and mind expanding project for almost any grade level.You can tell that much thought and attention to detail was put into this book. If you are interested at all in preserving the environment and teaching our kids about ways to do that, this book belongs in your library."},{"Title":"Green Dollhouse - Creating a Doll's Eye View of a Healthier World","review":"Once you begin reading the Green Dollhouse, you will not want to put it down. This book is a refined blend of educational material for children and adults alike. Creativity and art are presented in a very accessible fashion with an emphasis on problem solving. The light and playful manner in which this book is presented complements its role as a resource for learning about suitability. Amongst its colorful pages you will find information on what is available, valuable and possible.Filled with beautiful photographs depicting dollhouses built by teams from around the world, the Green Dollhouse entertains while educating the reader. The process of reusing household materials and turning them into art pieces seems to be at work.On the pictures throughout you will discover everything from paperclips, stamps and milk cartons to LED light fixtures, rotating PV solar panels and organic wall paper. In the narrative you will find information on how to select appliances that have minimal environmental impact, and how to make recycling fun and creative (\\"Fun Facts\\"). If you want to turn your reading into a hands-on experience, look for the pages with instruction on how to build your own doll dwelling (\\"Fun Exercises\\").The dollhouses in the book originated from a contest sponsored by Sustainable San Mateo County in California. The participants were challenged to design and build functional and aesthetic pieces that would inspire people of all ages to make their own homes more environmentally sustainable and healthy.The Green Dollhouse could be the perfect gift for a friend, child or someone interested in the subject of architecture, sustainability or the innovative process of transforming common household materials into functional pieces of art."},{"Title":"Green Dollhouse - Creating a Doll's Eye View of a Healthier World","review":"The book is great inspiration for middle school house/sculpture and environmental discussions. The book arrived in tip top shape and promptly."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Kings","review":"I never would have thought that spacefarers would keep large stocks of embalming fluid in their ships, but what do I know. I also wonder at the clear sense of up and down that exists aboard these spaceships, and how they seem to come to a dead stop when their drives are busted. I give Connell high marks for narrative drive; that's what enabled me to finish, and even enjoy the book despite being revolted by the violence, the characters, the society described and nearly everything else in the book. If an alien race had arrived and exterminated humanity, I would have called it a happy ending. In the end, I give it a qualified recommendation to space-opera fans with strong stomachs."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Kings","review":"Awesome, awesome, awesome!!If Alfred Bester, David Mamet and Kate Chopin had a voodoo love-child, theirpunk-rock offspring would be Adam Connell.Counterfeit Kings is a daring debut on par with Mieville's and Stephenson's.Connell surprises, delights and amazes. All the things science fiction wasmeant to do, and Connell does them better than most."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Kings","review":"Comparisons with Alfred Bester are apt here. The action in Counterfeit Kings is gripping and brilliantly paced. On the one hand, the story describes a race between several realistic characters--some of them truly disturbing--to recover a ruler who's gone missing. The book also tells of the protagonist Horrocks' struggle to hold on to his humanity as his corner of the universe descends into chaos. Brutal, exciting, insightful, and very well done."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Kings","review":"Folks, I bought this book based on the existing glowing reviews. But, I have to say that I thought this book was raw at best. I almost didn't finish reading it.I think that Adam Connell could develop into a much better author, but this work reflects his weaknesses more than strengths:* Characters that you had to try hard to care about* Weak plot* Gratuitous violenceI personally will not buy another of his books until he gets positive reviews from a major source and/or makes the cut at a major publisher.Sorry, but that's my honest opinion."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Kings","review":"Counterfeit Kings rivals the best of classic SF in scope and intensity. The science fiction setting and plot are woven together tightly, giving us one of the most plausible future visions ever put on paper. The plot twists and turns like a runaway rollercoaster, and even the most jaded reader of SF is going to get taken by surprise as the story unfolds.But for me, the most fascinating details of Counterfeit Kings are the characters. The cover shows a flayed human face, and Adam Connell pulls off the equivelent feat in presenting his characters, peeling away the layers of their external actions to stare unblinkingly at the demons that drive them. Life in outer space isn't easy in Connell's vision--the characters are trapped in flimsy tin cans, surrounded by void, their lives dependent on jury-rigged and ever-failing technology. The stress and claustrophopia has taken a toll on even the most likable of the characters. The heroes are separated from the villians by only the thinest moral lines, but, in the end, these lines prove to be the truly important ones. Connell's understanding of human desires and actions equals or exceeds his impressive grasp of science fiction. Even non-SF readers will love this book.I can't recommend this book highly enough. Connell has gained a fan for life in me after this one."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Kings","review":"Yeah, you can feel there are themes lurking under the book's surface current, but I don't have time for that. I want to be entertained. And I was!Holy cow, this book, it's like stepping onto one of those moving walkways at the airport. You have to be prepared for the jolt. So let me prepare you. Counterfeit Kings is high conflict, rip out the breaks, non-stop action. Chases, dogfights in space, murder, betrayals. Blood, guts, and octane, as I like to say.There's depth if you want it, but only if you want it. Connell's not hitting you over the head with allusions and symbolism and blah blah. You can be like me...I rode this thing like a twenty-foot wave and it left me breathless. I want more! Let's hear it for a sequel!"},{"Title":"Counterfeit Kings","review":"This remarkable novel by Adam Connell is a fast-paced page-turner that grabs you from the starting blocks and takes you on an exhilarating spree of plot twists, sudden violence, and poignancy. In spinning this volatile tale of desperation, conflicted loyalties, and revenge, Mr. Connell uses an interplay between a variety of characters--some despicable yet humorously sympathetic, and others heroic yet tragically flawed--to weave a wonderful read that left the impressions of a true cinematic experience on this reader. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Kings","review":"As Horrocks demands of Sari in the opening scene- strap your seatbelt on and get ready for one wild ride. This debut novel, from a writer I certainly hope to read more of, has it all- adventure, war, hate, love, and greed- presented at a breathtaking pace. The language used is terse and at some times harsh, and Connell does an excellent job of using dialogue to define the personalities of his characters. Throughout the story there are references to the great masters of the genre- Guilfoyle seems to be an ugly shadow of the famous Bester character. The story is driven by the egos of the essential characters and these characters are driven by the darkness inside them whether it comes from greed, jealousy, anger, or a warped sense of responsibility. The story is as much about the extreme actions people will take in a time of uncertainty- looking at death as an insignificant coincidence in their quest for what they believe is rightfully theirs- as it is a politically charged sci-fi epic. I highly recommend this book to any sci-fi aficionado and to anyone ready to take on a swift and stirring read."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Kings","review":"In the far distant future three percent of Earth's energy come from the gas mines above Io, Jupiter's volcanic moon. The harnessing of energy is the work of the Furnaces which is the brainstorm of Kingston who created a powerful empire in which he and his wife are the king and queen. During the Push, a war was fought to wrest control of the mines from Kingston but he and his allies were victorious.To prevent another successful assassination during the war he created Ringers, surgically transformed men to serve as Kingston's bodyguards. The system worked and the empire thrived until an assassin was able to slip past the guards and kill the king and take control. The ringers and Kingston scatter and claimants to the empire want the king to stay gone for twenty days for that means he will be officially declared dead with his empire to go to the most powerful claimant. Horracks and his pregnant wife Sari, once bodyguards to the royals, are asked to find the king before the time is up. They do not know that Kingston's illegitimate children and an old enemy working for rival business man want them to fail.Adam Connell debuts with an excellent future world tale in which business rules and sabotage and assassination is the order of the day. COUNTERFEIT KINGS is not a happily ever after tale but it is a realistic one as business rules the galaxy. There are many villains in Mr. Connell's story that readers will love to hate more than they will love the protagonist, a man who doesn't even know what his best option is in the coming war. Counterfeit Kings is a mesmerizing, action-packed and riveting work of science fiction.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Counterfeit Kings","review":"In the not so near future someone attempts to assassinate the King of a mining colony.

After discovering her when quite young, I still follow new additions to the series - nearly twenty years later! I read and re-read these books over and over again throughout my youth, but I haven't re-read this series in its entirety in a long time - and never as an adult. There are some new books added to the series since the last time I read them, so this re-reading project is pretty exciting for me since it will include these new volumes, and will be in a new order. These books really just remind me of being young, reading them in the back seat of the car on family road trips... I think I was in 4th or 5th grade when I first started reading them, and they've always been a pleasure to re-read - and I am sure this will continue to be the case! The Valdemar series is broken up into (for the most part) separate trilogies. In my re-reading project, I am going to try to read them chronologically - not by publication date, but by their timeline within the series.I really like this follow up toStorm Warning (The Mage Storms, Book 1)more than its predecessor! It is a lot more exciting, and because I haven't re-read it as much as some of the earlier books in the series, the plot itself was more surprising to me. I really like the introduction into Solaris' character. I still can't believe how quickly this whole reading project has flown by! I am glad that I have some new books after the Owl trilogy - though chronologically speaking, they are set back beforeBrightly Burning. Either way, Lackey is a talented writer with a real knack for creating likable characters and entertaining plots."},{"Title":"Storm Rising (Mage Storms, No 2)","review":"When I first got this book I was very excited to start reading it because of the great summary on the back. Truth be told, the back describes pretty much only the last chapter. The whole rest of the book is just showing what people thinking and having very little action. Besides that, it mostly shows Firesong's and Tremane's thoughts instead of Karal's, who is the lead character in the book. The only reason why I gave this book a three at all is because of the final chapter. In this chapter it has the climax of the book plus all the facts leading up to it. Overall, this book was okay, but definately not one of Mercades Lackeys best."},{"Title":"Storm Rising (Mage Storms, No 2)","review":"A wonderful continuation of the Mage Storms saga, but several times, I found myself tempted to skip a few pages. There is much more instropection than in Storm Warning and several sections neither contribute to the story nor add to the characters. However, overall, this is a good book, with a few surprising and heartwarming turns."},{"Title":"Storm Rising (Mage Storms, No 2)","review":"I loved this series{Strom Warning,Storm Rising, Storm Breaking} so much! I thought it was really great.My favortie character of all time is in here: Karal. I don't know what draws me to him.But he is just one of the most entertaining character I have ever met.SO i hope you enjoy these books as much as me!"},{"Title":"Storm Rising (Mage Storms, No 2)","review":"Lackey does a fantastic job of pulling people deeper into the heart of Valdemar with this second installment in the mage-storms. Revealing more of the tensing plot, adding in new characters and situations... to make this a good book, but maybe not as good as the first. I look forward to reading the third installment in the trilogy, which is sure to be the best of the bunch! If you've read Lackey and enjoyed her style, read this trilogy!"},{"Title":"Storm Rising (Mage Storms, No 2)","review":"Okay, well, I haven't read Storm breaking yet - but I want to!! So many questions I want to find out about...this second book in the trilogy enhanced my sense of curiosity.I did rather want to hear more about Karal and Natoli, and Andesha and Firesong though, but reading the ending made me think about when I read Black Gryphon and I enjoyed it all the more. Unless I'm mistaken, I thought Urtho's Vault was above ground and not below it though :)As usual, Mercedes Lackey has done an excellent job in piquing the readers curiosity, and I cant wait to conclude this series...only to get more books out :"},{"Title":"Storm Rising (Mage Storms, No 2)","review":"Compared to other Lackey books--which I consider to be without question among the absolute best writing available in *any* genre--this book was a big, dull, disappointment. I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen, but all I got was political maneuvering, winter manor administration (do you *really* want to read about sewage treatment in a fantasy novel?), and endless internal monologues. You get detailed to death.I think one of the problems is that the 'opponent' here is not a sentient entity (so far as we know), but the magical equivalent of a natural phenomenon. It's difficult to feel much emotion towards it, and while I was rather glad to have a break from Lackey's usual sadistic evil mages, I don't think this quite worked. Read it only if you liked the first book and intend to read the third; otherwise, stick to her earlier books."},{"Title":"Storm Rising (Mage Storms, No 2)","review":"Having read almost all of the Valdemar books, starting with the &quot;Arrows of the Queen&quot; trilogy when I was 12, I can definately say that Lackey's writing has declined in quality. The &quot;Arrows&quot; triology was charming, and one I still re-read, but the &quot;Winds&quot; and &quot;Storm&quot; series are the reasons I don't really read her books anymore. They could be well done, perhaps, but they are unpolished, and not well-thought out. It's disappointing to a reader to see a world with such delightful characters simply fall apart because of the author's haste to turn in the next draft to the publisher. Also, as almost anyone who has read most of Lackey's books has probably noticed, her preachiness gets old in a hurry. Reading the story becomes a chore when one is faced with some sort of &quot;rule to live by&quot; at every page turn in lieu of a coherent plot. Suffice it to say that Lackey's writing was far better when she first began and didn't have such cockiness as an author, and focused on the story instead of pushing her own moral/political/religious agenda."},{"Title":"Storm Rising (Mage Storms, No 2)","review":"Mercedes Lackey is a good story teller but after reading the last of the herald mage series and the queens own this story was very predictable. Disaster! Miraculous solution! World saved. It shouldnt have been a 3 book series."},{"Title":"Storm Rising (Mage Storms, No 2)","review":"Karal, Sun Priest of Karse, has now become the Karsite envoy to Valdemar. He and the other representatives of the Alliance countries must figure out a way to keep their homes safe from the worsening Mage Storms. But Karal's youth and apparent inexperience make other older council members discredit him, and Karal's forgiving nature makes irrational council members dislike him. As Karal struggles to represent his homeland, it begins to take a toll on his health. Only his friends An'desha, Natoli, and the Firecat Altra keep him from becoming ill. However, as the Storms worsen, the temporary protections against them begin to wear away. Will Karal, with the help of Altra, An'desha, the Tayldras Adept Firesong, and the Companion Florian, be able to prevent the Storms from destroying his home forever?&quot;Storm Rising&quot; is the second book in Mercedes Lackey's Mage Storms Trilogy. I really enjoyed it, though not quite as much as &quot;Storm Warning.&quot;It was slower paced than its predecessor and focused much more on the development of the characters. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing; I enjoy character development and tend to take my time reading books like that instead of rushing through them. Karal's relationships with his nonhuman friends Altra and Florian were filled out nicely, and I continue to enjoy the senses of humor that Lackey endows upon her characters. Firesong's spiral down into obsession and semi-depression was disturbingly real. Tremane came along marvelously. I liked him in &quot;Warning,&quot; but the caring way in which he begins to rule Hardorn shows him to be an even more decent human being than I expected.The climax is quite similar in basic structure to that in &quot;Warning,&quot; but that is mostly due to Mage Storm problem that the Alliance is facing. However, it was different enough for me to appreciate what happened. My only complaint is that it came so close to the end of the book that there was no real denouement.Bottom Line: A solid continuation of the trilogy that really lets you get to know the characters."},{"Title":"Storm Rising (Mage Storms, No 2)","review":"I am a devoted follower of the Valdemar series -- it's my one literary indulgence, being a classics major. It does get a little long on detail, but I am really enjoying being so INVOLVED in the world that is so fascinating. I think it is an extreme mark of her talent that she has created such an amazing world. Some people may wish for more action and less involvment with polotics and such, but I have no complaints."},{"Title":"Storm Rising (Mage Storms, No 2)","review":"I love the Valdemar series, but this is definately not one of my favorite series in the bunch. The plotline is very good, I admit: The various countries must band together and all chip in to find some way to defend themselves against a larger enemy who is determined to rule them all. At the same time, ancient echoes of a tremendous amount of magic being released are striking on man again, making magic turn wild and rampant once again, threatening all that lives. The plot is good, but I found myself having trouble relating with the characters and finding my attention wandering. The best parts were those with Elspeth and Darkwind back in the story! But if you are a Heralds of Valdemar fan, then I would suggest you read it, but if not then I would start somewhere else."},{"Title":"Storm Rising (Mage Storms, No 2)","review":"Faced with more challenges that many people - including himself - think he can handle, Karal struggles to maintain the Karsite presence on what has turned into both a series of brainstorming sessions regarding the magestorms and a likely council of war against the threat in Hardon. Against all the various stresses, he continues to serve the Sunlord while still wishing to be anywhere but. His relationships with An'desha, Natoli, and Altra continue to grow and mature in what little time he has for them, but duties and questions pile up faster than he can deal with them.My favorite of the books in the series, STORM RISING lets me ride along on Karal's shoulder again. Lackey deals with some very realistic issues, such as others' reactions to Karal's age in the political arena and the desire for revenge. Likewise, she showed how thinking beyond revenge can have positive consequences. The spirit of cooperation between the various countries involved is enviable in this day and age, where war seems to pop up everywhere.This is the last book of this series where the plot and writing seem to be up to par. However, I still enjoy curling up with this one and losing myself in Haven, walking along with Karal to the tavern or listening in on the discussions with the mages and the envoys. The visit by Solaris was a definite treat, one that opened up a whole new range of possibilities and explored some of them. We understand even more of Tremane and it's relief to see him join up with the 'good' side.This is one of the books I read and then wish my life had a little more of the magic she puts into her books."},{"Title":"Storm Rising (Mage Storms, No 2)","review":"I absolutely *adore* Misty's Valdemar books (especially the Vanyel and Talia trilogies), but Misty seems to be getting rather long-winded as she continues writing.

I'm trying to slog through the 3rd book right now..."},{"Title":"Storm Rising (Mage Storms, No 2)","review":"Ok.... I read the Valdemar books alot.... I'm a big, huge fan....

Paris is a city to be seen by walking, but being an old city, the streets can be small, tight, meadering, and dense sometimes. Don't be embarrassed to pull out a map on the street corner to get your bearings, and when you do, pull this map out.It is plastic laminated, so spills or rain or wear won't smudge the details. Refolds easily in a different pattern so as to keep area of interest to the fore. Great detail, easy to read, very useful. There is a subway map on the back, it is workable, but when you get to Paris, tear out a full page subway map from one of the many tourist magazines lying around."},{"Title":"Emergence of a Black Catholic Community","review":"The book gives the greatest and indeed much needed insight on an African American Group of people, who fought many battles for religious freedom, and the right to educate their own children, through their own Church.

Doherty's The Death of a King is a tale worth reading. Although minimal knowledge of the basic events, the death of Edward II and the eventual rule of Edward III, is helpful, it is not necessary to enjoy this book. I also appreciate it when the author concludes the tale by separating fact from fiction as does P.C. Doherty. For the history buff this book will stimulate your desire to 'learn more about it.'"},{"Title":"The Death of a King (Missing Mysteries)","review":"The author has obviously done much research on this topic and time period; it shows in this story. While basing the book on some facts about the alleged murder of Edward II, Doherty uses that as a starting off point and weaves a very credible tale of what-ifs and possibilities. The book has the flavor, smells, sights, and sounds of the middle ages. Caution: this book may make you want to go dig through the musty files of history yourself into the details of the baffling death of a king."},{"Title":"The Death of a King (Missing Mysteries)","review":"Intrique abounds in Paul Doherty's book, The Death of a King. Told through letters to a contemporary Prior, a humble clerk embarks on a journey for King Edward III that would make anyone's feeble heart beat. Edmund Beche tries to pick up the trail on King Edward II thought long dead, murdered and buried by his wife the Queen Isabella, a.k.a., She Wolf.Told through letters, Beche's journey is explained and the astounding mystery unfolds.If you are interested in the lives of England's medieval kings and queens and all of the political intrique, cover-ups, spying and mystery that surrounds them, you'll enjoy this story where unknown history and mystery is given new breath and secrets thought long dead are explained in fictional portrayals as though they could have really happened, and the way Paul Doherty explains it he could be right, but you'll have to be the judge.I enjoy medieval books by this author and he is so knowledgeable of the history of the English court that his books are a real treat to read. I learn a lot by Paul Doherty's books and I am wonderfully entertained in the process."},{"Title":"The Death of a King (Missing Mysteries)","review":"I usually like books with more 'fantastic' elements but all the history and action in this book kept it interesting enough without those elements.It doesn't have a lot of humor but instead has a very dark, medieval feeling, more like I'm sure it really was than what you see in movies."},{"Title":"The Death of a King (Missing Mysteries)","review":"If you are a PC Doherty fan, you will of course love this book. PC Doherty is a master historian and has the wonderful ability to weave a story into the historical setting.

If you like historical fiction, this is a great example of the genre."},{"Title":"The Death of a King (Missing Mysteries)","review":"The usual mix of suspenseful mystery and vivid depictions of the daily lives of medieval people.

Author Richard Heinberg provides a scholarly critique of modern industrialism, focusing on its current use of energy, and a sobering forecast based on predictable trends.The key point of the book is that the Earth's crust can provide mankind with an essentially finite amount of fossil fuel energy, with primary reference to oil. Drawing on the relatively unknown, and oft-misunderstood, concept of \\"peak oil,\\" the book addresses the imminent shortfall of petroleum that will not be available on world markets. That day of reckoning is far closer than most people think. \\"Peak oil\\" is a global application of Geologist M. King Hubbert's (1903-1989) studies of oil production in \\"mature\\" exploration districts. That is, exploration for oil in sedimentary basins at first yields substantial discoveries, which are then produced. Additional exploration yields less and less \\"new\\" oil discovered, and that level of discovery coming at greater and greater effort. Eventually, absent additional significant discovery, production \\"peaks\\" and then commences an irreversible decline. This has already occurred in the U.S. in the 1970's, and is in the process of occurring in oil-producing nations such as Mexico, Britain, Egypt, Indonesia and Malaysia. Ominously, \\"peak\\" production can be forecast in the next few years in such significant producing nations as Saudi Arabia and Iraq (in addition to all of the other problems in those unfortunate nations.)Much of the rise of industrial society was tied to increasing availability of high energy-density fuel, particularly oil. Western society, and its imitators in non-Western lands, is based upon access to large amounts of energy-dense fuel, and that fuel is oil. With respect to the U.S., the domestic decline in oil production has been made up, over the past thirty years, by increasing imports from other locales, with concomitant political risk. When the world production \\"peaks\\" in the next few years, the competition for energy sources will become more fierce than it already is. This book addresses issues related to what are commonly thought of as \\"substitutes\\" for oil, such as coal, natural gas and natural gas liquids, and shatters many myths. The author also delves deeply into energy sources such as \\"tar sand,\\" \\"oil shale,\\" nuclear and renewable sources. And thankfully, the author offers a number of proposals to address the looming problem (although these proposals are probably not what an awful lot of people want to hear.)A book like this one could easily descend into a tawdry level of \\"chicken-little\\" squawks and utter tendentiousness. But thankfully it does not do so. This is a mature, well-reasoned and carefully footnoted effort. I could take issue with some of the author's points about \\"big business\\" and how decisions are made at high political levels, but not in this review. Instead I will simply congratulate Mr. Heinberg for writing an important contribution to social discourse. I hope that a lot of people read this book and start to look at and think about the world differently."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"'The end of the world as we know it'...who do you believe? Facts and data are always open to both interpretation as well as manipulation and projections are, at best, educated guesses. But this much is certain, the oil supply is definitely finite, the main point of expert argument is 'when' not 'if'. And we (The Industrial Civilization) seem to not only not have a rational plan to deal with that, we seem unaware that there even is a looming problem.This book paints a very bleak future for us, the author makes no attempt to sugarcoat data and facts that are disturbing to say the least. And we are not talking about some nebulous time in the distant future, this dismal future starts next year (or even now, anybody bought gas lately?)At the end of the book, the author offers suggestions on how we might better cope with the beginning of the energy collapse, mind you, not avert it, its far too late for that. But his options do far too little (backyard gardens and carless days?) or expect far too much (Global birth control?)for a world that seems oblivious to its peril.'The end of the world as we know it' in our lifetime? or our childrens? The more I read about this, the more impotency I feel about it. &quot;Doom and gloom&quot; I noticed other reviewers saying, &quot;Flawed analysis&quot; and &quot;slanted research&quot; --- words of denial that are shouted over the disquieting din of the growing storm.I am reminded of the words of John Wyndham - 'I would find myself a tidy little hill...and fortify it.'"},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"Heinberg's book suffers from only one major flaw I can see: it is too far ahead of its time. Therefore, he ignores the \\"perilous optimism\\" endemic in American culture and society, to use the phrase of Prof. Ernest Partridge of the University of California-Riverside. The existence of this misplaced and misguided optimism - or what I call national hubris - means that his book is more likely to be ignored or dismissed (e.g. as \\"too dark, too pessimistic\\") unless the mindset changes. Which isn't likely anytime soon!By \\"perilous optimism\\" Partridge meant a kind of national philosophy or zeitgeist built largely on ignorance and unfounded hope for the future rather than appreciation of cold, hard facts. There are multiple inputs to this, particularly where our national and global energy predicament is concerned.Perhaps the most significant is entropy, and how energy is constantly \\"degraded\\" as it used, ushering in ever declining scales of efficiency, ease of extraction, leading to diminishing returns. An appreciation of entropy would thus pave the way for a more realistic assessment of the global energy situation - and how we need to prepare from now for a start post-industrial, low energy age.Heinberg is not the first to have sounded the various warnings of imminent collapse and onset of a \\"regressive\\" energy age. For example, Jeremy Rifkin in his landmark book \`Entropy- A New World View' (Bantam New Age, 1980) called attention to the many underlying themes to do with entropy - including the waste energy accompanying each energy conversion, say combusting petroleum in an auto to yield waste heat and CO2. The latter now the prime culprit in the Greenhouse Effect, which has increased significantly in atmospheric concentration the past 2 years (2002, 2003).The now deceased and noted science writer and biochemist Isaac Asimov- in various essays written over decades- also warned repeatedly of the need for human stewardship. He particularly pointed out constraints on humanity's use of resources, particularly in terms of how population growth impinges on finite resources and sets limits to growth. Isaac Asimov was probably also the first to use the term \\"carrying capacity\\" which he estimated to be 3 billion humans for this limited world. (Overestimating Heinberg's value by 1 billion. But for a more scientific assessment, which approximates this,see: 'Population Growth and Earth's Carrying Capacity' in *Science*, Vol. 269, p. 341).Asimov warned that humans had two choices: decrease their population to the carrying capacity limit - to live in an equilibrium with the Earth and its resources- or let nature \\"increase the human death rate\\" (e.g. by starvation, diseases - especially pandemics, wars over resources etc.)Author Aurelio Peccei, in his \`One Hundred Pages for the Future' made similar pleas for humans to notch their numbers down to replacement levels or lower since they exceeded the Earth's ability to support them. (Part 1: \`The Ascent and Decline of Humankind'). Peccei refers to an enormous supplemental population - one that exists beyond the ability of additional resources, energy as a \\"human bomb threatening the planet\\".More recently, two articles appearing in \`Physics Today' (July, 2004 issue) have set the stage starkly for what we face in a bleak energy future. The first by Paul B. Weisz, \`Basic Choices and Constraints on Long-Term Energy Supplies' (p. 47) embodies pretty well what the title implies. The second, \`Thoughts on Long-Term Energy Supplies: Scientists and the Silent Lie' by Albert Bartlett (p. 53) pinpoints the failure to name human population growth as a major cause of our energy and resource problems.Bartlett avers that \\"their (scientists') general reticence stems from the fact that it is politically incorrect or unpopular to argue for stabilization of population - at least in the U.S. Or perhaps scientists are uncomfortable stepping outside their specialized areas of expertise\\".Whatever the reason, Bartlett argues it is equivalent to perpetuating a \\"silent lie\\", a term derived from a Mark Twain quote:\\"Almost all lies are acts, and speech has no part in them...I am speaking of the lie of silent assertion: we can tell it without saying a word.\\"Indeed, it occurs each time a rosy economic forecast is given, and energy scientists - for example, withhold comment rather than strongly vocalize or object to how these forecasts are adrift from sober reality since they take no account of \\"externalities\\" or \\"external costs\\".One example of such a false economic indicator is \\"GDP\\" or \`Gross Domestic Product' as noted by University of Maryland eo-economics professor Herman Daly.The GDP is supposed to measure the total production and consumption of goods and services in the United States. But the numbers that make up the Gross Domestic Product by and large only capture the monetary transactions we can put a dollar value on. Almost everything else is left out: old growth forests that maintain cooling, and acts as CO2 repositories, watersheds, animal habitats, e.g. the Everglades, and costs of infrastructure maintenance.Ignoring these \\"externalities\\" leads us into a fool's paradise where we come to believe things are much better than the GDP numbers show. Similarly with energy, conveniently ignoring externalities of cost and demand leads too many to envisage a pie-eyed future of never-ending growth and ever more intense energy consumption.All this translates inexorably into \\"growth\\" and woe betide you if you dare intimate (as Prof. Daly has done) that a zero or negative growth index may be a lot better for humans, if they hope not to outstrip their resource support base.Daly has noted that the concept of the GDP was developed to help steer the US economy out of the Great Depression, and through World War Two. It was for another time and place, and is no longer relevant to this time and place. It needs to be dunned and ditched in favor of the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare.All of the above sources, issues are mentioned because, if one is not already au fait with the problems posed by human population and energy use, Heinberg's book is bound to fall on deaf ears or unreceptive neurons. Never mind the documentation and evidence he provides.For example, his primary quantitative indicator used throughout the book: EROEI, or \`energy returned on energy invested' will likely be met by eyes glazed over, or disputatious attitude, unless one is reasonably familiar with entropy's role in diminishing energy returns. Thus, as one FINITE energy resource is constantly consumed, it becomes ever more difficult to extract the same energy efficiency for the same cost and effort.But for those who live in the fantasyland of an infinite -resource planet, this doesn't exist on their radar: since consumption will never make further extraction more difficult!In like manner, ignoring associated external costs inevitably provides a false assessment for an alternate (to oil) energy source. Thus, critics may pillory Heinberg for not jumping on the nuclear power bandwagon, but he is exactly correct - when the costs of safety implementation, waste disposal and de-commissioning of reactors is taken into account!I awarded this book four stars, but also aver that it is perhaps too far ahead of its time to be appreciated the way it ought to be at the present time. I believe Americans, especially, need to see much higher oil price spikes and experience more economic and other suffering, rationing - before they can truly appreciate the propositions and proposals Heinberg puts forward. They are still too locked into the numbing mindset of \\"perilous optimism\\".But nothing breaks through such specious optimism as brutal reality and a real world that is finite, and brooks no Polyannish visions of making it \\"infinite\\"."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"Anyone who cares in the slightest what will happen to mankind in the 21st century must read this book. I don't think there's any stronger endorsement I that can give! We always seem to assume our civilization can advance and advance and advance forever, and the author rightly points out that a fluke -- a temporary abundance of raw energy -- is responsible for much of what we've accomplished in the last 150 years, not just innovation.Heinberg writes clearly and painstakingly structures his points, so that the argument, when fully unfolded, sounds reasonable -- not at all like alarmist left-wing hyperbole.For me, the most unsettling point comes late in the game: that roughly 4/5 of the global population may have to die off post-oil. (Today's elevated soil productivity is dependent on oil-based fertilizers, with no substitute in sight.)Read the book!"},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"Of four excellent book on the topic \\"Oil\\", The Party's Over is my favorite. It is well written, easy to read, logical, rational and documented with extensive facts. Richard Heinberg compares his position on various issues with those of other authors who disagree, and provides a good defense for his position. His last chapter, Managing the Collapse:Strategies and Recommendations, offers realistic options and solutions, and understandably indicates that the lifestyle as we know it can not be maintainable. He describes the reality of the coming changes in great detail, and paints a picture that many people will be reluctant to accept.This book is essential reading for those concerned about the environment and the future of mankind, and are willing to face the challenges ahead.PS. The other three excellent books are: The Oil Factor by Stephen Leeb, Out of Gas by David Goodstein, and Hubbert's Peak by Kenneth Deffeyes"},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"Richard Heinberg set out to answer the questions, \\"How much petroleum is left? How much coal, natural gas, and uranium? Will we ever run out? When? What will happen when we do? How can we best prepare? Will renewable substitutes--such as wind and solar power--enable industrialism to continue in a recognizable form indefinitely?\\" (p. 3) He sorted the various responses to these questions into four broad voices--those of free-market economists, environmental activists, petroleum geologists, and politicians--and of these four, he found the third, the petroleum geologists, to be the most useful, if only because \\"theirs is a long-range view based on physical reality\\" (p.5). (Throughout the book, Heinberg notes that the free-market economists are almost constitutionally opposed to talk of Peak Oil, because, as economist Robert Solow said, \\"the world can, in effect, get along without natural resources.\\" Resources, in other words, are merely commodities created by the market to satisfy demands, and when the demand arises, the market will find a supply. Needless to say, Heinberg finds this laissez faire approach to Peak Oil--\\"perilous optimism\\"--quite dangerous because it ignores hard ecological realities.)\\"The message here is that we are about to enter a new era in which each year, less net energy will be available to humankind, regardless of our efforts or choices. The only significant choice we will have will be how to adjust to this new regime\\" (p.5). In short, an ecological perspective on humanity's consumption of petroleum and other nonrenewable resources reveals that the astronomical population growth and economic expansion of the last century are the biological bloom and population overshoot enabled by an energy subsidy from cheap, abundant oil, coal, and natural gas. As with other population overshoots in human (and evolutionary) history, the end probably won't be pretty, with massive die-offs and \\"structural readjustments\\" (to use free-market lingo) bringing the human population back into line with the Earth's carrying capacity. Heinberg's book challenges us to face this coming change NOW and to do what we can to mitigate against its worst effects through exploring and developing economical and social alternatives to the status quo.The discovery of new oil resources peaked several decades ago, according to the majority of petroleum geologists, and as it seems that discovery and production follow similar curves, it will be but a matter of years until the production of oil peaks. (For the record, this doesn't mean that we will literally run out of oil, but only that it will seem like we've run out, because it will cost more--financially and energetically--to extract and refine the oil than it is worth.) The peak in oil production won't merely have a direct impact on the automobile industry, but will also undermine the production of plastics and pharmaceuticals, of which oil is the feed stock, and will yank the rug out from under petro-intensive, corporate, \\"Green Revolution\\" agriculture. Combine these consequences with growing population and energy consumption of developing nations like China and India, and you have a recipe for seriously ugly changes. Like James Howard Kunstler in The Long Emergency, Heinberg examines various other energy sources and technologies, from natural gas to zero-point energy, and finds them all wanting in one way or another. (Unlike Kunstler, Heinberg maintains a solid faith in our flexibility as a species and in our ability to adapt.) According to this perspective, oil (and other nonrenewables) were a one-time windfall in ecological terms, and once we've passed the peak in extracting them, we will have to recognize our ecological limitations as one species amongst many struggling for limited resources.I recently read PowerDown, the follow-up to this book, and found it an excellently written, powerful and thought-provoking read. Perhaps it's because I read The Party's Over in conjunction with the contrarian book The Bottomless Well (Huber and Mills) or perhaps it's because I'm a bit burned out reading books on Peak Oil, but whatever the reason I did not find this book as compelling as its sequel. That said, it is still a better introduction to the subject of Peak Oil and to its ecological basis and implications than most others I have yet read."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"There's no question that within a decade at the most, and probably within three years, we'll be forced to begin utilizing alternative fuels to a much greater extent than today, as we will begin seeing the demand for oil exceed global petroleum production capabilities. But the doomsayers are simply poorly informed about the progress that has been made in renewables and other technologies over the past five years. Since Heinberg is so uninformed, I'll try to educate him briefly.Perhaps the most significant recent advance has been the order-of-magnitude drop in the cost of the enzyme needed to make cellulosic ethanol from waste and switchgrass. Equally important, wind energy in favorable locations is now competitive with natural gas. Also, the cost of photovoltaic has dropped by a factor of three in the past decade, and another factor of two drop in price can be expected in the coming decade, at which point it will begin to compete in select applications. Electric vehicles, using lithium ion batteries, with driving range over 250 miles, will be available within a year, and they will be competitive in major respects with gasoline hybrids. Within a few years, advanced, clean-coal power plants with CO2 sequestration will be more efficient than most coal-fired power plants currently in use today.About two-thirds of our current hydrogen production (from natural gas, which is a very limited resource in North America) is used to make ammonia and nitrates for fertilizers. We can use wind farms in the Dakotas to produce all the renewable fertilizer our nation needs (this would take about 250 GW of peak wind power). Of course, various raw materials would need to be transported to the wind farms, and the fertilizers would need to be transported out, but fertilizers are much more easily stored and transported (by rail) than hydrogen. We can easily eliminate the use of fossil fuels for fertilizers. The potential benefit is huge, both in terms of massive industrial jobs creation (over a 10 to 15-year period) and in terms of CO2 emissions reductions. Moreover, such a project would also eliminate our dependence on imported LNG and allow natural gas prices to decrease. Several excellent articles have appeared recently on advanced biofuels, including my article 'Fuels for Tomorrow's Vehicles' and one in the June issue of C&EN.;Yes, things will change, and we can expect oil to stabilize at around $60/bbl (current dollars) within a few years, but the world will deal with it. That price, along with fossil carbon taxes, will be high enough to make renewables and synfuel largely replace petroleum over the next four decades. As a result, we'll still be pumping some petroleum a hundred years from now -- albeit at a greatly reduced rate. And by the way, Heinberg is absolutely right about one thing: the energy solution will not involve hydrogen. -F. David Doty, PhD, engineering physicist"},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"I've read several articles and books on 'peak oil' and related topics, and I can assure you that this is one of the best distillations of the arguements for the dangers of peak oil to continuation of our modern way of life whether its international trade,metro transportation,jet travel, heating and air conditioning of our houses, etc. Everything about our life of relative luxury is going to change in the coming worldwide recession, and then depression and the author nails down why this scaling back of our lifestyle is almost surely going to happen and happen in a most wrenching way. He systematically breaks down the potential of various energy sources and the shortcomings in replacing the special qualities of the limited quantities of oil and natural gas. Peak oil will come soon and when it does the US and other great powers are ill equipped to transition the oil age through to the next age of power.Though I haven't finished this erudite, well researched tome I believe it's in the best interest of all Americans and world citizens to start informing themselves and our often ideological, ignorant and craven government leaders(I site New Orleans debacle)to start making this transition as smoothly as possible. The present energy bill recently passed only encourages more waste, gives corporate welfare for the industries already milking the public, creates an expansion of the greenhouse gases that are exacerbating the coalescing international trends, and gives short shrift to alternative energy sources which may be the only way to create a positive future. This book should be a wake up call."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"I'm sure that the economists would debate just about every point made by Mr. Heinberg in this (end of the world as we know it) book but the author offers justification and factual evidence for almost every claim made.Since I was born, the population of the world has grown from two billion to almost seven billion and this population explosion corresponds exactly with our industrialized society's almost total dependence on oil and coal for food production, transportation, heating and cooling our homes, manufacturing products and transporting them to market and just about everything else the US and other advanced nations do.All of this growth has been happening because we have been discovering more oil than we are currently using. This will end within 5 or 10 years and all the readily available oil on earth will be gone within 30 years. Oil shale (organic marlstone) is not the answer because it takes more energy to get the oil from the stone than the end product plus you wind up with more waste that the raw materials you started with.If we had started planning for this when OPEC shut down our supply in 1973 and part of 1974 in retaliation for our support of Israel during the Arab-Israei war, much of the coming crisis could have been avoided but we all remember what happened to President Carter when he started talking about conservation. Reagan was elected and no politician since has followed Carter's path. Now it is time to pay.The author gives us two ways to cope with the upcoming crisis: We can join the international community and try and make the transition from fossil fuels to other sources as smoothly as possible or we can continue to try and maintain our priviledged status even as our civilization falls. The United States currently has 5% of the world's population and the majority of the weapons of war.Since we are at war right now in Iraq and Iraq is supposed to have the second highest oil resources in the middle east, I believe the choice has already been made.If my father was a member of &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;, I am ashamed to admit I am a member of the worst generation. I pray that Mr. Heinberg is wrong but I am afraid that my children and grandchildren will hate each and every one of us &quot;baby boomers&quot; who wasted all these resources and left them nothing."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"I just ordered a bunch of extra copies to give to friends, and when I run out I'll order more - everyone should read this book.

And how civilization now, is threatened by the depletion of its main source of energy, oil.I got into Heinberg's work after watching The End of Suburbia, where he makes several appereances and quotes ideas from this book.My interest was mainly end of oil and energy alternatives, Party is Over goes all the way back to the beginnings, which is good, but sometimes you feel overwhelmed by so much information. Anyways the facts are good to know and definitely reinforce the concept and value of energy, mainly oil.If you are interested in having a strong fundamental understanding of energy and civilization this is definitely a book you should read. Heinberg really knows what he is talking about, all his arguments are supported with a lot of scientific evidence.I really admire Richard Heinberg's work, but Ive got to say I liked Power Down better, check it out after checking this one, or if you wanna save some money and time just get Power Down."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book since Heinberg always keeps to the facts.

In fact, I would recommend his chapters to those who are new to the topic. He then reviews the options.It is here that the book shines since he never seems to get angry, preachy or arrogant as Kunstler is sometimes. Given the immediacy, apathy and the lack of general change this is very good.This is a book that I would recommend to someone wanting to learn about this topic.

I have no expertise in the field but I find little to disagree with - we are in trouble, our lifestyle is going to change and the sooner we start dealing with it the more of our culture we can preserve. I am writing to suggest another source of information which comes to the same conclusions but is a little less alarmist and which is not mentioned in Heinberg's book nor in the Amazon lists of what others who bought this book bought. This is Energy at the Crossroads by by Vaclav Smil. It was reviewed in Nature, one of the two most respected of our scientific journals, by Michael Grubb who concludes it is \\"The most sober, thorough, and thoughtful integrated text on energy available, and it embodies core facts and some fundamental truths that any analyst of energy issues should ponder.\\" Smil is an academic who has studying energy issues for 40 years. He is less inclined to forecast than Heinberg having seen so many erroneous predictions however he is clear about the coming end of oil. He goes into more depth on energy issues, global warming, and especially the alternatives to fossil fuel (no great news). He does not have the activist impulses of Heinberg - which may of course be good or too bad depending on what it takes to change course. Smil's book is both longer and more difficult to read because of the amount of science presented and I found it well worth the effort.Since writing this review I have come across another very important book on energy policy -A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies by the Yale economist, William Nordhaus. This book looks at the trade-offs of various approaches to ameliorating global warming using computer modeling to forecast the cost and results. A gradually increasing carbon tax, maximal participation by all nations and industries and support for alternative energy research come out best. The Gore approach of stringent carbon restriction from the start ends up costing much more to reach the same results which surprised me."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"Maybe the most important book since Charles Darwin's \\"The Origin of Species\\".This volume represents THE wakeup call for a world society quite literally addicted to crude oil for its continuation, and, in most cases, it's very survival.Heinberg has done his homework, and this volume should be required reading for anyone in an industrialized nation, or one just getting started down that road. It is a proven scientific fact that within a few years, we will begin to run out of oil, and it will be pretty much gone within 5 or 6 decades. Considering that we have built our entire society around an oil economy, the implications are dire - far, far beyond not being able to drive through the coffee shop with the kids in your SUV on the way home from the mall. Alternative energy sources? Dream on - read on.The book is thoroughly researched, well-thought and organized and presents the often dissenting views at every side of this hugely important issue. It is also delightfully written and composed, and is fun and quick to read.I highly recommend this book, and I hope at least one person reads what I'm writing and buys this book.

Like the sybil from Troy Richard Heinberg alludes to in his book learned, they can shoot the messenger or just ignore the messenger but they can't avoid the future. A book predicting the fall of the Roman Empire was never published so Nero fiddled along. To quote the eminently quotable Elvis Costello \\"The truth can't hurt , it's just like the dark/ At first it scares you witless but in time you see things clear & stark.\\" Time will tell if the author The Party's Over is a soothsayer or simply the next Jim Chanos, the Enron stock analyst who dug deep and sold short.Like Kenneth Lay parking billions of dollars in debt in off shore shell companies while assuring his fold to park their cash in Enron stock, the gang holding up at 1600 Pennsylvania avenue don't want you to know the truth about energy resources. Richard Heinberg is telling us about fossil fuels what Arthur Anderson never told us about Enron, the end of abundant cheap oil is near. Far from being a doom sayer of apocalyptic proportions, he analyzes the fine print and finds the devil in the details. First prices will rise dramatically, then world wide debt will swell to unserviceable levels and finally the century long party thrown by the bones of the dinosaurs will wind down. Most politicians will deny it, of course. No politician will be willing to do a Jimmy Carter until the sun comes up. I'm going home early to prepare because Rome didn't fall in a day. Richard Heinberg may not be a hero but he surely will not play second fiddle to today's Nero's. Read this book, share this book. Read this book twice."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"This book attempts a grand scope: to illuminate the energy supply and demand forces, analyze their effects long-term, and offer solutions for minimizing the negative impact. Unfortunately, there are far too many instances where statements are made that are unsupported by the evidence presented. Another 100 pages or so were needed to fully make an attempt that all of these assumptions are valid.In spite of that major shortcoming, the author succeeds where itcounts: chapter 3 hits the mark by identifying the oil(energy)supply limitations and why an impending shortage is at near-term.This discussion correctly and carefully outlines several prominent analysts from BOTH SIDES of this debate.Chapter 4 attempts to explain why alternative energy sources willcome up short, for cost and other reasons. Chapter 5 discussesthe complexities of the domestic and international economic andpolitical realities, and why the result will grow into a dramaticchange for all societies dependent on abundant cheap energy.In the end, the case was made - and clearly.Most unfortunately, however, the author engaged in some politicalattacks that were directed mostly at the Bush family. Some ofthis liberal rant is borderline slander. The Author should havesimply stated the facts of the impending oil shortage - they arepowerful. But he just couln't resist the opportunity to smearthe people and political views of those that he disagrees with.As a result, my copy has many of my margin notes such as &quot;rubbish&quot;, &quot;slander&quot;, &quot;no evidence&quot;, &quot;lacks support&quot;, &quot;baseless accusation&quot;, and even &quot;outrageous lies&quot;.

With that came something else I hadn't done in just as long: filling up my car with gas. And this summer, at $2.25 per gallon, this was not an expense I had missed while I was at school. I also remember at one point this same summer reading about how oil had just topped over $40 per barrel and if this trend continued it could pose a major risk to the economy. It's now October, I'm back at school and I no longer have to consider gas money into my budget, which is a good thing seeing as oil has gone up to $54 per barrel. In light of all of this, and not to mention the upcoming presidential election, I thought Richard Heinberg's The Party's Over: Oil, War, and the Fate of Industrial Societies would be a very fitting book to read. In a sense, I was right; the main point of this book is to tell how not only we have developed a whole, powerful society mainly thanks to petroleum, but also the path we are headed down and the consequences we could face if we deplete this resource. In another sense however, I could've been just as happy having not read this book; the message is there, but how it is presented in the writing,, especially in parts where he offers up solutions, is overall dry, biased, and at times even absurd."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"...of bad books on the coming shortage of oil.

How many times can the same mistake be made and credibility be maintained?

Unfortunately, or perhaps I should say fortunately for mankind, these predictions were radically and irrecoverably wrong.Again the same &quot;small&quot; models trying to predict &quot;huge&quot; events appear again in this book. In addition to the lessons Mr. Heinberg could have used in Economics, this Biologist could have also used some lessons in Physics. You see, as powerful as we like to think we are, we simply cannot violate the laws of Physics, that is to say that we could spend eternity trying to destroy the matter and energy of the Earth and we'll be no closer to that goal at the end of such an enterprise than we were when we started. That's right folks . . . it can't be done.The worst we can possibly do with the matter and energy available on this planet is change its form, disperse it, move things around.

Its about the whole economy that has been built on using a non-replenishable energy supply. You know how those economists always count on the 3% growth in the GDP. Well the book argues that this long term growth is fundamentally driven by our long term growth in energy usage, which everyone knows will have to turn around at some point.The other surprizing fact is that the turning point is long before you run out of oil. Heinberg shows data that indicates that half of the oil is still left in the ground when the returns start to diminish. And it appears that that we are within a few years of reaching that point.So we've used up about half the \\"available\\" ( i.e. feasible to extract from an energy perspective ) oil. Now oil production starts to decrease. What happens next is anyone's guess, but Heinburg presents some detailed discussions on the possiblities. Don't assume that a coal, nuclear, or \\"hydrogen\\" economy are going to be as easy and profitable as the petroleum economy we are leaving behind.I've read lots of books about energy and the environment, and this is definitely one of the best."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"I've been waiting for this book for about 30 years. Back in 1970 the book The Limits to Growth told us that we were going to run out of oil and that there would be a collapse of the kind of society that we've come to know (and love or hate) by around 2050. The first half of this book updates what was said back then. And the news isn't good. If anything the basic findings from 1970 are confirmed. This analysis takes about half the book. We will not have the free wheeling oil based economy that we have now.The part that was missing from The Limits to Growth was the social aspects. Mr. Heinberg has at least made an attempt to forecast what these will be. There's an old saying that predicting the future is easy, it's being right that's hard. Mr. Heinberg's future certainly seems to be based on facts reasonably extrapolated into the future. Will he be completely right, of course not. Is his thinking a good start, absolutely.The point that I think I found most fascinating is his description of four sets of voices talking about the oil situation:Conventional free market economists -- No problem, higher prices will make us find more and develop substitutes.Environmental Activists -- Conserve because of greenhouse gasses and polution for our children's sake.Petroleum Geologists -- We are about at the peak of production and it will decline from here on.Politicians -- Generally support the economists, they don't want to go to the voters and say anything bad. Leftists think price caps and subsidies to low-income people and blame the oil companies. Rightists think eliminating environmental regulations will open vast new fields. Sounds just like our last presidential election.Mr. Heinberg is down on nuclear power because of the environmental concerns. Since the book was published the impact of the Kyoto Accords has made the elimination of greenhouse gases a requirement in many countries. In the past year the price of uranium has gone up 500%. Nuclear is just about the only practical alternative available today. While the environmentalists are concerned, the great unwashed wants power and the politicians don't want them upset."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"Heinberg's \\"The Party's Over\\" presents a thorough, understandable, and logical discussion of the history of the petroleum industry and what we need to do about the growing crisis.

This book should be widely read and discussed, NOW."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"As someone who now has the time and energy to watch current world events with interest, I have puzzled over what seem to be possible ulterior motives for our aggressive intervention in Iraq. Yet, given its rich supply of so much marker (or high quality) crude oil, this well documented book by author and academic Richard Heinberg book gives one a new perspective as to why we seem to be taking the actions we are to consolidate the stranglehold the Western world needs to guarantee a continuing and uninterrupted flow of it in its various forms. The author makes a strong and persuasive case for the notion that the world is running dangerously close to serious shortfall and consequent disruption in the overall supplies of crude oil for variety of reasons.In \\"The Party's Over\\", Heinberg threads an argument that the world is quickly running out of inexpensive oil, and that the world economy as it is currently oriented around the premise of such cheap sources of oil is about to undergo a relatively sudden sea change. In fact, he argues, within the next few yeas the high mark of such oil production will peak, much to the dismay of consistently expanding requirements for ever more total production. Given this gradual but consistently greater historical requirements for oil and its products, momentary gluts on the world market are more representative of temporary relaxation of segments of the world oil market rather than indicative of an overall trend, which slowly but surely increases from decade to decade. To wit, Heinberg argues, the Western world is about to enter a new era, one that will dramatically change the nature of international commerce and the increasingly unified world economy, in which a sneeze in Asia gives Canadians a cold.Thus, posits the author, even if the Western democracies are willing and able to initiate conservation programs and develop strategies for switching to alternative energy sources such as solar and wind power, the overall effect of the declining availability of crude oil over the coming decade or so will be to force a de-facto decline in the total availability of energy for overall consumption. Such a set of circumstances could prove to be a serious challenge to the attempts to grow the global economy, and may also seriously damage overall standards of living, especially in modern post-industrial societies like our own that are so intensively energy dependent. According to Heinberg, we may well be on the cusp of a new era as different from our current culture of extravagance and plenty as the times after the industrial revolution were from the feudal era. Yet this time the progress may be in the opposite direction.What all this represents is a massive transition placed in its proper historical context, illustrating the several ways in which our long dependence on fossil fuels and its corollary development of corporate forces with immense geo-political influence may face a fractious and much more difficult future in the face of such dwindling sources of overall supply, including the possible of resource wars in the Middle east and elsewhere as well. Given our seemingly obsession with SUVs and all the other petroleum intensive products of modern life, the impact may be one that is especially difficult and troublesome for affluent societies such as our own. This is a troubling yet quite informative book, and one I highly recommend. Enjoy! ."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"The topic of \\"peak oil\\" may be one of the most important topics in all of history. This book covers every aspect of the issue, from photosynthesis to resource wars. The book is exactly as long as it needs to be and is readable. I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it. My only complaint about the book is that the author gets a little preachy and political at the end."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"Henberg's core message is that industrial civilization is based on consumption of inherently limited energy resources that are about to become scare. Soon, each year less energy will be available, regardless of society's efforts or choices. Competition for what remains will trigger dramatic economic and geopolitical events - it may be impossible for even a single nation to sustain industrialism as we know it tody. Renewables cannot fully replicate the energy characteristics of fossil fuels, and decades will be required for their full development. The \\"bottom line\\" is that society must engage in a crash program of radical conservation to avoid catastrophe.The \\"really bad news\\" is that I doubt we will be able to undertake a successful program of radical conservation that avoids catastrophe. The reason is that it is politically far easier in the short run to pursue competitive measures for obtaining those decreasing resources - eg. Cheney's energy solutions and Bush's obstinence on the related Kyoto treaty."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"The Party's Over lays it right out there for us - we are beginning the process of running out of oil. Doubters like to say \\"That can't be true, because the all mighty market hasn't yet started creating the viable alternatives\\" (in anything like replacement level quantities). Why then, I ask, is our foreign and military policy all about putting as much of a lock down as possible, on known supplies (see e.g. Blood and Oil by Michael T. Klare)? As Heinberg well notes, the politics of democratic capitalism depend on ongoing economic growth - which is why, from the point of view of George Bush and Dick Cheney, it seems reasonable to keep our army engaged in the middle of the Iraqi Civil War, even with little hope of short term victory. Its the oil, stupid (with a bit of desperate ego mixed in). And why there is as yet no serious politics of conservation alive and well in this country.Heinberg mightily strengthens his case by framing the story of oil within the context of ecological science and industrial history. Industrial capitalist culture is behaving in a predictable way. We have had a fabulously productive oil party. As a player in this eco-system we have been on a roll. Such rolls tend not to want to be slowed by the soft voices of alarm pointing out that the highway ends at the edge of the cliff up there not so far ahead. The literal fuel to power our engines will likely run out sooner than the ideological fuel that powers our belief in this way of doing business. You hear the \\"new age\\" argument that its not the oil supply that should be our concern - that its the infinite supply of human ingenuity that's critical. What's scary to me is how this market sucks up so much of that ingenuity for enterprises like convincing us we need more of this, that and the other; like creating, using and selling ever more sophisticated weaponry around the globe; like sustaining our belief in the magic nature of capitalist markets.Heinberg mentions in his afterword to the revised edition that many readers have reported finding the book depressing. Small wonder. I was depressed at times as I read it too. But I also felt something bracing about it. If you're like me, standing on the \\"liberal - progressive\\" side of the political spectrum, but feeling that there's a missing center to our politics, I recommend you read this. There is a new politics that needs to be invented, and quickly. Ever since Stalin, et. al. gave communism a bad name, and the right wing in America made liberalism tantamount to communism, progressives have been floundering. We're trying to find a way to say that we really need to wake up, learn to take care of each other and the earth, get real about the climate and the oil -- all without saying that all this will involve serious sacrifice and some serious form of the unmentionable S word (socialism). The more information like that found in The Party's Over and other like works gets into the main stream, the more likely it is that all that human ingenuity will start driving invention in the social and political realm, where we need it every bit as much as we do in the technical."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"I purchased this as part of my catch-up research on the state of debate regarding Peak Oil.

While I do not agree with Heinberg's approach to dealing with the decline of oil, or with his predictions of what the social and political outcomes of this decline will be, his book will likely perform a useful service in making the general public more aware of the nature and imminence of the end of the petroleum age and the industrial age."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"If there's a better book than this one, on the energy crisis, then I'd like to know what it is...my advice to everyone interested in this vital topic is to just buy Heinberg's book, because there is none better (at least not as of June of 2005).There's a reason why \\"The Party's Over\\" rates 4 out of 5 stars on Amazon, and has nearly 50 reviews, though I firmly believe it deserves five full stars!If you want to know just HOW excellent this book is, I suggest you read the Amazon reviews for the book, for \\"lowest ratings\\".

The problems happen when the author strays from science into politics, sociology, history, and especially economics. Even some of his technology - engineering stuff - can be unreliable. But when he's good, he's quite good.The mind-stretch parts are particularly good in chapter 4 and some of chapter 3, where Mr. Heinberg discusses various energy technology technologies, and the concept of a \\"peak oil date,\\" respectively. Simply laying out the range of energy uses, abuses, and possibilities is a quick and excellent way to make the reader aware of the state of the planet. Since the major theme of the book, after all, is what to do when the oil supplies dry up, his sober and stark assessment is to the point. Kudos for his wish to end subsidies for oil companies, but catcalls for his equal wish to subsidize other unknown technology (p165). How about no subsidy for anybody? \\"Corporate welfare\\" hasn't done much for the regular person anyway.The major weakness in this book is one that unfortunately afflicts many on the Left. That is, comparing the theory of a system they like, with the worst actual results of the competing system they don't like. A good example on the smaller scale is Heinberg's glowing certainty about EXPECTED energy production from solar panels and windmills, vs. the listing of worst possible results and costs seen from nuclear energy reactors. On the larger scale, his clear preference for central government rule over free market forces is unsupported and irritating. The notable exception is his choice to discount our US Geological Survey findings on oil reserves, in favor of his (half dozen) gloomy retired oilmen's assessments. Things go smoother when one picks sources that agree with one's line of argument!Nevertheless, there are enough good parts in this book to make it worth reading.

This will reinforce to those who already walk lightly on the earth and to those who have no idea how life as we know is sustained and how we got here. This is the ultimate history lesson because life comes down to accessing free energy and molding it to suit us and to thrive. Only now, we have learned the hows and whys.

Even the limited, \\"specialist scale\\" awareness of it has only begun to dawn widely only in the last 2-3 years, especially in the aftermath of 9/11 leading upto the Iraq war, followed by rising oil prices. This book is a concise primer, among all the others of its ilk, that describes the nature of Peak Oil fully and clearly and its character. Heinberg does do justice here in describing its full list of implications, however I do feel that they could be stated more clearly. Peak Oil will mark an unprecedented catastrophe in thev history of the human civilisation of the present, especially in its vanguard, that is the developed countries. It has no antidote either. Oil depletion is a complete cataclysm, total in every respect, because oil forms the lifeblood of postmodern civilisation as we know it: the glamorous, advanced and yet predatory imperialist capitalist setup that has existed since the USA rose to world power after World War 2, and then defeated communism after a 47 year long \\"cold war\\" to become the world's sole arbiter. Peak Oil is welcome news, because it will bring about the utter downfall of America and the West and their system. These societies will be the hardest hit. Peak Oil is the only means that can effectively release the rest of the world from the otherwise hopeless situation of the monstrous stranglehold of the West and its relentless, greedy exploitation of the world's resources for its own thoughtless and fanatic hedonism. The postmodern, globalised West could have used its gift of surplus wealth and techno-cultural marvels to help upgrade the rest of humanity's condition, as was its primary moral responsibility. But because corporatism is immoral in that it is solely geared to base selfishness, the West prostituted its gains, by supporting their Third World crony elites' extreme and debilitating corruption, coupled with ridiculously wasteful consumerism at home. Had Peak Oil not come, this vicious cycle would have continued relentlessly, pushing the world to total chaos, war and ecological disaster till it seized up in despair and destructed itself irreparably. In this sense, Peak Oil - the grim reaper and equaliser - will deliver us in time and give us salvation by ensuring our survival, even if on a less glamorous level.

However, the demand for oil will continue to rise and the spread between falling supply and rising demand will rapidly grow, as no adequate alternative energy source will be available to cover the shortfall. Doomsday will then be at hand. The price of petroleum, and petroleum-related products (i.e., just about everything) will skyrocket; transportation, communications, agriculture, indeed, every major industry in the world, will sputter to a standstill; the world economy will stagger and collapse; civil authority will dissolve; and the noisy, messy experiment that was industrial civilization will expire in a world-wide bloodbath, or \\"die-off,\\" that will reduce the human population by 90 percent, or more, and will leave the planet devastated, ruined, and, quite possibly, dead.It would be easy to dismiss this apocalyptic vision as alarmist nonsense if only the \\"Peak Oil\\" proponents weren't so bloody convincing. By and large, they are a sensible, reasonable-sounding group of Cassandras, who dispense their grim forecasts as soberly as the subject allows. Virtually all of them rely upon the pioneering work M. King Hubbert, a research geophysicist who, in the mid-1950s, created a model to estimate the productive life of energy reserves. In 1956 Hubbert used his model to predict that oil production in the continental United States would peak sometime between 1966 and 1972. U.S. oil production did , in fact, peak in 1970 (and has declined by 50 percent since), and Hubbert and his forecasting model, dubbed \\"Hubbert's Peak,\\" passed into the arcane lore of petroleum geologists. Other petroleum scientists have refined Hubbert's model and have applied it to global petroleum reserves. Although results differ depending upon the variables used by different researchers, the consensus is that the \\"Hubbert Peak\\" of worldwide oil reserves will occur sometime between 2004 and 2007. In other words, as I sit at my keyboard writing this review the high noon of petroleum-based industrial civilization may have come and gone, and the whole human enterprise may be inexorably descending into twilight and darkness. Sic transit gloria mundi - with a bullet.If the Cassandras are right, and the end of the world is imminent, it has received remarkably little coverage in the conventional media, although the internet hosts many excellent websites that the curious or concerned citizen may consult to learn as much as he or she would like about the post-petroleum world to come. Recently this state of affairs has started to change, and several good books have been published on \\"Peak Oil\\" and its consequences. First among these, is Richard Heinberg's &quot;The Party's Over,\\" a sober, detailed contribution to the literature, which clearly and fluently describes the fossil fuel bender the industrial world has been on for the past 100 years, and what we can expect to follow from it. Although Heinberg does his best not to induce white-knuckled panic in his reader, the picture that emerges from his book is absolutely frightening, particularly the notion that, at this late date, we can do nothing to prevent the catastrophe from occurring. At best - that is, if the entire human race sets aside all its disputes and immediately mobilizes its combined efforts to solve this one problem - the scale of the catastrophe might be reduced. At worst, in 50 to 100 years time, the greatest disaster in human history will have taken place, and the relatively few survivors of this disaster will dwell in a stateless, Hobbesian world that will make present-day Liberia look like Shangri-La.Or so the argument runs. Perhaps Heinberg and the other \\"Peak Oil\\" prophets are wrong. Perhaps Hubbert's model is defective and world oil production will not peak tomorrow, or next week, or next year. Perhaps the USGS's estimate of world oil reserves is correct and the peak of production will not occur until 2020. Perhaps a previously overlooked, gigantic new field, the equivalent of three or four Saudi Arabias, will be discovered and delay the peak until the early years of the 22nd century. Perhaps. But the point is, Heinberg et al. will inevitably be right someday. Someday, worldwide production of cheap, high-grade crude oil will peak, and the longer that peak is delayed, the more horrific the following decline will be, unless the nations of the world take immediate action to prevent the disaster. This preventive action will entail much more than just developing an adequate replacement for cheap petroleum; although, as Heinberg makes clear, no alternative currently on the drawing board appears to be sufficient. Rather, if we are to avoid the catastrophic consequences of \\"Peak Oil\\" we will have to drastically rearrange our affairs - politically, economically, socially. Or, to be blunt, capitalism, certainly as it is currently practiced, will simply have to go. Unfortunately, it is difficult to conceive of a socio-economic system less capable of dealing with the coming crisis than neo-liberal capitalism. But there it is.Of course, if Heinberg and the other proponents of Peak Oil are right, time has already run out for Petroleum Man, and there is little that can be done to avert doomsday. We shall see. This morning (March 5, 2004) the front page of USA Today warns that record gasoline prices will continue to rise, and there is a likelihood of gas shortages this summer. The \\"Nation's Newspaper\\" also reports that the loss of 2.1 million jobs in the USA during the last three years appears to be permanent. Both of these developments fit neatly into the predictions of \\"Peak Oil.\\" One thing is certain: we live in interesting times. Anyone who wants to learn just how interesting these times are is well advised to read and ponder \\"The Party's Over.\\" We've been warned. Will we act?"},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"This volume begins with a discussion of what energy is and how it has been used to develop our industrial way of life. Brief histories of wood, coal, and oil use are also included. Much of this book centers around the amounts of oil, coal, and natural gas remaining to be harnessed in the future, with several experts giving their predictions for the peak production of the world production of oil, not far away by most accounts. The United States had it's oil production peak in 1970 (predicted in 1956 by M. King Hubbert) and has been in decline since, with a slight temporary increase in the 1980's due to Alaskan oil.As Richard Heinberg emphasizes continually in this book, the decline in world oil production seems imminent, along with the ensuing decline in national industrial economies which rely on oil, the United States being by far the biggest example. Per capita energy use by Americans is five times the world average, Heinberg writes, and he makes it abundantly clear that this waste and extravagance cannot continue much longer, and no number of Iraqi type excursions will make a difference. Heinberg writes that this decline of energy availability and use can be achieved peacefully with individual countries cooperating with each other, or violently with nations squabbling over the remaining oil. However, one thing stands out very clearly now, back in the 1970's during the initial problems with energy shortages due to the Arab oil embargo, it should have been a wake-up call to our leaders to develop sustainable energy sources then, it was not done, our short-sighted leaders failed us. But as Heinberg says, corporate leaders are also at fault, with their massive self-interest at risk, they could make less money if the country shifted more to alternate energy sources, and their lobby is very strong on Capital Hill in Washinton, D.C.. If that alternate energy program was began on a massive scale in the 1970's we would probably be in much better shape now, in terms of our energy future, but as Heinberg states in this book, at this late stage our options are limited. The massive industrial military machine the United States has is given attention here also, as Heinberg writes, this massive allocation of resources can and should be directed to more pressing concerns, the citizens of the United States do not need a military budget that equals the rest of the world combined (we are'nt going to fight the Soviets, that is now clear).This volume also covers alternate energy sources today, and what they can do to help us in the future, again, as Heinberg says, we have began with too little and too late to prevent a collapse of our industrial way of life. How large of a collapse will it be? No one is certain. Heinberg also touches on the subject of overpopulation and immigration. Did you know that approximately 90% of the population growth in the United States over the next 50 years will be due to immigration? This is an area that has been neglected, and as Heinberg says, it is politically sensitive and politicians rarely stick their necks out in areas such as this. Also, in terms of overpopulation, have we, due to the use of oil in creating a large world food supply, exceeded the carrying capacity of the planet? This is another area Heinberg writes much about.Heinberg envisions, after the world oil supply peaks and begins it's inevitable decline, a slower paced, more idyllic lifestyle, and as he says, probably a more agreeable one, at that, to most people."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"...to get a little tilling done before someone steals and eats her.I chose this book for my second read on this subject because it has the highest ratings (on subject) on Amazon. Heinberg has done a thorough job of discussing every aspect of the coming problems to society due to a lack of petroleum - most of which I had never considered. Literature about this are from the point of view of either the politician, the economist, or the geologist. He takes the view of the geologist and the future does not look good.I hold a more positive view: that human ingenuity will prevail - but I could easily be wrong. In any case, this is a worthwhile read for anyone. Of particular interest is the chapter that deals with alternate energy sources. The next time you read about an alternate energy source in the news, you'll remember the real pro's and con's from an expert.Quick synopsis of 41 page alternative fuel chapter from \\"Party's Over:\\"Natural Gas: Cannot be shipped from overseas easily like oil - is more difficult to extract economically every year - is being depleted like oil. In view of the precarious status of North American gas supplies, any attempt to shift to NG as an intermediate fuel would waste time and capital in the enlargement of an infrastructure that will soon be obsolete.Coal: Shortage not so much a problem, however, its EROEI (Energy Return On Energy Invested) and pollution are a problem. As the richer seams are exhausted, it may cease to be a useful energy source within only 2-3 decades.Nuclear: Electricity from existing nuclear plants is inexpensive, but only if direct costs are considered. When adding in plant construction, safety, reactor decommissioning, and waste storage - nuclear power is very expensive indeed. There are currently 442 reactors operating worldwide. France in the only country in Europe still building them. Only Asia expects to expand significantly. Only a few of the highly touted fast breeder reactors have been built, and they have proven to be prohibitively expensive. The US currently processes enough uranium to fuel existing US reactors for the next 40 years. The mining process is wasteful, polluting, and dangerous. When all things are considered, the EROEI on nuclear energy is fairly low and there is significant intangible downside.Wind: Of all renewables (not depletable), wind power usage on a global scale is being developed the fastest. Technology has advanced - it no longer kills birds because it uses slower fan speeds and the fans are mounted on a vertical axis. It can operate in more variable wind speeds and the cost is declining rapidly. Soon your own equipment could be bought and used on your own property. Wind has the best EROEI and Germany leads the world in its usage. On a large scale, wind power would require vastly new infrastructure, but it is the most practical alternative so far.Problem: cannot easily be converted to fuel transportation and agricultural needs.Solar: Technology advancing rapidly, photovoltaic the best so far. Research is advancing into diverse methods of collection, including such easy methods of application as solar buckyball collectors incorporated into house paint. Tremendous potential, would need new infrastructure.Problem: cannot easily be converted to fuel transportation and agricultural needs.Hydrogen: For now, the process of hydrogen production always uses more energy than the resulting hydrogen will yield. For one thing, hydrogen is not an energy source, but an energy carrier. It's production depends on continued usage of the dwindling supply of natural gas. There is new technology, however, and reason to be optimistic. As with wind and solar, a whole new infrastructure, requiring time and investments of huge amounts of money and energy technology are necessary. Like wind and solar, hydrogen fuel cells should be central features of our plans to phase out petroleum. We should be dramatically increasing these investments.Hydroelectric: In many regions of the world - and especially in the US - it is already thoroughly exploited.Geothermal power, tides, and waves: limited application in limited regions of the world.Biomass: wood burning - pollution and limited resources in a world with 6 billion people - imagine the world being one big Easter Island.Ethanol: costs more energy to produce than it eventually delivers to society. Brazil is the poster child, but is burning down rain forests to grow sugar cane.Cold-Fusion: pseudoscienceConservation - Efficiency and Curtailment: Will be crucial in cushioning impacts from the depletion of oil. But it is not a panacea - even when you ignore cheaters (individuals and countries).Saudi saying: My grandfather rode a camel. My father rode in a car. I fly a jet airplane.

Most Americans have known for years of risks associated with dependence on &quot;foreign oil&quot;, but few Americans know that the critical point in human use of oil as an energy source is upon us. Few Americans ever heard of Hubbert's Peak in terms of American oil production, much less world oil production. Thus, industry and government have been able to use aspects of the truth (there is still one trillion barrels of recoverable oil underground) to obfuscate a critical fact -- the end of the entire age of oil as a primary fuel for human industry is within sight.This fact has enormous (world altering) ramifications, as Heinberg demonstrates in his well-researched book. Foreign policy, domestic policy, ecology, wildlife conservation, and the entire American &quot;way of life&quot; are at issue. The information offered in this book is certainly known by government officials and undoubtedly has a direct influence, a primary influence, on the War on Terrorism, the War on Iraq, the U.S. Stock Market, and, increasingly on public debate in the U.S.The fact that the U.S. Government, under administrations of either party, have not provided knowledge of the issues discussed in this book speaks poorly of the future of American democracy, and the absolute, dire need for American to educate themselves by reading this book and others like it.To his credit, Heinberg explores opposing and alternate views of the data that support his conclusions. Rather than deny or ignore the alternate views, Heinberg explains them and persuades the reader by virtue of superior argumentation. This adds to his credibility, while diminishing the credibility of the doubters of his arguments.In the current War on Iraq and War on Terrorism, many Americans and other citizens of the world found governmental explanations for precipitate U.S. military actions to be of doubtful authenticity and perhaps indicative of some hidden agenda. Heinberg's book helps understand what the basis of this hidden agenda is, and his book underscores the fact that this is not a temporary situation, but tied to the ultimate depletion of oil as a usable resource for the &quot;energizing&quot; of human industry and societies.This book will be a bellweather book for the understanding of America's place in the world, and humanity's prospects for continued prosperity on a rapidly changing planet. It would be impossible to overemphasize the importance of this book."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"This is one of the best books on peak oil and the consequences to come that I have read. Heinberg goes into considerable detail not only delineating the rise of industrial societies based on fossil fuel riches (the \\"treasure found in the basement,\\" is how he phrases it), but on what is going to happen when the oil is gone. A couple of other good books are Beyond Oil: The View from Hubbert's Peak (2005) by Kenneth S. Deffeyes and The Long Emergency: Surviving the Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century (2005) by James Howard Kunstler. Kunstler in particular is in close agreement with Heinberg. For a different point of view--and an amazingly pollyannaish one in my opinion--see The Bottomless Well: The Twilight of Fuel, the Virtue of Waste, and Why We Will Never Run Out of Energy (2005) by Peter W. Huber and Mark P. Mills.When the party animals go out at night they think not of the morrow or of the headache to come. This is Heinberg's analogy except the consequences of the binge will be quite a bit worse than a headache. Note well the subtitle: \\"the Fate of Industrial Societies.\\"Heinberg hints at some possible political consequences as the oil patch begins to run dry. He notes that young people \\"will see evidence of the extravagant party their elders have thrown, while for themselves there will be only dregs left over.\\" (p. 209) They may take a sharp turn to the left (as historically happens during times of stress or deprivation), and \\"in wealthier countries (such as the US) may be branded as traitors to the cause of maintaining their nation's unequal control of global resources.\\" (p. 207) I believe there is already evidence of this as Bush tries to discredit his critics.But can it really happen that industrial society will collapse when the oil is gone? Can it really be the case that there will be horrific wars over the remaining oil in the ground? Is it true that there is no substitute for the black gold, no energy source that comes close to replacing it?These are questions that Heinberg addresses and addresses well. His conclusions are largely pessimistic, but I am not sure he is right. The slide down from Hubbert's peak may be gradual and give us time to make the switch from oil to something else. But what might that something else be? Heinberg, as other authors have done, goes through the list of possible alternatives--coal, natural gas, hydrogen, nuclear, renewables like wind, solar and biomass, etc., and comes to the dreary conclusion that economically-speaking, nothing can come close to replacing oil.One of the chilling ideas he expresses is that the current \\"Industrial Age\\" or \\"Petroleum Era,\\" now little more than two centuries old, is really just an \\"Industrial Bubble\\"; and as soon as the cheap energy is gone, humankind will revert to a pre-industrial way of life. Without the treasure trove of oil and all that it provides--not just fuel, but plastics and fertilizers, paved roads, and a myriad of other products--the planet will no longer be able to support the present population of six billion plus. Heinberg believes that a sustainable human population without oil will be closer to two billion.The least that will happen is that we will undergo a reduction in our standard of living based on the fact that whatever replaces oil will be more expensive. Conservation on a level currently unthinkable will also be required. We can all kiss our SUVs goodbye, and ask ourselves the really relevant question: how do you spell b-i-c-y-c-l-e?The point I want to make is that we can spell bicycle, and indeed it is not necessarily true that we clever humans are going to stand by and let our societies collapse and inflict a lot of pain on ourselves. My belief is that the transition to a planet on which there are fewer people living in a less energy-intensive way than is currently the case, especially in the United States, can be relatively painless and actually something to look forward to. Heinberg makes a similar point about the human value of returning to a more agrarian, less competitive way of life. But a smooth transition will require a complete re-education of society, especially of those in positions of power, corporate heads and government leaders. A public works project greater than any the world has ever seen will be required. Conservation and the use of a variety of energy sources will be required. Careful planning and cooperation will be necessary. Finally, we who have been taught to conspicuously consume will have to change our ways. Heinberg observes that \\"people currently have to be coaxed and cajoled from cradle to grave by expensive advertising to consume... If the message of this incessant propaganda stream were simply reversed, people could probably be persuaded to happily make do with less.\\" (p. 182)Right now our government is intent on securing access to what remains of the world's oil instead of working toward the inevitable time of no oil. This short-sightedness is dangerous and if we don't elect leaders who will address the problem and work toward solutions, the dire consequences spun out by Heinberg, Kunstler and others will surely come to pass. Every day that goes by with us mired in this Neanderthal mind-set increases the probability of famine, war, pestilence and brutal poverty for our children and grandchildren. If we don't act now, our legacy may very well be a return to something resembling the Stone Age.By the way, be sure to get this, the 2nd Edition of \\"The Party's Over\\" from 2005, and not the first edition from 2003. Heinberg has revised and updated the book to take into account the invasion of Iraq and other recent developments."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"The Party's Over is a good book to start with if you want a basic understanding about the Peak Oil energy discussion. It provides an holistic overview of the situation, how we got to it, and what some of the possible solutions are and possible scenarios that may result from it. I would recommend reading Hubbert's Peak before you read this book. I would also recommend you read Mr. Heinberg's follow up book: Power Down after you read The Party's Over. Also, if you are serious about informing yourself, read everything you can about Peak Oil before making up your mind about anything.If you are an experienced reader you will understand that Mr. Heinberg, like all authors, is not immune to having his own biases or personal political slants. And like all authors he can't eliminate it all from his writing. But that job of sifting and sorting has always really been that of the reader. So, ignore the critics who criticize this book because of political slants, etc. Whatever his political views are they do not detract from his basic arguments. His arguments are well-supported. He has extensive note and references. Also, ignore the critics who say the book is boring. The organization is clear and quite linear making it possible to grasp the basic concepts of a very complex and multi-dimensional subject.On average I read about 6-7 serious non-fiction books a month and in my opinion The Party's Over is the most important book I have read in some time. I think every person on the planet, but especially Americans should read this book if they want to understand the world situation and why it is the way it is. Whether or not you like what he has to say, whether or not you agree with what he has to say, whether or not you believe what he has to say is not the point. The point is that he has some very thought provoking analysis that if nothing else will make you think. And in my experience thinking rationally and analytically never hurt anyone."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"This is the most elegant book yet written to summarize work by others on the upcoming powerdown as the peak rate of oil depletion is reached. With impressive economy, the author summarizes: ecological insights into overshoot of carrying capacity (mostly from Catton's Overshoot), the collapse of complex societies (Tainter), the important observation that the constraints leading to peak extraction result from the decreasing \\"energy profit\\" of this futile treadmill (mostly from Gever et al's Beyond Oil), and that US natural gas extraction is probably at peak now with acute shortages and price jumps just ahead (see High Noon for Natural Gas). The author looks at other energy sources, noting e.g. the low profit of US coal, waste issues with nuclear power, and the controversial energy profit ratio of solar PV. He is rightly dismissive that most of these can be scaled to replace the many uses of declining oil, but his points are often superficial and easily rebutted by expert proponents of technical fixes (e.g. Megawatts & Magatons for nuclear fission). He is very good on the comprehensive impact of oil depletion. His discussion of fusion is outdated: Inertial Fusion Energy may be poised for a breakthrough in the next decade. He finishes with a watered down list of \\"things you can do\\" to prepare your community and your family for powerdown (he expands on these in his newer book Powerdown). Based on energy consumption, the best bet is to live where a car is unnecessary. He says \\"learn to grow your own food\\", but you'll need to read elsewhere how hard that is. There is nothing on energy efficiency and passive solar housing. This last section is written with more optimism than the rest of the book, much as Deffeyes did in his Hubbert's Peak. Presumably, this is to avoid a \\"survivalist\\" viewpoint. Overall, this book is not going to change skeptical minds because it is devoid of numerical arguments that, e.g. would show how small the over-hyped \\"hydrogen economy\\" will be. But it will get people to think and to explore online where the supporting evidence is overwhelming. I doubt that powerdown can be adopted as a successful political agenda; too many blowhards. There has to be a grass-roots shift off the consumer treadmill to crash the unsustainable, \\"limitless\\" global economy. The author echoes Klare's Resource Wars, making it clear that the sooner we recognize the resource basis for global turmoil, the better the slim odds that we won't pursue endless wars against \\"terrorists\\" who just happen to live atop the fuels we crave."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"Once upon a time there was an oil crisis. That was the 1970s. Then oil prices went down, availability seemed assured, and so it was thought the crisis was solved. But of course oil is non-renewable, so this was just wishful thinking -- whistling in the dark. Now 9/11 has woken some of us back up to the reality of our situation -- metaphorically hurtling toward a cliff at an accelerating velocity.The guts of Heinberg's presentation is a summary of the projections of the oil geologists. Following Hubbert, they use the best information on reserves to estimate the global peak for oil some time in the next few years, probably by 2010. Some see this as alarmist (see my review of Vaitheeswaran'sPower to the People), but the mainstream estimate is only a decade further off, at 2020. The world is going to become an uglier place than it already is after Hubbert's Peak -- prices will go up, and wars for control of oil and gas (ie, Afghanistan, Iraq) will certainly intensify as the demand is still increasing exponentially both in the rich countries and the industrializing countries such as China and India.So what do we do? Heinberg does not flinch from a hard-headed examination of the limited options. He applies a physics analysis of EROEI (energy returned on energy invested) to such possibilities as solar, wind, geothermal, hydrogen, nuclear and others. His conclusion is that there is currently nothing that is likely to make energy available at nearly the same EROEI as oil and gas once they run out. A tragic \\"what might have been\\" is his observation that if we had taken concerted action beginning in the 1970s, we might have had time to use the remaining fossul fuels to fuel the building of a renewable solar/hydrogen infrastructure that would have made possible in principle a long, prosperous, ecologically sustainable, civilized planet. It may well be too late.This is no reason not to try, though. In the best-case scenario, there's no collapse and we minimize global warming by shifting to renewable energy. And better than the worst-case crash scenario is to urgently develop renewable energy, thus providing some cushioning for the crash that will come as we run out of oil. Reducing the size of a huge neomalthusian catastrophe (measured in millions or hundreds of millions of people dead, and ecosystems and species lost) may not seem like much of a choice, but it may be all we've got. CARPE DIEM!See my list THE CLEAN/RENEWABLE ENERGY REVOLUTION for much more on the issues of oil and energy.

The author considers various consequences and scenarios for the post \\"Peak Oil\\" world, and does a thoughtful and sobering job of it. He flirts a bit with the \\"die-off\\" school of thought, which suggests that the world's population is going to be drastically reduced after peak oil has hit. (Let's pray that it isn't.) Whether or not you agree with Mr. Heinberg, this book will help you think through the implications of the down-side of Hubbert's curve, and make you ponder dozens of actions you might take to prepare for it. By the way, there's a really fantastic, hard to get, DVD called, the \\"End of Suburbia\\" that some Canadians put together that has some spine-tingling interviews with numerous \\"Peak Oil\\" authors (including this one) that you should buy if you're interested in the subject."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"Notice how almost all of the criticism of the book is not directed at what is said in the book but at some doomsayers from 30 or so years ago. Since the 1970's technology has given us a much better handle on what we have in the ground. We know from such innovations as 3-D seismic mapping that only 40% of the world's land and oceans have any potential for oil discovery and that there is a 50% chance that less than 1 trillion barrels of recoverable oil are in this 40%. This is something we had no clue about before the 1990's. As technology has enabled us to become more efficient at extracting the oil we know we have, it has ominously showed us how little is actually left. Heinberg's greatest success is in showing how the energy returned must exceed the energy spent when analyzing a source of energy. Hence it does not matter how cheap all these renewables get. Since oil is needed to build solar panels and ethanol plants and nuclear plants, we will not have enough cheap oil to upgrade the infrastructure in time to prevent a collapse."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"This book brings to the forefront something that we all knew was bound to happen...the end of oil.

But I wish that readers be patient an look past the author's slant and look at the essential argument and message and then you will be presented with a very plausible scenario of events to befall most of us in our life times.How accurate his scenarios will only proven in the future -- there are probably other plausible scenarios, but the plausibility of his scenario will require use to think deeply of our society, its future and what we are going to do to adapt to this plausible crisis."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"Prognostication is a tricky business, just ask Cassandra.

To quote the eminently quotable Elvis Costello \\"The truth can't hurt , it's just like the dark/ At first it blinds you but in time you see things clear & stark.\\" Time will tell if the author is a soothsayer or simply the next Jim Chanos, the Enron stock anylist who dug deep and sold shortLike Kenneth Lay parking billions of dollars in debt in off shore shell companies while assuring his fold to park their cash in Enron stock, the gang holding up at 1600 Pennsylvania avenue don't want you to know the truth about energy resources. Richard Heinberg is telling us about fossil fuels what Arthur Anderson never told us about Enron, the end of abundant cheap oil is near. Far from being a doomsayer of apocalyptic proportions, he analyses the fine print and finds the devil in the details. First prices will rise dramaticly, then debt will swell to unservicable proportions and finally the century long party thrown by the bones of the dinasours will wind down. Many will deny it.

And, he provides amble references so anyone interested can retrace his analysis and draw their own conclusions.This is a Must-Read for anyone interested in current world events (ie. Iraq).

In it he predicted a catastrophic future in which overpopulation would destroy human civilisation as we know it. By 1970, he was predicting that, after decades of famine, decline and anarchy, the year 2000 would see the American population shrink to 22.6 million and tens of millions would be starving across the globe. In reality, America's population in 2000 was around 280 million, or about 13 times that predicted by Ehrlich. The proportion of the world's people starving or hungry remained unacceptably high - but lower than at any point in human history.I remember my first atlas, as a child fascinated by geography, in the early 1980s, which stated plainly that the world's oil supply would run out in 1999. Instead, oil reserves are larger than they were in 1980.In fact, those nightmare stories of the '70s and '80s were only part of a long trail of horror stretching back to Malthus, and beyond to ancient myths warning man of the moral perils of wealth and greed. Perhaps they reflect that part of the human soul which has produced wonderful monastic traditions in all the great religions - that longing for a simpler, more harmonious life. However, the scientific rationale behind them remains perilously weak.And so to Professor Heinberg's book - please take the more hysterical predictions with the large pinch of salt that, given the history of eco-disaster literature, they surely deserve. Heinberg's claim that 4 billion people will die before the Earth reaches a sustainable population is the same old Malthusian myth trotted out all over again. With human population growth slowing dramatically and now likely to plateau within half a century, it is entirely possible that we can stabilise our population at a sustainable level without catastrophe. But that doesn't sell books!Heinberg's claims of widespread devastation of trees, to the extent of suburban avenues being denuded, also seems a little bit over the top. There is still a lot of untapped oil in the world, and some rich countries with substantial reserves, notably the USA and Canada, have greatly cut drilling due to the high local production costs. Similarly little exploration yet takes place in the Middle East, while oil still all but bursts from the ground spontaneously in places like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Undoubtedly more oil will be found for some time, giving us a considerably greater breathing space than Rhienberg claims. And research into alternative energy continues to produce results. With more goodwill both from the general public and governments, there is no limit to what we can achieve.While deforestation in the rainforests is worrying, deforestation isn't a one way street, as I can attest as a citizen of a country (Ireland) which is considerably more forested than it was a century ago.More worrying than this exaggeration is the deeply authoritarian and anti-poor vein running through the book. Not only will we in rich countries, according to Professor Heinberg, need to radically change the structures of our economies, industries and societies, but poor countries such as China will have to 'forego' industrialisation to save the planet. I wonder how they're going to do that without some sort of particularly grotesque display of American military power of the sort that Heinberg - rightly - detests? While it may be difficult for University Professors in the world's richest country to grasp, there are a lot of people in the world, even in rich countries, who have a pretty horrible standard of living. I'm sure it's easy for Professor Ehrlich to talk about the joys of tending his vegetable patch, but he's not exactly as dependent on it as the average Malawian peasant farmer, or large Californian family surviving on a single minimum wage earner. You can't give everybody a decent standard of living without a bigger world economy than we have at the moment, and wealth generates both the sort of environmental conscience and technological development we need to make the planet a better place to live on.I'm sure many people are clicking the unhelpful box as we speak and tagging me as a right-wing loony. Bear in mind, I'm an anti-War, non-car owning, bicycle commuting, small flat-inhabiting person working in a non-energy intensive sector of the economy. I have no axe to grind here. I just don't like being panicked for no good reason. When I've been panicked about the same things all my life and they never happen, I start to get suspicious.How many times will the phone have to ring late at night before we realise it's a hoax caller?"},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"I appreciate the book's attempt to use metrics. We need this sort of analysis. But I think it gets sometimes off track and its use of the statistics is a little tendentious. The geopolitical element is relevant, but some Republican voters have posted that its pot-shots at Bush and others are gratuitous. I personally agree with the author that Bush and his party are a huge part of the political problem, but I must concur with these reviewers that I wish the author hadn't put that in. It's not relevant to the underlying science, and I think it turns off many conservative and libertarian readers on an issue which we all will need them to help solve, too. Even if the government is not the main player in the resulting solution, entrepreneurs of any political stripe are certainly needed in the world of renewable and distributed power generation. Everyone's butt may be on the line. The author unfortunately deals with each alternative in Siskel-and-Ebert fashion (thumbs up, thumbs down). He doesn't entertain the possible average EROEI if (imagine!) we tried to use all available solutions at once, in desperation, something I imagine would be more likely than not in his scenario. The author is dismissive in general about the big unknown factor: new technologies improving the efficiency of some of his dismissed alternatives-- especially in a crisis when more heads would be deployed to solve the problems. As with most prognosticators, he ignores at his peril the rather large risk that the future won't be as he forecasts. We can't assume these advances will magically occur-- they may not, and his thesis that we are at risk right now is totally sensible, as is basing all of your EROEI numbers on current technology. But I think it would be more scientific to add a big caveat about \\"all other things being equal\\", and discuss this possibility in the conclusion. It is, after all, a possible hope, and something to invest in also. He presents the book as though it's guided by science alone. Then he dismisses across the board all power sources that aren't 100% renewable/clean. His conclusions could be correct. But it also happens to fit the ideological position he expresses elsewhere, and I am skeptical about the sheer likelihood of a perfect harmonic convergence between his ideology and his science. There's just no gray in that part of the analysis. I don't think he does this because he consciously wanted to indoctrinate us with \\"leftist\\" thinking, as some charge, but I think his preference for [frankly] the more environmentally preferable technologies biased him toward reviewing them more favorably and vice versa. As examples: biodiesel and ethanol may take energy to produce, but a fair analysis would include statistics minus the energy the farmer was using anyway to grow his corn or whatever was the input to the process. He doesn't mention thermal depolymerization, which generates new petroleum by pressurizing and heating biomass (and thus extends the \\"party\\" and throws off the thesis of the book). I also hate nuclear power, but the author calculates its EROEI based on today's plants, which he notes are rarely operational. I could be wrong, but don't the public opposition after 3-Mile Island and the constant protests and shutdowns comprise the lion's share of the reason for poor plant productivity? Regardless of what he thinks is politically possible (or terrorism-proof, etc.) today, he should at least give us an EROEI figure that relates to what's scientifically possible in the best case scenario, too. Opposition might change if we had no oil alternative and new reactors were meltdown-proof breeder reactors far from centers of population. If we don't want that (and, with 5 nuclear subs rotting away in the Atlantic as we speak, we shouldn't), we should at least be forewarned in case we are caught deer-in-the-headlights and we learn suddenly then that's our only productive alternative energy source, and our alternative is to lose our wasteful bourgeois lifestyle. One thing I do appreciate is it ignores the prevailing, glib \\"hydrogen\\" discussion which our society is carpet-bombed by in books like \\"the End of Oil\\", which spins hydrogen as though it is an abundant, mineable source of energy, which it isn't. In all, this book is a great first start on the subject, a great introduction to the topic, and definitely worth reading.

(LOL , LMAO)"},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"The book is well-written and easy to understand. Basically, the world oil production is set to reach an all-time high around the year 2008. But this is a bad thing, since oil production is going down forever after the peak. There is going to be a worldwide scramble for the remaining half of the world's oil resources, resulting in an &quot;Oil Crash&quot;. This phenomenon known as &quot;peak oil&quot; has a growing number of proponents among prestigious geologists.But not all is bad news. There are several alternate sources of energy, such as Solar, Wind and Nuclear. Moreover, there is a new technology called &quot;Thermal Depolymerization&quot; or TDP which can convert any organic material into oil with an output-to-input oil ratio of 5.7 (One gallon of oil plus organic waste can make 5.7 gallons of oil). There was an article in May 2003 in the DISCOVER magazine about TDP titled &quot;Anything into oil&quot;. TDP is slowly coming into mainstream commercial production with the help of billionaire investors such as Howard Buffett (Warren's son), so there is hope after all.Unfortunately, the author wants everyone to &quot;BELIEVE that all hell is going to break loose after oil production peaks&quot; -- and panic, rather than give several scenarios (such as implementation of Solar, wind, TDP) that can pan out in the future. I can believe in the author being an expert on oil production, but his claim to understand the details of the alternate sources of energy without answering the proponents of those fields -- such as the economic viability of TDP, which is making waves -- is not believable."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"Like many (perhaps most) books related to the environment, this one suffers from the passion of the author. It's a sort of paradox, I suppose. If you're excited enough about the subject to bother writing a book, you may be too excited to write an objective book.Heinberg does a pretty good job of presenting geological data and will likely convince you that oil production is going to peak sometime in the next decade. There is little explanation of the methodology behind this conclusion, though, so if you're interested in calculations, you may want to look elsewhere.Most of the remainder of the book relates the author's prediction that the reduction in petroleum availability is going to cause an unprecedented catastrophe for humanity and a massive die off of the world's population. His support of this conclusion, though, is kind of convoluted and reminded me a bit the whole Y2K thing.Essentially, Heinberg contends that we will use virtually all the world's oil in an irresponsible frenzy and that it will then be too late to switch to alternate energy sources because you need oil to create the infrastructure. This will lead to the end of the world as we know it. Let's think critically about this prediction for a moment:According to simple observation and every economist on the planet, increased scarcity will cause higher prices. And higher prices will gradually make the transition to conservation/alternate fuel sources desirable for the consumer and profitable for the provider. In fact, Heinberg makes a point of telling us that in the past humanity has always moved to new fuel sources as the old ones became scarce or the new ones proved superior. Thus, we meandered from human to animal to wood to coal to petroleum. But that's it. According to him, for some unstated reason and with all our technology, we can never do it again.So, with less energy, we won't have the capacity to feed and warm as many people, and therefore many of us will die. Of course, this opinion seems to have little basis in reality.I mean, if I wanted to play the devil's advocate, I could reasonably argue that:1: The relationship between population density and energy availability is actually inverse (China and India vs the U.S. and Europe.)2: That the demise of oil will cause an enormous economic boom as entire industries relating to conservation/renewables start gearing up.3: A significant decrease in the quantity and processing of US food supplies, in combination with an increase in the need for human powered transportation, could actually have a positive affect on health care costs and life spans in the U.S.Seriously, what's the real worst-case scenario here? Probably that, out of pure laziness, we'll just build 500 nuclear power plants and run our SUVs on hydrogen.Of course, Heinberg would argue that the nuke thing is morally unthinkable, but let's face it, Americans are not going to doom themselves to starvation over some vague ecological qualms. Gas is the cheapest fluid in the U.S. other than tap water, and we're already considering drilling in the Alaska Wilderness, for God's sake.Don't get me wrong, the book's entertaining, as all good apocalyptic visions are. But does anyone really think we're all going to be living the life of Mad Max in twenty years? Of course not. If we did, we'd be cashing in our 401ks for guns, solar panels, and composting equipment.So, in a nutshell, if you're up for a fun beach read, buy this book. If you're interested in realistic insight on how the world is going to adapt to severely reduced petroleum availability, keep searching."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"This book contains some interesting factual content. But to get to that content you have to wade through a lot of unsubstantiated opinion and left wing drivel.

It is the most bleak opposite. Indeed, it seems as though we are headed into a two-hundred year dark age of wars over energy supplies. The author backs this grim view with dozens of statistics and arguments--not that he is in favor of this outcome, but he does fancy himself a realist.This book feeds into survivalist theory--that is, he who controls energy will control the world. From the author's point of view, it is not likely that our civilization will survive in any recognizable form. One of the most telling graphs concerned the prediction that human life will decrease from about 9 billion persons to about 3 billion persons within a hundred years of the exhaustion of oil.Realists will love this book; depressed persons will avoid it; and most of the world will not think about the consequences of exhausting almost all fossil fuels in the next several decades.

When is it going to happen? The researchers at Uppsala University give 2008 as their latest estimate. But what happens afterwards - can our civilization survive? I am certain that there exists a clear answer to this important question, but I don't think I have found it in Richard Heinberg's book.While The Party's Over in well argued and seems to be replete with scientific data, the author clearly exhibits his extreme bias in at least one area: nuclear power. For Heinberg nuclear technology is anathema, and it would be a disastrous error to turn to nuclear power when energy shortages arise due to the depletion of fossil fuel (p.139) - yet Heinberg has not answered the essential question: could nuclear power - in terms of energy that can be produced - provide a substitute for fossil fuels? Or is nuclear power just something to be avoided at all cost, because it is inherently evil and anybody who even thinks of increased use of nuclear power must be an evil-doer in league with the nuclear lobby?I do not believe that nuclear power alone can support our civilization of waste after the Hubbert's Peak. But Heinberg's biased treatment of nuclear power (an area of technology which I happen to know something about) makes me wonder: has Professor Heinberg been short-changing us on other issues too?We need an objective, well researched book on our energy alternatives after the inevitable Hubbert's Peak. Unfortunately, The Party's Over does not seem to be it."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"I majored in Mineral Economics 25 years ago at the University of Arizona and we studied energy economics at length. Other than technological updates there is no new information in this book, it is literally a repeat of what I studied back when hand held calculators were &quot;new&quot;.From a positive prespective Professor Heinberg introduces the reader to energy, ecological systems, and their resulting carrying capacity. He also uses Net Energy so a surrogate for the market to determine the value of energy produced. However, I think there is some &quot;double counting&quot; of energy costs.From a negative perspective his political comments such as &quot;Though it is an empire in steep decline the US . . .&quot; (pg. 191) detract from a fairly serious subject. Large complex societies like the US just don't roll-over and die when the going gets tough.All-in-all I found the book to be nothing new, I studied the same stuff 25 years ago.

The laws of thermodynamics say that total entropy, i.e. disorder, can only increase. Thus we are doomed, and only the details need be sorted out. The earth, of course, is not a closed system. The sun shines on the earth producing not only solar energy directly, but producing wind and growing plant life that can be used for fuel. This is so obvious, that the author's credibility is reduced to zero by his \\"closed system\\" claim.I don't doubt that oil production is in decline, but it is a slow decline because new technology makes it possible to economically extract more and more oil from oil fields. In the near term, what we mainly have is coal-to-oil conversion (the US has about 200 years worth at current oil consumption levels), oil shale conversion (much larger amounts), and nuclear energy (about 5000 years supply). On the near horizon (perhaps 25 years) are cellulosic ethanol (made from wood chips and inedible vegetation) and solar electric. Further out there is fusion power and solar energy from space transmitted to the ground by microwaves.The common thread of doomsayers is that they do not understand technology, and more importantly, how economics interacts with the development of technology. There will be interesting events as the world shifts away from oil to alternatives, a process likely to be played out over the next fifty years, but the end of the world scenario is nonsense."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"One of the best books I have read this year.

Much like his other titles, he does not hesitate to call a spade a spade. Would that more writers and commentators would follow his lead in communicating so directly. This effort is among those texts that should be required reading on this topic. It is indispensable.Heinberg goes at great length into what has precipitated our predicament and he treats options and alternatives in a straightforward and easy to understand manner. He starts by laying a foundation for how the world as we know it has come to be, namely in relation to the enormously generous geological gift we call oil (and other carbon fuel sources). He lays out the trends in oil discovery and its acquisition and how the theorem (or fact) of Hubbert's Peak plays into our current conundrum.Alternative energy sources is given more than adequate treatment, ranging from natural gas (not entirely a true alternative) to nuclear power, biodiesel, and many others. Heinberg wraps it up by a treatment of the consequences on a global, national, local, and individual level. The afterword concludes this effort nicely by touching on current developments in the realm of related geopolitical events. All told, after having read this book, it is no surprise that Heinberg is considered one of the foremost authors and educators on this topic.For more Peak Oil reviews: http://www.peakoilresources.com"},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"I've very much enjoyed hearing Richard Heinberg perform a lecture on the subject of Peak Oil and resource depletion. Out of all the peak oil writers I've read from, I find him the most reasonable. I've even written to him a couple of times! Perhaps he's simply mellowed over time, but I think this book has a few problems.It describes what Peak Oil is and how it relates to our society very well. The problem is that it's quite dense and could have greatly benefited from some formatting tweaks. Also, he seems to be overconfident in predicting what will happen. He does mention that it's based on present trends, but even that ignores potential social changes (some of which have occurred.)Some of his terminology is off-putting, such as his usage of the phrase \\"collapse\\". I am well aware that will be an economic contraction, but a collapse scenario i.e. Jim Kunstler's Long Emergency seems very unlikely.For the record, Heinberg is still my favorite author on Peak Oil. He is also much more reasonable than the doomer writers which act as proverbial Chicken Littles. I think his quality of writing, as well as his message delivery, has improved over the years.

The author has an incredible holistic point of view on ecology and humanity's role in macrocosmic evolution. He uses this perspective to analyze the geopolitic status and energy status of the current planetary situation. Also his elaborations on Hubbert's point that our financial infrastructure and energy infrastructure aren't 100% compatible was enlightening and provocative. Of all of the things I learned in this book, this issue got my head ensconced in thought more than any other.Now the bad part... The author, as with most radical environmentalists, seems to be overly-pessimistic. I won't go into the nitpicking, but rather than looking for ways that we will pull out of the crisis, he seems to spend his times looking for ways we'll crash and burn. The reader HAS to be aware of this, because these Crying-Wolf agendas can be addictive and easy to buy into!The author states regardless, that he is not trying to be pessimistic (he's in denial), but he is just laying out the facts and evidence to predict what will happy if our PRESENT trends continue. The thing is, the human evolutionary line isn't straight, or even a uniform curve, but an exponential growth, and quite adaptive at that, and the author seems to have little faith in old fashion human perserverence. The author even spends the first chapter delving into previous energy/economic problems throughout history and how we managed to adapt and survive. Necessity is the mother of invention?Nevertheless, there ARE valid and critical issues raised in this book (the financial vs energy infrastructure for one, and the realistic viability of hydrogen power for seconds).

The author discusses the fivestrategies we have employed, the most important being &quot;drawdown,&quot; themind-boggling rates of extraction and use of nonrenewable resources. Ofcourse the major point of the book, as surely all who have heard aboutthe book know, is that we are soon to hit what is widely being reportedas &quot;peak oil.&quot; Actually we hit peak oil production in 1979, the author states,and now, between 2006 and 2015, we will reach the point where what he callsEROEI (energy returned on energy invested) will begin to decline precipitously.EROEI is perhaps the key concept in this discussion, because as we know, therewill still be plenty of oil in the ground, the problem will be the exhorbitantcost to extract it, according to the author and the &quot;cassandras&quot; whosupport this point of view. The author uses the writings of many retired,former oil-company geologists to back up his conclusions.Mr. Heinberg then goes on to &quot;prove&quot; that not only is there not oneor even a combination of alternative sources, either renewable ornonrenewable, to replace oil, that it would also take far too long to developthe necessary infrastructures. Thus we are &quot;hopelessly&quot; dependant on oil,and it is inevitable that we are going to have to scale back our useageof oil, reduce the population drastically (by 2/3's), and live inself-sufficient communities, relying on &quot;good pair of shoes and a sturdybicycle&quot; (p. 149).&quot;The Party's Over&quot; is a great book to give to someone who is concernedand wants a basic understanding of the concerns of the book. I particularlyenjoyed Chapter 4, &quot;Non-Petroleum Energy Sources...&quot; The author demonstratesa solid knowledge of wind, hydrogen, solar, geothermal, and other powersources, though for someone already versed in these areas there isn'tmuch new. Still, the writing style is consistently first rate, and manygood references are provided for those who want the details (like me!).I also compliment the author on his even-handed style, devoid of the&quot;misanthropic invectives&quot; that some environmentalists seem to revel in!Yet I must disagree with the author's conclusions, especiallythe &quot;fait accompli&quot; of the final chapters. I have been exposed tothe kinds of predictions expressed in the book since the 1970's, andover and over (and over) I have watched prediction after predictionof this kind NOT come true. While I won't say I am a &quot;cornucopian,&quot;I simply do not believe that depleting energy resources is going tocause the scale of changes predicted here. Does anyone remember Y2K?I heard countless &quot;experts&quot; make countless predictions (I understoodthe computer aspect since I do that for a living), and as we all know,Y2K was a total non-event. Now, you might say, well, because of allthe warnings, organizations got their acts together and solved theproblem, whereas oil is nonrenewable and nothing can change that.I disagree. Y2K and other problems prove that there is somethingabout the human spirit that we seem to be able to find solutions,regardless of how all-encompassing the problems are.If something is going to take civilization down it isn'tenergy. There are countless other possibilities - earth changes,nuclear war, consciousness shifts (or lack thereof!), take yourpick, whichever insanity getting out of hand, but if we make itto peak oil, assuming the dates in the book are correct, we willfind ways to survive, even thrive, in my opinion.

It fuels our car, transports our food and goods, gives rise to our material, powers our industry, fertilizes our crops, lubricates our machines, pumps our water ... it boggles the mind.

Heinberg writes clearly from extensive research and experience that there is hope for healthy societies and economies if humankind starts quickly to make the transition to sustainable resources and technologies."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"Temporary energy sources have shaped the industrial revolution for hundreds of years. Dwindling energy supplies along with depleted resources are the consequences of the industrial market. Richard Heinberg explores the consequences and implication that result from oil extraction. The Party's Over introduces the reader to the history of the industrial era. Heinberg then gives estimates on oil reserves and extraction rates. He also examines alternatives to oil and discusses the future implications resulting from the peak in fossil-fuel production.Industrial societies started forming in America by modeling European styles beginning in the early 1900's. Oil was often found in the eastern United States mountain regions. This allowed for cheap prices and easy accessibility options. Global discovery of oil peaked in the 60's. By 1970, America was consuming more oil than it could produce. It solely relied on other countries resource supplies to fill the overwhelming demand made by the consumers.This led to intensified efforts towards energy conservation. Suddenly, people started to seek out alternative energy sources. It was a beginning of a new era that focused on the environment. People spoke openly about both social and environmental problems that related to resource consumption. However, these attitudes would dissipate with the arrival of the Reagan-Bush administration in 1980. The new administration stressed that citizens should forget their worries about energy-resource limits and consume as they please. Once again, environmental issues were dismissed and corporate America was enthroned.Heinberg bases most of his opinions around the fact that the world economy is dependent on petroleum, and that the United States has become dependent on imported oil from the Middle East. The message delivered by Heinberg is that industrial civilization is based on consumption of energy resources that are nonreplicable and will soon become scarce. He states that less energy will be available to humankind; therefore, a transition must be made to alternative sources of energy.After tracing the history of the industrial era, Heinberg touches on some specific examples of how oil consumption has peaked and why it should be of concern. From there, he goes on to say that certain alternatives will allow the industrial civilization to survive the end of oil. Examples of non-petroleum energy sources include natural gas, coal, nuclear power, wind, solar, hydrogen, and hydroelectricity. Furthermore, he stresses the ideal of conservation. By doing so, energy conflicts would be avoided and the economy would remain stable.After reading this book, one may feel alarmed. The most concerning thing mentioned in the book deals with corrupt international relations that focus on oil. It seems as though the current administration is centrally focused on oil imports. Many wars in recent years have been fought simply to gain oil. United States oil interests have destroyed landscapes and communities. Now, a new problem has arrived, the increasing level of terrorism sparked by disrupted international relations.The war on terrorism used in recent administrations allows for the takeover of certain resource-rich areas. Sometimes, America gains full control over a certain region and its oil resources. It is also concerning that our President, Vice President, and National Security Advisor are all former oil industry executives. If not for oil resources, the United States would not engage in activities in the Middle East.In the book, Heinberg clearly expresses his concern over the current administrations policy making. He realizes that the population will soon be at risk from the energy crisis. Transition should take place that shifts focus off of military spending and places it on energy research. The severity of the risks associated with the energy crisis must be looked upon. Global agreements should be signed into law such as the Kyoto Protocol. By doing so, all nations would be assured access to energy resources as well as equal opportunity towards the profits from resource exploitation.Heinberg points out that several hopeful signs towards sustainability have been seen at local levels. These issues cannot wait much longer to be dealt with. By increasing the public's knowledge on alternatives, proposals can be made that changes destructive consumption.Over the last 150 years, industrialization has allowed population to grow at the expense of the environment. It is predicted that oil will soon be scarce. Alternative energy resources must be studied which would emphasize sustainability. America must be aware of the problems associated with dependence on non-renewable resources. Soon enough, energy resource circumstances will change the way we live everyday life."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"This review of the past, present, and future roles of energy in the state of the world is remarkably clear in its presentation of the facts. While not afraid to go into some fine detail, Mr. Heinberg keeps the general topography of the situation well in view. The grim conclusions to which he arrives seem well justified by the facts he has marshalled. Even if you remain unconvinced, his insights (and his bibliography) equip one well for further research as well as for reflection on current events."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"Richard did not have to convince me about the ultimate decline in extraction rates of nonrenewable resources. But at the time of the original book, 2003, and the update, 2005, a good book to convince people might have been just the thing.I was looking more for information about what could be done to prepare for the future and I was disappointed. I don't know, perhaps I was thinking that the revised and updated edition would have more practical information about what to do to respond to a dramatically different future. I did not find it.So, if you believe that we have already seen or will shortly see peak oil and everything other nonrenewable and you want to review the facts and logic of a like-minded individual about what is going to happen and why then this might be a good book for you.If you don't believe in peak oil and want to find holes in the argument and you are thinking that a slightly dated book might be a good strawman to beat up - you might be disappointed. Richard Heinberg seems to cover the subject well - even if the recent decline in consumption during this global recession has pushed some date, that does not refute the core argument.If you are looking for what to do, how to prepare and such - then you might want to keep looking , this one is not it. Let me know if you find a good one. I'm not interested in living in a cave with a loaded rifle and 30 years of MREs, but moving to a more simplified life seems to be the rational \\"go forward\\" approach to the future.Hope this helps."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"I like Mr. Heinberg's book very much. His knowledge of the oil business and the energy world is impressive. His insight and technical knowledge is also very good in the book. However, Mr. Heinberg is a liberal democrat and is to the far left on every issue. Mr. Heinberg lives in a very simple world. Liberals are good and virtuous and conservatives are neo-facist and anyone who disagrees with the far left must be a Nazi. Of course, this puts Mr. Heinberg in the camp of the good guys. Mr. Heinberg believes that Mr. Bush (one), started the first Gulf War just to help his Oil buddies get rich. I find this explanation too simple and childlike. I find Mr. Heinberg's understanding about Saudis and the Arab People as naive. Having said this, I can overlook Mr. Heinberg's political views and taste and look at the more important message. This is a great book about energy and the future. It is an important message. This is Mr. Heinberg's best work.

Retired."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"I discovered Peak Oil in August 2006 through James Kunstler's 'The Long Emergency,' and since then I have read almost every book available on this subject, including all of Heinberg's books. I have even written my own essay for friends and family - which can be downloaded from my website at http://www.dougcraftfineart.com. This book is a great overview of the Peak Oil and energy depletion crisis facing us, and I recommend it for anyone looking for a comprehensive and thoughtful overview of this difficult subject.I have found all of Heinberg's books to be thoroughly researched, and well written, and he does offer positive suggestions for dealing with Peak Oil in this book. Other reviewers who complain of doom and gloom with Heinberg, have clearly not read some of what many other authors in this field have to offer.Whether you are a pessimist or optimist, the facts surrounding this issue and the nature of resource depletion are simply unassailable from an honest scientific evaluation. Peak Oil and energy depletion - coupled with climate change and exponentially growing population - are deadly serious issues representing the most calamitous crisis we humans have ever faced. Ever. The problem simply cannot be sugar coated.Nonetheless, I found 'The Party's Over' to offer a positive vision of our future where human communities have the opportunity to rediscover the traditional benefits of local economic interdependence and a much more sane pace of life. Until I had read Heinberg, I was truly in despair over our future. Now, I understand that we are adaptable and creative beyond what we think, we will survive, and we will all have the opportunity to help make positive contributions if we so choose."},{"Title":"The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies","review":"There are other books that I consider to be better at the over-all challenge of \\"connecting the dots\\" among cheap oil, drugs and drug money gladly laundered by U.S. banks, and war profiteering, but this book must be considered one of the finest underlying reference works that support the more speculative conclusions of others.This book provides both a solid history of how we got to where we are and why we continually dismiss the known future consequences of not providing for energy conservation and alternative energy; and it also provides a very finely presented review of what the author calls the \\"banquet of consequences\\" across transporation, food and agriculture, heating and cooling, the environment, public health, information storage and transmission, and the over-all geopolitics of oil.Had we all read this book, The Long Emergency, and Crossing the Rubicon prior to Dick Cheney's taking us to war in Afghanistan and Iraq, we would have realized that invading and occupying those two countries is about the oil catastrophe and Wall Street's need for drug money to provide liquidity (a point made in Rubicon, not in this book).Cheap Oil has been the Fool's Gold of this era. Unhappily, the fools (We the People) have ended up with our pocket's picked, and Wall Street and a few very large immoral organizations have ended up with the Gold.The party is indeed over. The only question that remains is: can we repossess the Commonwealth from those that have stolen it using profits from cheap oil?"},{"Title":"Writing CopyFor Dummies (For Dummies (Career/Education))","review":"As a marketing consultant, I frequently write and review copy. Until I started referring to Jonathan Kranz' excellent book while scribbling away, I had always been writing in a vacuum (although I didn't know it). Sure, I have a decent working sense of what to do and generally got good results, but I had never based my work on practical and proven best-practices. Now I find that I write with more confidence. I turn to chapters in the book as I work and it feels like I have a friend looking over my shoulder, giving me snappy pointers and wise advice.If you're a writing pro, you will make use of this book.

I've also been a senior copywriter for an advertising agency and worked in the creative department for a major newspaper.This is the first book on copywriting I've bought in several years, and I'm now the newest fan of Jonathan Kranz's \\"Writing Copy for Dummies.\\" Mr. Kranz has written an excellent book for the novice or pro, providing a complete, common-sense guide that covers the full range of marketing communications (including PR). Whether business-to-consumer or business-to-business, direct-response or branding, print or online, for-profit or non-profit, it's all there in an engaging writing style and easy-to-digest format.After being in the freelance trenches for many years, I know how far-flung assignments can be. It's invaluable to have an all-encompassing reference to reach for when I need knowledge in non-specialty areas. In fact, just last Friday I reviewed parts of Chapter 17 in preparation for a fundraising project with a major university.Some of the material might be a refresher for veteran marketers. As for me, I'm glad to benefit from a fellow pro's perspective on marketing and copywriting topics.

Most of the book covers B2C marketing, not B2B.All the advice is tried-and-true. If you follow it, you can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Writing CopyFor Dummies (For Dummies (Career/Education))","review":"There are plenty of how-to books on how to write copy, but I can't think of one that's as helpful and informative as Jonathan Kranz's Writing Copy for Dummies. This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to write great copy - and is also an excellent refresher for experienced copywriters who wish to re-invigorate their copy by taking a little time to review the essentials. The primary advantage of this book over other copy manuals is that it's not written expressly for individuals who wish to make writing copy their profession. Rather, it's also written for business people who don't necessarily want to be professional writers, but who need to write copy as part of their business responsibilities. As a result, it's an especially invaluable resource for small business owners who don't have the budget or inclination to hire a pro-and who, instead, take on copywriting responsibilities themselves.Kranz covers the full range of copywriting venues, whether it's direct mail, e-mail, advertising, PR, web sites and/or collateral. And in every instance, he clearly and expertly elucidates the keys to writing great copy-with how-to tips, pointers on what to avoid, nuts and bolts technical advice, and writing exercises that enable the reader to turn thought into action. Throughout the book, Kranz displays a welcome wit that nicely complements the wealth of factual information that's included-for example, he writes, \\"Telling is for journalists, teachers and stool pigeons. Copywriting is about conducting business, not distributing information.\\" Kranz also uses analogies to good effect-at one point, comparing the emotional logic of a good direct mail letter to that of a fairy tale. I'll leave the full explanation of the comparison to Kranz-but it's one of innumerable places in this book where you find yourself saying, \\"Yeah, that's an excellent point.\\" The author also references writing for different types of businesses-and gives pithy examples for hypothetical businesses such as Sugar Daddy's Car Wash, Round Table Books, Empty Nest Realty Group, DataPlus Oscilloscopes, Danny's Donuts, and so on.All told, I give this book the highest marks. Sometimes, readers need a \\"how to\\" primer on how to select the best \\"how to\\" books. My advice: If you want to learn how to be an effective copywriter, make this the one \\"how to\\" book you absolutely read."},{"Title":"Writing CopyFor Dummies (For Dummies (Career/Education))","review":"I bought this book for a good friend of mine, a skilled creative writer, but with little experience in writing professional copy.

It was as if it was written for me. The author not only touches on writing for business, but also for the political, nonprofit, and educational sectors. Kranz's personal, humorous and engaging style make the book all the more enjoyable. Overall, this is the most comprehensive book on copywriting I've come across, and I've read quite a few.

Kranz also brings a welcome dose of humor and helpful cautions drawn from long years of experience.

Kranz also gives a detailed breakdown of what goes into a direct mail package, that should be enough to get any beginning mailer off to a promising start.There are many books written about copywriting, that are aimed at business owners or the unfortunate folks who get stuck writing copy for their company because they once correctly used \\"presume\\" in an email. The nice thing about this one-and \\"nice\\" is a good word, because Jonathan Kranz is nothing if not a nice guy-is that it's a book about copywriting that doesn't assume non-copywriters know all the copywriting jargon and secrets.

I picked up the book to see what all of the fuss was about. I quickly concluded that it was nothing more than a mix of feel-good psychology and a sexist reading of Scripture (a very poorly supported one, at that). Captivating is just as horrible.For starters, the main premise of the book is very inaccurate-- every woman's heart longs for three things: to be romanced, to have an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and beauty to unveil.Sadly, there are probably millions of young Christian women who will read this message and agree with it-- young women who dream of fairy-tale marriages, strapping but strong Christian men to lead them and their children while taking a back-seat role in the \\"adventures\\" of life, women who believe that because a man's desire is to win the \\"beauty,\\" they must adhere to this conjured-up theory that to be beautiful is one of the three main longings of our heart. Sorry John and Stasi, but I don't buy it. Not only do I feel a complete lack of connection with this message, I also believe it is a harmful one to preach.Do you want to the know the longings of my heart?Why is it that a man's main desire is to seek great adventure while the woman \\"plays a role\\" in that male-dominated adventure? You are dead wrong when you say that \\"every little girl dreams of being a princess.\\" I never once had that dream. I enjoyed playing with toy guns, climbing trees, getting into fights with my older brothers, and playing every sport that was offered. In short, I identify with the male version of \\"desire\\" more than with the female. Does that make me less feminine?And this is not because I am in denial or have a mortal feminine injury. It is because I am a self-sufficient, self-confident and yes, beautiful 22 year old woman. But beauty is not part of the equation. I rarely notice my beauty; in all honesty, I am annoyed and sometimes offended when it is pointed out to me by men. I do not long to be \\"romanced\\" and \\"fought for\\" and told that I am beautiful. I fight my own battles, and that includes the battle in this society to overcome the sexist stereotypes that drive young women to feel insecure, needy, or \\"Feminist Nazis.\\" By the way, I am very offended by your referral to that phrase, as included in a letter from a reader. What does \\"Feminist Nazi\\" mean anyway? Its simply a buzzword used to perpetuate hatred towards women like me.The true desires of my heart couldn't be further from the thesis of this book. I long for adventure, for travel, for life's romance-- but this has nothing to do with the presence of a MAN in my life. The longings of my heart include fighting for social justice, improving the living conditions of women and children in this country and across the world, and rejecting the traditional female role outlined for me by my Christian background. If I can accomplish this, my heart's desires will be truly fulfilled. My happiness is not contingent upon being romanced, won over, or privileged to merely \\"take a role\\" in the adventure of a man. Please girls, get some self-respect! I am lucky enough to have had two parents who pushed me to follow my own dreams instead of find a way to fit this masogonyst world. I refused to be the little princess crying out for help; I was the princess who found her own way out of the tower, into battle and into victory. I hope and pray that there are girls out there who are courageous and intelligent, who will question the message of this book and seek out their own adventures, who will discover the unique longings of their own hearts instead of believing sexist lies poorly disguised as spiritual truth."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"are things that you would better spend your hard earned cash on than this insipid book. \\"oohhh....

If you are not in that audience there are penalty of other books out there that can assist men and women in balancing the feminine and masculine aspects of their own respective beings. For those who decide not to purchase this book but are still looking for something from a Christian base, I would suggest something by Cloud and Townsend.

Our Sunday School has this book for their study book, and I don't think it is for sincere Christian women. I NEVER miss Sunday School, but I am so turned off by this book that I haven't gone for the last two weeks. All about what a woman needs -- Beauty, Romance, and Adventure. I, for one, need the Lord first -- that is my main desire. This book has some good points, but not a lot. The main theme is what we need to feel good about ourselves and then to follow the Lord. The women used for examples are from movies -- even \\"Pretty Woman\\" -- she was a prostitute. Prostitues are used by God -- check the Bible! I watched this movie and am appalled that he uses this -- I know, I am being critical. But why not use women of the Bible and show their weaknesses and strengths and pattern ourselves after them. The book was not suggesting that we pattern ourselves after the women from these movies -- about 32 movies were mentioned!!!-- BUT why use the movie examples when we have many women in the Bible. He used Eve, but not in the way she should have been used for an example. I noticed feminist view points in the parts that I read. I have read and studied several book on a woman's soul and have grown tremendously from them, but this is NOT one of them. I feel good about myself -- the Spirit dwells in me -- I feel rich in my soul. This doesn't paint a true picture of what a Christian woman needs."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I loved this book - LOVED it. The authors look at the challenges that face women in today's society, but they look at it from a completely different angle. Their observations are refreshing and liberating.... we women should free ourselves from all the \\"rocks\\" that hold us down, and John and Stasi encourage us to be like Mary and sit at the Lord's feet, rather than rushing around being Martha to everyone and everything on our endless \\"to do\\" list. Truly, as Christ said to Martha, only \\"one thing\\" is important and Mary chose that one thing! (Thank you Mary!) Women, God chose YOU as the crowning glory of his creation - think about that for a second - we're the \\"piece-de-resistance\\"! You were MEANT to be captivating and beautiful and you ARE captivating and beautiful in His eyes. How cool is that?!Awesome. I'm buying copies for my mother and all my close female friends for Christmas. Women, life is but a breath, and a short one at that. Put down that long laundry list of \\"gotta-get-dones\\" and enjoy beautiful intimacy with the Lord who MADE you captivating, indeed....Thanks, John and Stasi - your book is a blessing."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I am currently reading this book and it brought me to tears so many times already. I've read the reviews by other women who object to the mentioning of movies, 'worldliness', etc. and even one who said basically, 'I don't need beauty, romance, etc. I need the Lord first..' Hm.. I think the point has been missed! The Lord is offering beauty and romance to us through himself, that is the whole point of the book, and those things are what we are created for as women. How are the two mutually exclusive? Where do we get the idea that to long for these things means that we no longer want the Lord as much? I find it the opposite! I've found that this book made me hunger MORE for God, while at the same time valuing my beauty as a woman more too. Why not have the whole she-bang?? Is God really that stingy? I think not. He offers the whole world's beauty to us to enjoy, why not enjoy ourselves and our beauty too? That doesn't make us self-centered and nowhere in the book did I see them advocating staring in the mirror as opposed to seeking God, on the contrary. Stasi was incredibly brave as she exposed her past wounds and mistakes and her true heart, and I think she must be such a beautiful woman herself. I love their descriptions of their part of the USA, especially being from Northern Canada. I am recommending it to all my female friends whose hearts and beauty have been hidden and shut down for far too long. As they say in the book, a woman's beauty brings us to greater awareness of God's heart. What a treasure to find such a down-to-earth book like this - I, too, am tired of the 'Christian femininity' books that say you need to serve other people from dawn til dusk. We do that anyway - why not celebrate beauty on top of it?? Thank you Eldredge's for this book!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's SoulThis book came highly recommended by a few friends and a myriad of strangers who had rated the book online. I did my best to give it a chance and to read it with an open mind. Although I made it all the way through, I gritted my teeth almost the entire time.Countless bad (and also secular) movie references aside, this book was filled with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute; about girls' dreams of being fairy tale princesses and the message that women are damsels in distress who need to be rescued by a man. John and Stasi Eldredge obviously share poor opinions of women's abilities to take care of themselves, viewing them as fundamentally broken and incapable of having stable emotions. Oh, and we're so pathetic as women that we need not even have ambitions, we just need to let things happen to us. \\"As a woman, you don't need to strive or arrange; you don't need to make it happen. You only need to respond\\" (Kindle location 2217). Seriously?This book might as well have been Stasi's memoir about her neglected, traumatic childhood on which she based the idea that all women have \\"daddy/mommy issues\\" that have dragged into their adult lives and impacted them in ways they can't see. I felt the whole time that the Eldredges were hoping I would stumble upon some dark, long-buried, awful memory of how my parents abused me or didn't love me enough (which is not the childhood I experienced, by the way). I imagine this book is beyond helpful for women who did suffer from abusive experiences they did not deserve as young girls or teenagers, but this book assumes more women had bad childhoods than not.And if that wasn't enough, the conceited, holier-than-thou tone of the book made me feel as if I am guilty for NOT having had a horrible childhood or having had something awful happen to me. Did (and do) I go through trials in my life? Absolutely. Did I have a perfect childhood with perfect parents who treated each other like gold and stayed married? Nope. But I always felt loved and I was blessed to have parents who instilled confidence, strength and a sense of capability and independence in me from a very early age.I won't even go into the poor writing, disregard for scriptural context and/or accuracy, calling God my \\"lover\\" or the authors' multiple references to casting out demons in Jesus' name either.

Spiritual classics, theology, and the like are relegated to a back corner, while best-sellers take the central shelves. I see a common theme woven through the most popular books, and it is not one I see in Scripture: It's all about me. I must discover who I truly am to find ultimate fulfillment. I must know myself better. Not know God better. Not understand how to live in His will. The theme seems to be how to ensure that I have the best life possible.One new book out is called Captivating, written by Stasi Eldredge and her famous \\"Wild at Heart\\" husband, John. I really did not know what to expect, beyond that it would delve into the heart needs John said that women had in his book: the desire to be pursued, to share an adventure, to unveil beauty. I have nothing against those desires per se. They are probably true of most girls.However, my issue comes with the emphasis the book carries. By the third chapter, I felt very strongly about this review I would be writing. I kept reading, and by the time I finished (I read it straight through one morning while waiting at a doctor's appointment) I felt...empty. Captivating did not leave me with anything to ponder or by which to be encouraged. There were a lot of words, a lot of stories, and a lot of emotive language, but very little \\"meat.\\" I hope my readers who like the book won't write off my reviews forever, because of this; please hear me out. This is very important.This month I am reading Created to be His Help Meet by Debi Pearl, and, quite simply, it is unlike any book I have ever read or heard of. I have never bought a book to give someone else simply because they had to read it. I just tell them they ought to read it. This time I was buying copies and giving them to my soon-to-be-married friends and relatives-they have to read this book!I mention this because the contrast between Captivating and Created is astonishing. I did not come into the reading with a bias toward or against either book--though I knew that I disagreed with John Eldredge's theology on some points--but the same is true of Debi Pearl's.To put it simply, here is my concern with Captivating:Captivating emphasizes an unhealthy perspective on life by encouraging us to focus on ourselves. The whole book is about who we are, our needs, what we feel, what we want. I think it is dangerously self-absorbed and carries an unbiblical message that it is all about us.Let me provide some examples.The chapter titled \\"What Eve Alone Could Tell\\" had some feministic undertones. Some of what was written is in contradiction to the Word that the Eldredges sometimes quote. I had a rough time going through this chapter. I wanted badly to give the author the benefit of the doubt, and I kept looking at the excerpts that upset me and trying to see them in context. I will quote at length so that you can see I'm not just pulling random phrases and twisting them around.Here are a few portions that may show what my concern is:\\"She is the crescendo, the final, astonishing work of God. Woman. In one last flourish creation comes to a finish not with Adam, but with Eve. She is the Master's finishing touch...Given the way that creation unfolds, how it builds to ever higher and higher works of art, can there be any doubt that Eve is the crown of creation?\\"Whether intended or not, this exalts woman above man, and sets her above him in perfection, which is nonsense. I understand some women struggle with self-esteem, but even more, we all deal with pride, and I don't think that this is helping us find a balanced perspective if we are having an identity crisis. But it gets worse.\\"She is God's final touch, his 'piece de resistance.' She fills a place in the world nothing and no one else can fill. Step to a window, ladies, if you can. Better still, find some place with a view. Look out across the earth and say to yourselves, 'The whole, vast world is incomplete without me. Creation reached its zenith in me'.\\"Mercy! This borders on blasphemy. I don't know what their point is here, but it is dangerous stuff. We do not find our worth and need for purpose in this sort of self-love talk, but in realizing we are nothing without our Creator, and all we have is by His good pleasure alone.There is another part of the chapter that displays God in a way that I believe is false or at the very least, grossly unbalanced. The authors seek to compare woman to God, and say that God is expressed in unique ways through women. I quote:\\"Not only does God long for us, but he longs to be loved by us. Oh, how we've missed this. How many of you see God as longing to be loved by you? We see him as strong and powerful, but not needing us, vulnerable to us, yearning to be desired. God wants to be loved. He wants to be a priority to someone. From cover to cover, from beginning to end, the cry of God's heart is, 'Why won't you choose Me?'\\"They quote some verses here, but they take them too far, I think. They are not looking at the Bible as a whole and what it says of God. God does not need us! He did not create us to fill any void in Him. The Trinity experiences perfect and complete fellowship. We are made for His glory, not for his need. Exodus 15:11 says \\"Who is like Thee among the gods, O Lord? Who is like Thee, majestic in holiness, awesome in praises, working wonders?\\" \\"The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty; the Lord has clothed and girded Himself with strength; indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved\\" (Ps. 93:1). Our God is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords (1 Tim. 6:15)!These passages in the Eldredges' book weaken our God. They reduce Him to the level of an emotional woman. Please, let's not take the comparison to such an extreme. It's gone too far.The book quotes far more movies than Bible verses, and it often seems to draw lessons from the movies and offer them as truth, even though there is no support other than what our \\"hearts\\" tell us. Also, the translation of the Bible used is very unique--translated by one man a few years ago. It's called \\"Alter.\\" What texts did he even look at? I was unable to find any explanation for his variance from the traditional translations. The wording he chooses is not accurate, and that bothers me.Another problem with the book is that it mocks the role for which God has specifically created us and our very identity as helpmeets. At one point, the Eldredges discuss Genesis 2:18 and use their \\"Alter\\" translation again:\\"The various attempts we have in English are 'helper\` or 'companion\` or the notorious 'help meet.' Why are these translations so incredibly wimpy, boring, flat...disappointing? What is a help meet anyway? What little girl dances through the house singing, 'One day I shall be a helpmeet\`? Companion? A dog can be a companion. Helper? Sounds like Hamburger Helper.\\"This is offensive. Mrs. Eldredge is mocking the words in which we women find our purpose. I know many little girls who dream of someday being helpmeets! To be a companion is a very glorious thing. I challenge the insinuation that these words are wimpy and boring. Look at what Debi Pearl says about the phrase \\"help meet\\":\\"If you are a wife, you were created to fill a need, and in that capacity, you are a 'good thing\` (Prob. 18:22), a helper suited to the needs of a man. This is how God created you, and it is your purpose for existing.\\"Later she says: \\"When you are a helpmeet to your husband, you are a helper to Christ.\\" Not quite \\"Hamburger Helper,\\" eh?When you read Mrs. Eldredge's words, a help meet is portrayed as a spiritually dead, going-through-the-motions waste. She writes, \\"Seriously now, picture the women we hold up as models of femininity in the church. They are sweet, they are helpful, they are busy, they are disciplined, they are composed...and they are tired.\\"There is definitely a disparaging tone in those words toward women who are helpful, disciplined, and sweet. As if serving God is not enough. We need more \\"fulfillment!\\" We need to remember we are the zenith of creation, reclaim our desires to experience adventure, be seductive (their words in several places--they try to soften the meaning), and to be adored. Please. There were other similar passages, but I did not mark them all. These should suffice to raise some serious red flags.Study the women of the Bible who served the Lord. They were disciplined, worked with their hands, and served others gladly. The example of Dorcas in Acts 9:36 shows us this: \\"Now in Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha (which translated in Greek is called Dorcas); this woman was abounding with deeds of kindness and charity, which she continually did.\\" The Proverbs 31 woman \\"works with her hands in delight...extends her hand to the poor; and she stretches out her hand to the needy\\" (Prov. 31:13 and 20). What does verse 30 of that chapter on virtuous womanhood state? It does not say that we find our ultimate purpose in life through a focus on ourselves. Instead, \\"a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.\\" Captivating does not praise a woman who fears the Lord and lives her life in service to Him and others.For new believers, women who have had horrendous pasts, like Mrs. Eldredge, perhaps this book can be helpful. I still think there is a better alternative, though, and without the dangers, biting sarcasm, and annoyingly frequent references to movies, secular philosophers, etc.Who knows, maybe someday things will change. For now, I'm setting Captivating aside and going with what I was created to be: a woman who pours out her life in service for others, who finds her greatest fulfillment in completing another, not in superseding another.Copyright 2002-2005 by LAF/BeautifulWomanhood.org"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"As indicated by the title of the review, I was quite disappointed by the book. But I must also add the caveat that I had come with great expectations based on my readings of John Eldredge's other works -- namely,The Sacred Romance: Drawing Closer to the Heart of GodandThe Journey of Desire: Searching for the Life We've Only Dreamed of. Perhaps it was in the attempt to appeal to the women audience and their more emotional sides, but there are too many accounts of personal stories used to evoke the readers' emotions and not enough Bible references to support the authors' points or to provide the readers with a take-away of substance.An example (as mentioned in other reviews) is the reference of God as full of emotions but leaving out His other characteristics of being just, sovereign, and powerful.My disappointment was only increased after perusing through the men's counterpart of this work,The Way of the Wild Heart: A Map for the Masculine Journey, which was less \\"fluffy\\" than this work.Although there are a few take-away pointers in this book, they did not make up for the overall cringing reading experience."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book gave me permission to quit apologizing for who I am. God made me who I am on purpose. I am not too much; I am not too little. I have unconsciously been living for years feeling sorry for the people in my life because of my perceived sense of failing them. Now I can lift my head because the blanket of guilt I wasn't even aware of has been removed. It's ok to be feminine. It's ok to be vulnerable. It doesn't make you weak. I don't have to prove anything to anyone.I can raise my daughters to be empowered by their femininity. If you have little girls, this book is a must-read. I would also recommend it to anyone with aspirations for counseling or therapy. It tangibly illustrates and puts into words much of the why behind female responses and reasoning. Women are not irrational and controlled by emotion. We are designed by a loving creator as we are for a reason."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is a book that the world needed so very much.

This is incorrect. No books in the Bible refer to something without God. This book was meant to be interpreted both literally and non-literally. For example, in the book of Hosea, he marries a prostitute and tries to win her back. This could be interpreted as God chasing after the body of the church and winning us back, or it could also be a message on forgiveness. Song of Solomon refers to the love a man and woman have for each other, as well as the love God has for all of mankind."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I had desires and hurts that I felt I was alone in.

A 21st century woman certainly doesn't live the life of a princess. John and Stasi Eldredge's Captivating takes a journey through the Fall of Eve, and points out the results of that fall in women today. Captivating brings a woman back to her years of innocence, and may even open the eyes of men to answers for their many questions about the opposite sex. Useful messages fill front to back cover of this self-helper, but other aspects of this book fail to receive this same glory and praise. The Eldredges' word choice, just like a broken record, repeats...repeats...repeats. Any educated reader with a vocabulary of more than five words will grow weary with this text selection. The authors' opinions also jump around with no real direction. Logical transitions don't appear at all between page 1 and 224. This wishy-washy style creates problems at the end of the book, making it hard for readers to arrive at a resolution. Captivating certainly deserves acclamation for ideas, but other areas of this book need a little TLC. An emotional connection may not be enough to captivate a large audience."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book speaks to the God-given romantic side of women and shows how much scripture speaks of God wanting to pursue us, protect us, how He longs to have us be in His presence and win our hearts as one who is smitten by our beauty, character and strength.I've never been comfortable with the concept of Jesus as lover but after reading this book I see that the Bible is full of such a metaphor...the church as the bride of Christ, for example. I think in our carnal, human minds we tend to think of a lover in a sexual way and that is what causes the discomfort with the concept. But, what it REALLY means is one who loves us so much that he can't wait to talk to us, to be with us, to have a unique and intimate relationship that is shared with no one else. It is with that kind of extravagant love that God pursues each of us and wants us to reciprocate with Him.God took what He knew we could understand as humans (the courtship and marriage relationship as He intended it to be) to describe the depth of intimacy He longs to have with us all, men and women alike. He wants to captivate us with a love so strong that He was willing to die to save us. He wants to help us see how captivating and beautiful we are to Him no matter what we have done and no matter how much the enemy and world tries to tell us we are unworthy, ugly, beyond repair or a waste of God's time and effort. That is what a lover does...he sees beyond the faults and blemishes and loves us unconditionally - not in spite of what we've done or what worldy standards of physical beauty we don't live up to - but because of who we are.Stasi and John make references to fictional characters from books and movies (as well as plenty of Biblical exampes!). I had no problem with that. I felt they were just using these cultural fictional characters as examples of different types of women, showing how God created us all different with different strengths, talents and desires. The work of a mom at home is just as esteemed and precious to God as that of a warrior princess.Embracing the sacred romance of our relationship with the living God is not sappy nor weak. It doesn't reduce us to submissive wimps with no voice or women with no power. If anything, I found this book incredibly empowering as a woman, wife and mother.This book teaches the balance God intended for women to bring to the world. We can listen to imbalanced message of the anti-male, secular feminists of our day and reject all aspects of our powerful and unique femininity. We can listen to the other imbalanced extreme, often promoted by religion, that tells us to be ashamed of being a woman and reduces women to mere servents of men no matter how demeaning and abusive that becomes. Or, we can listen to the heart of God and live up to the joyful potential and beauty He personally created in each of us."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Given to me as a gift, I found this book heart piercing, thought provoking and eye opening. For the first time in my life, I began to see who I was from the inside out. As I have gone back through the book with the companion journal, my heart has been stirred beyond my wildest expectations. The information in this book is too important for females to overlook!Yes, there are scriptural references in the book that have made me search for myself to see if they were taken out of context. Yes, there are references to the Eldredge's beliefs that made me question my own. Yes, there are numerous references to books, movies and personal experiences throughout the text. The writers have a wonderful sense that the concepts given can be seen in their everyday world, and they are helping me see them in mine.As a grace-centered Christian, I found this book fascinating! I could not wait to begin a book study on it for the women in our church. I have known several other women who have read this book and literally blossomed in their spiritual walk. No book is perfect (other than the Bible), but in the pages of this one, I found through my many readings of its pages (and numerous tears) a new perspective of how I am seen by my Father...Captivating.

I only wish that the book would teach these through usage of more scripture and less emphasis on beauty although I understand the author says that it is more about inner and outer beauty.I know that between most of my female friends and I, women today are truly simply \\"tired\\". Tired of trying to gain acceptance in the work place, tired of carrying the burden of the family without full support of the spouse, and tired of trying to please everyone in general. It is through these experiences that women feel broken. The cup at times feels like its running low.

It will truly touch your heart and help you understand why we do the things we do."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book reaches into the soul of a woman and how she relates to God-as a woman, not as a man would. So many books miss the mark of how one's faith can grow but the Eldredges' approach to faith always seems to make sense because they involve not only the mind, but the heart as well. This is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Being passionate about Jesus and having a deep love for God's love letter to us - His Word - you won't find me devoting too much time to reading outside of scripture...please know that scripture is the ultimate source to discover Who defines us, and to find healing for our hearts (Isaiah 61). That being said, it's wonderful to read this offering from the Eldredge family - because \\"Captivating\\" is chock full of the one source of Truth we can all count on...page after page of heart healing scripture and insight - along with personal applications by real, thoughtful, imperfect, beautiful women. Their stories and testimonies of their search for healing, truth and a closer walk with Jesus have inspired me to pause and recommend this book as a must read for both men and women...seekers of God...doubters and believers alike! Please don't take my word for it; while reading this, examine the book of Genesis for yourself - where God our Father speaks to us! God's timing is so perfect...while reading \\"Captivating\\", He also is revealing Himself to me and countless other women through His word at a women's Bible study covering the book of Genesis, word by word and verse by verse. So far, \\"Captivating\\" lines up perfectly with what is being taught through BSF. It saddened my heart to see a pretty critical review of the book or possibly it's authors from a sister who apparently never finished reading \\"Captivating\\"! If there is anything that doesn't agree with God's word, then discard it - as John teaches (1 John 4:1-3) but don't miss out on the encouragement that is available to you in \\"Captivating\\"."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"WOW! This is truly one of the best books I have read in years- it speaks truth and hope into lives. What is revealed about a woman's heart in relation to how God created us is inspiring and enlightening. I found healing and stength in places of my life that I wasn't even aware were stripping me of love. I can't imagine a woman reading this book and not being moved at the core of her being. Thank you John & Stasi Eldridge for expressing in words what some never grasp in a lifetime."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"In a nut shell- don't waste your time or money on this book. I thought the first chapter was a joke. Seriously. It is poorly written. Poor, incorrect unBiblical theology. The author seems to imply that all women have had some deep, dark secret (sexual abuse, ect) that they need to sob over. In one part of the book it told me that I needed to heal from my abusive past and just let the 'flood gates' open and cry it out. ??? Also, making it out that God NEEDS women. That somehow He (God) was incomplete without women. That's right- the author reflects that *God* needed Eve. It also becomes disturbing how the author reflects that Jesus should be our 'lover'. I don't know about you- but if I said 'lover' in any context whatsoever- it would imply 'someone with whom you have sexual relations with'. Creepy, inaccurate take on demon possesion and even going so far as to imply that sickness is a type of demon-possesion.I wanted accurate Biblical advice and instead I get moreso a ranting, off the wall, rambling \\"book\\"."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"As a married woman, I was seeking a book that would help me as I struggled against wanting to be attractive to certain men & being attracted to them. Attraction is a normal part of life, but I wanted to know how to deal with it as a godly woman.I ended up throwing this book away after the third or fourth chapter! The author gives terrible advice, such as telling the reader she should do things and say things to all the men in her life that will make them feel manly. Ladies, you should not be trying to flatter and make men feel manly who are not your husbands!She also advocates praying with and praying over men who are not your husband in a setting alone. This is unwise advice! If you find a man in a situation where he needs immediate prayer, get a man to pray with him! If you follow the advice in this book, you're setting yourself up for emotional and sexual affairs. Don't be as prideful as this author who seems to think she can fawn all over men and still stay pure!If you want a book that will help you to be a real woman who builds up those around her, check out Shannon Ethridge's \\"Every Woman's Battle.\\" That book will help you, \\"Captivating\\" will hurt you, your family, & the men in your life!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I've only read about sixty pages of this book and I already love it. Every woman should read it. It reveals to you how so much of who you are as a woman is so much of how God designed for you to be.

I read this book while in college and when the revised and updated came out I decided I should read it again. While doing so I used it to lead a bible study. I feel like the book has offered a lot to the girls I was ministering to. Not just to the students but also to myself. This book has helped not only them but me be happy with ourselves. This book also helped to plan talks and lead a fun filled girl's retreat where we talked about beauty. We laughed, we cried, we made new friends, but most importantly we discovered a new way to look at ourselves. This book is a great place for anyone at any part of their Christian walk to help build themselves up and see themselves in the way God intended us to see ourselves. This book is a most read for any female!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Fresh out of a long-term relationship, my heart was vulnerable and thirsty for Christ to fill me with truth and comfort. John and Stasi Eldredge's book Captivating was the perfect medicine. This book revealed to me the importance of women in this fallen world and how to discover what makes women truly captivating.The authors dig deep into the importance of the \\"captivating\\" beauty found in the soul of a woman, and how it can powerfully and gently be given to those around us. Yet there is devastation everywhere, waiting to tear the beauty away from a woman, leaving her feeling anything but captivating. Captivating guided me on a path towards restoration.Although many verses were credibly incorporated into the text, not all verses were used properly. Several theories in Captivating rubbed me the wrong way. The main critique I derived from the text is the misconstrued question of: Who is captivating whom? Although God does ravenously desire for us to pursue Him, the book does not emphasize how much more captivating God is than woman. One can see an example on page 28 where Stasi Eldredge says, \\"This may be the most important thing we ever learn about God-that he yearns for relationship with us.\\"(28) This lesson is vital; however, certainly not the most important lesson one can derive from the Bible, rather that humans are nothing without God.Even though I did not agree with all of the authors' Biblical inclusions, the message as a whole made me feel beautiful and important. These are feelings that can easily slip away from a woman in this demeaning world, yet these are feelings that God desires us to obtain. Let us remind ourselves daily of how lovely Christ is. For He is where our beauty and importance is derived from."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I gave Captivating four stars because I was able to relate to it very well and it opened doors for healing to take place; however, there were a couple things I disagreed with. It was relatable because it discussed the desires of a woman's heart. I, being a woman, have felt the need to be loved and the need to be thought of as captivating that is talked about in the book. The section of the book that was particularly helpful was when the authors explained that fear is Satan's way of keeping us from doing what God has called us to do. It opened my eyes to the power of Satan and made me want to conquer him all the more. One part of the book I did not agree with was when the authors were talking about affairs. They made it seem like it is always the wife that pushes the man into the arms of another woman. While that may be the case in some situations, it is hardly universal. I would change the marketing strategy for this book. It is geared only toward women, but I think men would benefit greatly from reading this book. They would have a better awareness of the hearts of women and would be able to understand women more completely. Overall, the book was insightful and discussed the hard truths regarding a woman's heart, which made it an enjoyable and challenging read."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"If you are looking for a book that will both be challenging and inspirational this is the book for you. Captivating gets to the core what it means to be a woman, particularly what it means to be a woman in the image of God. The authors unpack why women are the way they are, and how they are perfectly and wonderfully made. For me personally I found this book to be very beneficial when trying to understand who I was as woman and who I was to God. After reading this book I found that my relationship with Christ was enhanced because I had a better understanding of the love that Christ has for his people. The writing of the book was very well done. Each chapter was built off the previous one, which was helpful when trying to get a better understanding of the big picture that they were trying to capture. This book is an easy read, and the concepts are easily grasped.Overall this book was challenging and inspirational. It gets to the core of who we are as women and what we mean to our creator. I found that this book is very beneficial when trying to understand who I am as woman. I hope it does the same for you."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I love this book.

Very insightful, motivating and inspiring. I would strongly recommend this book to any woman that is trying to find, listen or understand her true self and heart. Praise God!!!!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating comes with a very nice cover that has a layer of vellum acting as a book jacket, but also acting as a veil for the photo of a beautiful woman underneath. The copy I received was an updated version of the original book with the same title.The authors of this book repeat their main point several times throughout: as a woman, you are created to be beautiful from the inside out. There are several key points which the authors say will keep a woman from showing her true inner beauty, including fear and wounds from others.This book includes several ancedotes taken from the lives of real women, and if it weren't for these being inserted throughout the book, it would have been much too dry to get through. There were also numerous references to movies, but I haven't watched most of them so the references were pretty meaningless.There were things about this book which made me feel uncomfortable. I would recommend that if you are going to read this book, you have your Bible open to check the authors' interpretations of the scriptures against what the verses actually say. I cannot actually fully recommend this book to anyone for this reason.It was also a bit confusing to read this co-authored book because at times I didn't know which of them was doing the writing--and knowing would have been helpful. Perhaps two different colors of ink, or two different fonts, would have solved the problem.Thank you to Thomas Nelson for providing me with a free copy of this book for review."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I'm sure the author(s) could've gotten their point across in a 30-page book. It seems like they make a good point, but then they hammer on it for 20 more pages, then move on to the next chapter and go over it some more. Ugh. I'm bored already, but I'm gonna hang in there to see what blows up!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Extremely thought provoking! I'm still mulling it over. The book was easy to read but at times hard to accept. The concept of women's power being in her femininity is a hard one to swallow in today's culture after years of fighting for women's equality and at a time when most women identify their worth with their accomplishments. BUT the longer you think about the books assertions and let them sink in, the more you see the TRUTH in what she writes! Are women today happier and healthier working themselves to exhaustion? I don't think so. Do women feel more fulfilled in their relationships with men and other women? Again, I don't think so given the divorce rate and the unspoken tension between women as they seek validation for their decision to either raise a family, build a career or both. Despite all our efforts to be seen as people not objects, we women spend more than ever before to look young and stay beautiful. Perhaps this book re-awakens a reality that we tried to bury years ago; women bringing grace, beauty, love and live into this world. Their very presence can bring calm and rest to a weary world. When women started focusing on things by striving for success, those wonderful things started to diminish in our culture. You may not agree with the book but it's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have been through a lot in my 40 years of life. I always thought that I had to be strong and just carry my sadness with me like a backpack I would pick up every day--it just became a part of my routine to deal with the overwhelming pain and sadness.A friend of mine suggested I read this book. I went into it skeptically because I have read so many Christian-based books that encouraged me, but never helped me to get \\"over that hump\\" of going back to dwelling on past hurts.I am now getting this book for a few of my girlfriends for Christmas. I believe it will help them as it has helped me.I read another review on this site that said the book did nothing for her. Well, to be honest, I believe that God reveals things to you when the timing is right. I have read books that I felt did nothing for me and then an event will take place in my life --and lo and behold the book I felt was useless did in fact prepare me for the event. So I don't limit God's teachings or Word. As the Bible states His Word does not go out void.I suggest reading a chapter or two and really reflecting on what it's said, how it relates to you and then prayerfully asking for God to help you get a deeper understanding from the book.I am still in the process of reading the book, but each chapter has brought me to a higher level. I no longer think the negative thoughts that once plagued my heart and soul. I no longer wake with dread of \\"what's going to happen to make me sad today.\\" I am renewed, I am cleansed and I am free of picking up that backpack of sadness."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have to say I absolutely LOVED this book. I read it last year and then did the DVD series with a small group with my church. I got a lot out of the book itself, but even more so when I was reading it with my group and watching the DVDs. I think this is a very relevant book for women of any age and really encourages women to dig deep and discover your wounds and allow God and God ALONE to heal you. It is very Biblically based and focuses on bringing these issues and the core of who we are to God (not men, money, etc). I have highly recommended this book to many people. A lot of women in their 20/30s that I know have enjoyed it, but my mom couldn't get into it. I think from what I have discovered is that sometimes my mom's generation and older are a little more private, and Stasi does put it all out there, which I appreciated. I think anyone with an open mind seeking God will enjoy this book though regardless of age. Just my opinion though :)"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I don't know why I was drawn to read Captivating. I almost always avoid this type of book-- like I need one more person pointing out more shortcomings in my life as a Christian woman. Thank heavens, it was not another woman saying \\" I have a long way to go but look how close I am to becoming the Proverbs 31 woman---\\"I have to say that Captivating has helped me to gain a new perspective on my own life as a Christian woman. No, it wasn't extremely deep (although I have yet to do the in depth study). I found the book to be insightful and validating. I actually found it to be somewhat calming. God loves me as a woman. It was neither judgemental nor condescending. I also found it to be hopeful. At 50+ years of age, I am not, nor do I have any hope of ever becoming, the Proverbs 31 woman. I have failures, God does not see me as as beyond hope.One more note. The book was written in somewhat of a conversational tone.

We wanted to be honest, genuine, and get to the core of who we are. After several life changes, we never did manage to get the book together. However, years later when this book came out I was in such a state of anticipation to get it. I think I busted down the door of my local Christian bookstore to get my hands on it!! I had been an avid read of John Eldredge's books and now having this one focused solely on the heart of a woman just captured me.I cannot tell you how many times my soul just sighed in relief as I read this book. It was so me and I felt like it was okay to be that way...a way this world was trying to beat out of me. It is a poignant and moving book that really explains the heart and soul of women. My friend and I who wanted to create this type of book many years before were relieved that this was getting into the hands and hearts and souls of women...they did it better then we ever could!I actually revisit this book every 2 years or so and have the companion guide too.

Instead, women have an inner desire to be involved in an adventure, something that will test their strength as women. Captivating is a revolutionary book on Christian femininity. Rather than focusing on the almost infamous example of a good Christian woman found in Proverbs 31, this book focuses on the godliness and courage of women like Rahab and Tamar. The basic message is that women are deeper than clothes, makeup, and a seemingly submissive spirit. Woman's soul is a treasure chest filled with wealth to be discovered and enjoyed.Similar to Wild at Heart, Captivating contains an important, but rather depressing, section on \\"her wound.\\" Although this section was not particularly uplifting, I endured it because I considered it useful for my own growth. The rest of the book, however, was much more enjoyable. I believe the most important concept taught in the book is that neither Christian women nor any other woman should expect men to give them the love and affirmation they need. This affirmation can come only from God. Although this book contains a lot of great material, I did not enjoy it quite as much as I enjoyed Wild at Heart, partly just because the transition between the two authors was slightly distracting at times. Despite this minor drawback, I recommend this book to women of any age but especially to young girls 16+. [Reviewer's note: Since I am not and have never been a man, I am not qualified to say whether men would appreciate this book.]I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their book review bloggers program.

I was at a place of soul searching in my life. So when I had the opportunity to read through it again, I jumped at the chance. Although I have had it for quite some time, I finally have gotten to read through it, again.This book goes through topics that each woman will someday, if not already, encounter. We all have a past, joys and sorrows included in our past. This book helps you look at each situation in your past, and figure out how to bring out the best of your past. We all need to use our past to grow in the future. Learn from our mistakes, and move on. When we are stuck in the muck, we are not the Captivating spirit our Savior wants us to be, nor are we Captivating to the world.I highly recommend you reconcile with your past, and use that to move forward with your future...your destiny in where you should be!I am not paid to review books by Thomas Nelson.

There was only one area in my life that I wasn't truly content, my husband. I held a lot of hurt and bitterness in my heart toward him, I was very lonely in my marriage. I was basically pushing him away and could not figure out why. Last Sunday before church, I found myself wanting some quiet time so I wandered into the library. I found 'Captivating' on the shelf and started reading. I was totally consumed by the message. At some points during the book I cried uncontrollably releasing some of the pent up hurtful thoughts I had been letting the enemy fool me into believing: I'm too fat, my husband can't possibly find me attractive, He doesn't really love me because he doesn't do [whatever it is]. It was just the breakthrough I needed. The authors made a connection about how we, as women, are made into the feminine form of God and men are the masculine form of God. Wow! I had been pushing my husband away....therefore, I was pushing God away! 'Captivating' has totally changed my view of my marriage and has quieted that little enemy voice in my head. I am beautiful and worthy of being loved by our Amazing God!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I was asked to read this title by the lovely people at BookSneeze and can only apologise for taking so long to do so.This is a new edition of Captivating (a title I've read before) and have greatly enjoyed revisiting. It contains some new material but is basically a re-release of the rather battered paperback I already own.The Eldredges have a theory. They believe that every woman (and every man for that matter) is born with a Question etched on their heart which only God can answer. It is in looking to other sources for answers that we tie our selves in knots, hurt others and open our arms to the Enemy (Satan). Captivating makes extensive use of the Bible (starting right back with Genesis) to explain why this is so and then offers a Biblical alternative.As I read this book I found myself drawn in by the excellent writing and entirely agreeing with the authors - yes, I have a Question. Yes, I've looked for answers in all the wrong places. Yes, I've been wounded and, yes, I want Jesus to heal me. I've found that my faith has been rekindled and, for the first time in a while, I'm spending quality time with Him.Although there were areas of this book with which I was less comfortable - I'm not big on spiritual warfare - there's enough here for me to mull over and work on without focussing on that aspect. Although I know the Eldredges have their critics, think this is one of the best books on femininity that I have read."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is so amazing!

In the new and expanded Captivating, John and Stasi Eldridge explain how these are woven into a woman's heart and how a woman can uncover the truth that God wants her to know about each of them.John and Stasi start by looking at the fallen, wounded heart of a woman. We see how past hurts and the attacks of our enemy have damaged our view of ourselves and clouded us from being able to truly understand and internalize how God thinks and feels about us. They give practical steps to help us move past the hurts and experience the romance of our King, how beautiful we are to Him, and that irreplaceable role He has set within us.I highly suggest that every woman read this book. We all need to deeply know our Lord and His love and desire for us. I also recommend that men read this book. Often men say they have a difficult time understanding women (after all we are complicated). Men need to know what is happening in the heart of women. This is a perfect way to gain more of that understanding.Get a copy, read it, and let the truths within it change you.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the [...] book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

John Elderedge's wife took over the writing of this book for the most part and the result is a truly moving work. Let me tell you, I can be EXTREMELY picky about Christian guidebooks (particularly ones aimed at women) because so many of them are written by well-meaning but misguided people who fill the books with unrealistic portrayals of angelic women, not to mention a good dose of the old \\"obey your husbands\\" tripe. Not only does this book have nothing of the sort, but it addresses these sorts of messages directly and reminds us of how beloved we are by God instead of telling us how short we fall of His expectations. When I first read the dust jacket, it alone made me feel as though the author had seen directly into my heart and was answering my unspoken prayers!Eldredge encourages us to be strong rather than telling us to hide behind our husbands or give up our dreams. I realize that there are some negative comments about this book, but I noticed a strange contrast between people's reasons for disliking it: some of them are feminists claiming the book puts women down, whereas others are claiming it boosts women's egos too much! Well gee, it can't be doing both, can it? For those of you who were offended by the book, Eldredge is NOT trying to describe women as fairytale-loving children; she is simply trying to address the need to be loved. The passages in the book where Eldredge discusses female warriors should be proof enough that she does NOT consider women as dainty princesses. As to the people who claim this book boosts the female ego too much...well, I'm not sure what they're thinking, but I can't say that I'm pleased with their comments. I don't see a thing wrong with trying to uplift women by telling us how Christ loves us and I can't understand why some people put down this book for doing so, particularly the ninny who claimed to be from a group called \\"ladies against feminism\\". I feel so bad for the poor woman who said, \\"As Christian women, we need to consider ourselves nothing!\\" That is a very harmful and sad way of thinking. Satan tells us we are nothing, not God; look at His sacrifice for us! And yes, that is certainly due to His goodness and not ours, but it must mean we are worth something if the God of all creation cares so for us. He also made us in His image, so to call God's children, His most precious creation \\"nothing\\" is insulting to the Holy Father as well as harmful to us. As Christians, we must humble ourselves, but that does NOT mean tearing ourselves down.There are many misconceptions with the book, one being that it raises women above men by saying that with Eve, \\"God's creation reached its zenith\\". The meaning of this is not that Eve was better than Adam, but that she was God's finishing touch to Eden, His last masterpiece. And what's wrong with saying that the world would be incomplete without women? It WOULD be rather difficult if there was only one sex, wouldn't it? I also know Eldridge offended some by saying that the word helpmate can sound mundane when applied to women. Well, it can be mundane, if it's misused or if that's all we are. There's more to women than being wives, just as there's more to men than being husbands; women weren't made to serve men. Before any of us were spouses, we were people with our own purposes to fulfill for God, and that unique purpose is still there after we marry. One very huffy person actually said \\"How dare they!\\" when accusing the authors of calling Godly women exhausted. The authors were attempting to address the harm women can do themselves if they beat themselves up trying to be nearly perfect in God's eyes; that IS a real problem that I've seen even Christian authors do.There's also a misunderstanding about the book passage that mentions a scene from \\"Titanic\\" (the one with Jack and Rose at the ship's front) and tells the reader to picture herself as Rose and Jesus as Jack standing behind her. This is NOT meant to be a romantic image of Jesus, as many seem to think; Eldredge is talking about the symbolism of Jack supporting Rose and showing her a new world. (I can't believe someone's complaint about comparing Jack to Jesus because of Jack's \\"belief\\" in fornication. Instead of nitpicking Jack's character, let's remember the fact that he makes the ultimate sacrifice for Rose and encourages her to persevere in life no matter what; sounds Christlike to me!To all the women who have a problem with the portrayal of women here, both the feminists who claim it's not strong enough and the ultra-conservatives who say it's not Christian enough, I give you this line from the book: \\"Redeemed women of God have tender, merciful hearts, backbones of steel, and hands that have been trained for battle. There is something incredibly fierce in the heart of a woman that is to be contended with, not dismissed, not disdained, but recognized, honored, welcomed and trained.\\"Doesn't this sound like a Godly, strong woman to you? I have never heard a sentence that so perfectly captures the essence of Christian womanhood. I've long wanted to be a woman both loving and fierce, and Eldredge practically took these words right out of my heart and put them in her book.There are a few comments in the book that were unnecessary; the offensive \\"three things every woman wants\\" line was a massive overgeneralization and I didn't like the silly comment that many artistic subjects are female because the male body looks ridiculous naked. Excuse me, but there's no need to insult men like that! God made Adam a perfect specimen of beauty too. These comments are outweighed by the good ones, though (IMHO) and the overall message is good. I think this gem of a book has something to offer every woman, even if it's only a small thing. Whether you are a romantic wanting to marry or an independent feminist (or both like me!) I recommend you read this and rejoice in Christ's perfect love for you!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I devoured this book in three days. Although the language gets a bit flowery at times and overly dramatic for me, I did take home some key messages. The main message that stood out to me is that what does being created a woman say about God. What does the creation of Eve say about God? What does your life say about God? Why is God Captivated by Eve and by you? The book encourages the reader to look deeper into themselves and into the Holy Spirit inside to discover what makes their hearts uniquely feminine and uniquely them.I did not get a sense, like other readers, from the book to be passive and to wait to be rescued. I think they point to the contrary, either women are too passive or too controlling. Spiritual battles are fought every single day, and as women they call for us to be active and go to battle with God and with each other to maintain the peace that the Lord offers all believers.Stasi and John look at two visions of Eve, Fallen and Redeemed. The Fallen Eve has to have control and has to keep on tasting the forbidden fruit. We can be the Redeemed, Forgiven Eve not through control, good works, manipulation, or legalism, but through the promises that God offers us.If the reader does not get anything else from Captivating, they will get that God put certain abilities, skills, interests, traits, etc. for the glory of God and to use and to manage them well will be Captivating for themselves and for others."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"By stating what women really want up front, the authors assume that all women are the same -- and that if they're not, they ought to be. I don't want to \\"play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure,\\" this meaning, someone else's adventure (a man's). I've always loved going out and having adventures, being adventurous through life in various ways. Being with a man has always hindered that. Fathers are protective, husbands can be controlling or uninterested in adventure.This grossly erroneous assumption about women from the outset casts the book on a very shaky foundation. By now I'm used to being \\"wrong\\" and \\"bad\\" for not being a stereotypical feminine Christian woman, and I understand that some women really truly are that way at heart. But the authors don't seem to understand that as foundationally as they are themselves, I'm equally myself. Different. Millions of women don't fit their mold, at a core level.I hope future books written by these authors will address all women, not just how they think all women are, or think all women *should* be."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"When I first began to read Captivating expected it to be based on Christian beliefs. As I continued reading, I found this was not true. The book makes many references to popular fiction (fairy tales, books, movies) while including just enough scripture to be considered spiritual. Even when considering the book from a secular point of view, it did not make sense. It presented ideas that were contradictory to one another and did not address the contradiction. I never felt sure about the message of the book; it went in circles without reaching conclusions."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating is the complimentary book for women to the book Wild at Heart for men by John Eldredge. In it the Eldredges describe the things that every woman longs for: to reveal beauty, to be romanced, and to be a part of a great adventure. They dig down to examine things like why little girls like to twirl around and play dress up. Another component is the discussion of relationships and how women are very much relationally oriented and many times define their well being by how their relationships are going. These may include relationships with friends, a husband/significant other, those they act as a mother to (whether their own children or other people), or their relationships as a daughter.The Eldredges describe how vital it is that a woman develops foremost her relationship with God and fills up the desires of their heart with Him rather than seeking it from other relationships whether those be their husband, children, parents, or friends. Ultimately, they must get those heart desires answered by The Bridegroom.Throughout the book, they use examples from both the Bible and popular movies/books. Some may be uncomfortable with the large number of examples from fiction vis a vis strictly Biblical examples. My feeling was that some of the examples from fictional stories may help the reader gain a perspective on femininity from stories they enjoy outside of the Bible.I was not able to personally identify with some of the components of the book but believe it would be a good read for any woman to gain a greater understanding of the desires of her heart or men who want a glimpse into how women work."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I want to find a woman who is strong on her own, and whose strength will not eclipse mine, but enhance it. Perhaps this is how one comes to be twenty-five years old, well-educated, itinerant in life, and still single. In many ways I am guilty of couch-potato-hood in the realm of romance because I have despaired of ever finding what it is I have sought for nearly a decade. But a ray of hope shines through.The Eldredge's \\"Captivating\\" has articulated possibilities whose existence I had begun to doubt. It claims that women can be both strong and feminine, and it does such a persuasive job that even a skeptic like me can believe it. My girl friends have found their freedom in this book--freedom from lies that have plagued them for years. I have found a cause to fight for, a host of new ways to affirm the women I know, to free them to be who they were made to be. It has been so long since I wept at a non-fiction book, but this one has reawakened a longing I stuffed down a long time ago, a longing for something I thought didn't exist--until now.Women, recommend this to your men. Men, care enough to read it and ask honest, vulnerable questions.ALong"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"No, I'm not a kid, but had to review this tripe.This book claims to tap into the deep, hidden desires of every woman. Let me tell you something, any time a book ( other than the bible) purports to teach something that applies to ALL people, or ALL of some kind of people, it's not true.I distinctly recall the games I played as a little girl, none of which involved being a princess, and being rescued. I was a missionary, an explorer, an escapee, but never the helpless victim. It was a boring role to play then, and a boring role to play now. I believe my childish game in which my brother and I fought until we both agreed to stop ( not because either of us had won, of course) would not quite fit \\"Captivating's\\" enchanting and dull view of woman.Did God create Amy Carmicheal? Or Gladys Alward? They didn't exactly fit the princess category. Both worked like dogs, and neither married. Both were blessed by God.Christian authors who attempt to generalize, and say that this applies to EVERY WOMAN/MAN inevitably run smack into people like me. Or Amy, or Gladys.See, there's good stuff in the book, but ultimately, I felt like I usually do with these books: smacked over the head with a narrow-minded perception of a \\"Christian\\" ideal from which one cannot deviate and be a true man/woman.I also read the author's husband's book, which was better than this one, and better than I expected. However, their joint views are terrible. It seems to be summed up in this1. God has a specific plan for every man to follow, a will for his life.2. If you're a woman, basically, you marry and are take along on that man's adventure.It leaves no room for God having a specific plan for a woman. What about Mary Slessingar, the missionary who broke an engagement to follow God's calling? The fiery redhead missionary of inner Africa? Should she have simply married this man and followed him on His Big Adventure, which consisted of lingering in the more civilized, preached-at coastal regions?Not all of us want to be an emaciated princess ( check the cover of this book...is her midriff bare?) and not all of us are longing for a knight in shining armor. Many of us are out of the tower, and hoping to meet the shining knight, side by side in the midst of battle, both having followed God's call.This book just plays on the whole princess theme, which purportedly is the deepest heart---and I guess the best heart of womanhood. Not to mention that most, if not all of these original tales were written by MEN, who naturally couldn't have the troublesome medieval female troubling them on their adventures, and thus conveniently put them in castles, or towers, or other out of the way places.Maybe this selfish, RESCUE ME idea is just that---selfish, and un-Christian idea that has no actual place in Scripture. Maybe that's why it left a sour taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Although I was initally excited about the captivating study guide, as I progressed I became more disturbed. In Chapter 6, The author relates our relationship to God in a sexual way by using the Song of Solomon. I believe the Song of Solomon to be an allergory of a husband of wife relationship. It disturbs me to think that we could relate to God in such a preverse way. This could be a very confusing study guide for those new in their faith or that are sexually active. I believe this to be a distortion and misinterpretation of scripture. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"A must read for every woman searching. This was given to me as a gift during a time when I really needed support and it was perfect. Truly a blessing. I have since given it to 4 women. If you are a woman wondering about worth, beauty and are looking for answers, this could be it."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I waded through a ton of these reviews after I had read the book and wow... some people obviously do not understand what the book was about.ONE: as another reviewer said, if you are such a strong woman that doesn't need to be rescued then why do you have a relationship with Jesus? He came to SAVE each one of us individually. And it isn't just a one time deal...it is continual and eternal. Thus, would it not make sense, that God would plant a longing somewhere in our heart too be saved by someone larger than life?TWO: Goodness, I could not believe that so many people were up in arms about the idea of God being a lover. It isn't a new idea and it doesn't mean you dream about making out with Jesus... For instance: nuns. They wed themselves to Christ. I highly doubt they fantasize about having sex with God. Seriously. What is sex but a device, created by God, for two people to become one and unite in love? How does one unite with God? Is it not by accepting him, by bringing him into your heart? By loving him above all else? And knowing that to him, you are beyond precious. How can you believe in the Christian God and the sacrifice his son made if you cannot believe that God sees you individually and loves you in a deep and unique way that no human mind or heart could ever fully comprehend or repay? Why, then, is it wrong to see God as the ultimate Lover? He invites us to have a personal relationship with him and what is more personal than taking him as the love of your life?I know I am his darling and when the world is too much for me and I sit by my window crying, feeling like an utter failure, the Lord is there with his arms around me, letting me cry and telling me it will all be okay, that he loves me more than than I could comprehend and he will never leave.God is an infinite being and it is laughable too think about him in human terms, but that is all we have and he knows that, he made it that way. \\"Captivating\\" puts it across in terms that are easy and familiar. It is an introduction, not a definition. It is aimed at those who have been hurt, who have locked themselves away from God and from men. Not really those who are already firm Christians.THREE: If you were a tomboy, that's great. But you don't have to use a condescending tone when talking about those who weren't. I was both. I played dress-up with my sisters and I caught bullfrogs in the pond. I had dreams of being a hero in wars and had dreams of some handsome man rescuing me. But you know what? I never would have admitted the latter to anyone, much less the fact that such dreams (both kinds) continued indefinitely.When I walk down a dark alley at night in the city my heart beats faster, I clutch my can of mace, and think about the self-defense moves I know. And I never admit to anyone that I would feel safer if my boyfriend were walking with me.When someone says something nasty to me and I choke up, unable to respond, so incredibly hurt that it takes my power of speech away, I am beyond grateful when my boyfriend jumps to my defense telling the other that they just can't speak like that to me. And I am thankful to him for *trying* to protect me and fight my fights with for for me. Key word: trying.Why is that wrong? All through my teenage years and now into my young adult years I was ashamed of these sorts of thoughts. I was a strong woman. I could take care of myself.I have goals and ambitions and they are sensible. I don't need a guy in my life. I have never been deeply wounded by a guy. Never let him treat me as an object or someone less than he. Never would I let a guy talk down to me and in my relationships I definitely play an equal role. (the fact that I have to state these things, to qualify myself, is in itself ridiculous.)This book doesn't advocate submission or the giving over of your will to a man. It reserves that for God (remember, God is your ultimate love). But it does let you feel comfortable, in the world of today, with holding your guy's hand when you walk down that alley-- and knowing that he will take care of you, at risk to himself, willingly. I mean, wow, he IS physically stronger than I am-- and a lot more intimidating. And he gets the cutest look when I tell him I feel safe when he is near.Society has turned the word feminine into something weak, stupid, and obviously unenlightened. It is so refreshing, incredibly refreshing, to read a book where femininity and the desires therein are held up as true gifts from God to the one he loves.So, that's my own little treatise on the book. I give it four stars because it seems a bit hastily written and not well put together, though the ideas are wonderful. And obviously, it isn't the Bible nor a flawless divine interpretation."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is captivating! Really. Well-written, each chapter impacts you and leaves you with the question, \\"How can there be any further revelation?\\" and then there is. It doesn't cater to the perfect woman, nor does it impose any 'burdens' on you to be one. Rather, it explains why you are stressed, frustrated and not living the life God intended for you but hiding behind the mask of dominating or desolate woman (or in my case, flip-flopping between both). Prepare for tears, even if you think you are a strong woman - God is waiting to reach you in this book and make you understand how truly captivating you are."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I went to the Captivating Retreat in 2005. It changed my life. I experienced God and the Holy Spirit in a new intimate, exciting way. This book is based on that teaching. It is biblical, it is powerful...it is something the Enemy doesn't want women to know. I'm actually leading a women's study on this book...using the DVD series available on the RansomedHeart.com website. Got the books thru Amazon. I'm humbled and honored to be chosen to lead women to healing, and glory thru Jesus...who said this as his mission statement \\"I've come to heal the broken-hearted and set the captives free\\". Jesus isn't about a religion as it is about a relationship...in fact as you'll learn in this excellent book...it's a ROMANCE. If your heart is heavy, if you want to live your fullest life...if you're curious how you as a woman reflect the female side of God, get this book and hear the truth of who you are and why the things that stir your heart, also stir the heart of God.

Although I found some insights worth reading the book for, I was a little put off with the language by which she conveyed her ideas, (e.g. At one point she refers to Jesus in his role as a Lover. Not as in, the Lover of my Soul, but more of a sexual connotation. Kind of, Jesus, my Luva') and I did not necessarily agree with her total theology. She also relied way too heavily on pop culture references and heavy injections of melodrama. After the third story about incest and rape, you think to yourself - I am just not wounded enough to read this book!Eldredge states that the question deep in every woman's heart is, \\"Am I lovely?\\". The group of ladies that I was meeting with to discuss the book universally agreed that this was not our question. Not one of us were consumed with heart-rending doubts about if we looked cute that day. Now as you read further, it can be understood that what the author means by that question is - Am I loveable? I think that she really had the start of a good idea with her theme that God has written some desires on your heart that are just for you! And the blessing of a \\"gentle and quiet spirit\\" is not just for women that have it all together, are good time managers, and have nicely shaped nails! But the idea is lost between too many movie references and not enough sound scriptural advice. Overall, the book did not live up to my expectations, and I have concerns that newer Christians may not have enough of a grounding in biblical knowledge to weed through the fluff without being completely confused."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The way you respond to this book has a lot to do with how you see yourself. If you're a woman who sees herself as a wounded bird or an ugly duckling that nobody loves, maybe this book is for you. If you need constant reassurance that God loves you, maybe you'll like the notion that Jesus is your strapping hero right out of the pages of a romance novel. If you see yourself as a victim in need of 'healing' or rescue, this book might appeal to you.But if you're a strong, healthy, and capable woman, you'll probably find the book not very relevant. I'm not perfect, there are things I'm working on, and there are things in my life that I'd like to change, but I wouldn't describe myself as a wounded bird waiting to be rescued. The need to feel 'captivating' is on a par with the need to feel like a world-class chef or a Pulitzer-winning writer -- it'd be nice, but it's not my overriding concern.And I'm not sure what kind of marital relationship the Eldredges have, but I don't look to my husband to \\"fight for me.\\" I want his support and respect and love, but I don't need him to start a fight and then claim he's doing it for me. I think he's a lot smarter than that.Sorry, can't give it more than 2 stars -- and those two stars are in the hope that most women aren't as damaged, weak or victimized as this book presumes."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I picked this book up and read it in a week. I loved it. Having grown up in a Christian home I have heard and seen a lot about how the church believes a woman of God should be. I really related a lot to the points that the authors made. I have found that after reading the book I saw a lot of their principals throughout life every day. It's also pointed me back to the Bible, and more specifically to the Old testament. I haven't been able to relate much to God the Father because I've always seen Him as a judge, however after reading this book I realized that I have His characteristics too. God gave me characteristics of a woman for a reazon. I read some of the negative coments others have posted and it saddens me. Some points are valid, howevre I want to tell the women, read it again! I'm finding that it's written for every woman and it's transforming how I view this amazing God that we serve.Read it! Enjoy it!

Yet, in order to accept these truths, we must first work through our wounded pasts, be aware of those who aim to thwart our efforts, and embrace the love that is only offered to us through Christ our Lord.Well written and inspirational, Captivating has become a widely read and lauded women's study. I was often surprised by my inner responses to the theories being revealed, and John and Stasi's interpretation of scripture. Although I did not always agree with certain contextual inferences, I did find the book beneficial overall.I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [..] book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend a few years ago but I had never ended up reading it. My teenage daughter came home one day recently and wanted to know if I knew anything about it. It had been recommended to her by a couple of her girl friends so I ended up buying it. She has read it twice since then and I have read it once - my book group ended up selecting it for our July book since they were intrigued about it when I mentioned it to them.When I look at the reviews, people have very strong opinions and either love it or hate it with very little in between. In my case, I am more of an \\"in-between\\" leaning toward the positive side. To be honest, it took me a while to get into it since the premise is that all women want three things in life: 1) to be swept up in romance, 2) to have a great adventure, and 3) to be beautiful (captivating). On the surface, I had an immediate reaction that they didn't know THIS woman and I really wasn't buying it. Keeping on and moving through the pages while trying to remain open, I came to understand what they mean by these three things and it isn't what immediately came to my own mind. For example: The whole \\"beauty\\" thing made me immediately think about women who are young, thin, blond, gorgeously dressed and beautiful (our society's definition) and not only do I not fit that, I don't really aspire too -- for example, shopping for clothing is something I avoid at all costs. When I better understood what they meant by the term \\"beautiful\\" - more related to inner tranquility and a heart at rest - I was totally able to buy into what they were saying.There is a premise here that most women have been damaged in some way, all in varying degrees. While many women may feel differently, I largely agree. Some have been hurt dramatically and some have only had hurtful comments made over the years that they have internalized and believed. Regardless of which camp we fall into (or somewhere in between), even those small things can take root and have a huge impact on our lives and decisions as we grow older. It's my belief that many women are carrying something around with them that they are not even aware of until they look deep for some reason and it's there, waiting to be uncovered. There were a few times that I was absolutely shocked to find something that I thought was my own deep, dark thought was in print on a published page and other women had the same feelings that I did.Whether or not you believe every single sentence in this book, if you read it with an open mind, you can still learn something -- or at least challenge yourself about how your life is unfolding and if it's what you want it to be. It can be unsettling and I don't hold the same beliefs the authors do on every single topic, but it still was an excellent read for someone who wants to learn more about themselves and question the status quo."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I was very excited about receiving my 1st book called Captivating by John & Stasi Eldredge. It is a New York Times Bestseller. The cover is beautiful, a white vellum with gold accents, and it's very appealing. What do they say about not judging a book by it's cover?The first few chapter's were indeed interesting. Some good points were made about the importance of Women in God's eyes. Another important point is that the enemy is really out to undermine our femininity, and our roles as God would have them. For me, this was the take home message.Then the book started to get weird. The authors use ALOT of references to movies, songs, and pop culture in general. The scripture references were used out of context in many instances. Some were disturbing, for instance they implied that Jesus should be seen as our \\"lover\\". As in husband lover, not just someone that loves us unconditionally. They used references from the Song of Solomon to back up this odd claim. Creepy and out of context in my humble opinion. I thought the writing was dis-jointed and often jumped around. It was confusing to tell which author was speaking at the time, John or Stasi.I noticed in reading other's reviews that this is an either \\"love it or hate it\\" type book. I guess I fall in the category of hate it. I do not think it's theologically sound and although there are some good points to be found, overall it does not send a good message to women.So now my dilemma is, what do I do with my book that I really can't recommend to other's?Disclaimer: This book was provided to me free from Thomas Nelson in exchange for an honest review."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have read several different types of reviews, either one way or the other. Hating or loving this book. Buy, for me personally I am going to take it like it is. This is a book that uplifts women and helps them to truly understand the women that God initially created. A very deep and insightful book. It will make you think about who you are in Christ and it will cause you to look at your life. I love books that make me do that.If you are a Christan that watches very few secular movies, then the comparisons and references to fictional characters is will be lost to you. Eldridge gives a lot of references to the secular movies and fiction. I get where the thought was in the reference, the author is trying to tie in the secular worlds way of relating, because so many of US are part of the worlds culture. As Christians we watch t.v. and watch movies at the theatres. So, for those Christians bashing Eldridge for his references, please take the speak out of your own eye! Some Christians will get the references and some wont... Google what you don't get.This is just a rehashing of Eldridge's Wild at Heart. But, it is pertaining to the female audience. I do believe that God gave Eldridge a insight into female and male. Yes, I believe that they are trying to sale these books in many different ways and it might start to look like mass production. But, I will stick with Jesus and take from these books what He reveals to my heart and then I will pass this book on to another female. If nothing else it is a great book for personal growth!I received this book free from BookSneeze as part of their book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review.

Without disregarding the \\"individual\\", the book delves into commonalities shared by women through God's design. Topics include woman's purpose, fulfillment of her desires, the worst enemies of her desires, paths to healing and encouragement to use womanhood to support the body of Christ.I LOVE this book. The first time I read it, my heart was opened to the mysterious of myself as a women. I discovered many of my \\"quirks\\" were really part of God's design; some of my \\"weaknesses\\" were actually strengths. I learned how to heal from hurts I never realized were an assault against my God-given womanhood. Now, I am encouraged to grow in my beauty as a woman, in spirit, soul and body; to live boldly for God's purpose for me.I really appreciate all John & Stasi's work, for many reasons, but one is simply for the fact they write together. Their shared work provides a well-rounded approach to all the topics. They are well grounded in Scripture as well, speaking life and hope into their readers while discussing the hard topics. It is evident God uses their words to bring healing.I highly recommend this book for women AND men.

Sadly, when women grow up, they are often swept up into a life filled merely with duty and demands. Many Christian women are tired and struggling under the weight of the pressure to be a \\"good servant,\\" a nurturing caregiver, or a capable home manager.By revealing the core desires every woman shares- to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a grand adventure, and to unveil beauty-John and Stasi Eldredge invite women to recover their feminine hearts, created in the image of an intimate and passionate God.Join us as we journey into the deep mysteries of our feminine souls in order to recapture our hearts.My Review:When I first saw this book available for review on BookSneeze I was very excited. I had heard excellent things about it. I have to admit I have had a hard time getting into it. Usually once I get stared reading a book I can't put it down. That wasn't the case with Captivating. The writing style is very accessible and there is an abundant use of good quotes and stories which make the book easy to read.John and Stasi remind us that women think, feel, and process differently. In theory, I agree with the authors intentions. The use of scripture often times seemed out of context.I wish they would have done more to describe who I am as a woman loved by God rather than a woman trying to be the princess in a fairytale trying to be found by my prince.The Authors:John Eldredge's BiographyJohn Eldredge is an author (you probably figured that out), a counselor, and teacher. He is also president of Ransomed Heart, a ministry devoted to helping people discover the heart of God, recover their own heart in his love, and learn to live in his Kingdom. John grew up in the suburbs of Los Angeles (which he hated), and spent his boyhood summers on his grandfather's cattle ranch in eastern Oregon (which he loved). John met his wife Stasi in high school (in drama class). But their romance did not begin until they each came to faith in Christ, after high school. John earned his undergraduate degree in Theater at Cal Poly, and directed a theater company in Los Angeles for several years before moving to Colorado with Focus on the Family, where he taught at the Focus on the Family Institute.John earned his master's degree in Counseling from Colorado Christian University, under the direction of Larry Crabb and Dan Allender. He worked as a counselor in private practice before launching Ransomed Heart in 2000. John and Stasi live in Colorado Springs with their three sons (Samuel, Blaine and Luke), their golden retriever (Oban), and two horses (Whistle and Kokolo). While all of this is factually true, it somehow misses describing an actual person. He loves the outdoors passionately, and all beauty, Shakespeare, bow hunting, a good cigar, anything having to do with adventure, poetry, March Madness, working in the shop, fly fishing, classic rock, the Tetons, fish tacos, George MacDonald, green tea, buffalo steaks, dark chocolate, wild and open places, horses running, and too much more to name. He also uses the expression \\"far out\\" way too much.Stasi Eldredge's BiographyStasi Eldredge loves writing and speaking to women about the goodness of God. Stasi received her Bachelors Degree in Sociology from San Diego State University which she attended primarily because it was close to the beach. She became a Christian her junior year in college and dove into the ministry of Campus Crusade for Christ. After graduating, Stasi joined Youth for Christ heading up a ministry to pregnant teenagers and teen mothers. She has been active in ministry. She spent her childhood years in Prairie Village, Kansas for which she is truly grateful. Her family moved to Southern California back in the really bad smog days when she was ten. She loved theatre and acting and took a partiaever since including theatre ministry, crisis pregnancy center ministry, women's ministry and children's ministry. The Eldredge family moved to Colorado in 1991.Stasi loves the joy and freedom that comes from knowing the passionate, stunning love of Jesus Christ and lives to see others come to know him more deeply. She loves worship music, time to bake, celebrating life, getting lost in a good novel, baths, walking in the woods, hearing her son's laughter, the sound of wind in the trees, a good cup of coffee, the smell of the earth after it rains, a powerful turn of a phrase, animals in the wild, gardens, freshly mowed grass, family traditions, cherished friendships, the Tetons, rivers, mountain lakes, the grace and beauty of horses, the affection of her dog and most of all her family and her God."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"John and Stasi Eldredge revise and update this runaway bestseller.What Wild at Heart did for men, Captivating is doing for women.

It takes the reader through 3 things a woman's heart longs for: to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure and to unveil beauty. Stasi Eldredge weaves in stories of her life experiences and does a good job of utilizing Scripture. John Eldredge chimes in here and there to provide a man's perspective and experiences.I have to admit that I was not captivated by Captivating. I have had a great deal of trouble getting into the book and finding interest. I believe in the message of the book. I love that it is not another woman's book that emphasizes doing more, more, more! I value the use of Scripture. I just have had trouble turning the pages for some reason. I am still in the first half of the book. I do plan on working my way through it.

This book used very descriptive language and immediately had my attention to find out why we as women have a desire to be captivating. This book was about discovering who you are a woman and explored this by diving into many deep and sometimes disturbing stories. They used many excerpts from well known movies, books, poems, quotes and Bible passages to help the reader understand certain concepts related to discovering the beauty within. They kept going back to the questions- Am I captivating? Do I have a beauty of my own? These were not shallow questions and were answered quite humbly and thoroughly.I really liked most of the content of this book and I think it has a message for all women to embrace their femininity as God planned. However, since both John and Stasi wrote this book, I was confused at times who was actually writing in parts of the book. I was also confused whether they were emphasizing being captivated by a man or God. Overall, I think it has a timely message for every woman and many would benefit from the healing prayers included."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"There is so much to this book that it's hard for me to summarize briefly. It's about what God created women for and how to get back to WHO God created you to be. This isn't your typical how-to-be-a-woman-of-God book in that it doesn't offer a list of what you should be doing, rather it gets to the roots of WHO you are, WHO God created you to be, WHY you are the way you are. To take it from the back cover: \\"The message of Captivating is this: Your heart matters more than anything else in all of creation.\\"I, honestly, was somewhat skeptical coming into reading this book, but it sounded interesting so I gave it a try. And it is GOOD. I couldn't believe how quickly it drew me in - for this type of book that is R-A-R-E! I found myself just drinking this book in. This book was talking to me Stasi gets me. This is a powerful, amazing book. It was a real eye-opener in so many ways. It helped me see how Satan has been tying me down, cutting me off from God's power and love. It made me rethink a LOT of things. I intend to re-read this book somewhat regularly - every year or two - because I think this is something that is constantly a work in progress, and regular refreshers will help keep me progressing in the right direction.

My reasoning was that if no one wants me romantically, why bother keeping those sections of the museum open? It's less painful that way...Or so I thought until I started reading Captivating.We can try to deny our innermost feelings and longings, but we can't eliminate them completely without killing our souls in the process. This book reminded me of that.Captivating isn't about marriage, although the topic is discussed. Addressing both single and married women, the book talks about how God designed women to be, and part of that is a core desire to be wanted, pursued and romanced. Not the degrading, soul-killing, thinly veiled lust for sexual gratification the world calls romance, but a sacred romance that comes from being appreciated and wanted for who we are both inside and out.Not casual reading or a quick fix, is an excellent tool to help you heal emotionally and see yourself in a way that's vital to your wellbeing.

On the five-year anniversary of the New York Times Bestseller, John and Stasi Eldredge have taken the opportunity to revise and update it. This version is just a little bit sharper and a little more relevant. The additions are barely noticeable, but, if you've read it before you may notice some of them.What I really enjoy about Captivating is how it draws parallels between the needs of a woman's heart and that of God's heart. I enjoyed this book in 2005 and I still enjoyed it in 2010. John and Stasi are honest and very aware of how the church (and other Christian books) have treated women for years.

This is a different concept than what many women hear in the world and in the church community even. John and Stasi touch on several hard topics, such as healing a wounded heart and even how a woman's heart is supported and supporting of a man's heart. From the time we are very little, we're always trying to play princess and have someone notice that we are beautiful, and in this book, John and Stasi say that that's okay and completely normal. We were built for that. This book was definitely not very preachy, but there were times that a background knowledge of the Bible was helpful.

The confirmation was life-changing, providing a launching point to move forward in spiritual and emotional growth.In the chapter entitled, \\"Wounded,\\" they write,\\"Our wounds strike at the core of our femininity. The damage done to our feminine hearts through the wounds we received is made much worse by the horrible things we believe about ourselves as a result.

The book promises to reveal what it means to be a woman and how to live the life of a woman as God intended on a day to day basis.The thesis of the work is a philosophy of gender reasoned as follows:1. Gender is imprinted at the spiritual level on the soul and not just in our physical form and genes.According to the authors, this principle is suggested by the contextual language of the versus in Genesis describing creation. Specifically, the verse dictating that God made mankind, MALE AND FEMALE, in his image. The authors argue that based on this inclusive language, both men and women represent the spiritual image of God and so it follows both genders display/embody attributes of God at a spiritual level.2. Women reflect the following attributes of God: romance, adventure, and beauty.Using numerous scripture references, the authors do a good job of demonstrating that romance (the call to pursuit; the quiet whisper that says I am here for you when you are ready, pursue me), adventure (intrinsically linked to grand, meaningful action), and beauty (the restful respite that takes your breath away and makes you feel at ease like a beautiful garden or gentle river or fresh cut flowers) are all attributes of God. However, I think John and Stasi fail to lead the readers through any well reasoned, logical proofs on why these three attributes are specifically tied to women. Instead, they merely provide examples of women who embody these attributes and use parenthetical questions such as \\"(don't you agree?)\\" to push the reader to accept their conclusions.Do I agree with this premise? It does seem that I've been imprinted to the depths of *my* soul with a desire to be pursued, with a quest for adventure, and with a passion to be beautiful inside and out. But I'm not every woman, and I'm not sure I'm at all comfortable prescribing these desires for all women as ordained by God. It's especially hard at times to reconcile the desire to exemplify beauty and respite as Godly with the current push of the Western world for women to be harder and aggressive. When I was a younger woman and wanted to be pleasant and gentle and restful to others I accepted the desire as part of who I was. When I was in my 20s, business classes (and women's studies) taught me that being pleasant, gentle, and restful are qualities women are merely trained into by a sexist oppressive culture and that it would do us good to free ourselves from the shackle of these desires. Studies are often trotted out to show the #1 reason men succeed over women in the business world is because they aren't constrained with a desire to be pleasant, gentle, and restful to others and that when women adopt the posture and attitude of men they too outpace the rest of their female colleagues in rank and pay (but sadly they experience more marital and relationship discord and are not well liked). And now here comes John and Stasi asserting that being pleasant, gentle, and restful to others are the very embodiment of God within us. Are they right, or are they fools and tools of the patriarch?3. Women are most fulfilled and most useful in serving God's kingdom when they cultivate and embody these feminine attributes of God.According to the authors, women are uniquely qualified to draw others into the kingdom and enrich the lives of others in discipleship when we cultivate these attributes I've detailed above. We can move hearts and mountains with our inviting hearts, our adventurous spirits, and our gentle and soothing beauty. Not only are we most effective when we focus on romance, adventure, and beauty but we are most joyful and fulfilled. Again, in lieu of providing reasoned arguments as to the validity of this premise, here the authors simply provide examples of women who are working life in line with this philosophy and suggest readers give it a try to see what fruit it bears. They also caution that by ignoring this principle and showing neglect in providing careful cultivation, these attributes will remain, as they are part of our souls, but they will grow weedy and untamed, resulting in a personality that is to either extreme of the attribute (aggressive and off putting/needy and clingy and desperate; reckless/listless and uninspiring; vain or harsh/frumpy or uninviting).The authors acknowledged that cultivating these feminine attributes can be a challenge. First, since such cultivation will further God's kingdom, evil forces will actively oppose our progress. Additionally, as mentioned above, there is currently a counter-cultural backlash pushing women to abandon these attributes and cultivate a more masculine attitude to get ahead. Finally, there is a very real fear and danger that offering these qualities to the world (and displaying vulnerability) will get you stomped on and abused. Try telling sexual assault victims that to be fulfilled they need to cultivate allure (not sexual, but personality), respite, and gentleness. There are some brief words on proper context (the author's aren't suggesting while being beaten a woman smiles and radiates beauty) but otherwise the readers are challenged to find a way to embody these attributes no matter the evil that should oppose them, no matter the western world social or business consequences, and despite the vulnerable risk it comes packaged with.-------------------------------------------------------------------An additional idea the authors offer is that Lucifer has a special hatred of women, stemming from his envy of her beauty and his opposition to her relationship building, that fuels much of the historical oppression and degradation of women in our world. The authors detail the scripture references to Lucifer's beauty as they construct the foundation for this conclusion. There isn't really a call to action suggested by this theory; the authors simply want to make women aware of the greater context of women's issues with regard to spiritual warfare. I like conspiracy theories so this premise appealed to me. Is it possible that women have been oppressed from time eternal not just because we are, on average, physically weaker but because there is a demonic plot working against us? Interesting to ponder.Outside of the content of the book, the writing itself is average. It's written in an easy, conversational format."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"With much respect to the authors of Captivating, there are several aspects of this book that make it hard for me to recommend it. The book does bring up some valid, true points about a woman's deep desire to be found beautiful and captivating. The solution to this desire presented in Captivating doesn't come from the true Word of God, however. Why? Because it keeps \\"self\\"alive. Captivating tries to convince us that we can look inward and find worth, beauty, and value within ourselves. It keeps the focus on us; on our feelings, our attributes, and our beauty. The problem I have with this notion is that beauty isn't from us. The true beauty that women should want to possess comes from Christ and Christ alone. Christ in us is beauty in its purest form. The Bible makes it very clear that we weren't born into beauty. We were born into sin. God made us wonderfully and beautifully but us as human beings, by nature, we are sinful. The authors of Captivating, in my opinion, missed this part of scripture. Captivating says, \\"We want you to hear clearly that beauty is an essence every woman carries from the moment of her creation. The only things standing in the way of our beauty are our doubts and fears and the hiding and striving we fall to as a result\\" (Captivating). From the very moment the original sin was committed, human beings are born into sin. It's Jesus in us that makes us beautiful. Our self-loving nature wants us to buy into the idea that in and of ourselves we are important and captivating. Yet God's word is based on the truth that Christ loved us even while we were still sinners. That's not to say we don't have any value at all. God sees us as valuable but that's not because we possess anything worthwhile of ourselves. It is because God Himself is Love. HE longs to rescue us from our ugly, sinful selves. To be clear, I am I not saying that no one should read this book. Captivating does offer some valuable insight. However, it's absolutely essential to keep in mind that we alone are nothing without Christ."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"In their book Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul, John & Stasi Eldrege share their journey in discovering and healing a woman's soul. There are 12 chapters followed by an epilogue, prayer for salvation, daily prayer for freedom, and prayer for sexual healing.I know this book has been highly acclaimed by many people. However, I just could not connect with it. It has set on my nightstand for months now because each time I would pick it up to read it, I just could not relate to it.

This book is poorly reserched. By the end the same concepts, ideas, and statments are no more than reworded and placed on the page. It tells a woman what she wants to hear - that God loves us and created each of us as a beautiful woman. However its' lack of reaserch stops us there. We feel cheated, like the annoyed person telling you what you want to hear in hopes that you will shut up and get over it. If perhaps the authors had set down and researched the concept rather than pushing a deadline in hopes of adding cash to their pockets we would have seen God working through them. Instead we see a follower of God following the world."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"\\"Captivating\\" is the companion book toWild at Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man's Soul, written specifically for women. It seeks to explain and restore godly femininity. From the blurb:\\"Your heart matters more than anything else in all creation. The desires you had as a little girl and the longings you still feel as a woman are telling you of the life God created you to live. He offers to come now as the Hero of your story, to rescue your heart and release you to live as a fully alive and feminine woman. A woman who is truly captivating.\\"It took me a long time to read this book. In the introduction, the authors say, \\"As a new Christian, the first book I (Stasi) picked up to read on godly feminity I threw across the room. I never picked it up again.\\" Funny, that's how I felt about \\"Captivating\\". The authors claim, \\"There is no 'one size fits all' pattern for God's women,\\" then proceed to build a book based on a one size fits all description of femininity. They never explain it, they just assume that you have the same views they do. I found the generalisations really irritating. Things such as, \\"[Men] are the less complicated of the two genders... Both men and women know this to be true\\", or, \\"Whatever else we know about women, we know they are relational creatures to their cores. While little boys are killing one another in mock battles on the playground, little girls are negotiating relationships... This is so second nature, so assumed among women that it goes unnoticed by them. They care more about relationships that just about anything else.\\" If you hold these same beliefs, you won't have a problem with them, but I found it difficult to stomach such bold-faced generalisations that seem to be accepted as fact.In a word, this book was \\"American\\". There are more references to movies than to the bible. The authors seem to assume that all their readers will come from the same cultural background as they do. As someone who doesn't, I found many of the references and assumptions incomprehensible.I know I am giving the impression that I didn't like this book, but once you get through all the annoying sexism and purple prose, there are actually some gems to be found. It's actually worth reading, but be prepared to wade through a lot of rubbish."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I was really excited about this book because a lot of my friends have read it and loved it. I am not a huge reader but I have read books that I have loved. But for some reason this one could not keep my attention.

I have to say I was a little disappointed with this book after reading its male counterpart, Wild at Heart, written by John Eldredge. While that book is more level and matter of fact, Captivating is true to its female roots with more emotion and unnecessary words and stories. Maybe not unnecessary, just excessive. It discusses how women have hopes and dreams that are lost in reality. But it also explains how a woman was designed and what she is to become through God's purpose for her.Captivating appears to be a book you either really love or really don't like. It doesn't have a lot of \\"meat\\" and is more of a \\"skimmer\\" book. I was able to skim through the entire book and still understand its message. For me, I didn't particularly like Captivating, so I encourage you to read it and decide for yourself if it's noteworthy."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book has a really good message. The message is to become a good Christian woman by finding your true beauty within yourself and by filling your heart with God. The book talks a lot about beauty and finding your true beauty through God because we were made in God's image. I think the authors definitely got to the point, but it seems to circle around a lot. They rambled a lot and kept restating what they had already stated but with different words. It was a little bit repetitive. I think the book could have been summed up in a shorter book. Do not get me wrong, this is a good book especially for girls/women who are struggling with their inner beauty and are trying to find out who they really are. It is a good book for those who seek to be a godly woman."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"A couple of months ago, Thomas Nelson Publishers sent me the book Captivating (Revised and Expanded): Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul by John & Stasi Eldredge. I had given my mom the first version of this book as a birthday present a while back, but I had never gotten around to borrowing and reading it. Many of the men in my life have read John's book Wild at Heart and gave it rave reviews, so I was excited to read this female version.While the title may be Captivating, I did not find the book to be. It was an extremely slow read and took many months to finish. The premise of the book is to reveal the inner desires of a woman's heart. According to the Eldredges, a woman desires to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty. They go through each of these points in great detail showing us how all women have these desires deep down even if they don't realize it. In their opinion, we have misconstrued ideas of beauty and romance because of some hurt we had in our past. They stated that they wrote this book to let you know that healing of your feminine heart is available and to let you know that it is available.Overall, the book made some great points but they just took a long time to getting to their points by using lots of movie quotes and antidotes. I felt like they could have made their point much faster and clearer if they had made their chapters more concise. I believe the book reassured me of things I already felt about my heart, but I don't believe it was necessary to read this whole book to figure it out. In my opinion, this book did not need to be expanded as it was wordy enough as it was!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Summary: This book was written by a husband and wife team to help women of all ages and stages.\\"You are a woman to your soul, to the very core of your being....The desires that God has placed into our hearts are clues as to who we really are and the role that we are meant to play....We think you'll find that every woman in her heart of hearts longs for three things: to be romanced, to play an irreplacable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty. That's what makes a woman come alive.\\"Reactions: What an amazing book! It really touched something in me and helped me realize how much shame I was carrying around needlessly. The Eldredges take it back to the very beginning and put a whole new light on Eve - one I had never thought of or realized before. I always thought of the apple incident when I thought of Eve, but no longer. Eve was created as a perfect woman to complete man and the world! What an empowering feeling! They also encourage women to find, or should I say dig out, their inner dreams that have been buried for years. What a wonderful, life changing book.

It has strengthened both my friend's and my marriage and has taught me many things to continue focusing on for our future together.

John and Stasi Eldredge want women to know that they are beautiful. They seek to uncover the truth about who a woman was created to be before the fall of Eve and how a woman can be redeemed, to be free to be the women she was created to be: captivating, feminine, beautiful.In theory, I agree with the authors intentions. In practice, I do not think that the Eldredge's do this topic justice. As I read the book I couldn't help but think that as a woman I was incomplete unless I was married. The use of scripture often times seemed out of context. While there were some good points and ideas to think more about, I wish they would have done more to describe who I am as a woman loved by God rather than a woman trying to be the princess in a fairytale trying to be found by my prince. I think the book is worth reading if you can get your hands on a free copy, but read with an open and discerning mind.**Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program.

The opinions below are my honest opinion and I received the book as a complimentary copy from Thomas Nelson Publishing.I have wanted to read this book since it came out several years ago, but never did get around to it. I was thrilled to receive this copy from Booksneeze to review and this is also the revised and expanded edition. Captivating is a wonderfully written book about us as women in today's society. It's about how our dreams as little girls and even as women have been destroyed or wounded and how the Lord wants to revive those dreams in our hearts and make us Captivating. It's about how God pursues our hearts as women and is very encouraging to any girl or woman seeking to find purpose in her everyday life.I personally loved this book. As a stay at home mom, I often times get bogged down in day to day chores and taking care of the home and children that I forget about my dreams and my soul. Captivating made me realize I am worth far more than just cleaning house, making meals, and changing diapers. My God wants to pursue me and my life and heart to make me into a Captivating woman for Him. I would highly recommend this book to any of the women at my church, in my family, or in my playgroup. Wonderful book that I will read again and again."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"It casuses my heart to feel sad for those who's responses to this book were 'I can't relate' 'leaders beware' 'I hated it'It is the complete opposite of the 30+ women who read this book together at our church. Some reviews said it was for weak women, they don't have a problem with men. We did not see it that way at all. Many of us at one time or another have been hurt. We live with imperfect humans who let us down at some point in our lives. Some have received healing and are walking tall in their faith, in their lives, in their relationships, but we still need to know how others might being hurting.I have never been molested but many of my friends have. Who am I to say that learning about others hurts does not pertain to me. We are called to love and serve others. This book open my eyes to where I was and confirmed where I am today. 'I am a woman at rest who invites others to rest' this book just confirmed and re-afirmed what the Lord has already done. And it challenged me to help other find that same rest...But as we read this book outloud as a group you could see and feel the different responses. The wounds, hurts, and healings that were represented in just this small group of women. Reading it was freeing to so many. It opened doors for healing to take place. Questions to be answered. The description of creation, ending with the climax of woman being created, was a beautiful love note from God to me, to us as women. I shared it with my husband who was moved by the thought and the visiual picture painted in their words.My heart saddens for the women who have read this book and don't come away from it feeling loved and charished by their creator. Nothing can take place from scripture and God's true love letter to us, but Capitvating just opens up scripture and helps, for so many, to make it personal to them.We read Capitvating 2 years ago as a womens group and they are asking to go through it again. It helps to remind us of who we are, what we were created and destined to be. Every woman and the men in their lives should read Capitvating.Be encouraged today in who you are and know your Father created you for a special purpose.

This book is really great!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"As a writer and journalism major (i.e., word freak), I couldn't help but dissect the title. The root of the word captivating is captive. John Eldredge, a former counselor for Focus on the Family, also wrote Wild At Heart, which is sort of the Christian answer to Robert Bly's Iron John. I ask myself, does a man who yearns to be \\"wild at heart\\" really want to be taken captive? Wouldn't taking people captive actually be a negative quality in a woman, or, for that matter, in a man?Then there's the premise of the book: all little girls dream of being princesses and being rescued by a prince. I scratched my head on this.I confess I was a bit of a tomboy. Maybe that's why I didn't long to be a princess. I didn't play prince and princess with the boys in the neighborhood. I played war. We converted the neighbor's swing set into fighter planes and swung back and forth making machine gun noises. \\"Da-da-da-da-da-da-dow!\\"Joan of Arc resonates with me; princesses do not.My husband, who also read the book, thinks this longing to be a princess may be a response to cultural conditioning from Walt Disney movies about princesses. Which makes sense, since my parents didn't take me to those movies. When I was eight, my mom took me to see A Man For All Seasons, about Sir Thomas More. I have a stronger affinity for Christian martyrs than for princesses.I don't want to belittle women who actually did want to be a princess when they were young. By all means, buy the book. Enjoy. A lot of women fantasize about being made love to by a god. I have no doubt this is what made the Da Vinci Code so popular.Personally, I'd rather be a goddess than a princess any day. Tamar, the only princess deemed worthy of mention in the Bible, ended up being raped by her half brother.But the Bride of Christ, Goddess of Heaven, seduced by the Love God himself. Methinks the Eldredges are setting their sights too low.I suspect most women experience longings in their lives from time to time. A sense of ennui, that somehow the things we wanted in life have passed us by. Many women struggle with wounds as well, some particularly deep. I'm often amazed at the number of Christian women I know who suffer from prolonged depression. When homeschooling mothers are drowning their children in the bathtub, books like Captivating are not only well intentioned, but also much needed.As I talk to Christian women, though, I often sense they're already waiting for some proverbial prince to rescue them, to save them from their empty lives, rather than taking the initiative to change their own lives, like Joan of Arc and most of the female heroes in the Bible. In courageously addressing some of the problems Christian women face, the Eldredges unfortunately promote the passive mindset that causes them.My husband and I couldn't help noting that, in spite of the fact Stasi Eldredge is listed as coauthor, the writing style is entirely that of John Eldredge. Only occasionally does he allow his wife to get her own ideas in, generally to confess that she was once (oh, Lord, help us!) a feminist.The true irony of Captivating is that, in a book ostensibly about the deepest yearnings of women, in which the author argues-truthfully I think-that the church has repressed those longings, John Eldridge has effectively stolen his own wife's voice, making her like The Little Mermaid. A princess, yes, but one who has relinquished for her prince the very power that made her captivating.Unfortunately, the Disney version has a happier ending than Hans Christian Andersen's original story."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I just could not relate to this book at all.

However, after reading Eldredge's excellent book Wild At Heart (which is geared towards men), I wanted to get the other perspective as well. I'm glad I did. Captivating is a must read for any man that wants to understand the heart of a woman. I especially recommend it to any men that are raising a daughter. You'll begin to understand the natural feminine desires of your little girl's heart in a way that you never have. Also, it will help you to become more \\"in-tuned\\" to your wife's needs as you share your life journey together.Edredge and his wife devote most of the book to teaching women how to overcome hurts from their past and how to reclaim the desires and dreams they once had as little girls. For these are the same dreams and desires that God placed within their hearts long ago and wants to see them fulfilled. The authors go on to explain how God wants to be our one true lover that will never fail us. We just have to open ourselves unconditionally up to Him.Like I said, even though this book is geared toward women, I think that men will get just as much out of it. As a matter of fact, I think it's more important for men to read this than women."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"great book every woman needs to read it"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"As a woman who has been searching to fill that void, in some way, shape, or form, for the majority of her life, this book has captured my heart and warmed my soul.

Anybody who wants it can come pick it out of the dirty-clothes pile.No, I didn't buy this book. My husband's sister gave it to me (which is why I'm using an anonymous name here) and I should have known better because she is one of those wackos who says things like \\"Jesus is my best friend.\\" (To which I'm tempted to reply: 'Honey, get some friends your own age').This book might appeal to you if -- and only if -- you're one of those dopey 14-year-olds who draws smiley faces on everything and swoons over TeenBeat magazine and dreams of being a fairy tale princess. I wasn't like that at 14 and I'm certainly not like that at 32.I don't need a knight to rescue me, I need a husband who is capable of handling his equal share of family responsibilities instead of retreating into his cave every night. The Eldredges got one thing -- and one thing only -- right: women are tired. Tired of handling the lion's share of responsibility for the marriage, the children, his family, the finances, the household, etc. But their solution -- Jesus wants to be the lover of your precious heart -- is the kind of useless platitude you'll find on a Hallmark card.

They look at the world and take it as is without INVESTIGATING WHY things are the way they are. They look at the iceberg and they see it above the surface and they think \\"there's the iceberg in it's entirety,\\" rather than LOOKING UNDER THE OCEAN to see the ENTIRE iceberg! They say things like \\"boys would never dress up as fairies\\" \\"boys innately like playing with weapons\\" (not because they bought their children toy guns, of course) , \\"women long to be rescued by a prince and men long to be the rescuer\\" and \\"almost all nude paintings are of women because the male body looks ridiculous naked and half covered with a sheet...\\" Not because most of the painters were MALE or anything. These things are NOT facts, they are the authors OPINIONS. If one would simply do some RESEARCH, you know, other than consulting popular movies, then perhaps they could have an academic argument. If you're interested in reinforcing horrifying and debilitating stereotypes of gender that have been used to oppress women for centuries, you'll enjoy this book.It doesn't even deserve the one star. My Christian women's group was studying this book and all 10 of us decided to stop reading it because we all hated it so much.However, if you're a Christian who believes in equality instead of sexism, then let me suggest \\"Is It Okay to Call God Mother?

I found myself thinking - Wow!- over and over and over. Wow, this is me! Wow, that's exactly how I feel! Wow, that is so true! And Wow, it's not too late to make some changes way down deep in my own feminine, Christian heart.I so enjoyed reading this book and reading Stasi's own personal story and testimony. John's comments along the way confirmed that this is not just a women's crazy idea about life, but indeed thoughts based on the Bible and personal experience in marriage counseling.The main thrust of the book is considering what is your own soul question. Am I lovely? Am I strong? Am I able? It is definitely a book of searching and considering how each one of us have been living in light of the freedom that God wishes to extend to us all - freedom to live up to the high calling of God in Christ Jesus and to live entirely for Him setting aside all of our hurts and past wounds.I felt deeply refreshed having read this book and am hoping to get the companion book for men - Wild at Heart - for my boys and husband to read soon.Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Well, I just finished this book in record time. I started it the other night and just fell in head first. No, that is not normal for me and a non-fiction book, but it was just so easy to read and easy to find my place in it. Before I had finished, I had ordered a copy for my mom, called two friends to see if they owned it (they did!) and started planning use for my women's group. Now, the women's group was an incidental, since I ordered the wrong book for my mom (study guide instead of actual book) but I know that it will hit so many women no matter where they are at.One friend said it really helped pull her from her depression and helped get her back on track with her family and God. No, it's not a replacement for the Bible, but a lot of us have a hard time focusing in on where the bible meets current day life. Oddly, as I finished the book Saturday night, then went to church the following morning, our pastor hit on some of the very topics in the book!

However, I just could not connect with the book itself. I'm not sure what is to blame- perhaps because I am only in my 20's and still growing up. Maybe I have not had enough life experience to really grasp the message of this book. Whatever it was, I can say that I enjoyed reading, but struggled to pay close attention.The main idea of this book is that women are created in God's image, and that means we are beautiful inside and out. The authors encourage readers to look past the fear, failures, disappointments, and heartbreaks to see the beauty that lies within them. It is indeed a strong message that each of us need to hear, and to put into practice. The authors make several strong points throughout the book, it just takes time to dig in and find those truths.

As I read, I pondered its offerings both in self-reflection and from my perspective as the mother of a little girl. The book describes how as women we are designed to share God's beauty and life-giving qualities with the world. Unfortuately, too many women are too wounded or busy or unattached from God and fail to reveal their captivating qualities. The authors describe an ideal where women are fully living out their feminine uniquenesses while not being helpless and weak, but instead serving God and loving others as \\"warrior princesses\\". It contained many anecdotes, many personal ones shared by the authors, which kept the writing very relational.The authors write in tandom, and at times it was confusing trying to discern who was writing.

The description sounded so interesting.The beginning of the book did indeed draw me in. I read a few things that didn't seem quite right, but knew that with all books, you can't take everything you read as gospel.I kept waiting for the book to \\"get to the point\\". Perhaps it's because I don't \\"suffer\\" from most of the things Stasi touched upon. Or perhaps it just wasn't speaking \\"to me\\". But, I felt a little lost about 3/4 of the way through the book.Small note, but I did find a few grammatical and spelling errors. There were a couple of sentences that didn't make any sense....as if the beginning or ending was left off.I think this book would address a real need, but the message is lost in the delivery. It was hard to know who was writing...either John or Stasi. Perhaps if they had two different font colors or font types for each of them would help. But, as a reader, you are left wondering who is talking at times.I wonder what the original edition was like, and may read that version as well, just to find out.Like I said, I do feel this book does address some actual issues present in women's lives. I just don't feel that they are as present in everyone's lives as the authors seem to feel. I will say that the needs of men versus the needs of women is right on. I will also say that so much more could have been expounded upon regarding the different types of women. So much more could have been written to show women how destructive being an emasculating or desolate woman can be. Or how to be more of an alluring woman.

Even though the first publishing was in 2005, my soul has needed this for, well, longer than I can remember.John and Stasi Eldredge are truly blessed with God's words to women who are hurting, broken-hearted, and probably even several out there who think they are doing just fine in their lives. Using their own personal stories of pain, heart-break, rebellion, and spiritual warfare, John and Stasi present an upfront message of life, hope and most of all, grace to those who have experienced pain and suffering in their own lives. Stasi's own personal stories of her childhood, the decisions she made, and the emotions she felt leading up to and as a result of those decisions really made me think about my own life and how I got where I am now.In the Epilogue, they \\"tout\\" their other resources, conferences, and downloads available on their website ([...]). I only bring this up because of Stasi's comments about the daily journal that is available for the Captivating book. \\"Do the Guided Journal the second time around. It is like getting two years of counseling for about thirteen dollars. What a deal!\\" Yeah ... I should get that journal!Oh ... and fellas ... don't think this book is just for women. There is plenty of information in this book that would give you a glimpse into how it feels to be a woman. But if you want to read a really good book, John and Stasi have Wild at Heart for you.In the appendix, there are prayers for several things. I personally have taken the \\"A Daily Prayer for Freedom\\", typed it up, and will print it out so I can read it each morning. It's long, but fully packed with the armor you will need to get through each day in the Spirit.

It was one of the most unique books I've ever read. I admit, it took me a long time to read it. A very long time. It forced me to think about myself, my life experiences, and my God so differently, that it was difficult to take in. I had to read it in small chunks, to digest what the author was saying.Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul was written by John and Stasi Eldredge. This husband and wife team take a couples' approach to writing this and it's companion book Wild at Heart (the men's book). It was so interesting to have the man's perspective on the subject of women. They so beautifully illustrated that our beauty comes almost entirely from inside, and that most women just don't even feel worthy of showing their true beauty.They address why we strive for beauty, how we strive for it, and what the unintended consequences of the striving are. What we miss as women is that each one of us is beautiful, because we were made in the image of God. We try so hard to be beautiful for ourselves, for men, for others, but we either aren't aware or we ignore the beauty that God instilled inside of us that would shine through if only we let it. It is the inner beauty that makes us captivating.Captivating made me think. It was hard for me to read because the subject matter was so different than any book I have ever read. It made me examine myself, my motives, my hurts, and my fears. It hit right in the heart, and forced me to pray. It also helped me to begin to see myself differently. Through the entire book, the authors bring us back to what the Creator whispers to our soul, if we would listen. You are beautiful. You are captivating. You are worth it."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"A few years ago I read a book about a brand new concept for Christian women, Captivating by Staci Eldridge. It was a radical shift in my thinking about who I could be as a wife, mother, and to be fully engaged in life's greatest adventures. I was surprised to see that there was a new and revised version of the same book that shown a light on my life a few years ago. Naturally I couldn't resist the temptation to see what new thoughts awaited me between the pages. Still Staci Eldrige has a way of taking your innermost thoughts and affirming that you're not crazy for thinking that there must be something more. Captivating, ISBN 978-1-40020282-9 still proves to be one of the best books for women giving them hope in the hurting and confidence in the midst of a changing life. Captivating shows you that you don't have to settle for a boring life. Make yours a life that you were meant to live...not just a life that will make do.

Captivating, by John and Stasi Eldredge, is written to address this very issue and many of the other main issues that plague women's hearts. This book draws attention to the unique beauty that God created women to be, and the important role that she was made to play in His story. The writers also deal with the wounds that women receive from the ultimate enemy, shining light on this war that rages against God's daughters, and showing that there is victory to be had on the part of the women of the Kingdom. Sadly, it all too true that there has been a major war against the soul of women from the beginning of time. Looking at the women in my life, and even myself, it is easy to find the ruins of this war that are left as scars on the hearts of us all. Women have these eveidences in varying areas and degrees, but no doubt every woman is in a battle, and so few even realize it for what it is.This has probably been one of my favorite books of all time. I've read it three times now, and each time my eyes are opened to who I really am to God, and how the Enemy does everything he can to tell me otherwise. I highly recommend this book to every women out there, no matter her age and place in life. This book holds truths that women need to have their eyes opened up to so that they can receive the freedom to be the beautiful daughters that God created them to be. This is seriously a MUST read."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"There is a longing within the soul of every woman to be beautiful, to be sought after, to be captivating. In this book, John and Stasi Eldredge, in their heart-to-heart fashion, lead each woman into her own personal revelation of true and everlasting beauty.I must admit I thought this was going to be just another feel-good, self-help book. I didn't need it, but perhaps some of my readers would be interested. I was pleasantly surprised.The Eldredges are on a three-fold mission: to lead women into a genuine and deep relationship with Christ, to help them see what each was uniquely created to be, and to encourage them to unveil their own personal beauty to the world around them.They begin by defining what it means to be a woman, and I really appreciate their balance. For instance, this quote from Chapter Two:\\"Rather than asking, 'What should a woman do--what is her role?' it would be far more helpful to ask, 'What is a woman--what is her design?'...\\"Isn't that rich?Though I could not agree with everything doctrinally nor medically, one must take what is profitable and leave the rest. And there was way too much which was eternally profitable for me to lay this book aside. In fact, I plan to read it again very soon. I hope you will, too.(Thomas Nelson has provided me with a complimentary copy of this book.)"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The subtitle says it all when it comes to this book's goal: \\"Unveiling the mystery of a woman's soul.\\" The book didn't so much unveil as it did remind. It would be the understatement of the century to say that men and women are different. (Remember Mars and Venus?) Man's typical understanding of woman is the source of many a comedian's jokes, but more significantly it's the root of many of our world's problems.John and Stasi remind us men that women think, feel, and process differently. Being cherished isn't a desire that's on the top of my radar screen, but the Eldridges remind me that a woman want to be cherished. Remember dress up games and fairy tale endings? Life in the real world hasn't crushed that innate feminine instinct.Here's a great quote that sums up a lot of the authors' intent: \\"If we could read the secret histories of our enemies we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostilities.\\"The book is a great conversation starter. It would be healthy for couples to read this alongside \\"Wild at Heart\\" to deepen our understanding of each other. The book is likely guilty of sweeping generalizations at times, but these don't weaken the spirit of the book. Bottom line: it's worth the read. Not earth shattering, but if it leads to more open communication between men and women, it could be life changing.(Disclosure: I received a free reviewer's copy of the book from [...].

I dove into it right away; I had read Wild At Heart by John Eldredge, and learned so very much about my husband while reading it! I was extremely excited for a woman's counterpart to the book.And I must say, I was not at all disappointed. Captivating touches on the very essence of being a woman, of being a daughter of Eve. It shows not only the when we were created, but the why, and in a way that shows God's incredible, intense love for us as women. It attempts to unveil the secrets to the feminine heart (if you can... it does a pretty good job, though!), and shows us how to start healing our wounds, by first and foremost, making God the hero in our fairy tale. It's a book about being uniquely feminine, to truly be an ezer kenegdo (commonly translated helpmeet, but being, oh, so much more than that!). It also shows something I've been missing in other books on godly femininity. It shows me how to put into perspective longings that my heart has had, and how those longings directly come from God, and are there to bring me always back to Him.Overall... a book I highly recommend!!One of my favorite quotes from the book says, \\"This book is not about what you ought to do, or who you ought to be. It's about discovering who you already are, as a woman. A woman who at her core was made for romance, made to play an irreplaceable role in a shared adventure, and who really does possess a beauty all her own to unveil.

We want to be found valuable, irreplaceable, and beautiful. Stasi, through personal anecdotes, addresses the fact that the world has quelched these desires. In varying degrees, we've had wounds inflicted on us from childhood that lead us to believe that the opposite is true: that we aren't valuable, that we aren't beautiful, that no one needs us.

The authors explain that most women have 3 core desires, which are; their desire to be romanced, their desire to display beauty and their desire to \\"to play a role in her own adventures.\\" What happens according to the authors is that women eventually \\"become either controlling or needy or just a good servant.\\" The authors feel \\"Godly women\\" should look to Eve as a role model and should see God as the definitive lover.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Are You In Spiritual Darkness Or Are You On The Path To Enlightenment? +++++++++++++++ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"To be known and seen are two core desires of the woman's heart.

Because of the profound connections between God's heart and ours this book speaks to the very nature of love and relationship in life.

However I came on to this website to order a copy of this book for a Christian friend of mine in the US, and decided to read some of the reviews before ordering! Having done so I felt compelled to have my say!!!!I did this book as a study with a Ladies Fellowship in Germany and to be honest the first chapter did put me off a little. (I thought it was a bit corny...) However, once I got into the book, I honestly couldn't put it down and was actually quite disappointed when I got to the last page. I found it quite compelling to read, but I don't suggest that you take this book as \\"gospel\\" (no pun intended) and to be fair, I don't believe the author intends for that either. All books like this are basically based on some other person's opinions and experiences. I thought it was a bit different from some of the other Christian books I've read recently, and I didn't get on board with every single area of the book, (I also thought of Jesus being a \\"lover\\" a bit weird, although I understood where she was coming from. I do agree with a loving and intimate relationship with him, so maybe she didn't quite hit the mark in describing that particular area) however it did provoke quite a lot of discussion in our group which was fab and very stimulating and enjoyable.I has made me think of my relationship with the Lord differently and has encouraged me on my journey as a Christian women who is not SUPER-CHRISTIAN-WOMAN! I don't see it as a substitute for scripture, but what book is? Read it and don't take it too seriously, see it for what it is."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"When I was a little girl (okay, not that little, but younger than I am now), I would imagine myself being a lawyer or a Jedi. I would save the world from criminals, uphold the ways of the Force, and travel the world (or the universe on my own starship). Eventually, the hero of my dreams (either detective or Luke Skywalker) would tell me how beautiful I was and marry me. Together, we would live happily ever after. Fast forward over a dozen years and the story is much different. Today, I have a less-than-glamorous job, no significant relationships with men, and little hope that anyone outside my family will ever call me beautiful.My story is one that many women can relate to. In this book, John and Stasi acknowledge the way that women feel and encourage them to rise above it. Women are not called to mediocrity, is their cry. Women are meant to be beautiful, to be loved and to love, and to be involved in adventure and the way this can be achieved is by a meaningful, intimate relationship with the one who started it all: God, the ultimate lover.What I Liked:When I first started this book, I couldn't get into it. When my church group encouraged the ladies to read Captivating while the men read Wild at Heart, I took up the challenge--this time with better success. The entire novel absorbed me--particularly Chapter Two: \\"What Eve Alone Can Tell\\". In this chapter, John and Stasi gave me a picture of my femininity that I had never, in my wildest dreams, pictured before. Here, they assert that Creation was not complete without woman. For me, that was the most jaw-dropping moment of the book. \\"Creation is not complete without me?!?!\\" Woa.Furthermore, John and Stasi give plenty of examples--Biblical, pop culture, and real-life men and women--of what they mean. In describing God and how he wants to love us, they use examples from movies that many women have seen: Titanic, Braveheart, Lord of the Rings, and Sense and Sensibility to name a few (none of the movies are endorsed, only the imagery is used). When describing how parents influence a daughter's image of herself, several women's life stories are given. This real-life approach is also given when describing interactions with men, interactions with God, and interactions in the world and lends the whole book great authenticity.But most importantly, John and Stasi made me realize how valued I was as a woman and how important it was for me to let go of all the chains and grudges and burdens I have been holding on to. In this manner, the book was a success and a delight.What I Did Not Like:Towards the end, the book begins to read like a to-do list, i.e. \\"So in order to feel better and be more beautiful follow the steps below\\". I hate this because I am the type of person who wants to do the items and conquer each before moving on in the book. But when you are just reading through a book (and don't plan on doing a step, waiting a few weeks/months, going to the next step, repeat), such a tactic does not work. And if I just read all the steps one after another without doing each one, I tend to get overwhelmed with all the \\"to-do\\" work I have in front of me.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:In relating a prior conversation, a woman says an expletive.John and Stasi relate others' (and Stasi's) failed relationships. These include rape, sexual assault, physical abuse, verbal abuse, and other forms of domestic violence. Definitely not for younger teens; preferably for older teens and adults.Overall:Wow. Wow. What else can I say? I've learned so much about myself in the few days this book has taken to read that I never knew in all the years before. I know why I feel the way I do--and that many other women feel the same way. I understand how my parents influence the way I do things today. And I understand that God loves me in a special way--a romantic way that church never talks about.Are you a lonely woman, looking desperately for someone to love and love you? Are you bored out of your mind in your job? Is someone calling you beautiful? This is a book that will show you that there is someone to love, to call you to adventure and who is calling you beautiful. A must read book.Brought to you by*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This books does something daring and dangerous. It sets women free.In a society that professes equal rights for women and liberty for all, women often are spiritually imprisoned. Why? We believe the lies fed to us by the media and wounds dealt to us through our lifetimes. It compounds and keeps us from being the women we are meant to be; the woman God needs us to be. The world needs our beauty and strength.The authors do a brilliant job of driving their points home and tells us how God loves us through the use of the word of God. They point out the enemy's use of the blows we are dealt in life to keep us from God and hinder our progress in life.The authors use abundant scripture and anecdote to write this book. It is entertaining and touches the feminine heart. It shows us that we can be who we are and should embrace our personal style and talents. It also tells us how we all have beauty to unveil. (This is opposite of what the world tells us, isn't it?)Of course, this is not the Bible so it is not perfect. For example, I do not agree with the author's implication that women are not intended for leadership. I have never been able to find Biblical evidence for this assertion. However, I trust their intention on this point to be of good faith.This book increases womens' self-esteem and assurance that God is the true lover of their souls. It also gives some good insight on men and our relationships with them.A must read for believing women!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"this book is really great. sorry others below didn't get much out of it, but it is really honest and good truth. only God liberates, but this book helps you find the places you've been unwilling to be yourself in. you'll benefit."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Very enlightening and helpful in enthralling and growth.

Companion to Wild at Heart--the greatest book ever written for insight into men."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have worked with Christian college-aged women in a bible college setting for eight years. Every year the same identity issues are a source of struggle for these women as the try to figure out not only their futures but their pasts and how the two interact. There is confusion about how to live a Godly life while pursuing their 'calling' and relationships with men and friendships with other women.This book addresses so many of the heart matters that when understood and applied to life can tansform women of any age I believe. If the principles taught in Captivating were used in the lives of Christian women the church would be a different place. Women wouldn't any longer seek approval and affirmation from men and men would no longer be confused about how to support the women in their life. Although this ideal, it will not happen...but as many women as possible should read and apply.I highly recommmend using this in a small group as the materials are difficult and bring up challenging ideas. The accountability afforded in a small group make for lasting changes and comfort and support during the most difficult chapters."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book had a profound impact on my spiritual life. Who knew that God was so romantic?!! I highly recommend it to every single woman ever, especially teens who are searching for meaning and purpose. Some Catholic women may have a hard time being fed spiritually by Protestant material (hence 4 stars instead of 5), but I am a devout Catholic and I was very much inspired. There is no polarizing material contained in the book nor anything that goes against Church teachings (as far as I remember). All in all, a great book for any denomination."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I had a really hard time reading this book. It is just not my cup of tea.

Maybe to some women, but not to me.\\" But as I read more, everything started to make more sense. This book has close ties to the Theology of the Body of John Paul II, but never explicitly so. This book encouraged such a positive change of perspective for me that I ordered 3 copies for other women I know. And then I ordered Wild at Heart (also equally eye-opening) for their husbands. I highly recommend this to every woman I know who is not scared of self-reflection."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The women I have given this to have nothing but praise for the book.The women's class at my church are going to do the dvd series in the fall that gives them a chance to go through it together like the guys did with \\"Wild At Heart\\""},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Wild at Heart was an amazing book and so I was excited to learn that the Eldredges were collaborating to put Captivating together. Like Wild at Heart did for men, it speaks to the innermost desires that women have. Other reviews might leave you wondering if it is worth reading, but I insist it is beneficial to you as a woman, enlightening to you as a man, and a wonderful tool to deepen a marriage.First, you must get it. This book is not a set of rules or a list of do's and dont's. Therefore, you cannot read it as such. It begs you throughout to explore your emotions and their causes. As Christians, we know that we were created with purpose. You have all heard that everyone has a God-shaped hole in their heart that only God can fill. Well, we have to admit, then, that we were designed to need Him. Some adults still don't understand this need, much less the children that we all were. Children have this need, too, and they look to fill it from their mothers and fathers. Because no parents are perfect, we receive wounds when our need is not fulfilled. These wounds harden our hearts so that we learn to do without, to live without, to choke down our emotions with a determination from an idea that the need cannot be filled and that we must \\"grow up\\" and learn to be independent. But, God created all of us, men and women, to be dependent on Him. It's no wonder why we struggle so much. We were literally not designed to be living the lives that we do.This book goes into the subject that all women have at one time or another repressed. It is the first steps to a path of having a deeper relationship with God. It brings light to the cycle of a lot of today's churches that deal with a recurring group of people that volunteer and then get \\"burnt out\\".A very long previous review explained that \\"we don't need to feel good about ourselves\\" because \\"we are all failures, women and men alike\\". While I agree that we have all failed and that we need Jesus to save us, I disagree with the theme of that review that makes it sound like the buck stops there. Yes, we all need to be saved and born again, but Jesus did not just die to save us from our sins alone. He died to set us free from the shackles of our sinful nature. He died so that we, through Him, could come to the Father and have relationship with Him. Communion with Him. Life through Him. If we, as Christians, teach the next generation to live a life void of personal loving relationship with God, then we have failed beyond the decision of Adam and Eve. If you have not been taught that you can have an amazing purposeful intimate relationship with God that satisfies you to your very core then I say read this book. Read Wild at Heart, too. God created men and women differently because he instilled different parts of Himself into each of them so that together they would be \\"in His image.\\" We can only know the complete heart of God when we know all aspects of his personality. So, I say read both of these books to fully understand the nature of our God and where you fit in to His desires."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is a dynamic book explaining the great love of God the Father for all people, but most especially women of any age. As a bride groom He seeks us out and wants so much for us, as his bride to know of His undying love for us and how He cherishes us.

I'll start by summarizing some obvious observations:1. He uses Hollywood movies (in excess) to illustrate spiritual points.2. He rarely uses Scripture and when he does, it's weak and/or out of context.3. His views are incredibly shallow - all men (and women) appear the same in his universe.4. His theology is incredibly weak as a result.5. Isn't it interesting how the three points match up so well with three points in WAH and WTD ?A large number of 5-star reviewers admit that this is the very first book they've read in a long time, and sometimes it's their first book period. With little else to compare, it's easy to see why there is so much high praise and so little criticism. There are many books better than this - I would recommend some Phillip Yancey, and Henri Nouwen.One previous reviewer summarized it best - \\"Pop phychology posing as theology\\" ... case closed.

You are NOT someone whose worth rests on your beauty and ability to have men contend for your favor! It's prefectly OK if you want to sweep a lovely man off HIS feet!This book is, above all, sexist. There are many things wrong with it, but the huge problem is that it uses Christianity as a pretext to reinforce a woman's role to sit there, quietly, beautifully, and sweetly, waiting to be \\"fought for\\". Women need to be told that they are strong, that they are more than just beautiful and desireable--NOT that they need to be more like the girls in the 'chick flicks' (which, by the way, every woman loves).On top of this, their most concrete evidence comes from movies. Yes, movies. And not even good ones, guys--I'm talking Titanic-like movies. In case you were expecting one, a sociological study this is not (let alone based on any empirical evidence whatsoever).It seems that Stasi decided that she would write a self-affirming book, telling women that they are all sweet, beautiful, submissive objects to be fought over and swept of their feet--precisely because that is what she is."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"A must read for every woman to help her see that she is not alone and that there is a way to heal from her wounds.

Just look at all those chicky-feely forwards in your inbox! The book is a little sweet and squishy in tone, but what I read got me thinking-such as the relationship between a woman and her father. \\"Captivating\\" is a good start, but don't stop with it. Reach for your bible and look up women like Tamar and Mary Magdalene and Abigail. Study their character. \\"Bad Girls of the Bible\\", the new \\"Lost Women of the Bible\\", \\"Intimate Issues\\" by Lorraine Pintus, and \\"Every Woman's Battle\\" and many of the myriads of \\"women-in-the-bible\\" devotionals can bring in a deeper discussion. I am a strong, competent, motivated and independent woman-but read woman, not MAN. I'm not wired like a guy and thank goodness.The book is sweet in tone, but if you're willing to be a little tender and dig objectively, you may learn a little something.

I would HIGHLY recommend it to any woman and especially any college woman!! Just with all the struggles that go on in a college students life, this book can really speak to you. I am a sophomore in college and it makes great sense for the stage that I am at in my life. It's so funny because as I was reading it I just kept thinking, that is exactly what I am feeling, that is exactly what I am going through!! And after talking to my girlfriends, they feel the same way!! It's just great to know that you aren't alone and that Jesus loves you more than any man or woman or anything ever could!!I also would recommend that men read this, believe it or not. I think it is good to have that knowledge of what is going on in the heads and hearts of your sisters' in Christ. Just for a more understanding of what is going on. Just like I recommend woman to read \\"Wild at Heart\\" by John Eldredge, to get more knowledge of what is going on in the heart of a man.I hope you will read this, it makes a lot of sense!!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is the best christian book that I've ever read. It really hit home with me and I could relate to all the things it talked about. I truly believe all teenage and young adult girls should read this book!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I had read Wild At Heart and had to read this one! It is great. I think God is amazing and to read something like this really opened my eyes. Great book! John Eldredge is a great author!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Loved it and have passed it down to my daugther, knowing she will get the most of it!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book has changed my life. As a woman from a \\"damaged\\" upbringing and past, I have been dating a wonderful man for 3 years but still had feelings of inadequacy and fear...I realized thru this book that I never first believed that God thought I was wonderful, how could I believe my boyfriend when he told me the same?! This book has released me from my past, set free my heart and opened my garden. Awesome."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"My mom bought this book, but before she could read it, I had started it and couldn't put it down! I can't say enough about it. I loved it, it was so encouraging to me.It has opened my eyes to so many things! It has awakened a desire to live a stronger, more passionate life.In the first chapter, they write \\"This book is not about what you ought to do or who you ought to be. It's about discovering who you already are, as a woman\\". I think that pretty much sums it up. Captivating is a book on realizing who you are as a woman of God.I enjoyed the way it is written, speaking to women of all ages.It is refreshing to find a book that isn't directed at dating or marriage. (Though I'm thankful for those, too)It has made me realize again, that God is so much bigger than we imagine and that He loves us with a love that is stronger than we could ever know. How He has created Woman unique. That we have strength, a beauty all our own.I would enthusiastically reccommend this book to any woman wanting to deepen her spiritual walk."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is amazing! I wish I could get every woman I know (and every guy for that matter--it truly reveals such honest, deep things about a woman's heart) to read this book! It spoke to my heart deeply and I related to countless things in it (as did all of the friends I know who have read it--they have all raved about it). Reading some of it brought back to surface some past hurts and some pain I've tried to ignore for years--but it was a good thing as it helped me to finally address and deal with those particular issues. Be prepared to be touched but be ready for your life to be changed in a good way!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is the most inspiring book I've ever read next to the Bible.

I bought the book and then went and bought the journal. I couldn't even get 1/2 way through the book. It wasn't interesting or attention grabbing. I wish I wouldn't have spent the money on the journal. 3 other women in my life group said the same thing about the book and they hadn't taken the other class that I did before they read it."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Wonderful encouragement for Women. Great for a Women's Ministry Read. Makes you feel really special!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"CaptivatingI was very excited to receive a copy of the book Captivating by John and Stasi Eldredge. The title and subject really drew my attention, and I was very interested in what the Eldredges had to say. My excitement soon turned to dismay as I read. In order to keep this a review and not another book I will not go into great detail the problems I had with the book. There were some good aspects which I will list first, and then I will briefly describe some of the problems.Before I even started reading I liked the idea of both John and Stasi authoring the book. I thought it would be very beneficial to get a man and womans point of view. A lot of times I just didn't know who was writing so that got a little confusing. They made several interesting observations about Scripture that I had never thought about and thus made me search those Scriptures to see for myself. For example, on pages 48 and 49 they are describing the scene in the Garden of Eden where Eve is being tempted by the serpent. On page 49 they write, \\"Now, to be fair, Adam doesn't exactly ride to her rescue.\\" Definitely food for thought.I appreciated the fact that Stasi was willing to open her heart and share a lot from her personal life. I'm sure it took a lot of courage to actually write her struggles, fears, and past sins in a book for all to read. I could tell she has a genuine concern for women and wants to do all she can to help.The best part of the book was found on page 126. I believe this is precisely what the authors are trying to help us understand is the heart of the issue. They write, \\"Jesus says the first and greatest commandment is 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind' (Matt. 22:37)... It is from hearts filled with love for him that all good works and acts of love flow.\\" I believe the authors are trying to help us understand that for a woman to be truly captivating and beautiful she will love God with all that she is. I absolutely agree, but this brings me to the problems I have with the book.Instead of introducing this passage of Scripture and taking us to an understanding of how that looks for a woman today, they start the book by generalizing how all women think or what they want. Little girl dreams of princesses and fairy tales, dress-up clothes, and tea parties are expounded upon. Too many movies are quoted. (I have never even seen half of the movies they mentioned.) The first part of the book seemed totally unnecessary. Why do I need to be reminded of how I felt or acted as a child. All of that is right and good in its proper place, but how do princesses and tea parties help me to love God with all that I am?The biggest issues I have with this book are over God's Word. I had hardly starting reading when on page 6 Stasi criticizes the Proverbs 31 woman! Then on page 45 Stasi (I think) writes, \\"Eve was given to the world as the incarnation of a beautiful, captivating God-a life offering, life-saving lover, a relational specialist, full of tender mercy and hope.\\" WHAT?!?!? The incarnation? Someone please tell me I read that wrong! Song of Solomon was quoted occasionally and there again liberties were taken that I do not believe were accurate. On page 197 the author again writes, \\"Ladies, you are the Bride of Christ.\\" Now I understand that this is a book written to women so the author could have just been using the word ladies, because as Christian ladies we are part of the church. However, since there are other theological issues with this book I'm not quite sure how to read that statement. Then on page 220 the author again writes, \\"He [Jesus] is captivated by your beauty.\\" I'm sorry, but I can't agree with that statement either. There is a lot I could say just on these few quotes, but this is a review not another book. These quotes are just a few examples of why I have problems with this book.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book to anyone. There are too many theological issues. If you do choose to read it, be very careful. The authors make there ideas sound very good and Biblical. That is the problem! They are THEIR ideas! Have a copy of the Bible beside you if you do read Captivating and compare what you are reading with what God's Word says. You will find that Captivating does not line up with the Scriptures. Follow God's Word (not me or the author of any book) and you will find the truth.I received a free copy of this book from Thomas Nelson publishers for review purposes."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I've also giving it to about 4 other women and they've enjoyed it as well. I didn't necessarily agree with everything said in the book 100% of the time, but it was a great tool to finally understand our God given desires as women and how He is the answer to them all."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"In all the times we interpreted the scripture to mean the woman was less than the man, this book inspires woman to have an understanding that does not overshadow the role of the man but proves the importance of the woman."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I agree with all the reviewers who have noted that this book has a very narrow view of women. It's so focused on the wounded or helpless woman seeking rescue, you'll probably wonder if these authors developed their view of women from patients in crisis therapy. Or maybe that's the kind of woman who shows up in their Christian-fundamentalist seminars. Either way, It just doesn't describe the women I know.Also annoying was that this book didn't seem to have a clear purpose or much substance. It's easy to find a fictional movie character or Bible quote to support anything in the world (you can find Scripture passages recommending killing children), but what does that prove? Not much. It circled around and around vague phrases like 'the secret of a woman's soul', but didn't provide much in the way of insight or interest. It's like they kept promising they had something important to say, but by the end I was wondering 'what was the point of all that?\\""},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This was a good book! It made some excellent points and opened my eyes to things in my own life that I could relate to. At sometimes it got to be a little bit slow in reading but overall a good book. Would recommend for ladies and gentlemen alike who are tryin' to get a glimpse into what a woman's soul is like and reasons why others may have turned out the way they have."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"There were a couple things that I identified with in the book but that was it. The rest of it, I really had a hard time staying focused. It just didn't capture my attention. Seems to really be a great book for a lot of people but not so much for me."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I thought I liked this the first time I picked it up, but I have yet to pick it up again. Nothing beats just reading the Bible!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I've decided to not spend much time on this review...I wasted enough time reading the book. The only thing I want to point out is this:If you DON'T want a scripturally-based view of who you are as a woman, read this book. This feel-good mentality is a product of pop psychology, not God's beautiful design. We all fall short of the goal...does that mean we should throw out the goal????New American Standard Bible (1995) Proverbs 12:1Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, But he who hates reproof is stupid.This book is like SO MANY \\"teachers\\" today:\\"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires; and will turn their ears away from the truth; and will turn aside to myths\\" (2 Timothy 4:3-4, NASB).Come on ladies, God has MORE for us! Cling to the Proverbs 31 woman!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Excellent book. Insightful and touching. Of course it will come under criticism, but that is no reason to not read it with a heart and mind open to what God may in fact have for you to learn.This book touched my soul and I would recommend it to every woman (and man).Realize that although it purports to be written for women everywhere, it likely will not impact every woman in the same way. Of course, this makes sense because God speaks to all of us in different ways.Take a chance, read the book, it may be one of the best books you've ever read...and may truly release your soul to live freely as a passionate and fulfilled Woman of God."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The message of this book is so desperately needed and is a MUST read for those longing for more freedom and life. Captivating has brought healing to my soul and with each paged turned I found my heart being turned back to the heart of God. I am forever grateful to John and Stasi for their stunning vulnerability and insight."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Any women in their right mind would be crazy not to read this book. It is so awesome how it touches the depths of the heart and soul of women and show us all we are the beauty of God's essence. It doesnt matter where you have come from or where you are going, knowing who you are in God's eyes, is empowering. I truly believe every women should at least read this book once."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"\\"Captivating\\" centers around three concepts: that women want to be romanced, to play an important part in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty, either in themselves or in the world around them. My sister and I read this book aloud and decided the following:- The concepts are backed up with scripture, but many of the ideas are subjective interpretations of the scripture passages.- The middle can get a little redundant, and some of the uses of terms, such as \\"Jesus as lover\\" and \\"romancer\\" can be uncomfortable.However, if the reader focuses beyond the everyday use of the terms, and at the intent of the writers, this book can be a refreshing and uplifting perspective on what it means to be a woman, especially in this day and age. At the very least, it's an excellent conduit for feminine introspection."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This was the life affirming/life changing book I wish I'd had the wisdom to write. It is a wonderful discussion of what it means to be a woman - how women reflect the image of God - and how feminine differs from masculine (and it has nothing to do with long skirts or cookie baking!). The women to whom I've recommended the book are moved to tears of joy after reading it and plan to read it several times. The cover has put several women I know off from reading it - don't know why - but this is one book NOT to judge by its cover. If you are a woman warrior or a woman wounded or a woman seeking to understand her own design - this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The troubling thing about this book is just how captivating it really is.I, like most women who have written reviews, was caught up tremendously in the good feelings it gave me about myself and God's love for me. When I started reading the book, I was struggling with my faith because of the way Christianity has treated women over the years. I came out of my reading feeling much closer to Jesus.But when the emotions wore off and my ability to think clearly returned I felt cheated: this book is not about Jesus or any other biblical representation of God. It is about an invented character that makes readers feel good.If you want a relationship with the God of the Bible, look elsewhere. The representation of Jesus is completely invented, created by Stasi Eldredge to make herself feel better about the less-than-satisfactory reality of how God relates to women in the Bible. I understand that it was not intended to be a work of biblical scholarship, but it completely ignores the true text. Women in the Bible are presented as captivating, indeed, but not in any way that should make us feel like God gave us a Hallmark card - think of David so \\"captivated\\" by Bath-sheba that he raped her; Jael so \\"captivating\\" that she seduced and drove a mallet into the enemy's head; Jezebel so \\"captivating\\" that she was able to lead Ahab away from the true God.All that being said,if you need a self-help book, this will make you feel great. Soak it up! But don't call it Christianity."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul by John and Stasi Eldredge is for women, what John Eldgedge's best-selling book, Wild at Heart is for men.\\"Every woman I've ever met feels it - something deeper than just the sense of failing at what she does. An underlying, gut feeling of failing at who she is.\\" In Captivating, the Eldredges attempt to explain the very nature of what it means to be a woman: \\"Every woman in her heart of hearts longs for three things: to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty.\\"The book goes on to explain the way sin has impacted women, and the ways women are often wounded by their parents, society's expectations, the church, men, spiritual attacks, and their own defense mechanisms. It provides hope and a path to healing and wholeness.Favorite Quotes* The vast desire and capacity a woman has for intimate relationships tells us of God's vast desire and capacity for intimate relationships. (P 29)* Christianity changes dramatically when we discover that it, too, is a great romance. (P 30)* Beauty is the essence of God. (P 35)* Little boys want to know, Do I have what it takes? Little girls want to know, Am I lovely? (P 47)* When a man goes bad, as every man has in some way gone bad after the Fall, what is most deeply marred is his strength. He either becomes a passive, weak man--strength surrendered--or he becomes a violent, driven man--strength unglued. When a woman falls from grace, what is most deeply marred is her tender vulnerability, beauty that invites to life. She becomes a dominating, controlling woman--or a desolate, needy, mousy woman. (P 51)* Women who are stunningly beautiful are women who... love truly and honestly without demanding that they be loved in return. (P 145)* All women are uniquely gifted to heal others in their lives become more of who they truly are--to encourage, nurture, and mother them toward their true selves. (P 179)* There is a mighty strength and fierceness set in the hearts of women by God... Women are warriors too. (P 188)* Jesus is extending his hand to you. He is inviting you to dance with him. He asks, \\"May I have this dance... every day of your life?\\" (P 220)Personal ThoughtsThere is great disagreement in our society as to the essence and role of women. So, any book that attempts to define and describe those things is guaranteed to be controversial and met with criticism.John and Stasi Eldredge claim \\"every woman in her heart of hearts longs for three things:\\"1) To be romanced - Every woman wants to be wanted, to be pursued, to be loved. They are NOT saying a woman is incomplete unless she has a man who wants, pursues, and loves her. In fact, they specifically say no man can fully satisfy this desire, only God can.2) To play an irreplaceable role in a shared adventure - Women were not created to be boring, busy machines of routine. They crave adventure and want to matter just like men do, but they want to pursue adventure and meaning in conjunction with relationships, as an essential part of a team.3) To unveil beauty - Every woman wants to be beautiful on the outside, but more than that, every woman wants to be beautiful on the inside, and every woman wants to create beauty in this world. I think we (men especially, but also women) almost completely misunderstand the importance and power of beauty. Beauty is essentially a vision of things the way they should be. There is beauty in art, in music, in a garden, in a family laughing together, in an elderly couple holding hands. Beauty is the holiness and grandeur of God. A woman's desire to unveil beauty is an innate desire to reveal the glory of God.Obviously, I am not a woman, and to be honest, I don't have the courage to say I understand the mysteries of a woman's soul. But there is something about each of these desires that resonates with what I know of the women in my life.There's a lot more in Captivating, particularly dealing with the wounds and brokenness all women deal with. I think women will find it tremendously insightful and encouraging. And I also recommend it to every man who wants to understand women better. My wife, Jennifer, and I are going to read through the book together and discuss it."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I must admit, when I first began reading this book, I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about it. I have been on such a rampage lately about the demise of femininity that I was sure this was just going to be one more book in a line of recent releases full of lies and leading more women astray. I am happy to say, I was wrong.It took me quite some time to read Captivating in its entirety, but not because of the book. I was in the midst of chaos in my personal life, and time slipped away, but I found myself carving out every moment I could to spend time in the pages of this book. I have been trying to find something spectacular to write for this review which would nail how I felt as I turned each page and learned more about myself in the process, but there only seems to be one word which fits. I found this book to be aptly named, because it truly is captivating!Women everywhere need to read Captivating to discover the absolute treasure they are to their Father. Men need to read it to have a better understanding of the vast differences between the sexes, and why that is such an invaluable gift from God.Aside from the usual Eldridge trademark of quoting movies some Christians may find questionable, I loved this offering from the dynamic Eldridge duo, and will look forward to reading more from them in the future."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"the most incredible book. completely changed my life. I found freedom to be myself after reading it, and closer to God. Given a copy to pretty much every woman I am close to and received only glowing reviews. it challenges our culture's ideals of women in several ways but there is some deep down burning truth about what it is to have a feminine heart."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"After reading through and feeling red flags throughout, I felt guilty for not embracing the unveiling mystery of my soul like some of my Christian sisters did. I cannot say enough about the need for guard if you read this book.If you are prone to a princess mentality, you will adopt princess behavior. This book will help you succeed.The authors use \\"romancing God\\" as an allegory, that is, \\"romancing God\\" is like unto romancing a man in certain ways.This is a vulgar de-exultation of God as I understand Him in Scripture.There is no room here for the blood, sweat & tears of a godly woman's life. Nothing to speak of hard working, serving women.The author states some of her own values such as, \\"preferring to venture outside rather than inside the home, preferring someone else doing the dishes, and preferring a good movie.\\"What of her fanciful values when compared to those of the woman in Proverbs 31?The encouragement in this book captivates you to another god ~ yourself.Women will be wounded and mis-guided if they adhere to these captivating principles.This book was among the influential reads that led my sister-in-law to be captivated away from her 26 year marriage and 4 children because she couldn't wear the tiara this prescribes AND love God with all her heart, soul, mind, and strength.\\"Herself\\" got in the way, and \\"Captivating\\" helped her succeed in bringing about a flesh-ripping divorce.Ladies, please find something better to read."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Best book I have ever read on being a woman!

I read it along side Experiencing God, and the two just supported each other so well. This is a must read, its starts off slow, but just wait for it...its wonderful. What a blessing."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I just spent the last 10 minutes reading or skimming through the 60-some reviews on here. Interesting to note that most people either love or hate the book. Personally I love it. When I read I find myself tearing up over various issues that fully resonate with my heart. I also promise you that I am not your typical 'gushy', chick-flick watching female. To be honest, i'm much more tomboyish and struggle to be feminine instead of 'tough'. But I believe God plants in woman many universal core desires and that is what 'Captivating' addresses. I give this book 4 stars and am going to explain why by addressing issues OTHER people had with the book's content.A warning, this could be long. I love to write. I beg your indulgence.First off..the title of the book, 'Captivating'. I saw one review that claimed this title is negative and implies men being captives of women. How misunderstood! In my evening Bible-reading, I came across this verse in Proverbs(5:18.19) 'May you rejoice in the wife of your youth...may you ever be CAPTIVATED by her love.' So yes, for the record, being captivating is very Biblical.Secondly, comments about the 'over-use' of movie references and pop-culture. I've noted that much of our Christian culture has always been AFRAID of popular entertainment. I agree that there is a great necessity for discernment, but at the same time, we must address society WHERE IT IS. This book does not seek to REPLACE the Bible, but to encourage us to see God in everyday things. How many of us never go to the movies or listen to the radio or read classic literature? very few indeed. Is it really so terrible to draw truth from fiction? Fiction is not synonmous with lies, yet some still chose to believe this. God is the author of our creativity..our desire to spin tales for entertainment. We shouldn't shun that.In order to avoid writing a book instead of a book review, I'm just going to address one final concern..one that holds more reason for concern. Eldredge's books do tend to lack 'meat'. Not to say they are faulty -- the books NEVER make claim to replace the Bible or other quality non-fiction. All i'm saying is that it's true that while a huge portion of his books will be easy to relate to, sometimes one walks away being unsure of answers. And this is my main concern and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. However, if this book is studied WITH the Bible, I believe that it will be a blessing and a source of healing instead of emotional 'fluff'.This book will likely resonate with certain personality types more than others. In my experience, it touches more of the expressive/creative types than those who are blatantly practical. That's ok. There is no one cure-all book, and 'Captivating' is NOT for everyone. However it does speak great truth about hurt and healing to those who will listen. And I encourage women and their husbands,boyfriends, brothers in Christ to read this book without prejudice and to see what God teaches.God bless."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I decided to read this book because I'd been told by multiple people that I respected as Godly women to read this. And I was given the warning- you might hate it at first, but get through the first few chapters and see what you think. I was skeptical, and reading the first few chapters I wanted to chuck the book across the room. I'm far from a Bibical scholar, but I value Scripture a lot and I think we're called to be skeptical of people's interpreations.I do not think that John and Staci Eldredge have everything right. But I think \\"Captivating\\" speaks to our need for God to meet us deeply, personally and intimately. I hear many people saying- I don't relate because I don't need someone to rescue me. Well then, why do you need Jesus? I think I believe a lie that \\"God loves sinners- His grace is sufficent for sinners- sinners need Jesus to save them...but now, I'm a Christian (a saved sinner) and yeah, I still need grace and He loves me, but I'm no longer in need of rescue.\\" God wants more for us then this- read Romans 5- read 5:8 (while we were still sinners Christ died for us- AMAZING)...now keep reading- it doesn't end with salvation...Paul says \\"HOW MUCH MORE\\" multiple times in the next few verses talking about what God has FOR us after our conversion. It never stops being about God rescuing us, or our need.What I love about this book is that it does beat the idea that God loves us. And you know what- I don't think we ever really learn this lesson and need to stop hearing it. This is not a Barney \\"God loves me\\" now let's all run and give eachother hugs- it is learning that God's love is totally life transforming. HE changes us- and not because we are this problem He has to deal with (which I think is how many people see sanctification)- but because He loves us more than we can imagine! \\"Captivating\\" forces us to our continual need...that's not a comfortable place...I think that is part of why I wanted to chuck the book across the room. I don't want to need anyone- I am a strong woman, right? Oh, wait, I am broken...we all are!! This book is not for low-self-esteem women- it is for any women who is willing to consider that she is broken (and maybe more than she wants to admit).I think the Eldredges are bold, and sometimes with being bold, you miss sometimes, but I think the message behind this book- that we are ALL broken and in need of rescue, and that God loves us in our brokeness and that He cares about our redeemtion beyond our salvation because we are of immense value to Him- is a message worth being bold about. I think they lack in some theological arguments, but I think their core message is Bibical- very Bibical- but I'm not sure we always want to hear it.I advocate reading this book. Read it as a skeptic, but be willing to actually consider their argument. Don't accept everything you read in ANY book...only the Bible is God's Word. Test things. Test their arguments against Scripture- see the flaws. But don't let your skeptism harden you to also hearing a message that might bring you some amazing freedom.Sorry this is long- these are my thoughts."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"\\"As a new Christian, the first book I picked up on godly femininity I threw across the room. I never picked it up again. In the twenty-five years since, I have only read a few I could whole-heartedly recommend. The rest drive me crazy. Their messages to women make me feel as though, 'You are not the woman you ought to be --- but if you do the following ten things, you can make the grade.' They are, by and large, soul-killing. But femininity cannot be prescribed in a formula.\\"So begins (or very nearly begins) CAPTIVATING, written by John and Stasi Eldredge. The \\"I\\" in question is Stasi, but it's her husband John you are more likely to be familiar with. He's the author of THE SACRED ROMANCE, WILD AT HEART, and a number of other books that promote an adventurous and cathartic brand of Christianity. Whereas WILD AT HEART tailored that message for men, CAPTIVATING looks to tailor the message for women and is likely to have similar bestselling results.But even though femininity cannot be prescribed in a formula as the introduction says, CAPTIVATING's premise is that there is an essence that God has given to every woman. \\"We share something deep and true, down in our hearts,\\" Stasi writes. And it's this universal feminine heart that CAPTIVATING hopes to expose, heal, develop, and celebrate.That this feminine heart needs healing is not hard for the authors to evidence. \\"Every woman I've ever met feels it --- something deeper than just the sense of failing at what she does. An underlying, gut feeling of failing at who she is. I am not enough and I am too much at the same time. Not pretty enough, not thin enough, not kind enough, not gracious enough, not disciplined enough. But too emotional, too needy, too sensitive, too strong, too opinionated, too messy. The result is Shame, the universal companion of women. It haunts us, nipping at our heels, feeing on our deepest fear that we will end up abandoned and alone,\\" writes Stasi.If that statement doesn't hold water with you, don't even bother picking up this book because it's an observation (and a foundational one for this book) that's only anecdotally supported. If you don't already believe it, this book isn't going to convince you it's true. But if this being both not enough and too much at the same time strikes a chord with you, as it does for me, you'll want to read on.When you do so, you will learn that every woman's heart longs for three things: to be romanced, an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and beauty to unveil. It's worth noting that in WILD AT HEART John Eldredge writes that every man's heart longs for three things as well: a battle to fight, adventure, and a beauty to rescue. Isn't that nice of God to pre-load both male and female hearts with desires that fit nicely in parallel three-point outlines?Snark aside, CAPTIVATING contains some truly moving stories of women, their anguish, and their beautiful blossomings into whole-heartedness. I especially appreciated a section about emotional promiscuity among young single men and women. And as in the books that John authored alone (or with best friend Brent Curtis), CAPTIVATING's imagery is steeped in nature, also something that I personally appreciate. I feel the closest to God under a West Texas night sky where the stars glitter like so many princess-cut diamonds (though admittedly, the site of Chicago's skyline under a full moon as viewed from Lake Shore Drive has been known to do a number on me too).The breathlessly romantic tone of CAPTIVATING will alienate some. But of greater concern to me is that, while Scripture is sprinkled around liberally, the real source material here for making sweeping statements about the needs of women is literature, movies, music, and nostalgia. And while all of these are beautiful landscapes to explore and traverse, given that they often offer potent glimpses of Truth, they aren't necessarily meant to be our spiritual base camps.Having said that, CAPTIVATING surely will be a balm for the souls of many women. And if you and/or the man in your life is a fan of John Eldredge's previous books, don't miss it.--- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I picked up this book in the hopes that I would find something original, something challenging, something other than the evangelical drivel that passes for \\"Christian Living\\" books these days. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed.What I Liked:1. There really were some challenging ideas in this book. So often, \\"biblical womanhood\\" is portrayed as being all about homemaking, mothering, and hospitality. It's all about being \\"against feminism.\\" While I don't see anything wrong with a balanced view of a woman's role, I do think that it's easy to take these ideas to the extreme. Stasi Eldredge's book definitely does not fit the mold, at least not in the circles I tend to frequent. Mrs. Eldredge's ideas are concerned more with the heart. To her, \\"godly womanhood\\" means getting back to our roots as women, to embrace our femininity and use it for God's glory. Unfortunately, Mrs. Eldredge's ideas about femininity are wrought with their own problems. (See below). Additionally, Mrs. Eldredge's idea that womanhood and femininity doesn't always look the same between women is very refreshing and something of which I need to be reminded every day.2. The authors are clear about the God-ordained distinction between the sexes. In other words, men and women are not the same.3. The chapters, while lengthy, were quick and easy to read. Yes, that is a plus when you're running after two children under the age of three.4. This book was easy to read in pieces.What I Did NOT Like:1. The Eldredges have a very low view of women. In their minds, all women are broken, messed up creatures who have spent their lives hurting and looking for someone to build them up and fill in all the holes they experienced growing up. There is no room for strength, confidence, industry, dignity or any other \\"Proverbs 31\\" quality in their economy. In fact, they mock and ridicule the \\"Proverbs 31\\" woman as though hers is an unattainable, impractical, useless standard to which we should strive. For them, it all boils to whether or not a woman feels she is beautiful (and while they spend an entire chapter developing this idea, I never understood what they meant- beauty on the outside? Inner beauty? What beauty are they talking about? Oh, the beauty that is completely corrupted by sin, but made alive and beautiful again by the saving work of Christ? That beauty?), and whether or not she is being properly \\"romanced.\\" In fact, I'm actually nervous about writing a bad review of this book in fear that Stasi will read it and spiral into a depression again. What if I hit a nerve, dig a deeper wound, remind her of her difficult childhood? Why not generalize this fear to all women because according to the authors, women are weak, wounded, and helpless.2. Theologically, this book is a mess. For example: \\"Eve was given to the world as the incarnation of a beautiful, captivating God\\" (pg. 44). Hello! That is heresy! Jesus Christ, ALONE, is the incarnation of God. I think they must have no clue as to what they are actually saying in that statement. It would be more appropriate to say that Eve was made in the image of a beautiful, captivating God. Image and incarnation are not the same thing. They make this error several times throughout the book. They suggest that Eve was the \\"Crown of Creation.\\" In reality, mankind (women AND men) is the apex, the pinnacle, the crown of creation. They often refer to Jesus as the \\"bridegroom\\" of the Christian woman and that the woman is His bride. Actually, the Church is the Bride of Christ, and that includes men as well as women. They refer to Jesus in these sappy, overemotional, and overtly sexual terms when they talk about Him as a \\"Lover.\\" Well, were I a man, I would either laugh at this or be very turned off. Jesus isn't my boyfriend. He's my God. He's my Savior. He's my Lord. He is the Bridegroom of the Church Universal, but not of individuals. I could go on, but its late and I'm tired...3. Frequent and blatant misuse of Scripture. They take so much of the Bible out of context that its hard to know where to start in pointing it out. Their use of the Song of Solomon is a frequent offense in this regard. The book was written as a description of marital love between husband and wife, not between Christ and the Church and certainly NOT between Christ and a woman. Hosea is another example. This book was written as prophecy regarding the eventual return of Israel from exile, not as a description of the return of a woman to her \\"first love\\". They often mock the correct interpretation of several passages in Scripture, tossing them aside for their own feminized, overly-sentimental view as well.4. They have a very low view of Christ. Essentially, they suggest that He cannot act in our lives unless we let him, unless we \\"open the door of our hearts\\" where he stands knocking (yet ANOTHER reference they take completely out of context). Theirs is a neutered, powerless Christ. There is nothing said in this book about the beauty He gives us because He is IN US, living HIS LIFE through us. The reason I need to look to Christ to find this beauty for which I am allegedly seeking affirmation is because the beauty I possess comes from Him.5. There is an overemphasis on the effect that Satan/demons/spirits can have on the lives of Christians. I believe this issue stems from their use of the Neil T. Anderson's book The Bondage Breaker, a book that has been widely rebutted due to its unbiblical views of Satan and his relationship to believers. They attribute common marital and even medical problems to meddlesome spirits when there were completely natural explanations for what they were experiencing. I'm afraid that people will fail to get to the root of their problems and just \\"blame Satan\\" instead of really working through very complex issues (or seeing a doctor for medical issues!).6. Enough with the movie metaphors already! I don't want to hear about how I'm like \\"Cora\\" in \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" or \\"Rose\\" in \\"Titanic.\\" Tell me about Rachel, Rebekah, Mary, Deborah, Ruth, Phoebe, Dorcas, Mary Magdelene, the nameless women throughout the Bible who acted in faith when God called them out of their normal lives into greatness. Tell me about those women FIRST and leave the movie metaphors out of it! Instead of looking to God to learn about us, they point us to our culture and ourselves in order to learn about God. That's completely backwards!This book is nothing more than really bad pop psychology trying to be passed off as \\"biblical\\" truth. It is sappy, overly sentimental, erroneous, and, in most parts unbiblical. I had a hard time following any of the points put forward by the authors. The meat in this book would've made for an interesting article in \\"Christianity Today\\" or \\"Focus on the Family\\" magazine. They didn't need a whole book to detail this drivel. Please don't bother with it. There are much better books out there about biblical womanhood than this one."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I love this book!! First of all, it's not based on the Proverbs 31 woman. The books that say \\"Follow rules A, B, and C to be a good Christian woman\\" drive me nuts!! They make me feel so completely inadequate. This book was so different than any other book I had read. The Eldredges describe a woman's deep desire to feel beautiful, cherished, and fought-for (how we want a knight in shining armor coming to our rescue), and how that relates to our relationship with God. The book describes how women reflect the part of God that wants to be desired and cherished as well.This book really spoke to my heart, and encouraged me in my walk with God. I would recommend to any woman, and to any man who wants to understand the heart of a woman."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"To be honest, I agree with most of what the rewiewer below had to say. The authors are subpar, but that's to be expected with the Eldredges. The reviewer is also correct in calling them out on their sketchy interpretations of Scripture. In fact, they use *so few* Scripture references, you better have Bible in hand while you're reading this book so you can do your own research for their controversial statements.However, I wouldn't go SO FAR as to bash the *concept* of the book. While I agree that not EVERY woman is broken and helpless, there are a SIGNIFICANT number of women who have experienced tremendous hurts. The authors touch on some widely accepted, scientifically proven psychological issues that can develop in women at young ages.All in all, this book needs to be read with a discerning mind. THIS IS NOT SCRIPTURE so not every sentence is truth....keep that in mind! My suggestion would be to start with this book to gain some insight but if you're dealing with some of the serious issues discussed in this book, professional help is a must!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"My problem with this book is the same as my problem with the book \\"Every Woman's Battle.\\" EVERY woman wants this, or ALL women want that. No. We don't.Reading books like these have always made me feel freakish. This book, like EWB, made me think there must be something wrong with me, for it was proclaiming what ALL women want, and all I could think was \\"But...I don't. What?\\"Well, according to the reviews on this site, I'm not the only one who feels differently than this book tells me I should. If I got one thing out of this book, it was coming to this site and discovering I'm not the only one who didn't feel the way the book said I did."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book has a fatal flaw: it depends on fluff and emotionalism, not Scripture, to draw conclusions. You may notice that the lion's share of passages from this book are not from an actual translation of the Bible... they are from a book by a man named Robert Alter wrote ABOUT the book of Genesis.I am wary of any book that tells me who I am in Christ, but doesn't think the words of Christ are good enough to communicate that.Secondly, and this is probably the consequence of the dearth of Biblical references, Captivating is not theologically sound. John and Stasi Eldredge spend several pages detailing how God created the earth in increasing measures of beauty and complexity and importance. The culmination, according to this book, is not with PEOPLE but with EVE. Page 25 says:\\"She is the crescendo, the final, astonishing work of God. Woman. In one last flourish creation comes to a finish not with Adam, but with Eve... Given the way creation unfolds, how it builds to ever higher and higher works of art, can there be any doubt that Eve is the crown of creation? Not an afterthought. Not a nice addition like an ornament on a tree. She is God's final touch, his piece de resistance... Look out across the earth and say to yourselves, 'The whole, vast world is incomplete without me. Creation reached its zenith in me.'\\"Not something I would teach the girls in my high school small group.Apart from the lack of sound scripture, the shaky theology, and the fact that these authors quote themselves in every chapter (from Wild at Heart), the other major fault of this book is that I think all 224 pages could be condensed into 20 or fewer. There was so much sugar-coated FLUFF in this book, that I couldn't take it seriously. The authors used entirely too many words, pages, paragraphs, and chapters to say, \\"You are a creature of inherent beauty, created in the image of God, and He Loves You!\\" That is not difficult to say.I started reading this book because my boyfriend cared enough to buy it in an effort to understand women better -- and because he loved The Sacred Romance. He didn't read Captivating, and now I can save him the time."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I am in the process of reading the book and enjoying it.Having skimmed many of the reviews, I'm left with the following thoughts:1. Captivating elicits strong reaction in most people. They love it. They hate it.2. I'm a life-long avid reader and I thought it was fairly well-written in terms of flow and readability.3. Captivating is not a book for people who want a heavily scripture laden reference to biblical womanhood. As several have mentioned, there are many of those books on the market. However, I do think you can be very theologically astute and still enjoy this book. You need not take all parts of it as your own. Depending on your theology, you may or may not agree with the Eldredges on every point.4. Captivating is a book that may have appeal to someone who doesn't necessarily consider him/herself religious. It is written popularly and many unchurched or otherwise unreligious people may be able to relate to the media examples better than biblical examples the Eldredges could have used. Something about it reminds me of Donald Miller's Blue Like Jazz, which chronicles his own journey to understanding who he is in relation to God.In all, I can understand why some would have objections and I can understand why some love the book unreservedly. It depends on your personal filter with which you read and process life. Of course, be discerning, as you would be with anything that you read. I believe Captivating has a place in emerging Christian literature."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book says that women need three things: to be romanced, to have an irreplaceable role in a grand adventure, and to have their beauty unveiled. And, according to this book, men need three things: a battle to fight, an adventure to live, and a beauty to rescue. Let me rephrase those a bit more honestly. Women \\"need\\" to be the passive receiver to a man's initiative, to play a role in a man's adventure, and to be told we are beautiful by a man, whereas men \\"need\\" to be the active initiator (the one who makes decisions), to live an adventure of their own direction, and to have a woman to control and objectify. This is the premise of every so-called \\"chick-flick.\\" This is the reason women look to men to give them worth and purpose.I would offer the three longings of every human being's heart: to feel loved by others, to love oneself, and to love others. (kinda like Matthew 22:37-39) You aren't going to get any of those things by playing roles and mimicking the dominant (and secular, I might add) culture. You're far more likely to get them by treating all human beings the same way -- as equals, without boundaries imposed by stereotypes.According to this book, women were created to be submissive and if they take care of themselves rather than looking to a male person to make all their major decisions, they are being \\"emasculating.\\" This is an example of how some people choose to believe that traditions of the dominant culture are somehow natural and approved of by God, rather than checking with the Bible to see how Jesus/God behaved toward women. \\"There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\\" How then is it appropriate to tell people that they when they marry someone they are supposed to have an unequal relationship where one person makes the decisions and the other obeys without any thought or responsibility? Being \\"one\\" does not mean one person thinks and the other does not. It means both people think and work hard until they come to agreement.If you choose to read this, I urge you to also readWhat Paul Really Said About Women: The Apostle's Liberating Views on Equality in Marriage, Leadership, and Love."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I absolutely love Captivating.

I guarantee it!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I loved this book and I hated this book.I will start with what I loved about it. I truly enjoyed the writing style of both authors. I was constantly drawn into the stories and the descriptions and I often found it hard to put down. It is an easy read and for that I am thankful. This busy wife and mom can rarely find more than a couple minutes at a time to read. I loved the fact that this book is not your typical \\"Follow these steps and you too can be the best woman, wife, and mother God created you to be.\\" Instead of focusing on what each woman can do to better her life, the authors focus on what every woman needs. She desires to be loved and cherished. She longs to be beautiful to someone. This book reaches out to women in their most vulnerable place, their heart. I found this book to truly uplift who I am as a woman and it encouraged me to reach out to my Lord Father as exactly as I was created. He created me to be beautiful and no one knows that better than Him.However, I found this book to be quite frustrating at the same time. I have no doubt that there are so many women out there who were used and abused from childhood on and I in no way discredit what they endured. I can't even imagine. But, there are also plenty of women, me included, who never endured any major abuse (for that I am eternally thankful). This book focuses so much on women who were abused that one would think that all women were at some point. That is not true. One would also think that all women are over-emotional, soulless, and hurt. This too is not true.I would most definitely recommend this book to any woman who has suffered any form of abuse. I believe it could help her start over and see herself as God created her to be. I, however, would not recommend this book to all the women in my life. I believe this book is marketed to all women when in reality it is written for a certain group.This book was provided by BookSneeze.com as a review copy and this review reflects my honest opinion."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The book captured me at the beginning but towards the end I lost interest.

I had heard good reviews from John Eldridge's book \\"Wild at Heart\\" and was looking forward to reading this book, the companion to it - focused towards women, whereas \\"Wild at Heart\\" is focused towards men. I started reading this book a couple of months ago, and it has taken me a while to work my way through it. Each chapter was short, but slow to read. This is not a book that can be easily read in a weekend. Overall, this book was nice. The book is inteded to look at a woman's heart and soul and tried to address some of the issues that women deal with. Most women have a lot of baggage that we carry around due to our life experiences. This book tries to show women how the past hurts effect us and how we really are beautiful and loved by God.I'm sure this book will be very helpful for some women. I found most of it to be \`nice' and \`a good reminder', but I didn't end up having any \`AHA!' moments while reading it. I'm not sorry I read it, but it didn't quite live up to the hype that my friends had given it when recommending I read it.This book was sent to me by Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their book review program.

As CRAZY as it may seem, I definitely feel that I can understand a woman's heart more. Some things I already knew, some I had no idea, but all around I definitely have a clearer picture on why women feel the way they feel. Guys, don't be reluctant to read this book.

I read the book, \\"Captivating\\" by John and Stasi Eldredge. This was the revised and expanded version from what came out a few years ago. I was stunned by this book, it truly changed the way I view myself from God's eyes. Captivating was written to an audience of women, challenging them to understand our beloved worth as a woman. My little girl is three years old right now and in the \\"dress-up\\" phase...she loves to prance around in these beautiful dresses and put on jewelery and make-up. The authors encourage readers to find the little girl inside each woman that is longing to just be loved and turn that devotion over to God. It says in the Bible that we are God's heirs, and He is a King, so I must be a princess. God is EXTREMELY captivated by us as women, and as what we can bring to the world. \\"There is a song written on your heart and you must sing it. The world is waiting, needing what it is you have to offer. You must live the life you were born to live.\\" (John and Stasi Eldredge) This book pushes the misconception that women are destined for certain roles, and encourages readers to embrace the uniqueness inside each of us and offer our love, devotion and hope to the world and the people around us.

The book uses a lot of pop culture media to describe who Godly woman should emulate.

Lately it has been rather hard for me since I have gone back to work and my husband has been staying home with our little one. As a woman, I feel like that is my role and have struggled with the temporary role reversal. Captivating helped me to understand better where I am coming from and how I can still be a Godly woman and mother.

Chapter five is called \\"A Special Hatred\\". Let me first summarize this chapter and then I'll explain why this chapter is complete heresy.The premise of this chapter is this: \\"most of the bad things that happen to you in life are because you're beautiful. Satan is jealous of your beauty and does bad things to you because of his jealousy.\\" Of course, what woman doesn't want to hear they are beautiful? But this idea is found NOWHERE in Scripture.We learn in the Bible that God allows trials in the lives of Christians is for His good purposes. One reason we suffer is in 2 Corinthians 4:8-11 \\"We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.\\" One reason God allows suffering is so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our bodies! It has everything to do with the glory of God and nothing to do with our beauty or Satan.Another reason we suffer is to give God glory in our suffering: \\" - 1Peter 4:16 -Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.\\" If you suffer, glorify God. Don't look at yourself and think, \\"I must be REALLY beautiful, for Satan to want me to suffer like this.\\"But chapter five of Captivating tells us we need to give glory to ourselves, for our beauty, when we suffer. Captivating says the reason women have suffered throughout history is because they are beautiful. (We know as Christians they one of the main reason there is suffering in the world is because of sin--not beauty.) Here are some quotes from the chapter: \\"I was terrified of men and terrified of my beauty. Beauty was dangerous.\\" \\"What is to account for the systemic, often brutal, nearly universal assault on femininity? Where does this come from?\\" \\"Who does Satan single out for his move against the human race? ...Satan went after Eve.... Have you ever wondered why? It might have been that he, like any predator, chose what he believed to be the weaker of the two. There is some truth to that. He is utterly ruthless. But we believe there is more.\\"(We KNOW why he went after Eve. \\"For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.\\" 1 Timothy 2:13-14 \\"But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ\\" 2 Corinthians 11:3. Satan went after Eve because she was easier to deceive. We have the answer to the question: \\"Why did Satan go after Eve?\\" The answer is found in the New Testament. Eve was easier to deceive than Adam.)Captivating goes on to say, \\"Satan fell because of his beauty. Now his heart for revenge is to assault beauty... But most especially, he hates Eve... She is the incarnation of the Beauty of God. More than anything else in all creation, she embodies the glory of God.\\" WHAT??!!?? Where is that verse???We know the declaration of God's glory is made by the heavens which He stretched out: \\"The heavens declare the glory of God.\\" Psalm 19:1 And then in Isaiah 40 God compares people with the heavens He made: \\"Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are accounted as the dust on the scales; behold, he takes up the coastlands like fine dust... All the nations are as nothing before him, they are accounted by him as less than nothing and emptiness. To whom then will you liken God, or what likeness compare with him?... It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to dwell in;...To whom then will you compare me, that I should be like him? says the Holy One.\\" (Isaiah 40:15,17-18,22,25)It looks like God Himself has answered this horrible comparison. God Himself has said, \\"to whom will you compare me?\\" Why do the Eldredges compare a woman, who is part of the human race--who is less than the dust on the scales--to God? And especially, how can anyone dare to say \\"she embodies the glory of God\\"?To quote again from Captivating: \\"Put those two things together--that Eve incarnates the Beauty of God and she gives life to the world. Satan's bitter heart cannot bear it. He assaults her with a special hatred.\\" \\"It changes things to realize that, no, it is because you are glorious that these things happened.\\" \\"You are hated because of your beauty and power.\\"Yes, women often feel alone. The Eldredges are VERY GOOD at speaking to a woman's heart and describing exactly how they feel. They certainly have this going for them. They describe a person's pain and problems and suffering brilliantly. The problem is their solutions. The solution to the abuse women suffer is not found in recognizing your glory and beauty. But I think people are so \\"captivated\\" by finding someone who understands them, who writes exactly how they feel, that they accept any answer the Eldredges give.Now, some of the authors' answers are right on. And I think this is another place people get confused. Readers can become so emotionally entangled with what the authors are saying, they can't seperate the heresy when it comes. So, if you read this book, and if it ministers to you emotionally, PLEASE realize that not all the Eldredges' say is true.Previous Review: One message this book communicates is: don't worry, you've already attained, you're already doing good. Let us show you how you are perfect, ideal, captivating; let's dig up and discover who you really are so we can see how wonderful that person inside you really is.Paul said the opposite: \\"Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own\\" (Phil. 3:12). And Romans 7:24, \\"Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?\\"(Notice: the word wretched was used, not fascinating, not enchanting, not captivating, but WRETCHED!I feel like the book might say to me: \\"Don't say that about yourself. No, you're not wretched. Don't put yourself down like that.\\" But if Paul was wretched, and he was a supreme example of someone who followed Christ, we are certainly wretched.)Though God may love us, though He may be captivated by us, it does not make us captivating. No where does the Bible say we are worthy of being adored or loved. God loves us because of His goodness, not ours.Also, the Bible says that \\"a fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself\\" (Pr. 18:2). As Christians, our aim is not to understand how worthy we are for God to love us. Our aim is to understand how unworthy we are to be loved by God so His greatness (not ours) can be exalted.The authors also say we have to conclude that a godly woman is tired and guilty. How dare they! A godly woman has entered into the rest God provides, and she has no condemnation in Christ Jesus. A godly woman isn't even that focused on herself--she's focused on the worthiness of Jesus. If a woman feels guilty, it's no sign of her godliness.Another glaring problem with this book is the criticism of the Proverbs 31 woman. In Captivating, the Proverbs 31 woman is called an \\"infamous icon.\\" Hello--the Proverbs 31 is part of God's Holy Word, given by God to us in inspired Scripture. I believe that the remarks given about this woman border on blasphemy: \\"Somehow she has sanctified the shame most women live under, biblical proof that yet again we don't measure us. Is that supposed to be godly--that sense that you are a failure as a woman?\\" So our standard for a woman is not the Bible, according to Staci; because, after all, the Bible makes a woman tired and guilty. And if the Bible proves (as Staci said, it's \\"biblical proof\\") we don't measure up, why is she taking it upon herself to say we do?Again, the book says a woman has been told by the church, \\"I am not enough.\\" Uh... Of course! The whole message of Christianity is that we are not enough--God is! Jesus didn't die on the cross because we were enough, or because our goodness is enough, or because we have what it takes to be special and holy. No, apart from Christ we we're wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked. Remember how Jesus said, \\"For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked\\" (Rev. 3:17)? This book might like to make us think that we need nothing, but we do! The answer is not found within ourselves, within our own hearts, within our own dreams and desires--the answer is Christ! It's found in Him and He alone is the answer! Not some dream I had as a little girl. Not some desire I have now as a woman. If we look within our hearts, which are deceitful ABOVE ALL THINGS (Jer. 17:9), we can only expect to find desperate wickedness. We need to move away from fairy tales and back to the Bible.I understand that some women who have read this book feel like they understand God more. But if what you're understanding isn't biblically based, it's not worth understanding. Overall, I cannot even in the slightest bit recommend it."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book truly opens the bible so that I could really see MY place in it--letting me see that I am more than just man's helper. My heart seemed to blossom and tears came to my eyes when I read how God created women to refect His image as well. I have studied the Bible for years and read the same scriptures--in some cases many, many times indepth--yet I was never able to see them in such light. I guess I always read them with the misguided feeling that I (women) were created only as helpers and that somehow meant \\"lesser\\". This book shows women that we were created as the \\"crown of creation\\" and how that image has been tarnished and trampled on, both over the centuries as well as in women's lives in general. I am currently reading it for the 4th time and I am still amazed and uplifted to see all His qualities within myself. I have tried to read it at least once a year because it seems like in the hustle and bustle of my everyday life and demands that God's truths about ME are forgotten and swept aside. This is a fantastic book for all women...not just those ultra homemakers with the perfect hair, but for those of us who are trying to find where we fit in God's picture of mankind. It is a must read!!!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"So God invented swirly skirts to help women bring men home to Him. This argument makes Dior's New Look pretty much equivalent to the Second Coming. Well, I've always worshipped Dior anyway.The book is not just silly; it is deeply offensive to any woman with a functioning brain, and any person who takes theology seriously."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I had to read this after I read Wild At Heart--This book pointed out so many times, places in my life when I was broken. When my spirit was crushed, when I missed getting something that I truly needed for my life--and it also gave me the strength to say, \\"Hey, that's okay -- I'm okay -- I'm beautiful.\\" Thank you -- John and Stasi -- for your ministry and honesty!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have to be honest. Captivating did little to captivate me.This the kind of book that just leaves a bad taste in my mouth and is just another increasing example of how I I just do not resonate much with Western evangelicalism any more - simplistic, all about me, lacking spiritual depth, and identifying Christianity with our American materialistic, consumer based western culture -On the one hand they are saying that they are not playing into stereotypes of women, or are not out to make women out to be only suited for certain roles, but they are really only describing stereotypes of women. Everything they are saying about women has to do with a western cultural mindset, point of view. That is the pair of lense they are using to set their criteria. All the cheesy \\"chick flick\\" quotes? Please! I love a good romantic comedy, adventure....but where is the depth in that? That is something I enjoy, but that does not define who I am. They are only speaking of real surfacy issues as they profess to be speaking of depth, the heart and soul of a woman. I mean, as they discuss little girls who want to twirl in skirts and be called Princess, I have to ask, what about women in Africa trying to stay alive through AIDS and hunger? What about women in Afghanistan? Somehow, I just don't think their concerns are so much to be romanced, be beautiful and long for a great adventure. I am offended that the Eldredges claim this is the heart and soul of every woman! Every woman?I do believe there are feminine traits and characteristics just as there are masculine traits and characteristics. Do I like to be beautiful, do I like to be romanced, do I like a great adventure? Yes. Did I like to play with dolls? Yes. Did I like to dress up in twirly skirts? not so much. I liked playing under the porch making mud pies. I liked my swing set. I liked building homes out of my blocks. So, yes, I agree these are some general feminine traits and characteristics, but I totally disagree that this is the essence of who I am...that this embodies my heart and soul as a woman. I am a woman, yes, but more so I am a woman following Christ and seeking to find my identity in Christ.. What really excites me and motivates me and spurs me is when I am in sync with who God created me to be, when I sense He is using ME (unique me) in the ways He wants to use me to advance His work and Kingdom. My identity is not in my husband or my marriage (and how he or it is making me feel about myself) or what I do, it is in who I am identifying myself with, and that is Christ. When men seek their identity in Christ they are inevitably going to become more of the MAN God created him to be. The same goes with women. As I seek to have my identity in Christ, I am going to become more of the WOMAN God created me to be.I think the Eldredges say nothing extraordinary. IAside from what they claim it does NOT, I think it does follow most formulaic Christian books - a+b = c (a fulfilled life!)Honestly, I am finding some parts of the book to be bearable, but overall captivating had as much depth as a cess pool of stagnant water. And we know what is going to come next. Workbooks, conferences, speaking engagements, support groups etc. that again, ties into our very western consumer, \\"me based\\" culture. But, on the other hand, if it brings people, especially women, into a deeper relationship with Christ, then it is doing some good.And I totally understand that my view is by far the minority (...)"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"For those wanting a pop-psychology quick fix to the complicated heart of a woman, maybe this book is for you. But if you're looking for biblically sound answers to the questions you have as a Christian woman - STEER CLEAR! While there are parts of the book that have merit, you have to wade through so much false teaching to get to the good stuff. You have to ask yourself - is it really worth it? The answer is \\"no\\" in my opinion, and my Pastor agreed. For those whose desire is to search the Scriptures for your answers I would recommend Beth Moore's \\"Breaking Free\\" or \\"A Woman's Heart, God's Dwelling Place\\" God Bless You."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I must disagree 180-degrees with reviewer Melissa Smith, who gave Captivating a one-star rating. Perhaps she was reviewing while wearing some strong presuppositions for protective armor.Having taken this book as an 8-week study course, I saw through Stasi's honesty the freedom God gives us to be REAL about our struggles and how we have been taught to see ourselves.It is incorrect to say that Stasi is putting down the Proverbs 31 woman--or to misconstrue what was meant by the word \\"incarnation.\\" Neither John nor Stasi would intend the reader to infer that Eve was an incarnation in the same degree that the Lord Jesus Christ was the incarnation of the Trinity.May I say a word to the woman who, because of this poor review, might hesitate to read the book? Please note that for about $5 you can own your own copy--then you be the judge. But let me assure you that you will find such validation, such affirmation in the pages of this book, such insight and understanding. You will see yourself on every page. You will begin to see--perhaps for the first time--that God does indeed see you--yes, you--as Captivating. He is captivated by you--His creation--even in all your flaws and weaknesses. He sees you through the lens of how his Son Jesus Christ has transformed you into His beloved daughter.Our lives as women are filled with daily activities that often seem mundane--unimportant--rote. We wonder if what we do has lasting impact or value. We can see our lives as hum-drum, when God has a grand adventure for us, behind the scenes of the hum-drum, when we take His hand in ours and see ourselves as HE sees us. THIS is the beauty of Captivating. John and Stasi will do for you, the reader.By far the most intriguing thought in the book--and one I have become convinced is true--is the explanation for WHY Satan, the enemy of our souls and all God's creation--has targeted women in particular. You will have an \\"aha!\\" moment as you consider the reason. Brew that cup of tea--and be prepared to have God shower you with His love through the pages of Captivating."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I bought this book because my husband really enjoyed \\"Wild At Heart\\". I thought \\"Captivating\\" would be a \\"Wild At Heart\\" for women and I was wrong. I really tried to like it and even read the book twice. I first felt uncomfortable how they try to relate Jesus as your lover. I get the concept, but the way they explained it was too weird for me. Then I started researching the verses they used and found most of the verses are taken out of context to meet their examples. I strongly urge you to look up the verses in the Bible and compare them to how they use them in the book. Then there are parts where John jumps in and speaks on how/why women act. Maybe it's just me, but not even my husband can figure out how I feel about myself, especially the root inner feelings. I really wanted this book to be a good one. Too bad."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"In this book, John and Stasi Eldredge succeed in telling people who already agree with their gender essentialist principles what they want to hear, and padding their bank account at the same time. If you are frustrated with the throwback gender roles that seem to pervade modern Christianity, do not read this book.Here are the notes I took to prepare for discussion with my book group.* Circular logic: we know that people want X because we see it represented in the media. But because X is represented in the media, people want it.* Gender essentialism: flat-out stated in Wild at Heart chapter.* Viewing children as \\"untainted\\" examples of gender differences is invalid because even very young children are socialized from birth. See: gender division of clothes and accessories even for infants, separation of toy store aisles into \\"girls\\" and \\"boys\\".* That argument also doesn't hold water in the case of children who prefer the clothing or toys of the opposite sex - who in many cases are denied access to their preferred items in an effort to \\"straighten them out.\\"* I suspect I differ from the Eldredges on this, but their argument does not consider scientific evidence of a genetic basis for asexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality - or anything that considers sexuality to exist on a spectrum.* Their linkage of sexuality with gender identity is not something I completely buy.* They note that their male children prefer to play with weapons and cars than nail polish and dolls. Have they presented their children with the option to choose \\"girl\\" toys? If not, they do not know that the boys naturally prefer what they have.* They say that boys are born warriors b/c their boys enjoy weapon toys. They discount their own role in encouraging \\"warlike\\" behavior by providing those toys.* Stasi repeatedly references experiences of herself and her friends as evidence of what girls/women desire. This is a self-selecting group of somewhat like-minded people.* They wildly misquote movies and books.* Their principles are limiting not just to women, but also to men.* The ultimate extension of their logic often leads to situations of domestic abuse.* The book does not justify its logic or observations, simply pointing out that Stasi too was once \\"misguided\\" by feminist principles. Because she felt happier when she developed a new worldview, it is assumed that readers will too.* The entire book is essentially white, western and bourgeois in orientation. People of lower economic classes do not have the option to dither about whether they should be less \\"striving\\" or seek more \\"adventure.\\" Women in the third world are more concerned about not being raped and given HIV than fulfilling their femininity.* An overemphasis on sexuality as a \\"gift\\" given by women to men compels a view of women as the sum of their sexual parts. This view, intended to set women apart from a sex-oriented culture, in fact has the opposite effect by enforcing the view that a large part of their worth is determined by the status of their sexuality. Fetishizing purity reinforces sexualization of young girls - not young boys - and ultimately creates a culture in which sex - getting it, withholding it, defining it - is the main cultural force."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The reviews for this book seem to be extremely polarized, and I can see why. Those who endorse it do so because they say it restores a sense of romance and adventure to relationship with God: and it does. Those who hate it cite the way there is little strong Biblical support, which is also true.I'll address the negative first. Perhaps in an attempt to be hip and culturally relevant, Captivating cites many pop culture examples of femininity and a womanly spirit. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this; current examples can enrich a text that deals with such an ancient faith as Christianity. The problem with Captivating is that the pop culture examples seem to replace Biblical support. I also found the book's overall message to be a little inconsistent in some places.These features did not ruin the book, though. It introduces the way you can have a romantic relationship with God well. I liked the personal anecdotes, both from John and Stasi and from other women they've talked with as well. Like I said, it's not too strong on the scripture, but in the one real place they do use scripture, it's wonderful and effective. The Eldredges highlight the way Song of Songs was not meant to just be taken literally, and they do a good job with it; it's my favorite feature of the book.Captivating may not be scripturally strong, but its heart truly is in the right place. The romantic love you can experience with God is often overlooked in books for women of faith, and Captivating can serve as an introduction to this side of God in the lives of women and girls everywhere."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Almost all the women I know have conflicts within themselves, even those who are happy with their marriages and/or their careers.

Each one of us, precious and valued by our creator!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Clearly, people either love or hate this book. I picked it up with some reservations, but then I couldn't put it down. I've been in evangelical churches all my life, and the extent of the teaching that \\"God loves me\\" has always been limited to Christ's death on the cross, and God's desire that I live according to His commands. Both of which are priceless and absolutely true, but only part of the truth.THIS is the God I never learned about growing up - and oh, does it open up wonderful possibilities of walking with Him. To those who claim the Eldredges take Scripture out of context, I say that this is the first time I've heard many of those verses IN context - the whole context. And I love their use of so-called \\"secular\\" movies and music - I instantly understood, in a way I'd never understood before, so many principles. Whether I liked the movies or not.God has taken me on a journey for the past several years of teaching me His voice, and showing me far more of His character and His very personal love for me than I'd ever known. I've learned that His interests and care for my moment-by-moment life far exceed anything I would have dared to dream. It's been an amazing journey - and it was an incredible experience to see it all summed up in this book.Do I agree with every single point of view in Captivating? No - at least not yet. But it brings together, in an absolutely unprecedented way, all that God has been teaching me. Yes, it challenges much of the traditional, and quite honestly impersonal, aspects I've always been taught about God. And it's about time someone took us further and deeper...To those who hate the book, I simply ask - what if it is, indeed, so wonderfully true?"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Are you tired of being let down time and again? Want to know why you long to have that need met? Want to know where it came from and how to truly fill it? You can't get it from people on this earth, but this book will lead you to know where you can find it and why you long for the truth.This book has helped me realize that my husband is not the source of my happiness. My children will not make me happy. My friends will make me cry. But there is one Person who needs me just as much as I need Him, if not more. It makes me want to fight for what's right and what I need in my life instead of letting the emotions of the day guide me to whatever the outcome will be. Granted, I still have my times, but at least I can fight back for the truth.I hope this book will teach you how to live instead of letting live. It will make your family happier in the end. AND you will see the fruits of your labor. I guarantee it, if you follow Him."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have read many of the reviews concerning captivating. Personally I found it to be a great read and very good bible study. I was able to study this with over 200 women and saw many face challenges and things they had allowed to be buried for years. Some who had endured rape, molestation, bad parenting and other types of relationships were able to connect with a part of their femininity they had lost. There was a deeper understanding of the cresendo of creation concerning woman....well written throughout the book. The book ties scripture, everyday life experiences and even movies to help with application. I do realize while many embrace this book, many do not. I think it is difficult sometimes for us to admit that we are missing something, difficult to come to terms because facing truth sometimes can be painful and many of us find comfort in status quo or the reality that we have made for ourselves for years. I truly believe this book was a gift to women in so many ways. I had given it to friend who after reading the first three chapters was angry saying the writers were generalizing all women and that she didn't feel any of that. She wanted to throw the book out of the window...she was so angry with me for book. I allowed her to vent and suggested she not read it if it is not for her. Well about a week later she called to say she was sorry. She really did not want to admit some of the things from the book because it would cause her to make some changes, admit some things are wrong, and confront some issues in her life. I would challenge any woman to read this book with an open mind and not from a critical standpoint.There is so much in us women that needs to come forth and again Captivating in a biblical view ministers to the heart of a woman!!! For those who like my friend wanted to throw it out the window or get a refund I challenge you and admonish you to pick it back up again and feast on this gift.FSATAT!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"WOW! This book not only gets to the heart of what I often feel it reminds me that the only antidote to feeling alone, unlovable, unwanted and... is to find my answers in my Savior, Fiance, and Lord. It gives real life examples from the authors' lives as well as other people. The Eldredges cover a lot of territory in these 200+ pages. They touch on issues of identity, Spiritual warfare, wounds from dysfunctional birth families and many other areas. This book only skims the surface in many areas as its main purpose is to help women see more clearly who God intended us to be in a general sense and for us as women to understand the role God designed men to play in our lives and us to play in theirs. I think this book could also help men to get a deeper glimpse at the things that we as women often keep buried between ourselves and hopefully God because we feel that the men just don't get it.Maybe they do, maybe they don't but one of the points in the book is that we need to look to God, our Creator, for the true answer to our nagging questions regarding our worth as a man or a woman. The following quotes illustrate some of what the authors have to say on this topic.\\"A man's deepest question is, \`Do I have what it takes?'.... A woman's is, \`Am I lovely?'....We can't wait until we feel safe to love and invite.... God calls us to trust Him and offer our true selves.... He wants us to entice, allure and invite others to Jesus by reflecting his glory in our lives. He will give no guarantee that others will respond well.... God's invitation is to bring our sorrow to Him. To keep our hearts open and alive, and find refuge and healing in His love.\\"This book also reminds the reader that God is ultimately the source of validation and fulfillment that we try so hard to find elsewhere. If our focus is on Him and the relationship He desires with us and built us to desire with Him then many of those feelings will be eliminated.There is so much more to this book and it has created a hunger and thirst in me to pursue the more intimate relationship with my Lord that I have been neglecting. I would recommend this book wholeheartedly. I can't even begin to put down here all the gems and wealth the authors have managed to fit into this short span of pages. Read Captivating to get the full picture of what these authors have to say and how it can be applied to your own life."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I think every man ought to read this and get a glimpse of what goes on in a woman's heart - it will take them to a different level spiritually.

According to what season you are in your life will determine how you relate to this book. Just like the bible, certain stories and messages are more meaningful to you because it relates to what you're going through. This book is for any woman who feels alone, undesired, or hurt (single or married). Captivating shows you how God desires you. It reveals the venerable side to every woman's heart. If this is something you are not seeking (at this time) then it will not appeal to you. But at that moment or season when you feel alone or abandon and you want to understand the why's, when's and how's of your heart's desires then allow this book to be an instrument of God's undying love for you."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"There wasn't much theology in this book. Unless you consider movie quotations and situations as theology. And what they did take from Scripture, much of it was taken out of context, like the passages from Song of Solomon.

That's the theme of this entire book, which probably should be titled 'Captivity' instead. Waiting and following and being looked at are apparently what the Eldredges think are the most important things in a woman's life. They seems to believe that male attention is the guiding light of female existence (Please look at me. Rescue me. Fight for me.)So, let me say that Staci doesn't speak for me and I doubt if she speaks for any of the women I know. I gotta wonder if Staci even speaks for herself, since John does so much of the talking and since this book is just the cookie-cutter reverse of Wild at Heart. She defines her role only in response to what John believes men need. John says that men need to fight, so Staci compliantly agrees to be the pin-up painted on the bomber. I want to ask her \\"Honey, can you think for yourself?\\"Unlike Staci, I didn't spend my childhood in twirly skirts desperately seeking Daddy's attention. Forget playing dress-up, I was building volcanoes and radios and exploring the woods and building forts from chopped logs. My dreams weren't of weddings, they were of being an archealogist and a deep-sea diver and an astronaut and a Wimbledon champion. My heroes were Joan of Arc -- women who did things, not women who waited for men to do things for them or to them. I admired Robin Hood -- I couldn't care less about the passive girlfriend. Apparently unlike Staci, I had a mother and father who taught me to be independent and self-directed, not to wait for rescue; to build my own kingdom, not to wait for prince to carry me along on his idea of adventure.And did you notice how John and Staci keep telling us that men need battles. My question is \\"What are they fighting for?\\" Is there any sense these men are fighting for any real cause, to improve education, to eliminate poverty or disease, to make healthcare more affordable? No, that's the kind of fighting women and more civilized men do. What we're talking about here are men who are just looking for a fight. There's no overriding goal -- the battle itself is the goal.Staci wants women to become a collaborator in this. She wants women to be a convenient prop in the male warrior fantasy, the excuse he uses to justify his own violence. \\"Men need to fight for you\\", she claims. Really? How does their fighting help me or improve the world in any way? Does it educate my children? Does it pay for their books and shoes and dental exams? Does it create a safer, better, more just world?Just because there are some men who can't control their urge for killing and destruction does not mean I have to become a party to this. So, don't tell me these men are fighting for me.They're fighting because they lack the skills to resolve problems intelligently, or they feel real manly firing big guns at small animals, or they need to compensate for their failures elsewhere, or a hundred other little-boy reasons. But don't tell me they're fighting for me.It seems pretty obvious to me that John has some real issues with insecurity -- and Staci is merely playing the role of enabler. She's little more than the mirror for his compulsions -- which she then declares her great adventure. Of course, her idea of \\"great adventure\\" is nothing more than being the recipient of male attention or pursuit or rescue, or to be excuse for male violence. Sorry, that's not an adventure, it's a pathology. And it might be the Eldredges', but it ain't mine."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"My daughter in law advised me to read this book & felt it would do anyone good, so I bought a copy for my daughters & my other daughter in law.

It not often you read a book about what a woman truly is according to the word of God. It amazing to see that we woman have the same nature of God and when she explains it, it makes you so proud to be a woman. The love of God for woman is evident throughout every page.

They use both description and exposition, drawing the reader into what is an exciting, investigative, and compelling book.Examples of their use to descriptive references were made in relationship to personal thoughts, feelings, experiences, and revelations from their own lives. A particular example from the book that I can recall was in relation to depictions made toward God answering prayers. \\"The kiss\\" from God that Stasi talks about in one of her latter chapters was a story reflecting God's goodness that I found to be beautiful and inspiring. The imagery also used in descriptions offered of experiences had, was powerful, relatable, and inviting. I was never dismissive of the content, but rather enthralled to read on.Because of the realistic and honest nature of the Eldredge couple's writing, it is easy to become a part of the ideas made throughout the book.There are some aspects of the book however, that I felt could have been left out. Namely: the common and often overused mention to movie titles. This seemed to be distracting within the context of the statement being made, and detracted from the seriousness or validity of the main ideas presented. Likewise, I felt that there was a great deal of overgeneralization. Though it can be valuable to share stories from personal experience, it should be pursued with careful intention.Overall, it was woman's insecurities, fears, joys, and desires as the things being discussed in this book. There was great consideration into expressing the feelings and emotions of woman. There were many moments throughout my reading this book, that I was forced to pause and think about the notions or thoughts that were presented. They were powerful, convicting, and strongly explained. I closed the back page of Captivating feeling satisfied and fulfilled. I felt as though I had gained a deeper understanding of myself as a woman."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"At last someone has put in writing what I've known in my heart all my life! &#34;Captivating&#34; is literally a work of art...beautifully written and inspiring. Also, it's very healing. I thank God for John and Stasi and the work they do."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The book Captivating by Stasi and John Eldredge is an eye opening novel about the role of a Christian woman. It touches on many topics such as a woman's relationship with God and a woman's influences in her life. The book recognizes the struggles many women face dealing with appearance, self-confidence, and past experiences. It also talks about the power that is unique to women especially in sharing our faith and God's kindness.I liked all the main aspects of the book and the points it had. It was very interesting to learn about a woman's role as a Christian. The book makes you think about your life and how the role as a Christian woman is applied. It made several references to the bible that connected the points Stasi and John had. It was an enjoyable and easy read. Throughout the book, however, I found many things to be repetitive. This could be the authors' way of getting their points across. The book also includes several stories of different young women. It is at some points random. It is hard to keep up with who is who.Overall I thought it was an enjoyable book. For women, it is hard to know our role and importance as Christians. I would recommend it to any Christian woman who is willing to learn and accept others opinions. I would also suggest it to Christian men who want a better understanding of women's importance as Christians. It is important for all of us as Christians to understand the importance of women."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"THe Book opens your heart and mind to a different concept of thought.Your Self discovery will interest you.

The authors take verses out of context to prove their points and the new Christians were being misled. I am throwing away both my book and study guide since I wouldn't want anyone else to fall victim to the faulty teaching. Stasi herself seems to have many issues that are unresolved and if you view the videos that come with the book it is clear that the women in the group need help in climbing out of the pit instead of repeatedly discussing their difficult past (which since I am a former social worker didn't seem all that difficult by comparison to what many women suffer in our world)."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I received this as an \\"audio book\\" gift for Christmas and listened to the entire reading in one afternoon.

I would recommend it to any Christian woman who wishes to overcome those obstacles that keep her from the close walk she desires."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"According to this book all women are shallow. All we care about is me, myself, and I. We want a fairytale life based upon movies and not a spiritual life based on the BIBLE!Not all women are this shallow.Some of us want something more than a pretty pink dress and for someone to call us beautiful.I find it very disturbing how they have changed an immaculate God into someone who would be \\"incomplete without me\\" and how his \\"only desire is to romance me\\". This is a very selfish and shallow book!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is a controversial book, and I feel less qualified to evaluate it than I imagine my female friends are. It seemed to do a good job of articulating the female condition for those individuals *for whom these generalizations are true.* Unfortunately, not all women resonate with the book's premises, and some feel that it perpetuates gender stereotypes. It also gets very Christian-ese at points and I struggled to keep my attention focused during those parts.The book expands the Eldredge pantheon begun in The Sacred Romance and Wild at Heart, and while those books have been very helpful to me, I've started feeling as though the authors find themselves painted into a corner with their only option being to continue fleshing out the details of their uniquely flavored male/female/spiritual mythos. Perhaps this book can best serve as a conversation-starter: I could easily err if I assume that it's true for all the women I know, but I could also accelerate my understanding of an individual person by asking, \\"What parts of this book seem true for you?\\" Any book that generalizes about gender is bound to draw some fire, but I do still believe that there tend to be baseline psychological differences between the average man and the average woman in terms of deep desires, motivations, etc., and that this book is another helpful tool in gaining understanding."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"A wonderfully insightful book about the heart of a woman. This book is not intended to replace your Bible, but it offers a gentle view into the way you (as a woman) have been \\"fearfully and wonderfully made\\".

Now, I can't put it down because of the subject matter. Though it is a little confusing sometimes as to whether John or Stasi is writing, what they are saying and how they say is is wonderful. Through scripture and through illustrations, they \\"unveil the beauty\\" of God and why it is so important to women today. I am alreay buying copies for family and friends and will recomend it for years to come. It is also one that I will be re-reading with my husband. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"First off, I'm a guy. Allow that to change how you take my review however you'd like.I just finished reading the book about a week ago. It wasn't my first attempt. The Christian Student Center I belong to had a girls group class over the book, and I saw a copy lying down in the center. I must say this, it's a real page-turner. I was so disgusted by everything I read that I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to see the next garish leap of logic. I read about a hundred pages, walking away thinking, \\"Is it really possible to combine self-aggrandizement and fragility to that degree?\\"I kept wanting to finish the book, if for no other reason than to fully understand the type of women that would agree with the material so that I could better spot and avoid them. Finally, I asked a female friend to loan me her copy. I will say this: towards the end, the outrageous claims die down and the book starts to make more sense. But getting there is quite a chore. I kept asking myself, \\"Do women really believe this?\\"-Can a woman really be so self-absorbed as to agree with the authors' idea of ONLY Woman as the \\"Crown of Creation\\"? (I chuckled when I read them saying that Woman was NOT an afterthought of God, because according to the Bible she either was, or male and female were created together)-Is the central theme of EVERY woman's story \\"The assault on her heart\\"? (If you summed up your life story in one sentence, I hope for your sake, for all our sakes, that it wouldn't be, \\"My heart has been assaulted all my life, to the point that it is my life's defining characteristic.\\")-Is the central question of a woman's life REALLY \\"Am I lovely?\\"? Do women not have something more noble, more altruistic, to think about?-If a woman is supposed to exude calm and rest and \\"All is well,\\" what does that mean for female entrepreneurs, female carpenters, single moms who have to work hard jobs to feed their kids, etc.? Are they doing \\"femininity\\" wrong? Are tomboys and girls who don't like wearing makeup displeasing God?-Are the women reading this book really swallowing the outrageous claims of the authors hook, line, and sinker? (\\"No one has come up with a good enough translation for that Hebrew word until us\\", \\"Men being the head of the family is not the perfect order and was only established because of the Fall\\", etc.)In between these major gaffes, the text really seems incoherent. The writers will meander around a topic and connect all sorts of things that don't fit or make sense. I'm also a person in the camp of \\"fewer movie quotes, more Scripture quotes.\\" Frankly, as I read I was reminded of a misogynist tract I read earlier that suggested female communication consisted of telling stories at each other, trying to make each other more cheerful, and occasionally asking, \\"Does that make sense?\\" after a non sequitur tale. When the book itself offered up a variation of \\"Does that make sense?\\", I laughed out loud.Despite everything I've said, I'm not sure I wouldn't recommend the book. There are obviously some women who love this book and think everything in it is true and wonderful. To that end, reading it feels like doing military recon. I'd suggest this book to guys to help them find out what type of girls they want to date and marry. I'd suggest this book to girls and women whom I doubt would agree with it, to see if they could come up with better alternatives.Let me also say that I got a few epiphanies out of this book. I now realize that women believe beauty has utility, and as a person who has long seen almost no benefit to something being more beautiful than useful, this is great food for thought. I also came to consider that our romantic relationships are the closest mirrors of our relationship with God. What is lacking in the latter may cause problems in the former.Overall, I'm glad I read the book, if only to know more about the women that agree with it. However, I desperately hope most women don't see themselves as simultaneously God's greatest accomplishment and the victim of continuous emotional assault. In short, I hope my future wife thinks the same things about this book I do: it's a weird and saddening little tome; thank God the Bible tells a very different story."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I loved this book. It it a truly powerful, amazing book!I am a pastor, and have had study groups with women going through this book together.I like how it addressed our feelings of failure, and never feeling good enough. Our questions are all different, am I lovely? May not be yours, it may be... am i happy? Do i have what it takes? am i important?This book inspired me to seek Jesus on a very personal level, letting him deal with issues from my past as well. I believe if you read this book as the story it is, without getting legalistic, you will truly appriciate the message of the book.Stasi takes you through her journey...and hopes you will start on yours.The bible is always open to interpretation by the reader, but it is the Holy Spirit who makes the words speak to your heart. It is a living word of God, and The Song of Solomon is an example of that... its not just a pretty song...As for the negative comments some have made about captivating,these are likely from offense, and a negative,critical spirit.This book has brought many women i know closer to the Lord.We should encourage these things, even if it wasn't your thing.The Word of God tells us our words are powerful, that they speak life or death... they either build people up, or tear them down.This book was a builder, it spoke life.We should do the same."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is mostly emotional claptrap.

It was painful. I found it to be too egocentric for my taste. Like other reviewers, I could not relate. I walked away from it feeling like there was something wrong with me because I don't get all gushy over made in Hollywood romance.

Its a deep book, making one think, but in a good way. It opens your eyes to show that you are really beautiful, inside and out because that is how God created you. I have friends that are reading it too and we all are getting something different from it. I defiantly recommend this to any woman, any age. It does help you think better about yourself."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"What little girl doesn't dream of one day being swept off their feet by Prince Charming and live happily ever after? These desires are the secret that fuel the hearts of women everywhere. Even though many women dream of this life, there are very few that ever find this type of happiness. As time passes, we begin to lose sight of these dreams and begin to \\"settle\\" for what we think will make us happy. Life events leave us wounded, pushed aside, forgotten, and doubting that true happiness in life will ever be found. If you add to that the typical \\"Christian women's duties\\" that makes for an increased feeling of failure. The message of Captivating is this: Your heart, above everything, matters to God. The longing as a little girl that was once felt is how God created you to be to a woman. Just like Prince Charming who has come to sweep you off your feet, God has come to capture your heart and give you the freedom to live fully just as He created you to live.In Captivating, the Eldredges attempt to explain the very nature of what it means to be a woman: \\"Every woman in her heart of hearts longs for three things: to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty.\\"1. To be romanced - The desire to be pursued and loved is something that is deep within a woman. It runs so deeply that no man can fill this need. This is a need that only God can fill. Although women search for \\"things\\" to replace that void, it is not truly filled until one enters into a genuine relationship with the Creator of life.2. To play an irreplaceable role in a shared adventure - Women were created for adventure and desire to be part of a team. They want to play a role in the relationship, not be on the sidelines. Women were created to be a \\"helpmeet\\" for their mate and to come alongside them to share in the adventures of life.3. To unveil beauty - All women want to be beautiful inside and out. Beauty is found in many things. Art, music, moments in time... It could be considered a vision from inside each of us that portrays our interpretation of the way that beauty should be. I believe that this perception of beauty is placed in each of us and that it reveals the true glory of God.This book deals with brokenness and wounds and goes into depth to explain how sin has impacted women. It explores the ways that women are wounded that demand activation of their defense mechanisms. I believe that this book is a very insightful read and can lead one to a path of healing and wholeness."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is a truly incredible book that so carefully and fully explains what is lacking in most relationships today. This book is so well written that you will have a difficult time putting it down. And it is so very deep and helpful that you will have to put it down and take time to absorb and understand all that is being presented. I so wish that I had this information about the true heart of a woman many years ago. I think that anyone reading this book, female or male, will come away with a much better understanding of how a woman feels and why she acts the way she does."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Husband and wife, John and Stasi Eldredge, channeled their insights into the female heart to write their first collaboration, Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of the Woman's Soul. This New York Times bestseller is the sister book to Wild at Heart. Authors John and Stasi are a testimony of partnership, as they are also leaders of Ransomed Heart Ministries in Colorado Springs, Colorado. They have a built a life in the Rocky Mountains, pursuing their raw passion for Christ's miraculous creation with their three sons.Captivating explores the core of the feminine heart, identifying its innate desires and dreams as Christ's very own treasures. It is written as an invitation to women to join in an infinite and intimate romance with Christ. It also provides testimonies of healing and revival, encouraging the broken and scared to start fresh with a new perspective, that of our creator. For those seeking and attempting to understand the complexity of the woman, Captivating offers fulfilling and joyful explanations. Most intriguing, it defines man and woman's relationship as a chase. Each is driven by this thrill of pursuit, where the man desires to pursue and the woman desires to be pursued.As a nineteen-year old woman, just beginning life on my own, Captivating instilled a new confidence within my spirit. Stasi writes, \\"The desires you had as a little girl and the longings you still feel as a woman--they are telling you of a life God created for you to live.\\" That said, I encourage you to not only purchase, but also share this work with those you cherish, including men. I pray it will enrich your relationships with others, yourself, and Christ."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I really liked this book. It is my 2nd/3rd favorite book. Initially I hated it. I suggested it to several women who had personalities that were similar to mine...strong, lioness-like...We all had a similar reaction \\"hated it!\\". But as I continued to read with a open mind and prayer it was quite revealing. Using the word of God and by being honest about what is truly in my heart (things mentioned in the book) I have been transformed. To the women who said \\"hated it\\" I advised them to continue reading and they have all come back to say \\"I loved it!\\". In order to appreciate this book you must have an open mind and honest heart. There were some things I didn't agree with such as salvation/who are true Christians (Act 2:38, Romans 6:3-6, John 3:3-6). Other than that it was great!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I just finished rereading Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul by Stasi Eldredge. I read it a while back, and just never got around to posting a review for Book Sneeze.From the back cover - The message of Captivating is this: Your heart matters more than anything else in all creation. The desires you had as a little girl and the longings you still feel as a woman are telling you of the life God created you to live. He offers to come now as the Hero of your store, to rescue your heart and release you to live as a fully alive and feminine woman. A woman who is truly captivating.In the book, Staci, along with her husband, John, author of Wild at Heart, states that \\"Every woman in her heart of hearts longs for three things: to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty.\\" Each of these longings are discussed in detail with appropriate and timely scripture references that give a good biblical foundation for understanding the longings that women experience.My favorite section of the book deals with the friendships of other women and the importance of those relationships in a woman's life. \\"Women friends become the face of God to one another - the face of grace, of delight, of mercy.\\" Though female friendships may hold disappointments and hurts, an inevitable fact in our broken world, deep friendships are so important, it's the way God designed us!I love the idea in this book that God is inviting us to a great romance with him. What a blessing to know!Other topics in the book discuss sensitive topics of wounds and how they shape us and our relationships.I enjoyed reading Captivating."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating is a book written for women, the tagline being: \\"unveiling the mystery of a woman's soul. Along with this book, John & Stasi also wrote a book for men, called Wild at Heart, which they often refer to in Captivating.Their basic premise, in my own words, is that women are created to be princesses, and men are created to be knights. Yet, we suffer in our lives because we are kept from fulfilling this destiny. By destiny I don't mean actually being princesses and knights but there's a longing in each of our hearts that a \\"princess\\" longs for, namely: to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty. In John & Stasi's words: \\"that's what makes a woman come alive.\\"All in all, I enjoyed the read, sort of. I mean I like it, but it just feels like something is missing/lacking but I can't seem to define what. Would I recommend it? Yes. Most probably. And if you read it maybe you can tell me what it is that seems to be off.Oh, and I honestly am intrigued to get Stasi's follow up book: Your Captivating Heart."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"If you remember John Eldredge's first book \\"Wild at Heart\\", you'll love Captivating where he teams up with his wife Stasi for a look into the woman's soul.Men can benefit from reading this book as well. Who wouldn't want to know exactly how to restore a woman's heart so she can be all that she can be in a relationship?The book starts with 3 focus points for women: to be romanced, to play a role in her own adventures and to display beauty. There are a lot of references from movies and pop culture, which is interesting and goes along with the focus points in the book.Learn how to set your heart free, to realize that there may be things in your life that you don't like and want to change to better yourself. If your hurt and need healing this book is very helpful. This book may not be for every woman, everyone has their own opinion on what they need. This book holds a message and that message is that God will always be there to care for us, to heal us, and to lead us in the right direction. If this is something you are wanting then it can be made possible!When reading this book I remembered the verse: Proverbs 31: 9b-31.[...]Thanks to Thomas Nelson Publishers/Book Sneeze for my opportunity to review! [...]"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The book Captivating has been given multiple reviews. Some of the reviews are positive and some negative, but I personally believe that it was definitely worth the read. The book was easy to relate to. Women of all different personalities and backgrounds still have the same yearning, to be loved and be called beautiful. John and Stacie Eldredge write with a passion to provide information to answer the call of women. Their information is backed up with verses provided from the Bible that show the reasons why God put women on this earth.The only thing that I had a hard time liking in the book was the beginning. I felt that the beginning was very hard to engage myself in. Once the reader moves past the opening, the rest is very informative and enjoyable to read.I recommend this book to all young-adult women. Reading this book applied to my life in many ways."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I just finished rereading Captivating by Stasi Elderidge, and was again reminded of how great it is, and what a needed message it has for women. If you are a woman then I think you might need this book. Here's a snippet:\\"Every woman I've ever met feels it --- something deeper than just the sense of failing at what she does. An underlying, gut feeling of failing at who she is. I am not enough and I am too much at the same time. Not pretty enough, not thin enough, not kind enough, not gracious enough, not disciplined enough. But too emotional, too needy, too sensitive, too strong, too opinionated, too messy. The result is Shame, the universal companion of women. It haunts us, nipping at our heels, feeing on our deepest fear that we will end up abandoned and alone...\\"If any of this quote resonates with you then I think you'll get something out of Stasi's book. Her premise is that: every woman's heart longs for three things: to be romanced, an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and beauty to unveil. She spends the book unpacking these three things driving home the point that God loves us deeply, something I think we always need reminded of! I left this book with a sense of God's love for me and new insights into what womanhood is all about, even on the second time through!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I would have never picked it up otherwise. I would have never really come across it if it weren't for it being recommended to me since I don't venture into Christian nonfiction too much. With that being said, aside from a few reservations, this book was actually really pleasant and beautiful in many of its parts.I think you have to be a practicing Christian to really appreciate this book, more than I did anyway. I am a Christian, but I haven't considered myself a 'practicing Christian' in a long while now, even though I am a very spiritual person and I have my own personal relationship with God. In this sense, some of the scripture passages went over my head. Even so I was still able to realize what the authors were getting to in some parts of the book.One of the reservations I had when I started reading the book had to do with rhetoric. I was fond of some of the words being used, and some of the notions being talked about. Things like how women were Unseen, Unsought, Uncertain and they had to be Romanced and Rescued. Once you strip away some of the rhetoric in this book, you realize there are some meaningful and substantive fundamental concepts about us, women, and our femininity worth reading about.My next reservation was with the roughness of the concepts. I felt the book was stochatic in many ways. It didn't really flow easily from one part to another. It sort of jumped like a rabbit from one pasture to another... grazing on the surface of each one but not really getting to the nutritious depth of it all. I think even so I was still able to gain some insight into what the authors were trying to explain.So what did John and Stasi Eldredge accomplish with this book? What is the authors gain from reading this book? Well first and foremost, I believe they realized an image of a woman's feminity. How does our culture, society, and the rhythm of our daily lives tame and even at times destroy a woman's femininity, a woman's captivating soul? And how does a woman regain her sense of beauty, captivating soul, and a calm secure sense of self back?First, through a woman's beauty and mystery, both of which lie at the center of her captivating soul. This is what the authors say about these two. See for yourself. While on the surface, these statements might appear a bit mocking and sarcastic even, there's something of use in them, something deep down true about them.'A woman knows, down in her soul, that she longs to bring beauty to the world. She might be mistaken on how (something every woman struggles with) but she longs for a beauty to unveil. This is not just culture, or the need to 'get a man.' This is in her heart, part of her design.''One of the deepest ways a woman bears the image of God is in her mystery. By 'mystery' we don't mean 'forever beyond your knowing,' but something to be explored.Not something to be solved but known with every-deepening pleasure and awe. Something to be enjoyed. Just like God, a woman is not a problem to be solved, but a vast wonder to be enjoyed... She years to be known and that takes time and intimacy. It requires an unveiling. As she is sought after, she reveals more of her beauty. As she unveils her beauty, she draws us to know her more deeply.Whatever else it means to be feminine, it is depth and mystery and complexity, with beauty at its very essence.\\"Secondly, I believe the authors touched on very real dynamics of a woman's soul (as well as a man's). Towards the end of the book they talk about what curses women and prevents them from acheiving their true captivating soul. That plague is 'loneliness' for women, and for men is futility.The book, though, is much more broad than what I have just mentioned here. If you are a woman with a curious mind on how Christianity sees women and if you want to see a fresh perspective placed against that, this is a good book to read. I am a woman and I have a curious mind, and I am glad I read this book."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I loved Captivating because it helps you understand what God thinks of you.

I was one of them, once upon a time. Underlining was my way of rereading a passage and imprinting it in my brain. Trouble is, I would have to underline nearly every sentence of Captivating, because nearly every one resonated with some deep hurt or desire from my life.They should sell this in a gift pack with a box of tissues...or perhaps a dozen lace-edged hankies would be more appropriate.The question on the lips of every girl or woman is \\"Am I captivating?\\" Am I pretty? Am I beautiful? Do you want me?It's the reason little girls (and even full-grown women) twirl their skirts.It's the reason there are whole aisles of \\"beauty\\" products at the corner drugstore.It's the reason for face-lifts.For eating disorders.And breast augmentations.It's the reason a battered woman will go back.But it's a question that often is never answered, never even really heard, here on earth.So many women are in a world of hurt, broken by their lack of self worth.But God hears the question.And answers, if we only open our hearts to the sound of His voice.Lest you think this book is about exterior \\"beauty,\\" it's not. It's about how we tend to look for love in all the wrong places. And how to repair the holes left by our past hurts by turning to God.It's a powerful book. And I recommend it.Disclaimer: I received a free review copy of this book from Thomas Nelson Publishing through [...].

Written by John and Stasi Eldredge it is a discussion of how they believe that at the core of a woman's heart God has instilled a need to live a life that develops the beauty in a woman's soul which shines through her physically and spiritually. They continually focus on the fact that God loves each woman and that all of God's creations are beautiful. At first I was reluctant to start to read it, I have read so many Christian women's books that seem only to intensify the guilt that I am not 'perfect' and have really no chance of following their instructions to become 'perfect'. However right at the beginning Stasi addresses that feeling by confessing that she also hates those books so, hope begins. I like their take on the phrase \\"ezer kenegdo\\". That God created Eve not as an afterthought but rather as a crowning glory, or final touch, to his creation of the beauty and marvels of Earth. That as an ezer kenegdo a woman is essential and irreplaceable in a man's life. I found that my mind was engaged with this view and all it's substantial ramifications. Although there were some areas of the book that I found I couldn't relate to like some of the chapters of different areas of problems for different women all in all I definitely learned a few things and will read it a few more times for I am sure that I will learn something new each time. I did have difficulty with the many referrals to \\"Lord of the Rings\\" which I haven't read but they didn't really detract too much from the gist of the message. Although the prayers at the back of the book have some relevance, I can't see someone actually getting all the way through the Daily Prayer for Freedom more than once. This book would be good for a woman's group and a study guide is also available. I think 4 stars.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program.

Booksneeze let me have two books to read this past month, and I loved the books they sent me. Today's book is for all of you ladies out there looking for the divine purpose in your femininity (and for all the guys trying to figure it out.)John and Stasi Eldridge's book Captivating is a landmark book, in my opinion, on the female soul. In poetic, flowing style, the Eldridges unravel the complex design of a woman. I've read numerous tomes on the characteristics of males and females, yet never have I encountered a book that treated the subject so well that I ended it with a passionate admiration of my wife and all the women in my life.John and Stasi show how society and the Church has tried to regulate the role of a woman to simplistic terms and chores, thereby limiting her. By revealing the core desires of every woman--every personality and kind--they prove that women are much more than what they have come to believe about themselves.Every woman wants to be fought for or romanced, to share in an adventure and to have their own, unique beauty to unveil. These desires cannot and should be delegated to social stereotypes, but should be liberated and allowed to be expressed. Than, we will see women as God intended for them to be--captivating."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Stasi Eldredge truly poured her heart and soul in Captivating: Revised and Expanded. With the aid of her husband John, Stasi wrote in this book how all women feel at some point in their lives and how they just want to be loved. She made me think at my own life and why I might feel about certain things now that I do. At the same time she wrote of all the trials she hade been through and how she had to deal with them and still to this day struggles with the pain of her youth.For Christian women this is a must read. It is a guide to show us how God wants us to feel as women, that we are all beautiful and that he truly loves each and everyone of us. That we as women do matter and that we should feel good about ourselves.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, it was hard to put down, but at times it was also painful to read. It is sad to know that some women go through life not knowing what true love is, especially God's love.I highly recommend reading Captivating but be prepared to uncover something about yourself you didn't know.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program.

The publisher has in no way influenced the content of this review, and the views expressed are solely my own. This is a book I've had on my wish list for sometime, so the opportunity to acquire it through the BookSneeze program was seredipity. This book was also recommended by Dave Ramsey, along with many other authors I am reading at present.SUMMARY: Captivating is all about the soul of woman as created by God. Starting with Eve, the authors describe the heart and soul of women, including the fictional characters found in age-old and modern day stories, and the author's themselves. Weaving in references from Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Sound of Music and Cinderella, John & Stasi describe how every woman is built to be romanced, to be an irreplaceable role in an adventure, and to be beautiful. The authors also describe how these qualities affect a woman's relationships with their husbands, parents, siblings, and children.REVIEW: This book is intense, full of material both scriptural, personal, and pop-cultural. It will challenge your view of yourself and how you relate to the women in your life. The few pages the authors use to translate ezer kenegdo from the Old Testament have already improved my relationship with Dawn. As with the other Edlredge book I've read [Epic], Captivating is full of drama, describing modern day, earthly experiences as taking place within a larger context on the spiritual plane. The book is full of adventure and romance as Satan has a particular hatred for woman, God's image bearer for relationships and closeness, and God seeks to return the hearts of His fallen daughters to Him. This book is challenging and eye-opening, but comforting and healing as well. I highly recommend Captivating.Reviewed at [...]"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"When I first heard about Captivating, from the author of Wild at Heart John Eldredge and his wife Stasi, my sarcastic tinged thoughts were something like \\"the boys get to be \`WILD' and I get to be \`captivating', oh boy.\\" But I hadn't gotten far into the first chapter when hope flared in my heart that this would be a different type of what-you-are-as-a-woman book.Captivating's authors make it clear from the introduction that this book is not another, what you are doing wrong and ten things you can do to fix yourself book. HOO-ray! What it sets out to be is a re-discovering of the richness femininity was meant to bring to our lives and the way it speaks to us about the heart of God.I liked that this book explored things other than having babies, serving, and being helpers to men. It talked about those issues but didn't stop there, as many books do, as if to say that's all there is to being a woman.For example, some of my favorite topics addressed were a woman's desire for adventure, being a part of something epic, and doing battle and how these things are part of the essence of femininty but have a different flavor than our male counterparts.\\"There is something fierce in the heart of a woman...A woman is awarrior too. But she is meant to be a warrior in a uniquely feminineway.\\" pg 11Some of the chapters didn't apply to me but I found myself thinking of people who could really benefit from reading them.There were a few times when I wished they had included more scripture, but other than that I found my view of what being a woman means broadened and enriched by this book. Yay!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"\\"Am I lovely?\\"\\"Am I worthy of love?\\"\\"Am I captivating?\\"These are the questions that every girl and woman asks. How your Question was and is answered has a huge impact on how you view yourself and your beauty. \\"Captivating\\" seeks to change how a woman sees herself. It points you in a direction to receive the answer to your Question from God. The book talks about how to overcome the lies we've been told and the wounds we've suffered to become to women God desires us to be. You can choose to live the life you were born to live.I enjoyed reading this book. It kept my attention.....what woman isn't interested in becoming more beautiful? I was very interested to read the author's suggestions on how to obtain the life that God has planned for me - how to become closer to Him. I do feel that this book is written more for women who have suffered under the weight of abusive fathers, rough husbands, and even mothers who didn't care for them. I think this book can help provide great healing for them. I was very blessed to have parents who answered my Question with the right words. They adored me and my siblings, did their best to lead us along the correct path, and didn't have a problem showing their love for us. This book was a good thinking book for me. It presented several topics in a way that I had never heard them presented. I also enjoyed the brief insight into a man's life, what his Questions are, and how they pertain to women. The authors have also written \\"Wild at Heart\\" about men - I think I would enjoy reading that, as well, since I am the mother to 3 men-in-the-making. The only thing I really disliked about the book was the constant references to books and movies. I'm not much of a movie watcher, so many of the movies I had never seen and therefore the point they were trying to make was rather lost on me. They did attempt to explain each scene, but I think if I had actually seen the movie it would've been a much clearer picture. I didn't agree with everything the authors had to say, but I would recommend this book to a friend (I actually have a few in mind that I intend to loan this one to).This book was provided free of charge from Thomas Nelson publishing.

'To be spiritual is to be busy. To be spiritual is to be disciplined. To be spiritual is to be dutiful.' No, to be spiritual is to be in a Romance with God. The desire to be romanced lies deep in the heart of every woman. It is for such that you were made,\\" (129).That's right-- to be a \\"woman of God\\" means to let God romance you. And that's just part of what the Eldredges (mostly Stasi) talk about in this book. Throughout the entire book, the Eldredges talk of how God wants women to live out those three basic desires we have as little girls: to be romanced (to be desired), to be part of a great adventure, and to be beautiful.No matter where you are as a woman in life, God sees you as beautiful. He is captivated by your beauty. He desires you to live the life you were born to live and designed to live-- to take part in the great adventure he has planned for you (whether it's motherhood, starting a business, traveling, being a missionary, volunteering, continuing your education, etc.). For those women who are married-- it's no coincidence that these desires line up with the desires most men have as little boys-- for a battle to fight, for adventure, and for a beauty to rescue. One of the things my husband told me when we first got married was that he'd always fight for me, for us (he'd just read John Eldredge's book, Wild at Heart).I love the way these desires fit together when a man and woman are in a relationship. In Stasi's words, \\"A woman in the presence of a good man, a real man, loves being a woman. His strength allows her feminine heart to flourish. His pursuit draws out her beauty. And a man in the presence of a real woman loves being a man. Her beauty arouses him to play the man; it draws out his strength. She inspires him to be a hero,\\" (19).And if you're not married...not to worry. Married or not, God fights for you every day. He wants you. He wants to rescue you. He wants to be a part of your great adventure."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul by John and Stasi Eldredge is essentially about uncovering the deepest desires of a woman's heart.

Maybe my expectations were too high going into it, but I had a hard time making myself finish reading Captivating. It really didn't grab my attention like I thought it wouldIn my reading of Captivating, I was actually surprised to find more popular culture references than Biblical ones (I'm not saying this is a bad thing - I just wasn't expecting it).

Another \\"girl\\" book telling me how to act pretty? Having read parts of Wild at Heart, I knew there would be something more to it than that. What I found is that this book is about the feminine heart - the most important part of a woman's being. It's about why God made women and the glorious purpose He has for them. The authors explore the deep significance of beauty in the heart of a woman, how to recognize and reveal that beauty and then give it to others. However, in this fallen world all is not beautiful, and the feminine heart often sustains many wounds. So the authors carefully guide you through steps to heal the wounds of both personal sins and the sins of others. Finally, the purpose of our femininity is revealed in the irreplaceable role of women in the kingdom of God.As I read this book, although I didn't agree with everything the authors said, I found myself both inspired and convicted to further explore what is in my own heart and to value the inner preciousness of womanhood. I think this book will be understood best by grown women who have some life experience and recognize how different their femininity makes them from men. The authors don't address every aspect of womanhood in their book, but in matters of the heart they do have some excellent wisdom to share.Disclosure: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program.

I loved the book, but it may be due in part for the same reason I love food cooked with organic and fresh ingredients - the book itself became captivating because of the allure of it's subject. There is a lot of honesty in these pages, and it is presented in a graceful eloquent way but still retains the raw emotion - much like the treasures it is describing.The duo set the scene where the Bible sets it - creation. God creates alongside man an ezer kenegdo, which has been translated from Hebrew to mean a \\"helper\\" or \\"companion\\". But John and Stasi point out that when ezer is used elsewhere in the Bible, it is in reference to a very necessary lifesaver in desperate times. She is hope for the man. And, as a man reading this book, I was spurred on by the message that I don't need an ezer to be a couch potato living a stagnant life; I need an ezer if I am living out a wild faith which throws me in the midst of adventures. I found this book to be a great insight into the hearts of women whom I admire. There are examples of hurt as well as triumph and I have been able to see some of the women I interact with in those stories. I can see this book being a tremendous tool to help understand the whys and hows of these majestic souls.However, I do know that this book, like Wild at Heart, does not apply specifically to every woman. I found when reading that there are some very general statements made which some women I know would not be able to relate with. There is a statement in the introduction which I think is good to keep in mind while reading; \\"So, is a true woman Cinderella or Joan of Arc? Mary Magdalene or Oprah? How do we discover essential femininity without falling into stereotypes, or worse, ushering in more pressure or shame upon our readers?... And that treasure is your heart, your priceless feminine heart. God has set within you a femininity that is powerful and tender, fierce and alluring. No doubt it has been misunderstood. Surely it has been assaulted. But it is there, your true heart, and it is worth recovering. You are captivating.\\"I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their rad book review bloggers program.

John and Stasi Eldridge do a fabulous job of delving into the mysteries of being a woman and encapsulating the true desires of women as pertaining to self-image, relationships, and the way we are viewed by others.One of my favorite sections in the book expounds on the common lie that women have bought over the years: that we are simultaneously \\"too much\\" and \\"not enough\\". We feel we are too needy, too emotional, too weak, too much work for guys to really get to know us. On the other hand we never have enough time, never enough grace, and no matter how hard we try at whatever we do, we won't feel that it is good enough.I love how the Eldridges embrace the natural femininity that so many of us have squelched over the years, and encourage women in every stage of life to rediscover the hopes and dreams they once held, before the harsh realities of \\"real life\\" caused us to store them away for safekeeping.I highly recommend this book.

Although, in summary, it sounds quite cheesy, Stasi and John guide the reader on a journey through scripture, literature, and real experiences that tend to lack empirical and statistical evidence yet resonates within the recesses of the mind.That God created man, both male and female, in his own image is an accepted Christian doctrine. The authors take this doctrine a step further by expressing the divine nature of womanhood. He specifically blessed us with qualities that are feminine; relational, beautiful and seeking validation. It is their goal to assist the female reader unveil her femininity and connect with God and her man.Validation is found within the books pages as the authors reveal that God is beautiful and glorious. He seeks to have an intimate relationship with His children. He seeks our honest hearts and implores us to seek Him.It is easy to assume that every woman carries with her wounds that have not healed. Most pop psychology books provide ample fodder that our parents have wounded us. I tire of this mentality. It quickly establishes that our parents are the enemy rather than part of a support system that shaped our diverse personalities and independent selves. This mentality also relieves the grown child of any responsibility to respond differently to stimuli.On the other hand, John and Stasi Eldredge offer compelling arguments for accepting our Divine Nature and infinite worth as Children of God. A God who reserves a piece within His heart that only we can fill. A god who can validate our existence and provide shelter and peace.This book will not appeal to every reader. While reading it, I found gems of truth that resonated within my soul. In my attempts to articulate these truths at a later time, they sound sloppy and cheesy.Bottom line: We possess divine matter. The qualities that are belittled and squelched for the perceived lack of strength are really our divine nature. It is the woman who seeks out relationships and deeply connects to those around her. It is the glue that holds society together. We are the ezer kenegdo, a beautiful Latin word that can not be directly translated into the English language and is erroneously penned as \\"help meet\\" to our husbands, conjuring utilitarian images. In a more accurate picture, we are the part of Adam that he lacks. Together we complete each other and hold a healthy and vital balance of who God is.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] &lt;[...]> book review bloggers program.

This is a book about restoring the heart of women to live full, beautiful, captivating lives as God created them for. It's a book about femininity and God's specific design for woman. It delves into the wounds and lies that steal hearts and reveals the freedom that can be found through God. It's a great book and I would definitely recommend it.I was a little skeptical of Captivating before I started reading it because I knew it had been popular a few years back and I tend to be weary of \\"popular\\" Christian culture - feel good ideas with very little biblical Truth behind them. I also thought that a book about \\"being a woman\\" was going to be overly cheesy and sentimental. I was very pleasantly surprised by Captivating. While there were a few moments in the book I thought were a little over-dramatic, the majority of what I read was biblically based and rang true to me. I especially liked the way they described womanly beauty in this book - as a reflection of God's beauty and coming from a heart at rest in God. So good. I could go on, but I would suggest you read more for yourself. I think you will enjoy it!I received this book for free from [...] in exchange for my honest review."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"When I first started this book, I was a little skeptical because how can just one woman speak for us all? How can she know our deepest feelings and emotions with every one of us being so different. As I continued through the book, I began to like it so much more. Captivating shows us a woman's relationship with Jesus and how woman think, feel, react, and more. It was a truly an amazing read and I would recommend it to anyone. I am very tempted to read the book written by the author's husband, Wild at Heart. It depicts a man's point of view about his relationship with Jesus. I would love to read and compare them both.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program.

It touches on everything in this book, and will also help you understand yourself better as a man, which in turn will help you come to a better understanding of what makes woman tick. If you are a male that is into counseling woman then I would recommend this book to you.From my interaction with woman over the years, I can see this book bringing healing to many a woman's life, as long as they give the book a chance and are honest with themselves. I do see some anger in some of the other reviews, but I really think these reviewers are just missing the point.As a man I do find the type of woman that the author tries to lead all woman to become, to be the only ones that I truly find Captivating.

It makes little sense to walk out of a light-hearted romantic comedy and then turn to the Bible to find a series of proof-texts to back up the warm, fuzzy emotions delivered by Hollywood's view of romance. It is time for Christians to become more critically minded about sex, romance, and marriage. We should turn to the scriptures first and ask for the counsel of those around us who exemplify feminine strength. Christians should be the ones critiquing overly romanitcized love, not endorsing it.

I was compelled to buy it and I am very glad I did. I felt the Eldredges did a wonderful job of taking biblical truths, making them culturally relevant, and revealing God's heart towards women. I found the references to movies and music a much needed open door for the unchurched and sick-of-church. The message I received from this book is one of restored relationship with the One who loved us first and aren't all we of faith to be ministers of reconcilliation?

Much of the message resonated with me, but several points weaken it. The biggest problem I found was the poor theology and scripture taken was out of context. The other big issue is that this book walks a razor's edge towards teaching self centeredness. It attempts to point the wounded heart towards healing (a very noble goal), but falls short by meandering into worldliness (way too many references to secular movies, music, etc.). It also puts women into a box, citing \\"what all little girls play\\", and \\"what all women long for\\"; while we all have some of the basic feelings described, not every little girl plays princess (though I did), nor does every woman long to be romanced (a good friend of mine hates it when her husband brings her flowers). Regardless of the above points, the book is worth reading if you are a woman hurting and lonely from rejection in your life.

Is that how you see yourself - as a timid teenager tiptoeing through FantasyLand? Idly waiting outside the castle for someone to come along and tell you that your ribbons look pretty and your feet are so dainty?If so, you might identify with the rather meek, child-like creatures these authors apparently think all women are (or want to be). So, I'm not surprised they chose a book cover that looked more suited to a children's book of fairy tales and nothing at all like a book of substance geared toward grown women with adult responsibilities.There was very little in this book that resonated with me. I found it shallow, silly and, at times, downright offensive in its portrayal of women as trite, helpless beings who live only for male attention.

At what cost?"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"/CAPTIVATING: UNVEILING THE MYSTERY OF A WOMAN's SOUL serves as evidence of the epidemic of confused ideation which unfortunately, finds its way into print.The perennial faults, common to New Age literature, [The CARTESIAN AFFLICTION & The ERROR OF ECCLECTICISM, are made evident in this book, by authors claiming vaguely, to be \\"Christian\\".Even the title reference, concerning \\"A WOMAN's SOUL\\" more than suggests that the SOUL is itself SEXED, or qualified by a gender, and this would specifically make the book unChristian in its theological foundations. In Christian theology, there is no such thing as a SOUL being feminized or masculinized.One can only wonder what system of Checks & Balances such author use, or failed to use, as they compare their proposals to valid propositions.Philosophically, the core difficulty concerns the issue of human IDENTITY. The authors fail to identify SOUL as the human identity, and opt instead for a modernist interpretation of being founded upon SEXUAL IDENTITY. Therefore, if I am born male, my identity is that of a male, rather than that of a SOUL.This fault established, the foundation for nearly everything the authors write is not only weak in its rationality, it is contradictory to even the most simple and basic of Christian doctrine, regardless of whether the reader is either Catholic, Protestant, or any other sect.______________________________________________________THE THREE HERETICAL PREMISES:PREMISE (A): The first woman, EVE, according to the Eldredges was not a creation of God, similar to ADAM, nor was EVE molded from ADAMS Rib as Genesis indicates. According to the Eldredges, the essential premise of their book is that EVE was an INCARNATED GOD, and not mortal as ADAM was mortal.Here is the evidence for that:\\"Eve was given to the world as the INCARNATION of a beautiful, captivating God--\\" p. 44, mid-page, CAPTIVATING by John & Staci Eldredge (paperback edition) [caps mine---BB]Genesis 2: 21--22 indicates something entirely different.PREMISE (B) The second premise of the Eldridges is that God the Father did not send Jesus Christ. This is because even before the generations leading up to Jesus, God had cease to act. The FINAL ACT of God, as claimed by the Eldredges, is that God's final act was the INCARNATION of EVE as a God.Here is the evidence for that.\\"She is the crescendo, the FINAL, astonishing WORK OF GOD. Woman.\\"----p. 25, CAPTIVATING, by John & Stasi Eldredge.PREMISE (C): The third premise of the Eldridges is that Chapter 31 of the book or PROVERBS contains an INFAMOUS ICON,Here is the evidence for that.\\"We're all living in the shadow that INFAMOUS ICON, 'The Proverbs 31 Woman,' whose life is so busy I wonder when does she have time for friendships, for taking walks, or reading good books? Her light never goes out at night? When does she have sex? Somehow she has SANCTIFIED THE SHAME most women live under, BIBLICAL PROOF that yet again we don't measure up.\\"---p. 6, CAPTIVATING, John & Staci Eldredge (paperback) [caps mine---BB]Any objective person, reading Proverbs 31, can see that the scripture claims nothing that would serve as a BIBLICAL PROOF that:(a) Women do not measure up. In point of fact, it was WOMAN who bore the MESSIAH.(b) There is an INFAMOUS ICON described in Proverbs 31.(c) The woman described in Proverbs 31 has SANCTIFIED THE SHAME women live under.The Eldredges, at the least, have borne false witness.The book seems committed to answer common Mass Minded dilemmas, which appear in the earthly, rather than the spiritual woman. CAPTIVATING is consistent with New Age publications, including in a later chapter with address of fantastical and worldly propositions for \\"Warrior Princesses\\". This is itself strange in consideration of Christian doctrine. It only addresses woman as a maiden, or unmarried. It fails to address the status of the married woman.__________________________________________________At the beginning of each chapter, the authors offer several quotes from literary figures of the past, and other personages, as though to indicate that the twisted associations of the author's ratiocinative processes are supported as standard philosphical underpinnings throughout the realm of literature. However, many of such quotes are taken entirely out of context, and others are not even remotely related to the Feminist ideological proposals of the authors.For example, Chapter 3 begins with a quote from William Shakespeare:\\"O pernicious woman.\\"That's all. It isn't even a complete sentence; but by the confused ideation of the authorship, somehow the line of the character in a Shakespearean play, is to be construed to imply that Shakespeare himself held some philosophy that all womanhood is PERNICIOUS. Anyone familiar with the Catholicity of the Bard would see the utter absurdity of such a proposal._________________________________________________Sometimes, it is not pleasant to indicate the massive faults of authors, because a reviewer would prefer to be kind; but if one neglects to review according to facts, and consider reviewing on a factual basis, all manner of nonsensical propositions find their way into print.That such literature has little at all to do with Jesus Christ, or a dynamic and vital spiritual life, is obvious.Is is most certainly New Age writing and that it is philosphically flawed is readily apparent from even the very first line of the book:FIRST LINE: \\"Now we are on holy ground.\\"--INTRODUCTIONHow do the authors determine what \\"holy ground\\" is?No indication is given.How do the authors show that \\"we are on holy ground.\\"?No indication is givenWhere precisely is the \\"holy ground\\"?No indication is given.The reader must assume that ground is \\"holy\\" merely because the authors are upon it, and for no other reason._____________________________________________________If the \\"final ...work of God\\" is the creation of Woman (or the INCARNATION of a God), who was it who sent a Son to be sacrificed for the sins of man on Calvary?In short, the Eldredges just Make-Things-Up.[ see Cartesian Affliction]/"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"There have been controversies in Christian circles about the authors of this book.

They struggle with many of the same thoughts as they strive to find a balance between the false messages the world offers, and the misguided messages the church often offers women to combat the lies the world sells.

We have been released from the curse of sin and death, this includes the curse issued in the Garden. I believe that this book should be read in conjunction with Wild at Heart for we can not understand our roles as men and women unless we understand each other.John has taken on an incredible task - to understand a woman's heart. He did the only thing that he could do, he asked his wife to help. They have taken modern culture and showed us the desires reflected in unsaved and saved humanity. Then they showed us how to meet those desires - to pursue a romantic relationship with God.In order to give ourselves permission for this romance, they had to first show us that God needs us - no one else on earth can fulfill the purpose that God created us for. Then they showed us that God can answer our needs, he is the only one that will never leave us, never let us down, he is the deffinition of Love in all of it's forms.Romance and intimacy are not the same as sex. Sex can offer a false intimacy and it can help to keep intimacy in a relationship, but it is not the same as, nor a substitute for intimacy or romance. To confuse this fact is to misunderstand the basic human need for God, because God is capable of intimacy and romance (not always represented by flowers), God knows us and knows our needs - he meets us where we are.I found such a release of pent up frustration when I read this book. I felt such a desire to pursue God and to have with him the relationship that I was created to have. I felt at peace with my role as warrior - to stand over my husband's woundedness and to allow him to stand over mine.The ones who deride this book are by in large narrow minded and short sighted. There is much to be had here - with prayerful hearts and knowledgeable minds, this book is a path to fullfillment. You can not expect to be given everything, you must seek in order to find. It's like the person who comes to church expecting to be filled with the holy spirit compared to the person who comes to church already filled and overflowing with spiritual gifts.Obviously, you must make your own decision about any book, but if you come with an open mind and an open heart - God will fill them both."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The truth must be told! We are many ways different. I mean man and woman. Not only physically but also mentally, socially and spritially. There are many people who wants that women should act like a man. Women can try it and survive very well for that role. Unfortunately, then they will lose their feminity. If you want to keep your job then you should be a hard-working and efficient woman. When you go to home, you should make food, take care of children, wash clothes etc. Very important thing is your looks! You should sacrifice a lot time for make-up and other things which makes you look better. If you are not satisfied your body, you can go to plastic surgery(you need a lost money for that...) There are so much pressure for women.Of cource, men has many difficulties to meet but now I talk about women. Many women are totally lost their inner needs because they only trie to be what beauty magazines, media, Internet, friends and other sources tell them.Allright, I am not going to tell that Captivating book will tell every secret of women soul but it clearly shows some very meaningful things. Captivating is sequal for Wild at Heart which told us secrets of masculine soul. It showed the real place for men to be brave, prepare to fight for right things, save princess etc. This time John asked his wife Stasi to come help. Luckily, she wanted to write(her first book ever) because women can understand much better mystery of their souls. Stasi tells some own experiences on this book which really cut deeper on theme.If you don't believe in God and Bible. You will lose a lot things in this book which use many biblical themes, places and has written on through a view of spritual eyes. Back to Eden, when people lived on paradise everything were perfect. Relationship between man and woman worked well. They lived in respect, peace and harmany. Also God was a very close person for them. Then they fall! Snake betrayed them! Everything changed! Man started to fear and doesn't want to use his power and strenght in positive way. Woman took control, started to use her beauty wrong purpose(prostitution, wilthy magazines etc.) They disconnected with God!Captivating book helps woman to come back a source of their souls. God has created woman which is a crown of creation and represents the femine part of God's heart. There are many things that helps women to find their real desires and heal their wounds. This book is only aid for that. I belive that with help of God, prayer, other women(who has find their hearts back), brave men, other books for this topic and processing yourself, you will find your feminene soul.My women friends are really liked this book which has touched their soul very special way.* I recommand to read book if:* You are not satisfied the model of women what you have seen or living through.* You want know some reasons for that why you're woman* Are interested in healing your wound of femine soul caused by many factors(father, mother etc.)* You are willing to live a real life listening your femine heart what The Creator has offered to youAuthors has made a great work when they have written this book.This really shows many parts of woman reality. There are also chapter for warrior princesses. Good book also for men! Read this and you will get a little more understanding for women's soul. For me this book really give a lot and I cried many times when read this. Captivating is a fascinating and interesting reading experience.Finally, One of female friends told me this sentence that mirrors very well the spritit of Captivating:\\"We(women) are in accordance with the beauty ideal of God!\\""},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"In my opinion, Captivating is a 220-pages-too-long version of Smile--Jesus loves you. It has poor biblical references, as has been noted below, and atrocious choices in other references, as well as poor research. They cannot even take the time to be sure to spell properly the names of the characters whom they hold up as examples, even, as with Toula from Greek Wedding, when the name is on the back of the dvd case! In addition, whether deliberately or through ignorance, the Eldredges neglect to point out that many of the movies they cite as such perfect examples (Sense and Sensibility, Little Women, Lord of the Rings) are, in fact, BOOKS, real books, written by people who understood human nature; clearly the Eldredges do not. For instance, I agree heartily with those reviewers who make the point that all women do not, of necessity, share the \\"fairy princess\\" longings the E's propose. Jo March never had the slightest notion that her life should revolve around waiting for her \\"prince\\" to come some day--if she had, she'd have found Friedrich exceedingly disappointing! I think that there are many books, both religious and secular self-help books, and many GOOD novels, such as those the Eldredges didn't read, favoring videos instead, which could give a woman a clearer and healthier view of herself and her place in creation."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I started the book and immediately sighed and said, \\"ah, she understands me.\\" Ultimately, I agreed with their deduction of the basic-level desires of a woman (and man).I am so totally and completely blessed as I had an \\"uncomplicated\\" childhood and adolescence... free from the horrors of abuse and traps of bad (physical) decisions. (Too) much of this book, I felt, was spent talking about how to break free from those pasts and how to not let the past color what God created women to be.I appreciated hearing about how womens' base desires went hand in hand with how God created mens' base desires. It is a testimony to God's amazing design. It was encouraging to read about how we can glorify God as a married couple by embracing our God-given differences and loving one another.I didn't really like the way that they referenced so many movies and stories, although I guess I can see the reasoning - they were pulling examples for the way that the world portrays men and women. However, they were also using those examples as descriptions of our makeup as a woman. I am not much of a movie/tv-watcher, so these references didn't appeal to me.Unfortunately, the book was also missing a certain depth - no challenge to go deeper. It seemed to stay on the surface level.I guess, bottom line is, that the book was ok, but not one that I will keep in my \\"reference\\" library for ministry use."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"To say that this book is excellent does not do it justice.

This book is the female counterpart to the popular, \\"Wild at Heart\\" book for men. Upon first seeing the book, I was pleased with the aesthetic quality. It was a hardcover with a picture on the front, accompanied by a transparent dust cover. It was appealing, and would gain my attention among other books. I wasn't sure what to expect from the book, and while it didn't completely disappoint me, it also didn't leave me feeling like I gained a lot of new knowledge. The book discuses the essence and heart of a woman, what hurts and wounds women may have received along life's path, how we can find healing, and a variety of other topics. It also has an appendix at the back with several prayers, including the prayer for salvation. Although I found some parts of the book to hold new concepts, much of the information seemed like material that I had heard many times before. At roughly 230 pages, it is fairly long, and some of the information seemed repetitive. A few parts of the book that I really liked discussed God's Word and how we can apply it specifically to our lives as women. I also liked the overall theme of realizing who we are in Christ, and focusing our attention on becoming the woman that He would have us to be.

This is only two peoples' opinions, mind you, but their personal accounts and references to friends' and acquaintances' experiences give credence to their claims. It didn't hurt that I felt that I had LIVED this myself. I personally liked that the authors also use biblical scripture to support their points.

If women are hard to figure out ... it may be because people focus on the personality of someone rather than the soul. The soul knows the truth and it speaks from the heart and not the head. Dissecting the mystery of a woman's soul is heart-centered, honest, and unabashed in revealing the vulnerabilities underneath."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It is not theologically sound at all. It uses very few scriptures, and when it does they are taken way out of context. It looks at things more through the lens of secular psychology than a Christian viewpoint. It's scary to think that this is being used as Bible study material for young women at churches when it is not based on the Bible at all. Starting the chapters off with quotes from Bob Dylan and Aretha Franklin?? Lord, please forgive us!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I purchased several of these books for each of my 3 daughters and daugher-in-law (aged 20 to 25 years), because I have seen so much confusion (and pain) in their eyes, as they deal with self-image and relationships. I have several of John Eldrich's books, and have found his powerful insights helped me to better understand myself, so when he co-authored this book for women, I took a step out to see if this could be helpful, in this oft-confused culture, for the ones I care so much about.The response was way beyond my expectations...they all have come back to ME, telling me how they REALLY like the book (not an easy response for MY daughters!) explaining how closely the pages reflect what they feel and have felt - but were so afraid to accept and allow. They are all new in the Faith, and the book has offered the doorway to conversation and prayer together with them. And, I have had the blessed opportunity to help encourage them in their Walk here as a result.The book has helped me, a single dad, better understand the needs of those around me as well. It is solid, Scriptually based encouragement which ALL women need to hear, and men need to understand. This book should be a must-have for any household with any female (and/or male) members in it. :-) Thanks John and Stasi - awesome!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"this book dafantily makes you look at yourself for who you are.

They simply don't understand literary devices used in Proverbs 31. They understand that saying a fool's way is full of thorns doesn't LITERALLY mean that a fool will encounter spiky vegetation in their path.The language used in Proverbs 31 is hyperbole. It's like saying: Bill is as big as a mountain. You exaggerate to make a point. I absolutely believe that it is valuable and great to study Proverbs 31, and we should strive after that example. However, I think the reason is depresses women because they think \\"I can never do all that!\\" Well, Proverbs wasn't portraying a woman who existed. It used deliberate hyperbole to create an example.It depresses women as much as it would surprise people if they actually thought there was a mountain-sized man called Bill!So, you should neither reject Proverbs 31, or accept \\"Her\\" as an actual woman who lived.

It would maybe be interesting if John Eldridge's research went deeper than the local cineplex or a focus group. There is no research that shows that women desperately desire \\"to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a grand adventure, and to unveil beauty\\". There is only John's (and in this case, I guess to lend it some weight, Stasi's) insistence that this is so. This is just a rehashing of Eldridge's men's books, this time he is trying to get into the women's checkbooks. This is just another example of a 'Christian' writer that is only trying to move product. Need proof? Why is the book not released as a paperback so as to be less expensive, and so that it would be more affordable to people. That would even be good stewardship of resources (both financial and environmental, as it takes more resources to print a hardback book). John's other books are not available in paperback (except in large print editions). Skip this and read the Bible instead, do not play an irreplaceable role in a grand adventure of helping the \\"Christian publishers\\" make money hand over fist while rehashing a story that has already been told in other books."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Slow start...lot's of depth.

That truth is that our passion for adventure and love is interconnected with the heart of our heavenly Father and His love for us. But that is the only element of truth you will see in this writing. No one wants or likes to believe that they could be taken in by a false teacher. It's a personal blow to our pride to admit we are capable of being duped.False teaching always has 2 fundamental elements that make it a successful false teaching. 1)It contains a biblical truth that your heart can identify with 2) It appeals to our sin nature...usually \\"self\\" is involved.This book is all about \\"self\\" as a woman. There is a continual admonition to think extremely highly of yourself as a woman. To actually look at yourself as the \\"crown of creation\\" So many of the things Stasi appeals to us to think and feel about ourself, is nothing more that an appeal to exalt ourself above others. She even condemns the idea of being a servant.....which is characteristic of all of the teachings of Jesus. Jesus says if we want to be great that we must be a servant.I could write a book on all of the points I found in this book that are anti-biblical. I admonish you as a reader....if you choose to read this book inspite of my warning....to read it with great discernment.I have read a few of the writing of the Eldredge's and was quite taken back at the theology in this book. It caused me to really rethink what I've been reading. The Eldredge's have a gift to bring you outside the \\"religious\\" mindset and inspire you into the heart aspect of life....but this particular writing is an appeal to our self nature and should be avoided....in my opinion!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The first time I read this book, I was absolutely enchanted by it - the title is appropriate, as I was, indeed, Captivated! It truly did speak to my heart and I was delighted at the images the Eldredges conjured of a romantic relationship with the Creator of the universe.But as I began to read the Bible more closely, I realized that this romance just isn't there. God is so many things to me: Father, Savior, Lord, King, Shepherd... but not Lover. He is the bridegroom of the church, yes. But He isn't MY bridegroom. He loves me dearly, yes - but not as a lover! This is not a new heresy - it's been around since the mystics of the middle ages - but it is a heresy. And it makes sense, because otherwise God would be a polygamist and so would every person who gets married here on earth - whenever you had sex with your spouse, you'd be cheating on God! That's not at all what He has in mind for us. He gave us marriage as a blessing, not a curse, not an invitation to sin!I think the Eldredges realize this, because there is actually very little of the Bible in their book. Instead, they rely on pop culture references to make their points, which, while interesting and relevant, don't bring very much Christianity into the picture. The result is that worldly desires are held up as God-given, rather than analyzed in light of the Bible. This book does not promote humility before God, but a sense that you deserve God's love.So, although it saddens me to do it, I have to give this book the lowest rating and warn anyone who is considering it: this book will not help you in your walk with God, but mislead you down a very wrong path."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Maybe I am not the type of woman this book is geared toward.

My excitement was short lived as I was quickly disappointed that it did not live up to all of the hype. The general goal of this book is to encourage and teach women how to set their heart free. Through the demands of life, women seem to lose sight of their childhood desires to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a grand adventure, and to unveil beauty and the authors of this book try to encourage women back to a place of accepting that they were created in the image of God.In the first few chapters, I thought that maybe this book could go somewhere, but sadly after that I felt as though the authors, John Eldredge & Stasi Eldredge, became a little repetitive and in between the main points was a lot of fluff. My other issue with this book was that I had expected it to be much more biblical in nature and that it would use scripture to support its ideas, but the use of scripture paled in comparison to the use of movie references and when scripture was used, it was not always used in its proper context.Overall, this book took a long time to get through and in the end, I felt like I had gotten very little out of it.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program.

Reading Wild at heart helped me see and understand men better. But little did I realize the impact and exactness that Captivating would captivate and pinpoint the issues of my own heart, as well as the hearts of many close friends.I read this book on my lunch break and every day, I look forward to my lunch break where I can spend some quality time with myself and just allow my spirit to take in what is to be revealed that day. Little did I know that these lunch sessions would turn out to be little self-restoration sessions where I learned so much about myself. It even revealed issues that I did not realize that were not resolved and/or had.Captivating is the book for women.... not a certain group or age, but the whole of women in this world, all cultures, countries and colors should read this book. I am already half way through the book and have already encountered so many eye-opening things and growth in my own heart. I look forward to the healing and restoration of my own heart as I finish the book and continue in my journey that God has for me.Do not pass up this book. I promise it will change your life, heart and mindsets."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I'm a college student who was given this book by the mother of one of my friends. I'm not sure what to say to my friend about this, but after reading this book, it's clear that her mother doesn't know me very well. There wasn't much in \\"Captivating\\" that I could relate to.- No, I'm not interested in being a fairy-tale princess. I'm a hard-working honor student in a pre-med program. I was hoping for a book that would help deepen my walk with Christ and help me better understand how to use my gifts to emulate Christ's example of service to others. This book wasn't it.- I'm not carrying around unresolved issues with my father. I have a good relationship with my Dad who, while not perfect, has always helped me to dream big and always lets me know he's100% behind me.- I don't dream about being rescued or sitting behind some man on his Adventure Horse. I was raised to identify a goal and go after it, not to sit around waiting for someone else to take charge. And I'm not interested in being a side-kick or a helper; when I'm ready to marry, I'll be looking for a man who's seeking a partnership of equals.- I don't need to be convinced that God loves me. I already know God loves me; I've never had any doubt about that. I'm not looking to mimic a Hollywood romance where I'm Kate Winslett and Jesus is Leo DiCaprio. I don't see Jesus as a Fantasy Lover, I see Jesus as a life-saving inspiration with an important message for us all.- I don't need 300 pages of flowery words telling me how \\"special my heart is\\" or how beautiful my soul is. I'm not interested in navel-gazing, I'm interesting in making a difference in the world.This book seems to have been written for a small subset of women who have serious self-worth issues relating to deep wounds they've suffered. My heart goes out to these women, but I'm not even sure this book will help them. If you're that wounded, counseling will probably help a lot more than regressions back to 'Daddy's little girl'. For the rest of us who aren't in need of 'rescue' and find the notion of Jesus as fantasy lover to be a bit too weird, this book misses the mark."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have to admit, I wrote a scathing review at one time for this book. Although there are imperfections, as with ANYTHING outside of God's Word, the Eldredges have shown me ways to allow God to work in my life that I would never have thought I was closed off to. In fact, that was my main argument before. I was much more of a Tomboy and thought that was a good thing, a REALLY good thing and didn't understand the beauty/princess thing at all. I too wanted my OWN adventure and didn't want take my husband captive. I hated the secularization of their message with movies and songs, the scripture and meat as well as the idea that if I, as a child of God, am the Bride of Christ, then He is my Bride and being loved by Him would be a part of my desire. The idea of Jesus as Lover was sacrilegious to me.As I watched more and more wonderful women in my life read and love this book, I had decided to read it again and finish it this time in order to be able to refute every argument. I began with understanding that the secular movie references would help reach non-church goers/unbelievers in ways that most Christian literature could not and that every reference to beauty had nothing to do with outward beauty, but the beauty of God within each of us. As I understood fully the idea that God uses marriage as a picture to help us to understand His relationship with us then allowed the picture of being loved by Jesus in this way to make sense, this was not intended to be sexual as I along with many others mistook it.I now see that my hatred for this book had to do with the work I did not want to allow to happen within my heart. I allowed myself to remain closed off and angry that it was striking a cord missing the great healing that I believe God wants to do in every woman's life through this book.I now understand my role has helpmate and woman within my marriage and family in ways I never could before. I am thrilled to be alongside my husband on this adventure and will gladly be giving this book to any woman in my life who is willing to set aside their prejudices and the imperfections of human writing that any book has so that they too can enjoy the freedom of walking in the role that God intends for them."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I expected a lot more from this book since it was recommended by so many Christian friends. I just didn't get it. I understood what the author is saying, however I outgrew most of this by the time I graduated high school. Are there really grown women out there secretly waiting for princes to sweep them off their feet? I know that God created me to be feminine, fun, and nurturing, but I don't dwell on these qualities. Perhaps that's why this book didn't connect with me. I'm not really interested in overanalyzing my inner and outer attributes."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"My Bible study leader recommended this book, saying that it is a \\"life-changing book.\\" Upon finishing \\"Captivating,\\" I found it to be anything but. There were a few passages here and there in which I liked; although, I found the majority of the book to be watered-down and lacking of substantiated biblical support. Rather than backing up their claims with Scripture, John and Stasi Eldredge support their arguments using the plots of movies (i.e. Lord of the Rings). What is the problem with this? Movies are fictional. They are not real.All in all, I do NOT recommend this book. It is watered-down and deficient of solid biblical truth. Several of my friends have also been disappointed with the content of this book."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have read everything that John Eldredge has written and have found each of his books enlightening and wonderful. That being said none can top this book in reaching women on a deep heart level. The female version of WILD AT HEART, this book explores the deepest longings of women to be seen as beautiful and to be desired for the person they are. Co-written with his wife, Stasi, for the female perspective it gives a full picture of the relationships between men and women.For that reason (and many others), men in particular would benefit from reading this book in order to understand the women in their lives. As the authors write at one point, \\"Women are a mystery to be enjoyed, not a problem to be solved.\\" This directly addresses the problem most women find in their relationships as they are labeled too much of this or not enough of that (too emotional, too needy, not smart enough, not independent enough.) This book helps both sexes explore how the differences between men and women can be understood and appreciated in a way that edifies both.At the heart of this book are the principles at the center of each Eldrege book: that there is a battle for our hearts and that we must fight to regain the person that Christ died for us to be. Take the time to read this book and work through the guided journal when it comes out in July. I promise it will be a life changing journey that will open your heart more deeply to Christ and the ones you love."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is beautiful. Take your time to read the book. Let God speak. When she poses questions, take time to let them sink in, what is your heart saying in response? What is God saying? Remember that as you read that it is opposed by the Enemy. If you don't know this already, you will once you finish the book. The Enemy does not want your heart to be alive. Don't let him keep you from all God has.One thing should be said. In the book she delves into the wound, much like Wild at Heart. When she presented these concepts in the Ransomed Femininity retreats she made something clear that was not as clear in the book. YES, each woman does have a wound. NO, it does not have to be something that the world would recognize as tragic, just something \\"tragic\\" to you. Something that has tainted the way you look at the world, yourself, and God in some way. In the retreats she stated that when looking at your wound that your urge would be one of two. You would either thing that it was not a big deal, dismiss it, or you would consider it so large and become so engulfed by it that you would not truly believe God could redeem it. Be aware of your heart's response when reading about the wound and respond accordingly. I pray you are blessed!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating was a a bit confusing and I don't agree with a lot of what is communicated in this book. First of all, John and Stasi keep changing around who is talking about what. That was really confusing for me. They kept saying (Stasi here) or (John here). I didn't know who was who half the time. Also, it really confused me when Stasi said she was okay with taking prescription drugs for her depression and doesn't see anything wrong with it, and then compared it to someone taking medication for diabetes! Not exactly the same thing.....I think maybe if she suggested diet and excercise, that might have been more fitting? Also, it was a little uncomfortable when they are taking about calling the evil spirits away from Stasi when she was having dizzy spells...and why didn't her husband know she was having those for so long? That was weird.I understand that all people and Christians are different and have different views, but I DEFINITELY did not connect to the whole twirling princess thing. I never have wanted to be a princess nor have I ever desired to be treated as one.I do like how Stasi is very open to putting it all out on the table, but do you really have to go that far? I think some things are left better kept between you and God."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I found this book enchanting and exhilirating, but I don't think it is truly for everyone. Most women I know would benefit from exploring what makes us uniquely feminine, but I have known many women who are far too independent and motivated to enjoy exploring that side of themselves. I would recommend this book for any woman who is recovering from an abusive relationship or has a broken relationship with her parents, spouse, or boyfriend. If you read the whole book, it does encourage independence and discourage doting on a man to make us whole, but most people who would be bothered by the sweet, feminine portrait of a woman that is described may not make it far enough to see that message."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is the first book I have had the privilege to read in quite some time. I have heard how incredible John Eldredge's books are, and now I can understand the hype. I just finished the last chapter (I have also been doing the workbook), and I am so excited with what God has shown me through this book. I do not agree with everything they say, or all of thier viewpoints, but I recieved a lot of healing and revelation from this book. I would highly recommend it to any woman of God who has been wounded (haven't we all?), or is wanting a fresh outlook on who she is in God. Most other christian womens books I have read made me feel so damaged, so far from hitting the \\"mark\\" as a christian woman, this one gives a better understanding of what we were created for as women, not in a condemning way, but for once in an uplifting manner that can bestow hope. My favortie chapter is called about being a warrior as a woman, awesome. This is the first time I personally have read about women being described this way, that sealed the deal for me! I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"If you are looking for a book of fluff and childhood memories dredged from your past, skim through this book. Do not link it to a Bible study because it is not remotely associated with God's truth. For a new Christian this is dangerous territory because you may see your own husband as not measuring up. Well who can measure up to God's fulfillment as our bridgegroom and Lord? I am disappointed that I was duped into buying this book because of the Eldredge name. There are slim references to Scripture and for me it doesn't measure up."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Dear Whomever May Be Concerned,Today I finished my girlfriend's favorite book Captivating by John and Stasi Eldredge. There are three things that I have learned in the past two hours of reading and thinking. #1 My girlfriend is an amazing girl and I'm pretty much the luckiest guy on Earth to have her. #2 Guys suck at understanding girls. Being one of those guys who thought he understood girls in high school (arrogance is quite embarrassing) I just would like to say to every guy out there. \\"WE SUCK AT UNDERSTANDING GIRLS.\\" Growing up I thought because I understood the two concepts \\"Girls like bad boys.\\" And \\"Nice guys finished last.\\" I could fully understand the concept of the girl's mind. Man was I wrong. #3 The women's heart longs to be romanced. As guys' we FAIL. Epic giant fail. I look around and I see more guys in my generation looking at porn and degrading women in their mind than I see men buying girl's roses and trying to win their hearts.Men were created in God's image but women were taken from men therefore also created with God's image. Often times we make women feel like they are not skinny enough or too emotional but sometimes we need to be thankful that they exist! God knew exactly what he was doing when He made women. Kiss your mom on the cheek. Tell your girlfriend she's beautiful. Treat the women around you with respect. Stop looking at porn because it degrades women and turns them into objects rather than sisters in Christ. Most importantly start meditating on the fact that the heart of a women is a reflection of the heart of God."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book was intended as a complement to John Eldridge's best seller for men, \\"Wild at Heart,\\" which was predicated on the notion that \`in the heart of every man is a desperate desire for a battle to fight, an adventure to live, and a beauty to rescue.' According to \\"Captivating,\\" \`every little girl has dreams of being rescued by her hero, of being swept away into a great adventure, of being the beautiful princess.' As someone raised in the Baptist church, I know that Christians have always had a huge thing for medieval knight/princess metaphors. The fact that such chivalric traditions were developed about a thousand years ago and are completely irrelevant to modern-day conduct for a number of reasons is almost always overlooked.For Christian women, this book does have some good take-home messages: commitment to faith, and the danger of expecting your husband to meet all your primary needs (when \`only God can tell you who you are'). The authors are correct in that many women never do fulfill their potential. My issue is that this book sends women in the wrong direction to find that answer, while at the same time making the contradictory statement that as a woman, your natural purpose is to be a beautiful damsel deserving of rescue (whether by God or by a man). So, not much room for actual self-confidence and independence.I am surprised that this book is as popular as it is with Christian women, because there is really very little theology explored (but much assumed), and the book uses an eclectic mix of source material for quotes: popular movies, songs, and books. For example, to substantiate a statement he makes about men, John Eldridge writes: \`I want you to think of the films men love, the things they do with their free time, and especially the aspirations of little boys, and see if I am not right on this.' Here Eldridge is basing an entire argument off a generalization (much like his previous books for men) that every member of the male sex loves action movies, violence, and aggressive sports. And if they don't like these things, there must be something wrong with them, like not having enough good role models as children or something.The part I found most grating was in Chapter 3, when the authors argue that children ask one fundamental question, but they are different questions depending on whether the child is a boy or a girl (of course, gender socialization is completely glossed over): \`Little boys want to know, Do I have what it takes?...Little girls want to know, Am I lovely?' This level of gender essentialism should be appalling to both seculars (it's inherently sexist) and Christians (it's not even Biblically supported). Not to mention the fact that this means both boys and girls should be taught to only derive meaning from what others think of them (for boys, their achievements and for girls their beauty). The conclusion is that \`the essence of a man is [active] Strength' and \`the essence of a woman is [passive] Beauty.' Because that's a healthy worldview.Another fury-inducing passage regards a time when Stasi felt she was under a spiritual attack: \`As women we long for someone strong [of course not a stronger, self-respecting version of ourselves!] to stand between us and the vicious assaults of our Enemy...John began to take his authority over me as my husband and forcefully commanded the minions of Satan to release me...' Basically, Stasi puts her husband between herself and God. It's been a while since I've been to a Bible study, but I can tell you that nowhere in Scripture are women encouraged to abandon their personal responsibility in this way, and ironically, the chapter opens with a quotation from Isaiah 63:1 as an illustration of \`our Warrior God, a God who comes through for us.' If Stasi knows this God, why does she need her husband to fight evil on her behalf?Ultimately, this book is a mess, and you will certainly not gain any insight into a \\"woman's soul.\\" Like many Christian books attempting to address gender-related issues, the research is clumsy and even non-existent in places. Conclusions are based on general observations and outdated assumptions, and as such do not allow room for women as individuals to ask their own questions, make their own paths, approach their beliefs head-on, or develop healthy senses of their role in society. It sickens me to hear that so many young adult \\"Bible studies\\" for girls are centered around garbage like this."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I purchased this book because I loved reading Wild at Heart so very much. I am female, so reading this book seemed like a logical step. I love what the Eldredges are doing, and I don't have anything negative to say about them at all. What I can say is that I much preferred Wild at Heart over Captivating. I didn't get near as much out of this book as I was hoping to.That said, there is nothing saying that it wouldn't be great for another woman out there. It may just be \\"me.\\""},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I'm sure there are scores of Christian women out there who might have a problem with the premise of the Eldredge's book \\"Captivating\\". It very nearly goes against every notion that little girls were taught in Sunday school of women being the downfall of human kind and of their subsequent subordination to man. But speaking as a woman who has lived through the worst kinds of abuse, neglect, poverty, and loss, this book restores by leaps and bounds the self esteem a very large part of the world's female population.Do I buy into all of the theological misrepresentations contained in its pages such as their view of Mary the mother of Jesus? Not really, but to dwell on those would be to miss the point of the book completely. This work is a celebration of God's last creation, Woman. Some of the passages that I found to be the most powerful I will quote here:\\"How many of you see God as longing to be loved by you? We see Him as strong and powerful, but not as needing us, vulnerable to us, yearning to be desired (pp. 28-29).God longs to be desired. Just as a woman longs to be desired (pg. 29).It might come as a surprise that Christ asks our permission to come in and heal, but He is kind, and the door is shut from the inside, and healing never comes against our will. In order to experience His healing, we must also give Him permission to come into the places we have so long shut to anyone\\" (pg. 100).Some might find fault with this view of God but if we are created in His likeness as it states in Genesis 1:26, then I think it's safe to assume that the One in whose likeness we are created would experience many of the same emotions that we as humans experience; the chief of these being the need to be wanted and loved. It's a powerful thought. One that can change a life.All in all I found this book uplifting. I would definitely recommend it to any woman who is in need of a new, biblical view of themselves and of God."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book Captivating is written by John and Stasi Eldredge. I have always been pleased with the quality of books that this couple has put out, and Captivating is no exception.The theme of this book revolves around the \\"Heart of a Woman\\", and the three desires that a woman has: to be romanced, to play a role in her own adventures, and to display beauty. These three area's make up the core of this book. The Eldredge's use common movies, music, and books to make their point, and show that most women tend to run around in circles, causing confusion and unrealistic expectations.Captivating references that woman today are either controlling or needy, illustrating that women feel that to be in control is power, or to be needy, is the result of being out of control. The book goes on to point out, that true balance is when a Godly woman sees God as the Ultimate lover, friend, father, guide, the Alpha and the Omega, all of that.. The book encourages women to form close, intimate relationships with one another, like Ruth and Naomi did.In this wild and crazy world, the goal is to become stable and under the guidance of our Heavenly Father, using simple methods, and practical advice.I would recommend this book for any woman. from all walks of life, as well as couples, and men, so that they will understand, where a woman is coming from.I love blogging for Book Snooze, an affiliate of Thomas Nelson Publishing, I received a copy of this book for my review."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"The authors totally get inside a woman's head and explain her \\"being\\" in an unbelieveable easy to read fashion. If you have dealt with abuse, or are dealing with guilt, or just plain want to know what makes a woman \\"tick\\" buy this ASAP. I have given this book away to so many women, it truly is a lifeline for women in all walks of life. Brillantly written, a book you will read multiple times."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is fantastic. It did for me exactly what the title says.

It is not a how-to book on becoming the perfect woman. There are no magic words or checklists. Stasi and John release you to discover the Beauty and spirit of Adventure that is already in you. Life can distort our picture of ourselves and cause us to have wrong thinking about who we are as women. This book is a must-read for every woman who wants live the life meant for each of us, as a Beauty experiencing a fulfilling life of Adventure."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I've never written a review for a book before, but felt really compelled to do so on this book. This book captured the depth of women like no other I've found. I'm amazed at Stasi's ability to put so much into words that I've thought but not known how to say. I am so, so grateful for this book. I am buying multiple copies for women in my life. Thank you Stasi!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book ministered to me greatly from the first chapter. It gives an excellent perspective of God's value of women. I liked it so much I want to have young women study it."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Another book by John and Stasi Eldredge and it is about \\"unveiling the mystery of a woman's soul, and that is truly what it does. I am not big on reading books, but this one captured me, truly a great find and I recommend it to everyone! It is about remembering what it was like to be a little girl, what we held in our heart, what our dreams were. I know that I had many dreams as a little girl, dreamed about what I wanted to be when I grew up, wanting to be married, have kids, and many more. As I got older I longed for romance, for a guy to sweep me off of my feet, but yet to get to that my heart, my desires got trampled and pushed aside and it left me wondering, do I deserve the desires that I once had as a little girl? The answer is Yes, and this book tells you so! What I love is the message that Captivating is teaching throughout this book, \\"Your heart matters more than anything else in all creation. The desires you had as a little girl and the longings you feel as a woman are telling you of the life God created you to live. He offers to come now as the Hero of your story, to rescue your heart and release you to live as a fully alive and feminine woman. A woman who is truly captivating.\\""},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I purchased this book as a used but like new condition and was surprised that when I got it you would not have known it was a used book it was in perfect condition and the price was great!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift and it is probably one of the BEST gifts I have ever been given. As a young woman who was raised in an abusive home and without a father this book spoke VOLUMES to me. Even to just be able to read that I was NOT the only little girl afraid and hiding in the closet completely changed my world.I have read reviews by some who claim these views are \\"new age.\\" I'm sorry ladies, but they aren't. This book is entirely about how God made every girl to be loved and cherished by her earthly father as a reflection of the beauty she holds in the eyes of her heavenly father. It also points out a few things about the adam and eve account in scripture that I was unaware of. At first I was cautious but looked it up myself. The Eldredge's are entirely correct. They never claim women are blameless. They never claim that women are perfect. No where do they say those things are what make a female child of God beautiful to her heavenly father.This couple is speaking volumes to a generation of girls who have grown up fatherless and without any real identity as women. I'm not a traditionalist and or a feminist. I am your average young woman. It seems to me that these are the two groups that are \\"offended,\\" \\"bothered\\" or \\"outraged\\" at this book. If you are the average young woman, this book will speak to SOME broken part of your heart and will bring you closer to God, your heavenly father. I promise this to you. I have already recommended this book to several friends and plan to continue to recommend it to anyone I meet. I have already seen the amazing things it has begun to do in others lives and I am definitely NOT the same after having read it.I received a paperback copy for Christmas (like I said) and I just downloaded the kindle version so I can always have it on me. Chapter six, alone, I read five times before being able to move it. That was probably one of the most powerfully profound things I have read, aimed directly at my heart, by God, second only to the bible. My hard copy had a million notes in it already and I definitely cannot wait to go and add those - along with many more - into my new kindle version.I can see where this book may not be for my grandmother's generation, but it is certainly for mine. My mother's father died when she was six and I can see a lot of her woundedness from that in her personality. I am working diligently to get her to read it now. The woman I got it from (who loves it as well) is only two years younger so I really feel this book could speak volumes to my mother. I really hope I can get her to read it. Even if you think you don't need to read this because you had wonderful and loving parents, give this book a shot. You may be surprised at the broken places in your heart that it speaks to.READ THIS BOOK!!! There is nothing more I can say to you Open your heart to God's message to you, through this book and enjoy!!! I hope you can learn to bask in your heavenly father's love the way I have.Jo"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"In Captivating, John and Stasi Eldredge reveal that Eve (woman) was the culmination of God's marvelous creation. They express the great love and appreciation that God has for each individual woman and speak of the important roles that only women can fulfill. John and Stasi reassure women that they don't have to compete with or act like men. God has a specific purpose and plan in creating women, and He loves them just the way they are. Women can relax and enjoy their femininity and quit striving to be someone they are not. Most importantly, the Eldredges encourage women to sit at Christ's feet and to let Christ woo them--to feel His love and to be complete in that love, as they listen and learn of His purpose for their lives.I am so thankful that this is not another book for women written by some woman who has obviously not served in the trenches. Stasi is very real and admits to some of her own failings as a woman. This is not another book that will make women feel guilty if they are not Martha Stewart, Mother Teresa, and Marilyn Monroe wrapped into one.I highly recommend this book with my only reservation being their unbiblical view of spiritual warfare and their failure to mention baptism as God's plan for putting us into Christ.I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.Check out my blog at www.a-booklover.blogspot.com for more quality book reviews!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is beautifully written and really captures the heart of a woman. With Biblical explanations regarding why we are the way we are, women can stop making excuses for their behaviors and see that God made you beautiful! Women are \\"the way they are\\" due to a loving creator carefully sculpting their hearts to to exactly what it does! I would recommend this book to all women and even to men so they can get a glimpse of what God sees when he looks at a woman.

Both are great books."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book really made me feel special as a woman. God made Eve the pinnacle of His creation and yet somehow Adam always seems to get that distinction.

It also made me appreciate the fact that being feminine is special."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Loved this wonderful book!

Definitely not a turn on for me."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is a wonderful book for any woman wanting to understand and discover God's purpose and design in his creation of woman.

I was close to finishing this book and in my mind, I already knew what I was going to write about it. But when I actually finished it, I didn't even remember all of those good things because it left me speechless. This deserves to be more than highly recommended. Every woman, any woman, get your hands on this and get ready to reach a territory, a level that you didn't know existed within you, by the Grace of God.Overwhelmingly Captivating, that's what this is.So much that at one point, I had to put the book down because the beauty, the pictures that these authors paint through their writing... you cannot rush through this, trust me. I have to admit that sometimes I, personally, found that what was being said was more of their opinions (their interpretations of things- that readers may or may not agree with) but only sometimes. No book is perfect- and the revised version of this one might be slightly more interesting... Anyways, the most important thing is that these people love God (so they DO stay within the biblical context) and girls, ladies, I don't know about you, but this is stuff I wanna have on my shelf!And now...

Forget all the analytical speeches about why this book is or is not good or right for you and let the words in this book speak to YOU.

It was a healing tool, I say healing because so many woman are told how to be a \\"good\\" christian and that we are suppose to chase the image of the Proverbs 31 woman. Guess what, SHE DOESN'T EXIST!!!! This helped to heal all the lies we are told by woman still living by the old code. Stuck in a box, and God doesn't belong in a box! It made me remember that being feminine is my God given gift and right. Reminded me of the longings I forgot in the midst of trying to \\"serve\\" and being exausted by trying to keep up with the \\"religious\\" views of others. It was freeing and not condeming in anyway. I have felt hopless and like I would never measure up to the figure most religious spiritual women and men will try to tell you to be like. This set me free of guilt and condemnation from those things and reminded me that the Lord thinks I am beautiful and lovely and He loves me, sin and all.

Get out of that box:)"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"We have used this book two years in a row for a small group in in our Women's Ministry. Both times, I am amazed at how it affects the women.

I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful. It has done wonders for me. I began doubting God and just about everything I have ever learned (Catholic school girl) once I came to college. I was reaching out to God to come speak to me in some way, and thankfully He sent me Captivating. This book describes why women are the way we are-- we are BEAUTIFUL and DESIRED and STRONG. The authors are NOT saying that we are weak or submissive. Don't get the message mixed up! I think the people on here who are giving the book poor reviews did not quite understand the message fully.This book describes how we, as women, need to be loved by God just as we should love him. We are meant to be feminine because it draws out man's masculinity. This book is NOT saying that we are supposed to be dropping our hankerchiefs for boys to pick up for us. It's saying that we are WOMEN! We like pretty things and nuturing people because it is our very nature. Of course, not ALL women are called to motherhood or want to play dress up every day, but it is true that all women yearned to be respected, cared for, and admired (not for pride, but for qualities). If you disagree with this, then maybe you should look a little deeper in your heart and make yourself VULNERABLE for once! Bring down the walls and let God into your life. I cannot stress this enough, I cannot stress this enough."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I too am baffled by any negative reviews concerning any of John Eldredge's books. The proof of his and Stacey's ministry is in the ever growing 'harvest' of the fruits of the spirit produced by their ministry all over. For those who \\"just didn't relate\\" or think this in ANY way is \\"out of context with God's word\\" or \\"not of God\\" I encourage you to, first examine your hearts,then RE-read it with and open HEART and unbiased mindset and IN the Spirit ( ie. out of the critical, fleshly mindset- that mindset is NOT the Spirits' gift of Discernment) because it in every way IS truth and the books' only goal is to seek out and repair the many broken hearts and grow women THROUGH an intimate, pure, relationship with Jesus Christ. Every woman I have met who \\"didn't relate\\" or \\"disagreed\\" were the exact women who are wounded, stuck in LEGALISTIC religous belief systems and totally NOT real with HIM; women who walk around hiding their true hearts. This book shares how to GET REAL with Our Savior so you can truly Co-Labor with Him. Also, before anyone feels critically toward the book or the ministry,need I remind you: WE ARE ONE and ON the SAME TEAM. (Romans!)Don't get lost in legalism especially when this world is so up-side-down! Again, the proof of how Godly this ministry is will be found in the many, MANY wonderfully changed lives as a result of the Eldredges ministy. For those who think there are \\"few scriptures\\" read again! To those who are uncomfortable with the examples John uses from maintstream movies: Where are you living? HOW are we going to reach a fallen world and broken women if we cannot reach OUT to them with something they can relate to first? If you cannot reach a broken person on some level that they can understand/feel, you will be wasting your time. I PROMISE you, if you are 'truly' seeking an INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP with Jesus Christ, maybe stuck in hurts, wounds that are forgiven but may not be healed,if you are unsure about what it means to BE loved and held by our Savior Jesus Christ then this book is a MUST read as is only the beginning of a wonderful journey with Him-'Cloud 9' 24/7!

Read the book Sisters!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I really liked this book, not because it was written more eloquently than others, not because it revealed to me mysteries of which I didn't understand before, but because it was affirming. Much of what is said in the book you will know in your heart if you are in touch with it. However, after hearing what many churches say a woman's role should be, it is a breath of fresh air to be appreciated and affirmed and have it backed up by scripture and written by both sexes.

For example, they taught that a woman should seduce a man (in a non-sexual way?) to lure him into a relationship. Then, they used Ruth as their example because she slept at the feet of Boaz before they were married. Then, they blamed anyone who disagrees with them as not believing sex should be enjoyable and that the Song of Solomon is not about sex. What they don't understand is the historical and cultural context of the time of Ruth; that servants slept at the feet of their master. Ruth was stating that she was no longer Naomi's servant but she was giving her life to Boaz to serve him and be under his care; this gave him the right to marry her or give her in marriage as she now belonged to him. It was not a sexual gesture because Ruth and Boaz were both righteous and would not have tempted each other to sin.Another example they gave was to trick your husband by making a great dinner, having sex, and then the next day set up the same dinner atmosphere but when he wants sex, refuse him and say, &#34;Why do you want me? Is it only for my body...&#34; THAT IS UNBIBLICAL COUNSEL! Spouses should talk about their problems and issues and feeling, NOT trick their spouse into understanding what they are perceiving and feeling.They also used the unbiblical belief that bipolarism and depression is a disease caused by a chemical imbalance. This has never been proven medically, if you pay attention to all the documentation for the medical field it all states MAY BE, BELIEVED TO BE, THOUGHT TO BE, COULD BE .... There are no medical tests that can be administered to diagnose a medical correlation between depression or other related EMOTIONS as &#34;chemical imbalances&#34; related to any illness. They are diagnosed by symptomatic anecdotes. They are real emotions that stem from real problems that both can be overcome by Biblical counsel without the use of drugs. Drugs do not address that problem that the emotion is coming from, they only numb you from feeling the emotion. God gave us emotions so we could feel there is a problem and then solve it. Read anything by Jay E. Adams or Elyse Fitzpatrick.Another annoying factor from this book was their constant use of movies as examples- I don't want to read about what this fictional character did or that actor did in whatever movie- I read Christian books for Biblical references and examples- those were few and far between.Therefore, if you have really studied the Bible, you may want to throw the book away. If you have only a partial knowledge of the Bible, you may be lead in the wrong direction. And, if you have no Biblical understanding, you will get a wrong impression. I would not recommend this book to anyone.The authors are well intentioned but give their advice."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is for every woman who has been wounded by life, people, and the church - which covers just about all of us.

It got to the very root of the wounds and how to begin the road to true, lasting, healing. I would strongly recommend this book to EVERY woman ... you need to see and believe how truly remarkable, priceless, beautiful and necessary you are. God Himself made Woman the crown of creation.

That's all fine and dandy for Disney, but welcome to the real world, honey.I feel like this book is self-centered: There are millions of women in America (and billions in the world) who can't afford to look nice.There are millions of women who are horribly abused and mutilated by their husbands, yet she talks about the husband \\"having the authority\\". There are 17,000 children that die EVERY DAY from hunger. You want to be a real women? Then stop wondering when your \\"warrior prince\\" will come riding in, and start doing something.

As if it isn't bad enough to contribute to the dumbed-down and reactionary nature of mainstream American Christianity, Eldredge's work presents an incredibly destructive version of gender relations. Many women want a mate and a companion, not a knight in shining armor, and it is unhelpful for Eldredge to reproduce the chick-flick party line that all a woman needs is a good man to save her. Not only does that idea distract women from searching for fulfillment from the only being that can ever give it to them--God--but it causes them to have unhealthy expectations of men and of relationships. Personal problems that get taken into marriage aren't going to be solved by the mere fact of marriage but rather exacerbated. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book: there's nothing in there that you wouldn't be better off NOT knowing."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Little girls play dress-up and want to be princesses.

It exaggerates the issues about women.I would say, it does have a few good points. Definitely, I have read better books than this."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"When I read and review a book I attempt to do so as objectively as possible. After all, each book should be taken on its own merits. It is not entirely fair to cast presuppositions gained from previous books onto an author's later works. It is not unusual for an author to come to better or worse understandings as his life progresses. A person whose theology once seemed rock-solid, could, unfortunately, write a book later in life that seemed to be anything but orthodox. I say this to preface my review to John Eldredge's latest book, Captivating. I attempted to be as objective as possible when reading the book, but found it to be nearly impossible. The book was clearly designed to ride the wave of Eldredge's previous success, and most notably his best-seller Wild at Heart. Wild at Heart is mentioned on the front cover (\\"Best-Selling Author of Wild at Heart\\") and the back (\\"What Wild at Heart did for men Captivating will do for you\\"). It was mentioned again in the second sentence of the introduction and was often quoted, even at length, throughout the book (as was The Sacred Romance). There is even an 8-page excerpt of it at the back of the book. While this may provide credibility to those who enjoyed the first book, I found that it cast a shadow over Captivating.John Eldredge has gained prominence within Christian circles as a leading author who addresses issues of concern to men. He has written several best-selling books. Wild at Heart, the most popular of these, is also the most controversial. There have been extensive reviews and examinations of the book and many have expressed concern that it contains consistently poor theology. Captivating marks a new stage in Eldredge's ministry, as it is written specifically for women. The back cover tells us that \\"What Wild at Heart did for men Captivating will do for you.\\" It promises to \\"unveil the mystery of a woman's soul.\\" This book is co-written by Eldredge's wife, Stasi, and represents her first publication.I have little doubt that in a short while we will have many detailed, critical analyses of this book available to us - reviews that will be far more detailed and insightful than any I could write. I do not intend to write an extensive review, primarily because of the subject matter. I could address the theology of the book, but would have no comparison to the subject matter. After all, I do not read many books geared specifically for women. Perhaps I should. Regardless, this book is so closely tied to Wild at Heart that many of the criticisms levelled at that book will apply also to this one. In Fool's Gold, edited by John MacArthur, Daniel Gillespie writes a lengthy critique of the book and levels four main charges at it, saying it has an insufficient view of Scripture, an inadequate picture of God, an incomplete portrait of Christ and an innacurate picture of man. Those all apply to Captivating as much as they did to Wild at Heart.Like Wild at Heart, this book is built around three premises. Every woman wants to be romanced, to play a role in her own adventures and to display beauty. The book is roughly divided along these lines. \\"The longings God has written deep in your heart are telling you something essential about what it means to be a woman, and the life he meant for you to live. Now we know - many of those desires have gone unmet, or been assaulted, or simply so long neglected, that most women end up living two lives. On the surfce we are busy and efficient, professional, even. We are getting by. On the inside women lose themselves in a fantasy world or in cheap novels, or we give ourselves over to food or some other addiction to name the ache of our hearts. But your desire is still there, crying out to be set free, to find the life your desires tell you of. You can find that life - if you are willing to embark on a great adventure\\" (page 19). The adventure is written on the pages of this book.In place of an overall critique, allow me to express a few of my concerns with this book:* As with Eldredge's previous books, this one relies heavily on stories and, in particular, movies to express teaching. I counted the movies and arrived at a list of thirty-eight that are mentioned either implicitly or explicitly. Many of them are mentioned multiple times. There were also many references to novels and songs. While there were also numerous references to the Scripture, these were most often drawn from only a few passages and were often used outside of their proper context.* I was surprised to see that the book paid scant attention to those passages of the Bible that particularly address women. I do not recall any attempt to interact with Paul's epistles; Proverbs 31 received only one mention, and it was only in the context of sneering at the church's fixation with that traditional role model. In fact, the only passages that received any significant attention were Genesis 2 and 3. The authors rewrote Genesis 2:18, which most translations render similar to \\"It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.\\" They turned to a commentary and translation written by Robert Alter and suggested a better translation of the verse is \\"I will make a sustainer beside him\\" (page 27). Strangely, though, they later seem to indicate that a man does have some sort of authority over his wife.* Eldredge's emphasis on extra-biblical revelation has carried over from his other books. In this one, for example, he writes aout a time when the Holy Spirit told him to buy an Emmylou Harris CD for his wife (page 120). He also indicates that the Spirit will tell us when we need a bubblebath, a movie or a run (page 145), if only we listen to Him.* Eldredge rehashes the worst of The Sacred Romance, drawing extensively from Hosea and Song of Solomon and using sexual terminology. He says that God has a deep, fiery, passionate love for women and that He wishes to romance us. \\"Think of one of the most romantic scenes you can remember, scenes that made you sigh. Jack with Rose on the bow of the Titanic, his arms around her waist, their first kiss. Wallace speaking in French to Murron, then in Italian: \\"Not as beautiful as you.\\" Aragorn, standing with Arwen in the moonlight on the bridge in Rivendell, declaring his love for her. Edward returning for Elinor in Sense and Sensibility, and professor Behr returning for Jo at the end of Little Women. Now, put yourself in the scene as the Beauty, and Jesus as the Lover\\" (page 114). This clearly goes far beyond the biblical metaphors for God's love.* The authors tell us that the women mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus are mentioned because of their vulnerability (page 155). The ridiculous teaching about Ruth, first printed in Wild at Heart is repeated here.* Ironically, while God is presented as a wild Romancer, He is also presented in an emasculated form. We are told that God has been wooing you. We are told that \\"you are meant to fill a place in the heart of God no one and nothing else can fill. He longs for you\\" (page 120). This almost seems to indicate that God needs us to make His joy and satisfaction complete. There are often several references to our need to minister to the heart of Jesus through our worship. All of this portrays an inaccurate understanding of God.* There is a strange emphasis on spiritual warfare. Stasi writes about dizzy spells which she felt were caused by Satan. There are multiple references to binding Satan and casting him and his minions away.For sake of brevity I will cease. While some of these are only minor concerns, others are clearly more significant. Overall, this book is little more than Wild at Heart rewritten for women - with a soft, feminine cover in place of the harsh, masculine one. Like its predecessor it contains far too much poor theology and draws as much from popular culture as it does from the Word of God. While there was some benefit for me in reading about the hearts of women, there must be better resources available that would do this in a more biblical manner. Despite the risk of stating the obvious, I would caution Christians against reading this book."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"great book for women, and for men who want to understand women. very affirming, uplifting, and encouraging. one of the most important books for Christian women out there!!!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book was a gift for a group of pastors wives, I personally have not read it but they were all pleased to receive it!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is a great book to help you understand why you have certain struggles as a woman."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"NO stars!\\"Every woman's three core desires are: to be romanced, to play a role in her own adventures and to display beauty.\\"I am apparently not \\"every woman\\", as my core desires are: to be taken seriously, take the LEAD in my own adventures, and to display competence.This book does a grave disservice to every woman in this country who is trying to lead a full and rewarding life on her own merits.

It's a deep an honest look into the heart of a woman and into the heart of the God who made her. If you're looking to understand women from a Biblical perspective, then this is the book for you. And to be sure, this is not a list of rules or a blanket condemnation of women. This is humble exploration of what womanhood is, means, and why so many women seem so broken. This book can also be a bit touchy-feely in places and probably lacks the solid evidence that some readers will be looking for, but if you read this book with an honest interest and a pinch of humility, it will certainly change your life, or at the very least the way you view women. I think everyone should read this book.That being said, however, this book IS written from a Biblical perspective and not everyone will agree with its foundational beliefs and therefore its overall arguments. Though I wish I could recommend this book to anyone, if you're an atheist or really anyone who doesn't believe in the Bible, you'll probably spend more time disagreeing with Captivating's base assumptions than really reading it to learn. However, if you're the sort of person who can entertain an idea you disagree with, I would highly recommend this book as it is a good, easy read and an insight into what Godly femininity really means and where we Christians are getting all these crazy ideas from in the first place."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book came promptly and in great condition.

Captiving sheds light on the reasons why I felt like I did as a child and why I expected more from men as an adult. I just got out of a relationship that began with this love of my life calling me his queen (which I thought was odd and uncomfortable at first but then grew accustomed to it and was somehow comforted by it -- however, it didn't last, because the first time I questioned him he stopped calling me queen). This man reminded me of Jesus (somewhat) physically and he attests to Christianity and works in a mega-church. Intially, I thought this was it. It wasn't. This book Captivating is an eye and heart opening book. Don't listen to those women who have put this book down -- they are wrong.

It starts with Adam and Eve, conveying the importance of women and their role in God's eyes (NOT as a servant of Adam, by the way, but our importance in relationships) It then talks about how living in the world has ruined this, through a variety of striking examples of wounded women. I have no doubt that any woman who reads this book could relate to at least some of them. The authors gently show us how our wounds keep us from our potential, but then show us how God can allow us to reach it in our relationships with him and with others.One main focus is how women have an inherent beauty, the world does its best to ruin it, but with God we are allowed to be beautiful.

The authors seemed to make huge statements without backing them up with scripture. There was hardly any scripture used, and when it was, it seemed off topic or out of context.We started using the companion book for our discussions, but quickly turned to writing our own discussion questions. The questions were poorly written, and most of them were simply yes/no. We began writing questions challenging each other to find scripture that illustrated certain points that the Eldredges were trying to make. We were able to easily find more adequate scriptures, and we started to wonder if the book had been written in a huge rush and they hadn't had time to look for better scriptures (too much time watching movies, I guess).There are so many better books out there. This was weak and fluffy and seemed to focus more on what fantasy and movies have to say about love and beauty than what the Bible says. The problem with fantasy and movies is that life doesn't happen that way. And I was so sick of Lord of the Rings by the end of this book, I didn't even want to hear about it anymore!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"First off, I really wanted to like this book. My mother raved about how wonderful it was and gave me a copy of my own, telling me how it brought her to tears and moved her. I dove into it, thinking I would find beautiful truths to nurture my soul.However, I came away pretty disappointed.First off, the good things - the book captured me in explaining ways in which women are image-bearers of God. I did gain some insight from this. However, the negative in this book shadows the positive.Many other reviewers have spelled out the sloppy theology in this book, so I won't elaborate too much on that here. However, the biggest complaint I had with this book is the way in which it treats women who don't base their lives on a man's approval. Stasi and John talk a lot about women who want to be seen as beautiful, women who want to be romanced; and while those desires are all fine, they simply don't define every single woman. This book forms a one-size-fits-all mold for femininity, and then calls that mold \\"Biblical femininity,\\" leaving single, unglamorous, less-than-romantic women like myself to wonder, \\"Do I just not measure up?\\"Thankfully, John and Stasi don't make the mold - Christ does. He recognizes that each women is a unique individual with unique desires. I think this book would have been much better had it simply been a tale of Stati's journey to discover the kind of woman God wanted HER to be, rather than trying to fit her specific experiences to all women.For a more theologically sound, less rigid look at God's design of/plan for women, I highly recommend Jonalyn Fincher's \\"Ruby Slippers,\\" also published by Zondervan. I trust and agree with many of Zondervan's publications - but sadly, this one really missed the mark."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book is designed to address the life of a woman and the role she has to play. It was written to do for women what John Eldredge's Wild At Heart did for men. It also says that God longs to have a personal relationship with us. However this book misses the mark in making these two points. Here are some of the problems that make this book spiritually unprofitable---Generalizations. In the first chapter the Eldredge's state that \\"every woman in her heart longs for three things: to be romanced, to play and irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty.\\" In the rest of the book they attribute why women don't get these three things to the fact that their \\"Question\\" hasn't been answered. They say that every woman is asking the question \\"Am I lovely?\\" Stasi seems to take her personal experience and personal desires and attribute them to every woman. She comes from a troubled past of depression, eating disorders, abuse and sexual promiscuity--this helps the reader understand some of where she is coming from, but for her to make her own experience out to be the problems with all women is not accurate by any stretch.-Problems with Proverbs 31. Several times this book voices a problem with Proverbs 31. Speculating about \\"church women\\" and their model for femininity, they say,\\"We're all living in the shadow of that infamous icon, 'The Proverbs 31Woman,' whose life is so busy I wonder, when does she have time forfriendships, for taking walks, or reading good books? Somehow shehas sanctified the shame most women live under, biblical proof thatyet again we don't measure up. Is that supposed to be godly--thesense that you are a failure as a woman?\\" (p.6)The truth is that we are failures, all of us, men and women alike. That's why we need Christ to save us and make us new creations (2 Cor. 5:17), set apart to do His good works (Eph. 2:10). We don't need to feel good about ourselves or our efforts to measure up, that is the whole reason we need Christ--we don't measure up. As believers our time on this earth is a life-long pursuit for Christ likeness. If we think the Proverbs 31 woman makes us feel bad to compare ourselves to, how do we feel when we look at ourselves compared to Jesus, who is perfect? We shouldn't be resentful toward God's Word, but should humbly accept what God calls us to and strive wholeheartedly to that end.-Movies. Conclusions drawn from feelings/emotions and movies seem to be more valid than Scripture. I was surprised at how many movies they used for examples and illustrations for their points rather than looking to women in the Bible. Not only that, many of the movies they reference seem inappropriate.-Taking Scripture out of context. The Eldredges constantly refer to the book Song of Songs to make their points. Even though this book clearly and specifically accounts Solomon's relationship with the Shulamite maiden, this book uses verse after verse as God speaking to women.For example, in the introduction of chapter seven Stasi tells of a walk she took one night in which she admired creation and complimented God saying, \\"It's beautiful, Lord! The stars are amazing!\\" Apparently she \\"heard\\" a response, \\"I'm glad you like it, my Darling.\\" Stasi continues with her narrative, \\"I stopped dead in my tracks. I blushed. Did the God of the universe just call me 'Darling'?\\" She tells how later she was reading Song of Songs and was amazed to have some sort of confirmation in chapter one verse fifteen, \\"How beautiful you are, my darling.\\"Many other times the Eldredges make big statements without any Scriptural foundation at all. Two of the more troubling ones are:\\"For the root of all holiness is Romance\\" (p. 113)\\"You. You are meant to fill a place in the heart of God noone and nothing else can fill. Woah. He longs for you.\\" (p. 120)-Confusing Biblical love with romance. Biblical love is defined as: patient, kind, not having envy, not proud, rude or selfish, doesn't get upset easily, doesn't think evil but rejoicing in truth, love bears all things, hopes and endures. Romance can be defined as: an emotional attraction, excitement, adventure and seeking to gain one's favor with flattery.-Assuming our desires are good. Throughout this book, the Eldredges seek to address women's desires, may they be for acceptance, beauty, adventure or romance...they assume that all desires we have are God-given. They talk much about the core of a woman's heart and the longings and desires that are there, but they never address the reality that our hearts are wicked and terribly deceived. Jeremiah 17:9 says, \\"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?\\" At one point Proverbs 4:23 is quoted which says, \\"Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life.\\" The conclusion they make from this verse is that,\\"Your feminine heart has been created with the greatest of all possibledignities--as a reflection of God's own heart. You are a woman to yoursoul, to the very core of your being...When he created you as his woman--that journey begins with your heart. Another way of saying this is thatthe journey begins with desire.\\" (p.8)I can have lots of desires that are self induced longings for things that God may not want there. Proverbs 3:5 gives a similar exhortation on this matter of the heart and desires: \\"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding...\\" We should never assume that we have anything good in us and especially not that our own desires for things are somehow right simply because they exist. That is why I'm exhorted to guard my heart with diligence, it isn't right or good, but deceitful and wicked.-Vague on sin and salvation. The Eldredges do talk about God and mention salvation, but fail to do so in a clearly defined or Biblical light. In chapters three and four we are given an account of the creation and the fall where sin or salvation are referred to as \\"fallen Eve\\" or \\"redeemed Eve\\". Sin is often referred to vaguely as having \\"fallen from grace\\", \\"goes bad\\", \\"fails\\" or is not \\"not measuring up\\". The distinction of a woman being spiritually alive or spiritually dead is unclear. The Eldredges state that Satan hates women, because of her \\"beauty and power\\" (p. 85) making it seem as though the spiritual battles we face are between Satan and his evil forces and specifically women rather than believers.Another particularly troubling part claims that Christ has saved us so we can be ourselves.\\"Now the Son of God has come to ransom you, and to heal yourbroken, wounded, bleeding heart, and to set you free from bondage.He came to restore the glorious creation that you are. And then setyou free...to be yourself.\\" (p. 95)I'm very concerned about this claim, because Biblically the whole reason we've been set free from sin and death specifically is so that we can not be ourselves, but instead be like Christ. That's why in 2 Corinthians 5:17 it says that \\"If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.\\"There are so many other issues in this book that I could address--assaulting spirits, taking medication for depression, Christian psychology, and the chapter called \\"Arousing Adam.\\" But the fundamental problem with this book is that it is woman-centered rather than God-centered. The Eldredges try to exalt women to a position that is nowhere found in Scripture.\\"She is the crescendo, the final, astonishing work of God. Woman.In one last flourish creation comes to a finish not with Adam,but with Eve... Given the way creation unfolds, how it builds toever higher and higher works of art, can there be any doubt thatEve is the crown of creation? Not an afterthought. Not a niceaddition like an ornament on a tree. She is God's final touch, hispiece de resistance... Look out across the earth and say to yourselves,'The whole, vast world is incomplete without me.Creation reached its zenith in me.'\\" (p. 25)\\"There is something uniquely magnificent and powerful about a woman.We tried to reveal the immeasurable dignity, the holiness of yourfeminine heart by showing that it is God who longs for Romance...it is God who reveals beauty as essential to life. You are the imagebearer of this God. That is why you long for those things too. Thereis a radiance hidden in your heart that the world desperately needs.\\" (p. 42)\\"But most especially, he [Satan] hates Eve. Because she is captivating,uniquely glorious, and he cannot be. She is the incarnation of theBeauty of God. More than anything else in all creation,she embodies the glory of God. She allures the world to God. (p. 84)\\"You see, ultimately, a woman invites us to know God.\\" (p. 137)This book tries to make God out to be a \\"lover\\" and our \\"Romancer\\" rather than teaching us to love Him with all our heart. If you are looking for a book that can help you grow as a godly woman, I would recommend several other authors whose books present a Biblical study of what God calls us to as women: Elizabeth Elliot, Elizabeth George, Martha Peace and Beth Moore. Some books that I've enjoyed in my pursuit to being a godly woman would include: Feminine Appeal by Carolyn Mahaney, Twelve Extraordinary Women by John MacArthur, Attitudes of a Transformed Heart by Martha Peace and Becoming a Woman Who Pleases God by Pat Ennis and Lisa Tatlock. I would encourage you to read any of these books and stay away from Captivating. The heresy the Eldredges are teaching in this book is not edifying for anyone to read. If you know someone who is reading this book, I would encourage you to talk with them about these problems. We need to exercise Biblical discernment and enjoy the relationship with God that He defines in His Word."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is one of the hardest books that I have ever read...the urge to chuck it across the room hit me more than once. It's dead on accuracy with describing women was amazing and frustrating. I was forced to examine areas of my life that I didn't want to admit existed. It is an amazing guide for growing into the women that God intended us to be. I would reccommend it for all women!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Due to too many generalizations about what a woman is and should be, rather than a solid scientific approach to unveiling a woman's heart, soul, or mind. While I found the writing a bit lyrical at times, I was disturbed about how easily contemporary stereotypes are supported. \\"Beauty is inviting\\" seems to both provide an excuse for bad behaviors thrust upon women, while suggesting that a truly beautiful woman wouldn't thwart advances. Considering the current rates of rape in this country, this line of thinking seems a bit irresponsible. Further, the assertion that women of power are somehow less beautiful is disturbing, untrue, and simply unfounded. Ultimately, this is where I gave up on the book.I was looking for a considered and supported book, but in return found a book full of personal convictions, weakly supported by Bible passages (which seemed twisted to bolster the authors' points), and generalizations about who and what a woman is and should be. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Although Staci's ideas are easy to relate to and give the reader a sense of child-like wonder in a cotton-candy, fluffy-kitty sort of way, it became known quickly that this book is not meant for the serious student of the Scriptures...or maybe it is (if you want to put something to the test). 1st Thessalonians: 21 reads, \\"Test everything.\\" For each Scripture Staci put in her book, I put her to the \\"test.\\"One of many examples of a misuse of a scripture (or misrepresentation, rather) in her book is in Chapter 5, titled \\" A Special Hatred.\\" Mrs. Eldredge leads you to believe that God is talking about ALL of his people in Jeremiah 30:16-17 and then she asks the questions, \\" How will God treat your enemies,\\"...,\\"how will he treat you?\\" This scripture is NOT talking about the Gentiles or foreigners as she will have you believe...it is SPECIFICALLY referring to the restoration of Israel and those from \\"Jacob's tents\\" (Jeremiah 30:18) - in other words, God's people the Jews. Therefore, we don't ALL fall under that category...most of us reading this book probably DON'T fall under that category, unless you are a Christian Jew. Another OBVIOUS misuse of the Scriptures is when Staci is trying to use Ezekiel 28:17 to describe what happend to Lucifer and how his beauty became his downfall. This scripture has NOTHING TO DO WITH LUCIFER if you read the scriptures in context to chapter 28 in the Bible. In context, this scripture is about the King of Tyre who called himself \\"a god\\" (Ezekiel 28:2-3)but he is merely \\"a man\\" (Ezekiel 28:9). I believe the Lord could possibly be comparing the King of Tyre to the once \\"Most Beautiful Angel\\" who fell from his position, (Lucifer /Satan)but we can only infer this...it is not fact within this scripture. Therefore, this perception is based on mere conjecture.Again, this book is interesting if you don't care to get too deep or care that the scriptures quoted are used out of context and are not succinct with the Bible's teaching. This book would be a good example of what NOT to buy for someone who is looking for a book that is Biblically sound. It is obvious that Mrs. Eldredge put a lot of heart into her book but the vagueness and misrepresentations of the Bible's teachings were enough to make me put the book down from disappointment. I ended up reading it to the end only because even bad books deserve an un-bias critique from knowing the book up to the last page. I must admit, though, that in the end I just felt like a child who got an ice-cream cone expecting the whole cone to be filled and after 2 licks, finding the rest of the cone is filled with nothing but air. :("},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have read everything that John Eldredge has written and have found each of his books enlightening and wonderful. That being said none can top this book in reaching women on a deep heart level. The female version of WILD AT HEART, this book explores the deepest longings of women to be seen as beautiful and to be desired for the person they are. Co-written with his wife, Stasi, for the female perspective it gives a full picture of the relationships between men and women.For that reason (and many others), men in particular would benefit from reading this book in order to understand the women in their lives. As the authors write at one point, \\"Women are a mystery to be enjoyed, not a problem to be solved.\\" This directly addresses the problem most women find in their relationships as they are labeled too much of this or not enough of that (too emotional, too needy, not smart enough, not independent enough.) This book helps both sexes explore how the differences between men and women can be understood and appreciated in a way that edifies both.At the heart of this book are the principles at the center of each Eldrege book: that there is a battle for our hearts and that we must fight to regain the person that Christ died for us to be. Take the time to read this book and work through the guided journal when it comes out in July. I promise it will be a life changing journey that will open your heart more deeply to Christ and the ones you love."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"John and Stasi Eldredge have discovered some interesting things about human desires. These kept me going as I read the book. However, I disagreed with other statements that were so dogmatically made.For example, I found that I only have two of the three desires that supposedly are universal to all women. I also have one (maybe two) of the desires that are universal to all men. What does that say about me as a woman?Having said all that, I did benefit from the book. It was good to realize that most women do have many of the same suppressed dreams and desires that I do. It was also comforting to acknowledge that God has a plan to develop me as a person by using the struggles and even the things which have brought me shame in the past.I am glad that I read this book and I would recommend it to others, but would suggest that you use some discernment when you read it"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I'm currently doing a group study of Waking the Dead, my third read of that book, and I think that it is a very good book. I enjoyed Wild at Heart and I'm giving this book a strong recommendation for both men and women alike. I won't say that this offering is as good as Waking the Dead, or as much of an impact to a man was Wild at Heart was, however, I still believe that Christian men will gain a lot of understanding from reading this as I did.There is of course a group of Christians out there that doesn't believe that God actually speaks to people today. Okay for them, however, I'd not listen to them, if God is that silent, they are fools too. As for the Eldridge's style of using books, movies and the like to create word pictures and draw analogies from, well if they are wrong then C.S. Lewis and Tolkien were idiots too I guess. Gee, you'd think John was selling dope on a street corner the way some Christians bash him. Oh Well.In any case, if you liked earlier works by Eldridge, you'll probably enjoy this one too, if not, then you probably won't.One negative reviewer wrote that there is a \\"strange emphasis\\" on spiritual warfare.Think about that one. A strange emphasis indeed. I wonder if Paul ever taught about standing firm against the schemes of the devil or if Peter ever mentioned that the devil is like a lion seeking out whom he might destroy or if Jesus ever mentioned something about a thief that comes to steal and destroy. Ummmm. Well maybe not.Perhaps all this talk about spiritual warfare was just for \\"back in the day\\" after all, if one looks around this planet it's hard to see any destruction, I mean, heck, it's all peace and jelly beans.I give the book a strong recommendation to Christian women and the to the men that love them."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I think a lot of the reviews that gave this book five stars never opened their Bible. If they did they would notice how often she twists or quotes scriptures out of context. This book is based far more on movies than on scriptures.For instance in the Bible, Jesus says he is the Bridegroom and the Church is his Bride. This is a continued metaphor that God uses in the Old Test. to represent his relationship with the Unfaithful Israel.The main basis for this book is to lead you to believe that you are the Bride and Jesus wants to be your lover.She goes way past biblical when she says \\"Jack with Rose on the bow of the Titanic, his arms around her waist, their first kiss... Now, put yourself in the scene as the Beauty, and Jesus as the Lover.\\"Stasi is trying to tell us that we are supposed to fantasize about kissing and holding Jesus. ???? I think she didn't watch the movie because Rose was engaged when she had an affair and she had sex before marriage. But according to Stasi this is what we desire... to be a Beauty like Rose."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I've read several reviews for Captivating and it seems like you either love it or it makes you want to throw up. I read it and i have to say it was both suprising and disappointing. It is suprising because John and Stasi definitely understand the importance of family in shaping who we become. They also do a great job of pointing out how God views us. The disappointment comes in, though, in their misuse of the Bible. If the things they said in the book are true and how God really views us, which i believe they are, then they should have had lots of great Scripture to apply. Instead, most of the verses in Captivating were used out of context. In that respect the book was a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"A lot of people rave about this one. It's good, but I think it can be dangerous for younger girls to read. It focuses on \\"unveiling your beauty\\" (being vulnerable, etc.) as a woman, but that should really be saved for the right man, not just a middle school/high school crush. It can probably be tempting for girls to want to do that prematurely. Also, it can be kind of heavy at times, might not be right for all middle or high school girls. As for the way it talks about femininity and being a woman, I did enjoy those parts. Some of them are beautifully written and I strive for grasping my true femininity. I guess I just didn't love the WHOLE book as much as other people."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"My husband of 26 years left me for another woman recently. This book seem to speak directly to the questions and ache in my soul. It helps me to understand why I depended on the love of my husband so much & how I can really fill that void with Jesus. I never really understood before but this book helps me to understand how much Jesus loves me & why."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I recently reviewed the book Captivating:Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul by John and Stasi Eldredge for Booksneeze and let me give a quick synopsis of a few things I did not like about this book.I really disliked the portrayal of women as a whole in this book as being broken, hurting, incomplete individuals. This is a common mindset afflicting women in christian culture. I may not have had a great childhood and neither may have you, but twenty years later I do not need to wallow in the injustices of my life. I believe it is much, much better to fill ones heart and mind with what God says about us as women, as his creation and children. I believe we are all \\"more than conquerors in Christ Jesus\\". The authors play up women's broken needs and incompleteness as needing men. I wish they had played up more the fact that wholeness and completeness will only ever be found in Christ, whether you are a single woman or happily married.I dislike the author's intimidation with and contempt for the Proverbs 31 woman.Several time this chapter is referenced and never in light of the beautiful scriptural example it is meant to be.I dislike the book's focus on emotionalism and fluff.Entire portions of are bent and twisted to build up women's self esteem, tell her she is the glorifying piece of creation all the world was missing, and that she is the incarnation of God (umm...that would be Jesus, not Eve) \\"Eve was given to the world as the incarnation of a beautiful, captivating God\\" (pg. 44, Captivating).I wish I could give this book a good review. There is an incredible need for Biblically sound literature which don't play on women's tendency for emotionalism. I want the truth and life found in scripture.Have you read Captivating? If so, what was your take?"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"When I read this book for the first time about 6 years ago. I had a really hard time with it back then, and when it got to the \\"Jesus is my lover\\" chapter, I was completely turned off. My college group decided last year that the women would do this book. So, I read it again. And this time I decided to figure out why I had such a hard time with it.Lack of Scripture. I actually counted the scriptural references AND media references in each chapter... the media references were more than triple the scriptural references. Not to mention that a ton of scripture was used way out of context. There was one chapter where they used a verse about friendship that honestly didn't fit... I found 17 other verses they could've used for the chapter and all of them fit better than the one they chose.The way they portrayed women was awful. Yes, little girls have wedding fantasies, and dream about being rescued by their knight in shining armor. But really? This book made women seem weak. Yes, women are broken, but all humans are broken. I hated the way they made women seem so helpless.The theology was completely messed up. \\"Eve was given to the world as the incarnation of a beautiful, captivating God\\" (pg. 44) ... What? Eve is the incarnation of God? Hmm, interesting since Jesus is the only incarnation of God. Another one I liked was that Eve is the crown of creation. Ok... so since Eve was the last created, that makes her the crown of creation? Technically, mankind is the crown of creation. Not just Eve. Lets not forget the completely self centered view they try to give women when they state 'The whole, vast world is incomplete without me. Creation reached its zenith in me.'.Is something going wrong in your life? Oh, thats ok, just blame Satan/Demons. Not feeling well? You must be under spiritual attack... Don't get me wrong, I'm a firm believer that Satan and his demons play a huge role in life, spiritual warfare is very real. But to blame every single thing that goes wrong on demons? Come on. We're humans, we mess up. We have free will. Because of that, we make stupid choices. Sometimes God himself takes things away from us because of this. God does things for us... even if we see it as something going wrong. Whats sad is that my small group leader really focused in on this section and went on and on about how Satan tried to kill her that day, in multiple ways.When it comes to spiritual books like this, being theologically sound and having a good scriptural base is key. The fact that this book has neither makes it dangerous for women of all ages to read."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Yeah, I know, the title of this review seems weird, but I picked this book up to read more about my wife. The only problem is, I definitely don't think this was written for men. So, now that is out of the way, I'll move on...I think this is an excellent book to really capture the essence of a woman. From the guys who brought you \\"Wild At Heart\\" for us men, they really take the time to explain how a woman works and how they can better understand themselves. The reason I said before that it was written for women is because they assume that you understand what they're talking about, probably being a woman reading the book, and that all the concepts just flow. For a guy, its a little hard to understand, but my wife seems to love it.Overall, I think its a great read for any woman looking to explore why they are the way they are and how to deal with the feelings and emotions that come from being a woman."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I loved this book. I felt like the Proverbs 31 woman was portrayed as delightful, attainable, and desirable. I also have a new found understanding about why women are the way we are. I love the story of love and longing that is described between God and his daughters that he has created. If you have a daughter, wife, or mother then you should read this book."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"For the root of all holiness is romance.\\"I have a problem with that statement theologically and logically. It is very wrong. The authors have tied the idea of the love of God into our modern sexualized views of romance. English doesn't have the same ability to express different types of love the way the Greek can, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. The kind of love in this book is not what I want my personal relationship with Jesus to be about. The church being the bride of Christ does not mean that we as individuals should be desiring a fluttering-butterfly in the pit of our stomach feeling about Jesus.The thing the authors are trying to do is give women the knowledge that beauty is not about the outside, and they are deeply loved by God. Their goal is admirable. The methods are just not okay. Instead of using scripture to heal the broken hearts they apply examples from literature and especially cinema. The problem is encouraging people to live in a fantasy world will not help them adjust to life as it really is. Their point that we need to turn to God to complete us, and not other humans, is right on the money. But I don't find this book freeing. I find it deeply enslaving to a mental concept rooted in fantasy and fluff instead of what really matters.Real relationships are about being a community to one another and helping each other through practicalities in life. Closeness and deep connection do not require the artificial trappings of 'romance' that are pushed on us by our consumer culture. We need to stop being victims and feeling alone and quit looking for Jesus to be a fill in for some movie hero. He's so much bigger and so far beyond that fantasy foolishness!!!The evangelical community has done it again. Instead of engaging the MIND and exploring reason and reality we are pushing feelings and insubstantial fluff. We are taking our view of what our relationship with God should be from popular culture instead of taking our view of what culture should be from God."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I think what I really enjoyed about this book is that it brings spiritual truths out and it is really between the reader and God. Stasi and John both use examples of their own lives, but they are constantly encouraging the reader to take it to God. As a 20-year-old, God is still revealing who He created me to be. At this age, I have had to deal with issues that have held me back. This book opened up places in my heart that I didn't even know were closed (God used this book to do so,anyhow). I loved that they brought out three questions that a woman really does ask. My heart affirmed that they are the questions I have asked, and God showed me how He answers them. After finishing this book, I am even more enthused in accepting God's call on my life, and accepting that I am beautiful and irreplaceable. Read the book for yourself, and really see how it affects your heart!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I couldn't even finish this book. Rather than focusing on how we have sinful hearts that should desire what God wants, it tries to get women to focus too much on ourselves. When I stand before the Lord one day, I want to have lived fully for Him, not for myself and my beauty. Too dangerous of a book focused on psychology instead of the Holy Scriptures and our Incredible Lord."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Very Good Book.Have read it several timesHelps to understand women a little... lolDon't know they can ever be fully understood... only loved."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Really helped me see the value of my life.

It's not really terribly well written, but the themes it discusses are very true and very important. It isn't gooey, doesn't try to placate female suffering with cute phrases. While John and Staci do sometimes generalize about the nature of women, and while many of the hurts they describe are far more extreme than those I myself have experienced, still something in everything they say goes straight to the heart. Don't be turned away if you get to the \\"Wounded\\" section and find that you've never had such horrific experiences as they women they detail. This is definitely not just a book for severely traumatized women. I've a had a good life, and a good family, myself--but still, there are wounds. And I found myself crying over each section that touched some hurt, with just the right Scripture, just the right word of hope and encouragement. It's so powerful because it does speak right to the feminine heart, applies story and Scripture in a way that women need. Over all, it's a really good book, and you should buy it even if you don't think you have huge issues. If nothing else, it's a beautiful reminder of the loveliness of a woman's soul, in an age which always seems to make no difference between men and women."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"If you want a closer realtionship with God this book is for you.

It really could have been condensed into about 25 pages. I felt like it dragged on and on. I also felt like saying, \\"get over it\\" throughout the whole book. Yeah, everyone has had a bad past but rather than dwelling on it and considering how it has effected our lives let's just come to the understanding that we are beautiful, God loves us, and let's move on. No sense in getting emotional about it."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I read this book in July and I'm still basking in the knowledge I gleaned from it.

I couldn't imagine why it was so important to me, but I figured it must be a dysfunction and I felt shallow for it. I also had trouble with femininity in general because what was feminine was not valued in my childhood home or in the media. That was until I read Captivating.

They throw us head long into a journey of pursuing God with all of our heart, soul, mind and strength.The pursuit results in total transformation. Mediocre religion doesn't cut it anymore. We have to have God and we have to see Him powerfully and fully integrated in our every day lives.

I highly recommend it to any woman!"},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I give it 4 stars because it is a wonderful, enlightening book, but it is somewhat repetative, to the point of annoyance now and then. However, I could not put it down and I feel it is a valuable book for any woman to read (and any husband, boyfriend, brother, father or son). It truly is a fantastic book (about an awe-inspiring subject)with a message worth hearing.Edit: I wrote the above review in '06. It is now '08 and I have a different opinion of this book. I would only give it 1 star if I were reviewing it today. I have discovered that the theology is poor and the concepts basic. The authors use human emotion as a standard by which to judge God's emotions/motives. This is the wrong way to go. I again mention the book's repetitiveness, which is even more annoying now that I'm older. There are so many MUCH better books out there. Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"As I read this book, I became very troubled by what I was reading. I couldn't relate. I have since talked to other women about this book and they said the same thing, they couldn't relate and were troubled. I had my husband read the book because he had just finished Wild at Heart, by John Eldredge and thought that it was a good book. He was so troubled by this book that he is no longer reading any other book by Eldredge and plans to return the two he just purchased. I will not get into all the details about why this book should not be read be Christians (because I think the other reviews do an excellent job of this) but would like to warn leaders of Women's Ministries not to use this book. Scriptures are taken out of contact (what few they use)and it uses negative, sinful examples from movies and pop culture to explain how Jesus longs to have a relationship with women. This was very troubling! I think that new Christians will be harmed by this book. I have three young daughters and the thought of them reading this book when they are older compelled my to write this book review. There are many great books out there written for women that will help women grow and have a personal relationship with Jesus. If you are looking for books with sound Biblical teachings, read books by Kay Arthur and Beth Moore, who are in my opinion, mature, grounded Christian women with much to share about the heart and soul of a women."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I read this because I had a bad relationship with my mother and wanted to be a better mother to my daughters by understanding women better. I ended up learning so much about myself. I was cried several times reading this and it's helped me to allow God to heal some wounds and be more aware of how Satan tries to attack women and girls.I had my reservations about reading a book explaining women written by a man, but Eldredge seems to have a pretty good handle on what it means to be a woman and what it is that women need."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"My husband of 21 years recently met another woman and decided he didn't want to be married to me anymore. Through the pain of this, I was given \\"Captivating\\" by a friend who had also gone through a similar situation. God used the encouragement in this book to set me free from \\"needing a man\\" to validate me as a person. I felt God's love flow into me and out to others while reading the book. The more I read, the more love I felt for myself, for God, and for others. This is just my personal experience. I recommend this book to all my friends who suffer with insecurities.My husband and I have recently reconciled, and he is now reading \\"Wild at Heart.\\" We are both dependent on other people to validate us. I'm hoping the book helps him get past that and enables him to be the man he was meant to be without fear. At this point in our lives, we need all the help we can get to help us be healthy individuals in order to have a healthy marriage. We both love the Lord and want His will for our lives, but there are underlying issues from our past, particularly our childhoods, that have created two dysfunctional, hurting people. I thank God for placing this book in my hands at this time in my journey."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Never have I read a book that completely changed the way I feel about myself. I am 54 years old and I lived my entire life searching out there in the world for something or someone to fill this gaping hole in my heart. I've been through bad relationships after bad relationships, even those that looked normal on the outside on the inside I felt unloved, unappreciated, and undervalued and ultimately I was deceived by the man. I have always felt unsettled until I read this book. The words in this book connected me with God in way religion had not been unable to. I have always loved Jesus and claim him as my savior but this book helped me understand my value to God. It spoke directly to my soul and I have been changed since reading it. I am a stronger and more confident woman after reading this book because it helped me to not only understand my value and where it comes from but to claim it. This is a must read by every woman."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Why I hate this book:Women are individual humans, not a category you can fulfill with stereotyped roles. And I don't want to prized for being beautiful and be part of a hero's story. I AM the hero and don't need someone else to provide my adventure. I have a lot of positive characteristics besides beauty, and want to be recognized and appreciated for ALL of them. And I am beautiful whether or not it is recognized by a man.This book is great to use in your Bible study/reading group if you want to foster women's dependence on men. Horrible if you want to attract a respectful man who wants an autonomous and powerful wife, like himself, and to get to know you for who you, individually, are."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"\\"Every woman in her heart of hearts longs for three things: to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty.\\" After the success of Wild at Heart, it was inevitable for Eldredge and his wife put together a book about the heart of a woman's journey through life and faith.Brokenness and restoration are the two common themes you find in all of Eldredge's books. Since the fall of Adam and Eve, man and woman have been broken. We have spent the entire story of history trying to recapture a former glory by a means necessary. Our fruitless endeavors have left us broken, and that brokenness is very evident in woman today.For years, religion has pushed women to the sidelines. They have been told they are not fit to lead a church or organizations. Captivating, however, paints a different picture. Women are beautiful, the crowning jewel of God's creation. Women are strong with a tender protective touch, an attribute of God we see in the Bible. This is a great book for all young women. My wife and I both enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I have read Wild at Heart and Way of the Wild Heart many times and even taught them. When my first marriage died due to infidelity, my children were devestated, most especially my daughter. She no longer had a role-model to fashion her womanhood after. I bought the book and read it. I was amazed at the insight into a woman's heart it gave me! I am not a woman so I had no clue. I find myself buying this set; book, study guide and journal, for woman who I see struggling to find their identity as women. It has yet to let me down."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I read this book a few years ago and I was really blessed by it. I love the idea that God \\"Romances\\" me. I have never forgotten that part of the book. Every so often something good and surprising will come along in my day and I say to myself \\"God is romancing me\\". What a blessing.I see the book is revised and updated..so I will buy a second copy and reread it with pleasure."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I think it is so sad how people get so wrapped up in specifics and miss the heart of what is written in this book. Yes, they use many personal examples, because people share best from their personal experiences. Stop getting so wrapped up in how your pastor says to interpret a certain scripture, they are simply giving another perspective. I have recommended this book to several women, and I do not know anyone who read it with an open mind who did not feel an intense closeness with God after reading it. This book is very healing for any women that has been an insecure teenager, an abused child, a lonely wife, or questioning her place with God. The fact is God made women to be a glorious unique reflection of himself on earth, not to be forever beneath men as often Christianity likes to say, we are beside men. This book was beautiful and affirming. Rather than feeling ashamed for feelings of inadequacy, as many women do (probably all), this book gives a reason for those feels and scriptures to combat them. If you read this read this with your heart and your bible open, and pray that God shows you what he wants you to see when you read it. This book changed my life."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I'm reading this book for a second time. The first time I read this book was in the summer of 2007 and through this book and a lot of prayer, I came to know Christ. I was very lost, thinking that I was actually saved. While reading this book, I realized that almost everything they wrote was true about ME and how I was actually a bad person-no one is good. From that, I laid myself at the cross, begging for His grace and mercy. With that new beginning, I have had confidence like never before...a confidence that wasn't in how I looked, who I was dating, how skinny I was.... it was a confidence in my Jesus-the King who loves His unworthy daughter.Of course this book isn't perfect-it's not written by Christ. HOWEVER, just like ALL of us, God uses imperfect people. I will testify that this book God used to change my life. I've taught several classes on a women's heart (based on this book) to teenage girls and teenage boys, and I can't even begin to describe the e-mails I've received from 16 year old boys who repented from the way they've treated girls their age and the way they've viewed themselves.I say read this book with an open heart and open mind. This book is a good guide to seeing yourself, and I mean REALLY seeing yourself in who you truly are, all in the light of Christ."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This book was lovely. I received a free copy of Captivating to review from BookSneeze and I'm glad I did- I probably wouldn't have bought it on my own but feel enriched having read it. The premise of women as wonderful, special daughters of God is refreshing and enjoyable. Although my person beliefs aren't quite the same as the authors, I loved how clearly they described Christ waiting at the gate- just waiting for us to come unto Him. I also found myself agreeing with their ideas of what women want from men and our innate, God-given differences. This was uplifting and inspiring- a great read."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"In the book Captivating; Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul, Stasi and John Eldredge peel back the layers of those superficial ideals that seem to define woman today. Captivating is a book that tells the fairy tale from its original, God breathed perspective(aka: Adam and Eve). Then, reexamines a woman's truest desires and intimate needs. Everything from our relationship with our own mother and father, our children, and our Creator God.I found Captivating; Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul to shed light upon the truth. It helped to confirm my growing realization that becoming the Proverbs 31 woman is not a course I will master in my lifetime. Strive for, yes! Conquer, no! In the book, I appreciated the three characteristics that women tend to fall into; demanding, desolate, and alluring. I felt that these depictions really helped me to step back see times when I have been one or the other, then analyze what triggers contribute to myself being one over the other.Captivating is a must read for any woman needing a fresh perspective. A new way of seeing yourself. One who longs to shed guilt and stomp out rules that bind us into a life of fear, ultimately keeping us from ever reaching our full potential. This book is a beacon of truth and light."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Every woman's soul asks the question-\\"Am I lovely?\\"Women seek answers to their question and self-validation in everything except God- whether that be food, fashion, the affirmation of people, or something just as harmful. The book Captivating by John and Stasi Eldredge delves into the heart of a woman. The theme of the book is discovering a love relationship with God and how God made us uniquely captivating for His greater glory. It seeks to emphasize the great adventure to be found in a life resting in God.I greatly enjoyed this book. Although the text started out choppy, it evened out into beautiful, conversational prose. I liked that the authors sought to use familiar movie characters as a source of analogies, as well as including lovely quotes and real-life stories. I also appreciated that the authors discussed the heart of a woman as something gentle, but equally \\"warrior princess\\" fierce. I personally dislike the doctrinal harm that has been done toward what it means to be a woman, including the misapplication of verses pertaining to femininity. This book restores Biblical truth and displays godly femininity in an amazing, adventurous way. I should note that some may mistake messages in the book about how God loves and values women as flawed humans taking pride in themselves, but in fact the book only serves to portray Biblical truth about just how much God loves us in spite of our flaws, to the point where His dying on the cross seems a scandalous, incredible act of sacrifice. The book shows that God desires to completely restore women and to help them live the purposeful lives He created them for.The book also addresses women's heart for relationship as well as the feeling that one is \\"too much\\" or \\"not enough\\" all at the same time, which as the authors say, is \\"crazy-making\\". I appreciated that the book was not a list of \\"how-to's\\" to fix (if how-to's were all that people needed, everyone would be rich and skinny), and that it didn\`t focus on doing good things, but instead on being romanced by God, from which good can flow; but only as a secondary, and not a primary focus of life.The language of this book will probably appeal most to artsy and idealist-oriented personalities as opposed to realists and the especially analytical, but as I am an \\"INFP\\", the style of writing made the book all the more appealing. This book has the potential to impact many women, especially those struggling with understanding their value, combating spiritual difficulties, or those having difficulty realizing that they have an irreplaceable role in God's adventure.~ Lady HannahDisclosure: Book Sneeze provided me with a free, complementary copy of the book Captivating by John and Stasi Eldredge.

I'm glad that I finally got the chance to read it.Captivating is the celebration of women. There is no better way to explain it. Most Christian books for women that I have read are all about Mary and Martha, and they leave you feeling like even though Jesus said Mary made the better choice, you sure are a slacker for not being more like Martha. They always have a chapter on how to make yourself beautiful for your husband, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is less about women and more about their husbands. There is always a list of things that you should be doing....or not doing.....or doing better! Captivating does none of those things. I found that to be refreshing.This book is more about life and the adventure of being a woman. Not a doormat or a servant, but a vital piece of the puzzle. The celebration of the romantic, beautiful side of God that He passed to on to us women.I leave this book with a renewed sense of adventure and a desire to embrace my romance with Jesus, because He finds me captivating.I recieved a free copy of this book for review from Thomas Nelson. I did not receive any monetary payment and I was not required to say nice things about this book."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"CaptivatingBy John and Stasi ElderegdeCaptivating is set around the premise every little girl asks the questions, \\"Am I lovely? Am I beautiful? Am I captivating?\\" Throughout life we go on with the daily grind but deep inside our hearts we are still asking ourselves these questions and looking to external things to answer them. Captivating explains how God places these desires into our hearts and how \`looking time' can help answer the questions and what it takes to become truly captivating.John and Stasi Elderidge talk candidly about how we all can easily fall into a fantasy world of the way we think things should be. When our lives don't play out the way we thought they should many women escape to mindless movies, romance novels, food, or whatever else brings comfort. What many of us miss is how all our struggles and longings stem from the fall of Adam and Eve.As the pages are turned, Captivating doesn't promise if you do A and B you'll get C but explains how we are beautiful because we are made by Christ and everyone's shortcomings stem from the fall of man. The chapters are filled with thought-provoking questions of where we stand in certain areas followed by a prayer asking God to help us turn to Him and away from the lies we have believed.I first heard of this book a few years ago when it was newly published. Friends of mine had talked about being captivated by it just as the title says. So that's exactly what I expected - to be drawn in and unable to put the book down by the way it explains the questions all women ask. I wasn't as captivated by this book as I thought I would be, possibly because all had I heard previously about it. However I do think there are many good points scattered throughout the pages, they just seemed hard to find. It is definitely a book to read when you want to sit down, really digest each chapter and ask yourself tough questions."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I recently received a copy of the revised and expanded edition of Captivating by John and Stasi Eldredge from BookSneeze, a program that provides bloggers with free books in exchange for honest reviews.New York Times bestseller Captivating aims to unveil the mystery of a woman's soul and is to women what its predecessor, the bestselling Wild at Heart, was to men. The description on the back cover of the book begins like this: \\"Every woman was once a little girl. And every little girl holds in her heart her most precious dreams. She longs to be swept up into a romance, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, to be the beauty of the story. Those desires are far more than child's play. They are the secret to the feminine heart.\\"Never having read the original, I cannot comment on what has been revised and expanded. However, I can give my review of this particular edition, which I thought was wonderful. Throughout the book, John and Stasi Eldredge give examples of why and how women may have pushed their childhood dreams aside. With stunning insight, they map out the all-too-common road of a modern woman's life and show that just because those dreams have been pushed aside, does not mean we can't find our way again. The path, of course, is through Jesus Christ.Although the book can be a little \\"cheesy\\" at times, it will certainly awaken the heart of any female reader to her own longings and desires to be the beauty, even if they are long forgotten. Men who read this book will gain a whole new perspective on the women in their lives, and I would certainly recommend it to any man struggling to win a woman's heart. I definitely plan on giving this a second read, and I hope other readers find this book to be as inspiring as I have."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Captivating is a book that sets out to liberate the inner desires of a woman's heart through the affirmation of scripture and faith. It offers an affirming take on the lives and hearts of women and shows that we, as women, are exactly what God wanted us to be.Like many others, I found this book to be uplifting. It's one of those books that, if you open yourself up to it, hits a chord somewhere deep inside of your soul. It allows you to realize that there is no set mold for who and what you need to be as a woman. That mold is cast by society, not by God. God made women beautiful and all those societal standards of what you should or should not do as a woman are surface deep at best."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I purchased this book while looking for another Christian artist online. I now know that God wanted me to find it because it addresses issues that I am going through and the Lord's timing is always perfect. It amazingly breaks down our relationship with Christ to the bare minimum in a way that could bring nothing but healing. The sporatic input from John in this conversation about women is very helpful. Chapter six was for me like being in a counseling session and laying bare all my hurt and pain which is something I believe I have been avoiding, but we know healing cannot begin without. I stongly recommend this book to any woman who is struggling with a wounded heart and wants to heal it not through the empty offerings of the world but through the one who loves us purely and stands ready to restore."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"i have read this book before but it was awhile go. still it is amazing and doesn't disappoint. it really does show you a great amount of insight towards a woman. and how we can relate to each other and to God.sometimes we as women do not view ourselves as worthy of anything but this book shows that we need to stop thinking that way. it is an amazing read and i hope everyone will read it."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I tend to avoid books when they are on the bestseller list; it's kind of a reverse snobbishness, I guess. So I avoided Captivating the first time around, despite the fact that I'd read The Sacred Romance (by John Eldredge and Brent Curtis) and loved it, and despite the personal recommendations I received.I can't, thus, tell you much about how this revised-and-expanded version is better than the original. But I can tell you that, if you are a woman this is a book worth reading. Not if-you-are-a-woman-and-a-Christian, just: if you are a woman.Why? Not that the Christian thing doesn't matter, but that every woman struggles on some level with the issues that the Eldredges talk about. Their philosophy and, yes, their solutions are Biblically based; for non-Christian women, I can understand that might be a turn-off. But I urge you anyway: stride through the Scripture quotations and sit still for the stories and the truths that aren't tied up in church-speak.And for Christian women, this book can help you step out of the easy answers so often given via church-speak and deal with the hurts it's quite possible to hide but impossible to truly forget.The heart of this book is about remembering, about dealing with the lies that tell us to forget-about-it, quit-making-things-such-a-big-deal. This book helps us to understand why some things are a big deal, and should be, and how we need to look at them and find out what they're telling us. As we acknowledge, and remember who we really are, we can let go not in self-denial or resentment, but in true freedom.That's a good read."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"THIS IS AN AWESOME BOOK!

Though written to women, this book revealed to me fundamental designs which God uses to reveal Himself uniquely to and through women, and glean insights into how I as a man and husband can demonstrate Christlikeness to my wife.There were some presumptions by the Eldridges that all women have been significantly wounded in their parental relationships, which has not been the experience of my fiance nor myself; however, all have been wounded by the effects of sin, and this book is insightful, practical, and unafraid to confront the fears and woundings which seem so often to hinder women from sharing their true beauty with the world.I would recommend this as a great book for reading and discussion by both men and women in deep relationships such as marriage or engagement."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"Personally i am going to get a copy for my sister, mom, girlfriend, and girlfriends mom. and for all guys who would like to understand what is so Beautiful about certain woman this is just as good as \\"Wild at heart\\" in a feminine way."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"...if you read this book. It was a beautiful book and yes some of it made me really question the meaning of what the authors were trying to say or just plain uncomfortable but I chose to seek Him in prayer when I felt uncertain while reading this book. By doing so I found that this book and the meanings- the message I got out of it was amazing and enlightening- no not Jesus as weak or a \\"lover\\" in that way...none of that stuck. I got a message of love, comfort and that we are special to God and Jesus as in we are not \\"an afterthought\\". Yes I was somehow lead to believe that woman's creation was more for Adam's whim and pleasure then as an important role for Christ as one- man and woman as one in their roles but bringing different characteristics- man and woman are different. This book helped me to see this and since that women do have special roles as the companion of man as one- both for Christ. I do not chose to trust just any word written or otherwise with out first consulting Jesus, to ask for clarity- something everyone should learn. To much is wrongly construed and wrongly \\"translated\\" in this world. The only voice who can guide your search is Christ's! Last, I have to say that I saw on other reviews that the \\"heart\\" kept coming up. Our hearts are sinful yes but we are told to guard them in scripture over and over. The heart is referred to so very much in scripture it would do some good for people to look at this and meditate with Jesus on our hearts role! Because of so many bad messages out there you can trust only Jesus to show you the right one. I say the book is great and the message I got from it was so wonderful but I put Jesus in charge of \\"translating\\" it for me...not everyone else's reviews on here or anywhere else!

This book is the complement for women to understand their intended femininity. Complement is a just description as these books together reveal the theological view of complementarianism that implies different roles and responsibilities bestowed unto women and men by God. Therefore, if you have already solidified your views in egalitarianism, this may be offsetting for you. Regardless, you should definitely read it because you will undoubtedly find it amazing, and it will truly help heal a great number of women."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I was ready for this book.ready to grow spiritualy, emotionally.

For us, it is disturbing that Christians are eager to jump on the historical bandwagon of spiritualizing patriarchy. In reality, almost all the so-called \\"natural\\" characteristics of women and men are socially developed over time. It wasn't too long ago that Christians twisted God's message found in the Bible to justify slavery and racism as well. I encourage Christian readers to delve into history and see how much adventure, leadership, and agency women have had in early centuries of the faith and throughout history, as well as how institutionalized Christianity conformed to Roman society's fervent patriarchy, just as it seems to do today. Why is John and Stasi Eldridge's and many others' message of Christian patriarchy so seductive? For many men, it is comforting to hear that they deserve, by divine decree, the priviledges and authority society has granted them. For many women, it is comforting to hear that they can cease struggling and succumb to the existing patriarchy around them (even and especially if this is a benevolent, Christian patriarchy). I admit I'm being harsh in my treatment of this book, and I concede that the chapter on recovery from traumas such as sexual abuse is moving. However, the main argument that men and women are spiritually different in their needs, capabilities, and destinies contradicts history, science, the world around us, and above all, Jesus' life and teachings."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"After reading some of the reviews I'm a little saddened by this.

First of all, the Elderedges make many generalizations. They seem to think that every other woman has the same problems that they have had.Secondly, on page six, they talk about Proverbs 31. They disagree with this passage, claiming that women are not failures. 2Corinthians 5:17 clearly says that we are all failures.They use many movies as examples, rather than looking to the scriptures.The Elderedges constantly refer to the book Song of Songs, taking it completely out of context. It was written by Solomon to his maiden, and the Eldgedges use it as God speaking to women.They confuse Biblical love with romance.They make many claims such as \\"For the root of all holiness is romance\\" without any \\"proof\\", probably because that is not a true statement.They assume the desires of women are good. No one's desires are good, and it's wrong to make that assumption.The book makes God out as a lover, rather than a holy creator, which is wrong and perverse to think. It is so misleading, and is really dangerous for all of the women out there who are reading this book. As Christian women, we should think of ourselves as nothing, and humble ourselves, not have a self-inflated view of ourselves because of our sex as the Eldgedges encourage. The heresy presented in this book is ridiculous."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"This is a great book.

Some of my friends have really enjoyed it, but I don't think this book is for everyone.What turned me off to it was the writing style, the redundancy, lack of depth, and misused bible references.Chapter 7 starts off asking us to picure our favorite love story/movie and put yourself in the girl's position and God as the guy. She used quotes from Song of Solomon throughout the chapter to illustrate our relationship with God. I just thought she wasn't careful enough. I think it's important to have a loving relationship with God, but should we really think of him as a lover? It just has implications that need to be qualified. Also, Song of Solomon is a book in the Bible that's about a real, literal man and woman's relationship as it progresses from the start to marriage and sex. Should we really use that book to talk about our relationship with God?Ultimately, the 3 main ideas of what women desire (to be romanced, to play a role in her own adventure, and to display beauty) are right on and should be embraced by women. I just don't think this book provided much more substance beyond those thoughts."},{"Title":"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul","review":"I'm only 1/2 through this book and have already decided from the time I finished the 2nd chapter that this is my favorite book.

But for what it's worth, the sequel (or second half) ofThe Jungle Bookis better than its predecessor.The first book contained seven stories and a collection of poems, only three of which concerned Kipling's most famous literary creation: Mowgli, the feral child raised by wolves and learned in the ways of the Jungle Law. The second book comprises eight stories, five of which center on the adventures of Mowgli and his animal companions, as well as three unconnected short stories and the usual collection of poems.\\"The Miracle of Purun Bhagat\\" is a beautiful, haunting story about an Indian Prime Minister who gives up his career and lifestyle in order to become a holy man on the outskirts of a remote mountain village. This decision is not treated as a big deal within the narrative, for: \\"India is the one place in the world where a man can do as he pleases and nobody asks why; and the fact that Sir Purun Dass had resigned position, palace, and power, and taken up the begging bowl and ochre-coloured dress of a holy man, was considered nothing extraordinary.\\"Once established within the small hillside shrine, Purun partakes in deep mediation in an attempt to grasp the fundamentals of life and the universe, but it's not until the small village is threatened by a landslide that the long-awaited miracle of the title is performed.\\"The Undertakers\\" is very much like the first Jungle Book's \\"Her Majesty's Servants\\" in that the story is essentially the private conversation that takes place between several animals: in this case, a jackal, an adjutant bird, and a crocodile. Focusing on their bad reputations as predators/scavengers, and touching briefly on the Mutiny, this story (much like its predecessor in the first book) probably won't be popular with young readers.\\"Quiquern\\" is to the second Jungle Book what \\"The White Seal\\" was to the first: a story that has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with either India or the jungle, and so ends up feeling completely random and out of place. However, that's not to say that it's *bad*. Concerning an Inuit family living in the Arctic Circle, Kipling provides a harrowing portrayal of the very real struggle for survival that goes on in the winter months, as well as describing the stark beauty and mystery of the northern lands. When the food supplies in his village run low, young Kotuko follows a vision of the spirit Quiquern in a last desperate attempt to find sustenance for his people. Why it's part of an anthology called \\"The Jungle Book\\" is anyone's guess, but it's a haunting story told so vividly that you're likely to feel cold whilst reading it.But it's the story of Mowgli that most readers will pick up the book for, and some of his best adventures are to be found here. They include \\"How Fear Came,\\" which can be easily likened to one of Aesop's fables in the way Mowgli learns how fear was born amongst the animals of the jungle, as well as how the tiger got his stripes and the origins of the Water Truce that exists in times of drought, allowing animals of all kinds to drink without fear at the available waterholes.This is followed by \\"Letting in the Jungle,\\" in which we see a much darker side to Mowgli when he instructs the jungle animals to destroy the man-village after the life of his human foster-mother is threatened, and \\"The King Ankus\\" in which he returns to the ruined city in the midst of the jungle and finds a hidden treasure guarded by a half-mad white cobra. He takes a jeweled elephant ankus with him, though is warned that it will bring only death - and sure enough, Mowgli witnesses the destruction that it generates when it is stolen by a group of hunters.In \\"Red Dog\\" Mowgli allies himself with his old friend Kaa the python in order to rid the jungle of a pack of vicious wild dogs, and together they concoct a clever scheme involving a gorge full of beehives, a swift-flowing river, and the strength of the wolf pack. Finally, in the poignant \\"The Spring Running,\\" Mowgli finds himself struck by a strange melancholy that he can find no solution to - at least not until he revisits the man-village. Perhaps it's finally time for him to return to the man-pack...?In his other books, I've sometimes found Kipling's prose a little dry and meandering; here it is deep and rich and beautiful. It's a shame that theDisney filmis usually considered the \\"quintessential\\" version of this tale, for there is so much to be found and valued in the original text. Many of the characters are profoundly different - Kaa is not a villain with hypnotic powers, but a wise-yet-uncanny friend - and concepts such as the Jungle Law and the Water Truce are explored in further depth. Of course, there will always be debate surrounding Kipling's politics and views on race (the presence of white colonists in India is far more pronounced in the sequel) but as a collection of well-told tales, \\"The Jungle Book\\" (and its sequel) makes for quality reading."},{"Title":"The second jungle book","review":"i think the story of mowgli is one of the most original tales everthe concept of animals adopting a human has probably been copied alotbut this book is one of my favesit has alot of life lessons in aswell especially if you compare the law of the jungle with themankinds lawsi enjoyed all the storys however mowglis story stands out as my personal favoritemy only critism is some of the wording was a bit abstract for mebut at the same time i really liked the archaic languagei still enjoyed this book a great deal"},{"Title":"The second jungle book","review":"It's rare that a sequel actually exceeds the work that inspired it, but the Second Jungle Book really exceeds all expectations. Everything is better from the ending to the eskimo story. It's interesting how both jungle books have a story set in a frozen climate, but it does provide a nice break from the jungle.Now the ending of the Second Jungle Book actually features Mowgli and centralizes him as a character. The ending of the first Jungle Book is just a war discussion between four animals that's actually pretty hilarious.Although if I had to choose I'd probably rank the Life of Pi higher than the two Jungle Books, I find them to be both amazing works. And unlike the Life of Pi you don't really have to read the Jungle Book chapters in order if you don't want to. (I think one of the stories in the first book is deliberately out of sequence.)I'd have to call Walt Disney's adaptation of the Jungle Book his biggest miss. The movie is FAR inferior to Kipling's collection of stories (but I think his stories are more for grown-ups anyway). Of course, after someone finishes something as grand as Mary Poppins you have to give them a break. Good old Walt.Anyhow, if you don't trust my review enough to read all of the Second Jungle Book, at least go to the library and read the Quiquern chapter. Trust me, it's great."},{"Title":"The second jungle book","review":"The second jungle book has a Mowgli that is getting older, and beginning to interact with other humans, not always in a good way.

The book contains many tales. The first is how Mowgli the boy brought up by wolves learns, as a child, about the laws of the jungle, especially about how animals should act when bad weather makes food and water to be scarce. He also learns how the Elephant, the king of the jungle, understands how the jungle first began to be. The second story is about an accomplished Indian who rises to the top government position and gives it up to become a wandering beggar. He ends up on a mountain, treated well by animals, who warn him of an earthquake. He, in turn, alerts humans who build a Temple for him and consider him a holy man.The third tale picks up the Mowgli story from the first book. Mowgli has returned to the jungle after a three month stay among humans, including his natural father and mother. The village people think he is a devil because of his unusual behavior and consider his parents the father and mother of a devil, who they decide to kill. Mowgli rescues them and arranges for the jungle animals to protect them as they escape the superstitious villagers.This story is followed by one about a jackal and an adjutant, then there is another tale about Mowgli and snakes and killing, then another story not about Mowgli. This is followed by a story of a happy period in Mowgli's life. The jungle beings are afraid of him. Father and mother wolf have died and his friends among the animals are old. But those who are alive enjoy life. But then animals come and disturb the peace. This tale is followed by one when Mowgli is seventeen years old. He is now respected not only for his wit but also for his strength. This last story ends with a tearful parting when Mowgli decides to leave the jungle and go again to live among people."},{"Title":"The second jungle book","review":"Don't know how I got to 38 without reading 'The Jungle Book' and 'The Second Jungle Book'.Small complaint: this version does not have Kipling's poems, just the prose."},{"Title":"The second jungle book","review":"It had less stories about Mowgli and some were so confusing, I didn't even understand them.

He says, &quot;I'm not empty, I'm open.&quot; It's through his vulnerable, participatory wandering that Transtromer finds lucidity. Transtromer is always looking for the hub, the center, the reference point in life. He tells us that we live as people of multiplicity, anonymous and uncertain. As Protean men and women, we find no solid identities. &quot;Proteus...can't write his own name. He draws back from that terrified, as the wolf from the silver bullet.&quot; The Protean human, attempting to establish meaning without being tied down, experiences at once an invasive reality and a distressing invisibility. Transtromer expresses this bittersweetly: &quot;I who love to stray off and vanish in the crowd, a capital T in the mass of endless text.&quot; In these essentially lonely poems, Transtromer tells the story of a crowd of people sitting in a stalled train, staring out the windows pointlessly,until a train-man strikes just the right wheel with his hammer. Immediately, &quot;the ringing swells incomprehensibly: a thunderclap,/ a cathedral-bells-sound, a world-circumnavigating sound,/ that lifts the whole train...Everyone is singing!&quot; All it takes is stopping long enough to listen with reverence in order to &quot;Proceed!&quot; like the liberated train. Transtromer is not always suffering from invisibility or assaulted by the &quot;murmuring masses.&quot; One day, walking, he finds that &quot;The street's massive life whirls around me;/ it remembers and desires nothing...It seems to me that the street can see me...for a second I am lit. It sees me.&quot; Transtromer's life, and the readers' lives, may be &quot;impregnated with four times joy and three times sorrow&quot;, but &quot;By stealth we milked the cosmos and survived.&quot; There is, ultimately, a great sensuous and religious music to Transtromer's poetry that seeps into the reader's soul like a deep and long cello note, lifted on a light wind"},{"Title":"Tomas Transtromer - Selected Poems 1954-1986","review":"These poems which are so highly admired and for which Tomas Transtromer was given the Nobel Prize are poems of the single consciousness , the man alone. They lack any real sense of the personal 'other' of humanity consisting of real individuals. They are poems of solitude, of sensitivity in perception and originality in reflection. The list of their translators here Robert Bly, Robin Fulton, May Swenson, Samuel Charters, John F. Deane, Joanna Bankier, Eric Sellin is a list of those dedicated to and devoting much time and effort to a poet they clearly believe to be a great one. Still I in my reading was not able to hear the kind of music I hear in most musical poets, Shakespeare, Keats, Blake, Wallace Stevens, Hopkins, Dylan Thomas.Instead there is much rich simile and startling imagery, complications of perception feeling and thought. But this kind of originality so pervades the work that I had difficulty reading any plain sense paraphrase in it. In fact I found myself reading and rereading without knowing what is going on.I suppose though it is above all for the startling imagery that Transtomer is valued.Here is an relatively simple example of a Transtomer poem which I believe well illustrates his startling origina imagery, his leaping transitions, the puzzling and at times mystifying feeling his poetry gives.WEATHER PICTUREThe October sea glistens coldlywith its dorsal fin of mirages.Nothing is left that remembersthe white dizziness of yacht races.Theambler glow over the villageand all sounds in slow flight.A dog's barking is a hieroglyppainted in the air above the gardenwhere the yellow fruit outwitsthe tree and drops of its own accord.."},{"Title":"Tomas Transtromer - Selected Poems 1954-1986","review":"Swedish poet, recommended to my by my wife who is Swedish.A wonderful poet.

He is not afraid of laying his nerve endings on the line."},{"Title":"OSS Essentials: Support System Solutions for Service Providers","review":"This could have been *the* definitive reference on operational support systems. The author's uneven treatment of the subject and tendency to frequently go off topic or emphasize peripheral systems while leaving large gaps in the main subject have reduced this book to merely mediocre.The strong points: the chapter on customer care and billing processes is remarkable. Here is a list of things that caught my attention and make this chapter so valuable: (1) the customer care maturity model is well thought out and serves as an excellent benchmarking tool, (2) the customer analysis and acquisition is on the mark, and (3) the customer interface management process and associated diagram comprise an excellent model for OSS processes. I also thought the way the author covered the problem handling process represents best practices, as does the section on SLA management. This is the stuff OSS is made of and it's covered both well and contains ideas and models in which service providers will be interested. The chapter provisioning and order processing is also strong and filled with excellent information for those who are seeking OSS-specific knowledge.Weaknesses: Not only does this book overemphasize the network operations, which is important, but not central, but the author manages to drop this information into unexpected areas throughout the book. An example: Section 4.4 is an engrossing piece on the sales process that is succinct and filled with information, including tables and a diagram that reinforce the excellent information the author is imparting. Right in the middle of all this is a diagram that shows the use of a DMZ to separate intranets and extranets - not something anyone interested in sales processes cares about and is a big distraction. This happens throughout the book. Also, I agree with the comments made by a previous reviewer about wasting page count on product-specific information. This information needs to be moved to a web site where it can be maintained in an up-to-date fashion. Ironically, the publisher does this for other books. Finally, there are some major gaps: (1) no mention of the TeleManagement Forum, which is a global non-profit organization that is devoted to OSS. This organization has a technology integration map and numerous OSS-related processes that are De Facto standards in the OSS world, yet no mention of the organization and no mention of the wealth of material available that is directly related to OSS. (2) Section 7.4, which addresses migration from an existing to new billing system, misses some key considerations, which could have been developed into a discussion of strengths and weaknesses. For example, how do you segment and migrate subscribers? By CSA? Bill cycle? Region? Price plan? As the industry consolidates this particular issue keeps cropping up and a more in-depth treatment here is warranted. (3) No mention of TL 9000, which is an encompassing quality standard for telecommunications service providers. A portion of this standard applies directly to OSS.Overall, this book contains some of the best information about OSS that has been collected and compiled into a single book. In fact, it's the only book on the subject. What is needed to make it great is a strong editor who understands OSS and who is not reticent about removing large pieces of superfluous material from this book. More information about standards that are directly related to OSS should also be included. If you work with operational support systems you really have no choice but to buy this book - I just hope that the next edition addresses the weaknesses."},{"Title":"OSS Essentials: Support System Solutions for Service Providers","review":"This book assumes that the reader has already had a basic grasp of technology and protocols on which OSS systems are based and therefore is somewhat technicality-inclined from the perspective of an average reader who simply wants to understand OSS in plain English. The basic structure is pretty good, however, it will definitely help sell itself if it could be written from a totally layman's angle."},{"Title":"OSS Essentials: Support System Solutions for Service Providers","review":"The eight chapters in this 610 page book tie together operational support systems and how they relate to network operations, business support systems and network management. In some respects this book is less about OSS than it is about the network, which is evidenced by the structure of the book and page count given to each topic.It starts with an encompassing overview of operations, business and marketing support systems. This is entirely focused on OSS, and has one of the best descriptions of a service delivery cycle I've seen in print. This is followed by a chapter discussing a service provider's portfolio of products and services, which sets the context for OSS. Chapter 3, however, seems out of sequence, because it breaks the flow by addressing management protocols - a topic that is peripherally related to OSS, but is not central. The author gets back on track in chapter 4 with a solid, information-packed treatment of customer care and billing processes. Thi!s is the heart of OSS and the author provides some great information, which is continued in chapter 5's discussion of provisioning and order processing. Unfortunately, the author drifts off into network operations management, which is the topic of chapter 6. This is certainly related to OSS, but does not warrant the 74 pages this topic consumes. Chapter 7, covering support, documentation and management systems is really a catalog of products, which eats another 104 pages of peripherally related material that could have better been provided on a companion web site since product-specific information is a moving target and only renders a book prematurely obsolete. The final two chapters covering workforce management and trends for service providers were valuable, especially the comprehensive tables and lists devoted to job profiles and organizational structures.Overall this book has a lot of excellent information, most of which is not available elsewhere. However, the aut!hor wanders and drifts into too much detail on topics that are not central to the theme of this book. Since it is the only book on the market on OSS and does provide a wealth of information I decided to be lenient and award it 4 stars. I hope the next edition benefits from some good editing and focuses on OSS, and the product-specific information is moved to a companion web site the way other publishers handle this time sensitive material."},{"Title":"OSS Essentials: Support System Solutions for Service Providers","review":"It's the only public published book on BSS/OSS industry i can find.

Shades of Teddy Roosevelt.Whether it was progressivism or socialism Norbeck certainly promoted things like rural credit programs, a state coal mine and cement plant (the latter lasting for three-quarters of a century) while his sponsorship of good roads, railways free text book schemes, assistance to war veterans, grain-marketing acts are all detailed.Given all this it is perhaps not surprising that Norbeck was one of the few GOP survivors in the era of FDR and the New Deal. Fite describes vividly the tensions in Republican ranks in SD between the prairie populist and conservatives in the leadup to the 1932 watershed election that obviously pointed to the end of Republican rule, under the impact of the Great Depression.After an easy primary win Norbeck was returned for a third term when he beat his Democratic rival by 26,000 votes, despite the fact that in the presidential contest FDR carried the state by 84,000 votes. By the 1936 election the ailing SD Republican senator was positively endorsing FDR against GOP challenger Alf Landon!Like the earlier Roosevelt (TR), Norbeck was also a great conservationist and as Fite points out Mt Rusmore, Custer State Park, the Badlands National Park, the Migratory Bird Act are all testimonials to his efforts as both a state and federal legislator. Norbeck's wish, \\"I would rather be remembered as an artist than as US senator,\\" would certainly earn favour with all those, (including this Australian reviewer), who have travelled along the aesthetically pleasing Needles Highway in the Black Hills,as part of the Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway, artistic proof of his insistence for the road to blend in with the environment rather than disturb the beauty of this wonderful area.Norbeck's capacity to understand the importance of harmonising roads and tourism with the environment has helped make the Mount Rushmore and Black Hills area such an enduring attraction.As an agricultural historian and a native of South Dakota, Professor Fite, is clearly at home with his subject and his works have continually survived the test of time. The re-publication of this fine biography is long overdue and hopefully it will be well received by American readers and, like his 'Mount Rushmore,' is well worth reading by anyone with a passion for western or Great Plains history.On a personal note I wish the author, now in Florida, a long and healthy retirement and thank him for his contribution to making South Dakotan and American history such a pleasurable experience to the reader.FOOTNOTE: Professor Fite passed away on 13 July 2010. He was 92. I regret not having the chance to meet him face-to-face, something he invited me to do if I made it back to the USA."},{"Title":"Peter Norbeck: prairie statesman (The University of Missouri studies)","review":"Was thrilled to find it available.

Beautifully drawn by Aaron Lopresti and Randy Emberlin the scenes pop from the pages in almost fluid like form. The storyline is gripping to say the least and as always proves to be right inline with the dangerously fun TOS format created by Gene Roddenberry. All characters are true to form and drawn spot on. Their demeanors carry well throughout the issue and all reactions are true to what we have come to know from the Original Series.Captain Kirk, Spock and Dr. McCoy carry the majority of the storyline as they endeavour to solve the perplexing science behind one of Spock's old classmates new invention. Wrapped in mythology, extreme science and personal hatred the tale explodes in amazing action involving every major character as they struggle to counter the danger presented by this egotistical and mercurial scientist aided by evil itself.A grand tale that is sure to be worth the investment. You would be wise to pick this one up.ALL FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED. THANKS AND GOOD READING."},{"Title":"The immortal dinner: A famous evening of genius & laughter in literary London, 1817","review":"On 28 December 1817, London painter Benjamin Robert Haydon gave a dinner party that he meticulously recounted in his journal. He called it &quot;The Immortal Dinner&quot; because the guest list, tone of conversation, wit and good time had by all fulfilled his vision of a good life lived at the forefront of high culture. The title could have lived on as a conceit in a footnote, except for Penelope Hughes-Hallet's resurrection of it and the event as a lens through which to view close-up the lifestyle, major players, watershed historical events and zeigeist of the era. This is an original approach to this kind of history, and while it does not necessarily reveal any startlingly new information, it refreshes it, making it vivid and accessible. Hughes-Hallet has a way with ordering her information, as well as a fluent writing style, and the result is a very enjoyable read. Haydon is a memorable character, a person of some talent and vision, whose ego, bad timing and money management woes blunted so many would-be successes. While he made enemies, he also made good friends, and his dinner companions included John Keats, Charles Lamb and William Wordsworth. Though all the characters are well developed, it is Wordsworth who quietly forms a keystone, much as he did in the quintet of major Romantic poets, throughout the book, the elder statesman who long outlives them all. I wish this had been around when I was taking British Romantic Lit in college; it would have made excellent sidebar reading."},{"Title":"The immortal dinner: A famous evening of genius & laughter in literary London, 1817","review":"The Immortal Dinner was an entertaining and yet informative read. A broad reaching expose of the personalities who attended \\"The Immortal Dinner\\", we get to meet them before and after the event, as well as various asides with other important people of the day. I had no idea that Charles Lamb was so interesting- I feel compelled to find other material on him alone. It is obvious that the author felt a strong connection to these men, and attempted to undo some perceptions that posterity has left us. Keats described as \\"athletic...extraordinarily broad shouldered...Delphian priestess..\\" Huh. Haydon's self absorbed certainty of immortality due to his painting of Christ's entry into Jerusalem was sadly unrealized, made more profound by having the enormous work loom over the guests during the famed dinner. A thoroughly researched and enjoyable account. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The immortal dinner: A famous evening of genius & laughter in literary London, 1817","review":"Congratulations to Penelope Hughes-Hallett for coming up with a novel way to put together a book of historical subjects and reference--by narrowing her focus to one particular dinner, and the people who came to it, she can actually find more insight and give us a broader picture of her multiple subjects than if her canvas, like one of Haydon's, was big across as the River Thames. Haydon emerges as a provocative, vain, loveable and talented man with an incorrigbly high opinion of himself, a sort of rogue, but a heroic Englishman in the best sense. As other reviewers have noted, William Wordsworth--not usually a sparkplug of fun or dynamism--comes off terrifically well, perhaps he was a man at his best with a tableful of male peers and far away from the women who perplexed him so. I hope other cultural historians pick up on Hughes-Hallett's &quot;meal&quot; method and soon, perhaps, we will have an &quot;Immortal Lunch&quot; or &quot;Breakfast&quot; too."},{"Title":"The immortal dinner: A famous evening of genius & laughter in literary London, 1817","review":"The Immortal Dinner: A Famous Evening Of Genius And Laughter In Literary London, 1817 by British author Penelope Hughes-Hallett is a superbly crafted rendition of a legendary dinner party hosted in 1817 by painter B.

The Immortal Dinner successfully captures the spirit of that memorable evening, as well as the witty conversation, sober insights, and jocular banter that was exchanged about the topics of the day, in a party to remember.

At the same time, he has created a book with an extremely small number of words (almost all of one syllable) and maximum amount of repetition to make memorizing and learning to read the book as simple as possible.A handsome blue-eyed boy begins,&quot;EyeEyesMy eyesMy eyes&quot;He then points to a pink-eyed, friendly-looking rabbit, and says,&quot;His eyesHis eyes&quot;With a picture of the boy winking, the boy says,&quot;Wink eyeWink eye&quot;With a picture of the rabbit, the boy says,&quot;Pink eyePink eye&quot;Then you move into the concept of what vision is -- seeing and being seen.&quot;My eyes see.His eyes see.I see him.And he sees me.&quot;The connection between humans and animals is nicely built from there. This will help your child to understand that we have many things in common with animals. Knowing that can lead to lots of empathic play and developing a more sensitive adult. Be prepared for your child to want a pet rabbit, though.The book then uses the idea of seeing to add simple words, along with their images in order to help with word decoding. The words introduced include blue, red, bird, bed, sun, moon, fork, knife, spoon, girl, man, boy, horse, tin can, holes, poles, trees, clocks, bees, rocks, flies, ants, pink, underpants, rings, strings, rain, pie, dogs, and airplanes.&quot;Hooray for eyes!&quot;You can also use this book to establish an interest in flash cards. After reading the book, you can use some flash cards that combine a picture with the letters. Based on my experience with children learning to read, you can accelerate progress quite a lot of you can develop such a diving board for being interested in flash cards for vocabulary. Try to find some with colorful illustrations!The illustrations emphasize large heads and enormous eyes of the sort that I associate with the Walt Disney cartoon drawings of Alice in Wonderland. Everything seems simple, young, and childlike which will make the book more accessible to your child.After you both have the book memorized, I suggest that you play games while riding in the car to identify animals and the color eyes they have. This will help make your child more observant, which is helpful for reading development as well.See the potential all around you . . . and be aware that you are being looked at too! What can be seen about you?"},{"Title":"The eye book, (A Bright & early book, BE 2)","review":"This book is a great way to get young children interested in reading. The sentences are short. &quot;My eyes My Eyes, His eyes His eyes&quot; is just an example of the text. The book helps to identify the names of basic items, like trees or aminals. However, I like the 1968 version of The Eye Book better. The text is the same, but the illustrations are not so modernized. They are classic Seuss. The 1968 version is authored by Theo. LeSieg (Ted Geisel backwards!). Either version is a welcome addition to any Dr. Seuss collection."},{"Title":"The eye book, (A Bright & early book, BE 2)","review":"At first, I didn't think this book would be a real winner with my little one. But you just never know, huh? This \\"Eye\\" book, written by Dr. Seuss, is read nightly, with all the funny things that eyes can do and see, it proves to be quite interesting. The pink underpants definitely brings some giggles too! It's a pretty short book, one that can be easily memorized by toddlers. The book takes you on a tour of the various things that you can see with your eyes. The boy and the rabbit do everything from looking down holes to looking at the moon. It's quite cute but very basic so if you're looking for something for an older child, I'd pass on this one.

It's very easy reading. After my grandaughter checked it out three times in a row at the school libarary I jumped on the chance to buy it.I've heard the story many many times: \\"my eye your eye\\"...and with each reading my grandaughter was learning how to recoginize these simple words, and now she can spell & write every word in this book!"},{"Title":"The eye book, (A Bright & early book, BE 2)","review":"The thing I like best about this book is that the words and the pictures go together nicely. When the words say \\"Our eyes see bees,\\" there is a picture of a lot of bees. So, from an educational perspective, you can have your child point to a picture while he or she hears the verbal description of the picture. It's helped my baby lean several words and phrases.This simple concept is something that a suprising amount of childrens' books lack. It is good for two reasons. It helps them put words to pictures, and it helps them learn to read. The book is for children that are 4-8, but it's ability to help children match the verbal sounds of words to pictures makes it appropriate for infants as well.The learning potential of the book is enhanced by the rythm of the words. The book's sentences ryme and procede in a rythm that makes the book more enjoyable for your child.

I thought the pink underpants was a little strange, but they're just kids afterall!I'm a little surprised that I didn't notice anyone else had harped on its beautiful cover.

I believe when the child finds that they can participate in the reading of a book it really increases their interest in reading. I love this book because most of the words are easy everyday ones which we use frequently (even though we may not realise it).

Oh the wonderful sights the little boy and his pink rabbit see with their big, buggy eyes. And the inevitable 'hooray, hooray, hooray for EYES' ending continues to captivate my busy little boy who takes this book to his favorite spot when he needs to be quiet for a while.

Her more recent novels, such as Tall, Dark, and Deadly were a fun mix of romance and suspense. That's what I expected when I picked this book up. Instead, I found three formulaic love stories. The so-called suspense in each was hardly worth it. The chemistry between the couples was nearly non-existent. Out of the three stories, the best was the middle one, starring Wendy Hawk and Brad McKenna. Though the plot was predictable, (of course he was going to fit in to her world and of course his love would make her forgether dead husband) it was the best of the three. The connection between the characters (they all come back in Borrowed Angel, the last of the tales) is cute- it is sometimes nice to catch up with old characters. All in all, not terrible as a diversion, but not the best romance novel around."},{"Title":"Night Heat","review":"Night Heat is three complete novels in one book. I love it when author do this. I would never have paid for all three books separately. The first and third stories were great and I enjoyed them greatly. I was a little disappointed in the second one.

Not about design, or the elements of design, or how various design elements might be used either separately or in conjunction to evoke feelings or images.The book is broken into sections, one for each design element such as color, texture, etc. The first page of each section is a very general description of that design element. This is then followed by 15 pages or so of full-page pictures highlighting that design element. Looking at 15 pages of colorful objects or highly textured objects may be mildly interesting but it isn't terribly informative or useful.This book may be marginally adequate if you just want to flip through the pictures looking for inspiration. But the pictures are largely mediocre and too few to really exhaust the topics at hand so it isn't even terribly useful as inspiration.

This text is an elegant commentary on the ideals that the Romantics held dear, such as the authenticity of a life close to the earth, the superiority of existence outside of common society rather than within it, and our innate ability, with enough well-directed effort, to transcend our own humanity. Like a breath of fresh air after Wordsworth, Thoreau, Keats, and both Shelleys, Hawthorne's cynicism and pessimism on these topics shine clearly through this work. Though admittedly he has failed in his announced effort to make the text cheerful and lighthearted, this is not such a complete failure as one may initially suppose, when this novel is contrasted with his others. Much of the humor that is in the book is centered around the narrator, Coverdale, whose nature forces him to fit in with his surroundings in a way which is a bit askew, precipitating enjoyable scenes which the reader can appreciate, if he or she has refrained from judging this main character. The treasure in this book, however, is not mainly in its humor, but rather (for me at least - each person presumably takes from it something different) in the elegance with which so many universal truths are exposed (often only partially, so that the reader can feel a sense of triumph when they wholly uncover them) to our conscious awareness. As you have no doubt already surmised, I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"The Blithedale Romance is a somewhat dark, depressing tale of idealism gone awry and of friendship and love torn asunder by private ambitions. The romance of these pages is not what many modern readers may expect to find here; there is no penultimate consummation of love among these characters, nor is there much happiness indeed to be discerned from the complexity of their relations one with another. Much has been made of Hawthorne's own temporary residence at the utopian-minded Brook Farm a decade previous to the publication of this work; it is true that some of the experiences derive from his own memories, but Hawthorne went to great pains to make clear that this is a romance first and foremost and bears no direct relation to the experiences of his own life. Those who would read this novel in an attempt to get at Hawthorne's true feelings about the utopian socialism he flirted with and watched from afar during his pivotal creative years may well miss out on the thought-provoking treatment of such wonderfully literary, fascinating characters as Hollingsworth the idealistic philanthropist, Zenobia the modern feminist reformer with a fatal flaw inimical to her self-realization, and the sweet and frail Priscilla.The first-person narrator of this story is Miles Coverdale, a man difficult to come to terms with. He joins with the pioneers behind the utopian farming community of Blithedale and truly takes heart in the possibility of this new kind of communitarian life offering mankind a chance to live lives of purpose and fulfillment, yet at times he steps outside of events and seems to view the whole experience as a study in human character and a learning experience to which his heart-strings are only loosely bound. The drama that unfolds is told in his perspective only, and one can never know how much he failed to discern or the degree to which his own conjectures are correct. His eventual castigation of Hollingsworth cannot be doubted, however. This rather unfeeling man joins the community on the hidden pretext of acquiring the means for fulfilling his overriding utopian dream of creating an edifice for the reformation of criminals. This dream takes over his life, Coverdale observes, and his once-noble philanthropic passion morphs him into an overzealous, unfeeling man who brings ruin upon those who were once his friends. It is really Zenobia, though, upon which the novel feeds. She is a fascinating woman of means who makes the Blithedale dream a reality, a bold reformer seeking a new equality for women in the world who ultimately, at Hawthorne's bidding, suffers the ignominious fate of the fragile spirit she seemed to have overcome.This is not a novel that will immediately enthrall you in its clutches. The first half of the novel is sometimes rather slow going, but I would urge you not to cast this book aside carelessly. The final chapters sparkle with drama and human passion, and you find yourself suddenly immersed in this strange community of tragic friends-turned-foes. You care deeply what happens to such once-noble spirits, and while you may not find joy in the tragic conclusion of the ill-fated social experiment of Blithedale, you will certainly find your soul stirred by the tragedy of unfolding events."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"Hawthorne was able to work within a strict set of boundaries to create something of a social call to arms and equally,a strange, unwordly tale. The scenes in the forest are a clear antecedent to those writers in the 20th century working the magic realism vein. Above and beyond all of this though is the magnificent use of language to create atmosphere and brilliantly delineated characters. It's a gorgeous book ; the effect as rich as a Gauguin painting."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"As a Hawthorne fan, I allowed this book's title to dissuade me. A romance? Not my thing. Surely, this would be sub-par fiction from one of my favorite American authors. I set aside my objections, however, after seeing that England's Westminster Review called this book \\"the finest production of genius in either hemisphere.\\" I was further intrigued by its exploration of the Utopian ideal, in this case, the fictional communal farm of Blithedale, based on Hawthorne's own real-life experiences at the short-lived Brook Farm outside Boston. There are romance elements within this story, yes, but the initial romance is that notion of a better life somewhere else, with like-minded souls, forgetting the reality of the fallen nature in mankind.\\"The Blithedale Romance\\" is told first-person through the eyes of Miles Coverdale, a young poet. It's an easier read than Hawthorne's other novels, told with a wry sense of humor and sarcasm. He wonders, for example, whether this social experiment will be aptly named \\"The Oasis\\" or \\"Saharah.\\" As Coverdale joins the other dreamers at Blithedale, he imagines the spiritual benefits of hard work, the joys their own labors will bestow upon them, but those \\"clods of earth . . . never etherealized into thought. Our thoughts, on the contrary, were fast becoming cloddish.\\" The romance of their fellowship and shared subsistence loses its sheen, even in its first days, when they realize they must beat out the local market-goers, if they are to find the best produce. The very dog-eat-dog mentality they hope to escape becomes part of their reality, if they hope to survive their first winter together.The idealism of their Community begins to crumble beneath the personal, though outwardly philanthropic, ambitions of formidable Mr. Hollingsworth. Hollingsworth's goals draw in the equally formidable--and unforgettable, among women in fiction--Zenobia, who seems to be the leader of this ragtag Community. While Coverdale resists Hollingsworth's requests, Zenobia is joined by the farm's newest member, frail but graceful Priscilla, in falling in love with Hollingsworth. The connections between these four souls become clear as the story goes along, including the mysterious Mr. Moodie and the ominous Westervelt. These characters' pasts, their hurts, their loves and affections, will ultimately doom the otherwise noble intentions at Blithedale. Tragedy will ensue. And once again, as in the Garden of Eden, mankind's selfish endeavors derail his attempts at bettering humanity.Hawthorne, through Coverdale's confessions, not only warns us against the laziness that makes no effort at betterment, but against the lofty ideals that can become so narrow-minded they harm our greater good. He gives thought-provoking commentary on love, feminism, socialism, art, hard work, and the fundamentalism that now plagues our country in various modes. In confession, Mr. Coverdale shows his own culpability in the farm's failed experiment. If we are to live together in harmony, if we are to improve as a society, we could take a few lessons from \\"The Blithedale Romance,\\" choosing a balanced view of men and women, the spiritual and physical, and the need for community with occasional retreats for personal refreshment.Despite its numerous ideas and commentaries, this is the most whimsical--until the end--of Hawthorne's stories. Its plot meanders, but the characters are deftly drawn, full-bodied and multifaceted. Even in providing a cautionary tale, Hawthorne seems to follow his own advice and take a lighthearted approach to the unpredictability of the mind and the human heart."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"I decided to read Blithedale Romance because the plot was purported to explore utopian ideals and the breakdown of a utopian society. I thought it would be an interesting take on the subject, along the lines of Brave New World or 1984. What I got was something very different, and pretty disappointing at that. A lot of things about this book frustrated me. First, the events in the book are just plain unrealistic and non-believable. For example, when Coverdale's hotel window just happens to look out onto Zenobia's drawing room in Boston, and a huge confrontation takes place as a result. Second, the character descriptions are repetitive, and also hard to believe. I mean, how many cheesy ways can you think of to describe the delicate and fragile nature of poor Priscilla. A crumbling flower? A pale ghost? The Veiled Lady? A lost rabbit? Just please stop it; we get it after 30 total pages of this. Third, I believe that Hawthorne had the 19th century version of ADD. He goes off on non-consequential tangents that are boring. At times, he seems to be writing without a purpose. If you take out all the tangential descriptions, you could probably reduce this book to a short story about Hollingsworth, Zenobia, and Priscilla. Instead, we're required to read a whole novel that lacks tempo due to the frequent and irrelevant interruptions. Fourth, the characters are one-dimension and lack any depth. For example, Hollingsworth is the guy who believes in a single ideal at the cost of all others; everything about him follows from this, other than an occasional reference to his gentle nature. Priscilla is always the innocent and fragile little girl; nothing more.I'm giving the book two stars instead of one because there are three or four noteworthy quotes/observations in the book that I did like. In hindsight, I should have just read these passages from the book, and skipped the rest. You can't carry a whole novel on three or four wisdom soundbites."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"Hawthorne expresses his cynical attitude toward Utopian reformers in this novel. The narrator, Miles Coverdale, visits a Utopian commune (Blithedale Farm) where he interacts with a haughty, seductive woman named Zenobia and a timid creature named Priscilla. He meets the philanthropist Hollingsworth, who is so intent on reforming humanity that he does not have much concern for individual men and women. But all of these characters seem to have a secret and mysterious past, which is largely revealed but never fully explained by the end of the novel (at least not to my satisfaction). The story is rather bleak; it is confusing in parts, and it is difficult to tell whether or not you can fully trust the narrator's perspective. But it is somewhat interesting, and as usual with Hawthorne's novels, there are some deep insights and memorable characters."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"After reading \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" years ago in school, and now \\"The House of Seven Gables\\" and \\"The Blithedale Romance\\" in relatively close conjunction, there seems to be a common theme running throughout much of Hawthorne's longer fiction: namely, the deep and abiding mistrust in ideas of utopia, progress or perfectibility, especially of the human kind. Hawthorne came from a long line of Puritans, one of whom even presided over some of the Salem witch trials. Now writing on the cusp of the Civil War, he feels the renewed need for the kind of pragmatic skepticism which, one generation later, an entire generation of American philosophers will call for.Coverdale, the nave narrator in search of an agrarian source of truth, discovers Blithedale (the name itself should set off bells of suspicion), a community built around the ideals of Fourier, the utopian French social theorist. Fourier thought that life could be optimized through a kind of rationalistic social engineering, the basic living unit of which he called the \\"phalanstere.\\" The hilarious (hilarious in that subtle, dowdy, Puritan way that was uniquely Hawthorne's) part is that, once everyone in Blithedale is introduced into the mix, tensions, different ideas, passions, and ideologies start to bubble to the surface showing just what a pipedream Fourier's utopia really is. Hawthorne's point seems to be that holding rationality primary over contingency and human emotion is shortsighted and silly. Not only is Blithedale a folly, but the very idea of a utopia is a sheer impossibility. I'm sure that Hawthorne would have us remember the clever lesson from Thomas More's \\"Utopia\\" - that it means, quite literally, \\"no place.\\"I'll forego a lot of the plot details because I read this several months ago, and wouldn't be able to do them justice without re-reading it. What I have unpacked here is just what jumped out at me the most. There is a strange woman named Zenobia who always wears a fresh flower in her hair, who turns out being the half-sister of a Blithedale foundling named Priscilla. The novel culminates in a set of philosophical disagreements between Coverdale and Hollingsworth, the ironically patriarchal figure whose presence hangs over Blithedale. I found the plot somewhat contrived and unrealistic, even for Hawthorne, but still very much worthwhile.The action is based on Hawthorne's experiences at Brook Farm, a well-known utopian community in its own right, where he spent most of 1841, largely in an effort to save money for his marriage. He would marry Sophia Peabody (of the famous Peabody sisters) in July of the next year."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"I often go to the public library on Saturdays and select an armful of books to take home. I check out so many because I know that only one or two of them will strike my fancy. This particular time I went through my stack of novels, reading the first 50 or so pages, and found all of them wanting--except for the last one in the pile: The Blythedale Romance by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It's funny how some reviewers insisted that the first few chapters of this novel were \\"slow going.\\" It's all in what you're looking for, I suppose. Like most 19th century novels, the plot is developed in its own time. Since this was before movies were around, more scene descriptions and character development was necessary. I was immediately enchanted with this tale of a group of intellectuals, or would-be intellectuals, who decided to give Utopia another chance. I found the narrator, Miles Coverdale, charming and witty and all the characters interesting and complex. This kind of surprised me, because I read the book years ago and liked it, but felt that now I might have outgrown it. Not so. After House of the Seven Gables, it's my favorite Hawthorne."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"Hawthorne's third novel, THE BLITHEDALE ROMANCE, combinesdiverse elements such as mystery, passion, social reform and philosophy-even a ghost story--all blended into a delightful literary patchwork. Set in mid 19th century Massachusetts this novel was inspired by the author's personal sojourn at Brook Farm-an experiment in Socialism and communal living--where he shed the trappings of polite society in order to become an instant farmer in a noble cause. Although he drew upon real life personalities of the 1850's for inspiration, his work was intended to be read and enjoyed as fiction. Despite the obvious parallels between Hawthorne and his protagonist, Miles Coverdale, readers may savor the storyline at face value; while Hawthorne was actually engaged during his time at Brook Farm, Miles remained a \\"frosty bachelor\\" all his days, despite his last-line confession.Functioning partly as narrator and as Greek chorus passive Miles arrives at Blithedale Farm on a snowy evening in mid April, eager to begin his the great social experiment which would benefit all mankind. There he meets his similarly-minded new brethren and sistersbut the undisputed queen at the farmhouse is a beautiful, stately woman known as Zenobia. A sudden, insistent pounding at the door heralds the arrival of a shaggy bear of a man, the reformer Hollingsworth, bearing in his arms a precious burden: a pale, fragile girl, Priscilla, who requires their communal compassion. From that dramatic moment on Miles' mind and heart become entangled in the curious and mysterious affairs of these three. In fact Miles does not bother even to name the other social reformers. He devotes the next months of his life to private sleuthing and speculation on the enigma of these three individuals, although a few peripheral outsiders intrude on Blithedale's fragile harmony.Unlike Hawthorn's previous novels, this is first-person tale; thus, we do not witness events where Miles himself is not present. Despite the high-minded social motivation of the zealous reformers, personal passions cannot be prevented, nor can their effects on others be denied. Miles undergoes several transformations of opinion and feelings for the three who fascinate him. Unable to escape their mysterious intrigues even in Boston, whence he retires to reconsider his purpose at Blithedale, he is obliged to witness their private machinations in the real world. But who will prove the hero to rescue Priscilla from her hateful life of stage deception? Is kindly Miles up to the task? The dramatic climax of Zenobia's betrayal was based on an actual lugubrious experience of the author's. The novel provides rich insight into the struggle for Women's emancipation in the 19th century, as well as thoughtful judgment on the difficulty of establishing an agrarian Eden on earth."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"Lacking perhaps the ambitious design of other Hawthorne novels, Blithdale makes up for it in first-person freshness. It's witty and straight, take it as you will. And yes, somewhat wickedly tongue in cheek in its engagement with a 19th century American experiment in utopia on earth.Some reviews on this site are a sad testament to what a new generation has been subjected to by way of heavily idealized and politically ladened literary theory. The subtleties are all on the page but many students lately have apparently been prevented from seeing them by the standard goggles forced on their heads. \\"Depressing,\\" \\"cynical\\" etc are odd ways to approach a text -- I take it the reviewers were disturbed by the Grand Canyon between what was on the page and what was in their teachers' heads and expectations. Taken as a sort of cry of pain (an honest emotional response anyway) I would urge these young readers to try again.Truth is, utopia has always been the lodestar of the American mind -- inseperable from what brought many here in the first place, from the Declaration and Constitution, from the competing utopias of the civil war, to the published justifications of every one of our wars since. So what if Hawthorne didn't completely succeeed? Who else among our major writers so directly flew right to the heart of things, like a bee to honey?This is the story of Miles Coverdale, a self-satisfied reformer of his time, a sort of proto-yuppie, comes to Blithedale for reasons as vague as his own dense and unexamined mind. He finds other high minded individuals mouthing platitudes but in full rutting behavior, as would befit dueling moose in the Yellowstone -- mainly over the brazen Zenobia. Why isn't everyone laughing yet? No, of course D.H. Lawrence didn't think it was funny. But yes, all of these admirable characters have a lot to say about social advancement, womens' freedom, etc -- but hasn't anyone told the students of today that serious literature requires we look behind, nay beneath our own self-satisfied justifications? Apparently training in critical thinking has disappeared, replaced with acceptance of the jingoism of all-pervasive advertising: one is what one says one is, since one has the right to say it and thereby define oneself, end of story.But there's an apple at the end, folks, the punch line, \\"I was in love with . . . Priscilla . . . !\\"Thus the ironic punchline to one of the funniest things I ever read in my life."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"I read this book for college and at first was worried that it would not hold my interest for long. However, I was pleased to discover that The Blithedale Romance was full of mystery and intriguing characters. I would recomend this book to any reader who enjoys unraveling entwined strands of love and committment against a background of evil darkness."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"I have enjoyed this novel each time I've read it, though I've never thought it as strong as \\"The House of the Seven Gables,\\" mainly because in \\"Blithedale\\" Hawthorne never seems to get at what it is he wants to \\"get at.\\" I've never been sure if he's saying that in a utopian society, personal ambitions will destroy the society, or if he's saying that men do not want strong women who are their equals. Or something else altogether.Nor do I like the way the story is told, through a minor character who observes the main characters. And I've never been able to figure out Coverdale, whose name certainly seems to carry a message. On top of that, I find Hollingsworth unsympathetic and am dismayed that not one but both of the novel's main female characters are in love with him. Then there's Zenobia, who is overconfident, and Priscilla, who is too \\"veiled\\" and wispy to be interesting.That said, why in the world do I like the book? Well, I like the setting of a utopian community, probably much like the real Brook Farm (which Hawthorne belonged to for a while). I enjoy seeing the problems in a utopian community and the ways in which they are or are not solved. And I enjoy the conflict among the characters. If you like reading Hawthorne, I think you'll like this book."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"I fell in love with Hawthorne's books and short stories when I was in junior high school. Twenty years later he continues to be on my list of top ten favorites. His novels strike me as incredibly modern and relevant to modern day life.The Blithedale Romance has many elements in common with the much sillier novel Tommy's Tale by Alan Cumming. The events at Blithedale (a commune in the woods) are laid out in chronological order by Miles Coverdale who proves to be as unreliable a narrator as Tommy. Cloverdale's omissions are a result of Puritan embarrassment but the sexual tension is hovering just below the surface of his euphemisms.Like Tommy who lives in a flat with Sadie, Bobby and Charlie, Cloverdale moves into Blithedale to live with two women (Zenobia, Priscilla) and a man, Hollingsworth. Unlike Tommy's flat, the two men and women pair up in more conventional ways but Cloverdale hints that the four are more open with their adult desires than what Cloverdale feels is proper. Nonetheless, he is a willing participant.Blithedale, though, ends up being a failed experiment. Puritan mores and hot tempers ultimately brings the downfall of the commune and Zenobia, the liberated modern woman, pays the ultimate price.If you like character driven tragedies like Hamlet, I highly recommend The Blithedale Romance."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"Isolation and a refusal to see things straight-on are the main themes of this mildly successful novel by Hawthorne. Narrated by Miles Coverdale who comes to the Utopian community of Blithedale for his health (Hawthorne had spent some time at Brook Farm, a communal farm, on which Blithedale is based), we encounter Hollingsworth, who is interested in prison reform, and who uses the wealthy and exotic Zenobia for his own selfish purposes; she drowns herself when Hollingworth shows a romantic interest in Priscilla, Zenobia's half-sister. Priscilla is a true innocent, who is under the influence of the evil mesmerist, Westervelt.Coverdale is always on the fringe of what's going on, but never a direct participant. He eavesdrops and spies from windows (once even while hiding in a tree), and his inability to take part in the life around him is Hawthorne's central figure of isolation. Even at the end he declares his love for Priscilla - only after she has married Hollingsworth. Hollingsworth, too, spends much of the novel in isolation, pursuing his dream of prison reform; when he gives it up it destroys Zenobia (who has been living in a romantic fantasy of her own), but redeems himself and Priscilla. While Hawthorne deals credibly with the reality vs. fantasy theme of the characters, the plot is somewhat draggy, as is the dialogue. Not among the very best of Hawthorne's works."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"It's been over seven months since I read the BLithedale roamnce, and I find myself still turning it over in my head. Hawthorne has received alot of bad treatment by feminists groups...but in many ways, I think this book is rather feminine in perspective. Skip the big Hawthorne novels and concentrate on his later, better, less well-known works. They're magic."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"The fact that he spent his Halloween writing an annoyed review of Blithedale notwithstanding, I would like to know where dear Kevin got the idea that this book was actually about utopian ideals. He goes on to describe why he just didn't like the book, and in doing so shows how he really just didn't get what the novel is actually about. I suppose that any reader runs the risk of being disappointed if they approach a novel with specific expectations, but to actually say that he was expecting an earlier version of 1984 or A Brave New World (at least I assume that's what he meant) is in itself, I believe, exactly why he didn't enjoy it. Warning: possible spoilers ahead.The Blithedale Romance is not a book about socialism, communal farms, or really even about characters, it's a book about lenses and veils. The entire 'Romance' is given to us through the tinted and extremely untrustworthy (as well as creepy) eyes of Miles Coverdale, the man who can throw his own light over the entire farm because his is the only perspective we're allowed (blithe-dale means happy-valley. Cover-dale, covered-valley, see what Hawthorne did there?). The entire Blithedale experiment is essentially an ant farm to Miles, and when he gets bored of watching the farm, he goes to town and peers into other people's windows for a few days.What Kevin describes as 19th century ADD is actually Hawthorne's continual reminders that we cannot trust anything Coverdale says and that he is not showing us the events of the story as they actually took place but rather his interpretation of them. This is driven home in several different ways, firstly Miles continually refers to the fact that he is writing this account some twenty years after the events took place. He says of Zenobia that \\"I can now summon her up like a ghost, a little wanner than in life, but otherwise identical with it\\" and only a few pages before this he spoke of the fire they were gathered around as glimmering faintly out of his past memories. So which is it, Miles, is it a faint indistinct memory or a nearly identical reminiscence? These little reminders continue up to the last line of the book, he feels he is making some grand confession that he was in love with Priscilla when in fact any close reader has been aware of this from the outset, but he really seems to think that he was hiding it well. Of course Hawthorne knew that this revelation would not in fact be a revelation at all, an yet he includes this passage, in fact he concludes with it, as if to impress to the reader just how self-unaware Coverdale really is. We're also cued into how unreliable Coverdale is by the entirely overdone praise he receives from Zenobia in the third chapter when she tells him she has memorized so much of his poetry and asks him if he finds it irksome to have his verses sung aloud. Later in the novel Coverdale speaks of his attempts to write poetry as essentially failures and says that he gave up the youthful impulse soon after these events took place. I am convinced that this conversation only ever took place in Coverdales' mind and yet he presents them unabashedly as facts.I do agree with Kevin's first assertion that the events of the novel are 'unrealistic and non-believable'. For example, Coverdale's hotel window looking onto Zenobia's drawing room, his presence at the unveiling of Priscilla as the veiled lady, his presence in his 'hermitage' when Zenobia and Westervelt pass by in conversation (in fact his admitting that he made up the entire conversation he relays is another example in itself) and the fact that Coverdale is the one who calls out the searchers after he suspects that Zenobia has drowned herself. However, instead of making the book seem contrived or just silly, I feel these elements only add to our interpretation of Coverdale as a big fat liar and lend themselves to further questioning of whether anything in this book can be believed or not.Kevin's second assertion, that the characters in this story are repetitive and unbelievable, also shows just how drastically he under-read this novel. Coverdale's descriptions of his fellow Blithedale inhabitants (not the farm, but the novel) don't tell us nearly as much about the people they are supposedly about as they do about Coverdale himself. Coverdale's careless or self-servingly skewed views of people and events are shown when Moody's eye patch changes sides, when Hollingsworth goes from being a multidimensional and enjoyable character to a horrendous sneak-thieving cad, when proud Zenobia, after being cast aside by Hollingsworth, drowns herself, and how Priscilla seems to almost instantly convert from her pale, sickly, timid self to a giggling exuberant nymph under the influence of Zenobia, Hollingsworth, or both. If Kevin finds it amazing to the point of foolishness that all of the character descriptions serve to show only one dimension of the 'people' which they presumably represent, it is because that is exactly how Coverdale represents them.Each and every one of Kevin's problems with The Blithedale Romance are issues created by Coverdale being the author of the story. His descriptions of Hawthorne as writing a book which is \\"without a purpose\\" and \\"lack[ing in] tempo due to the frequent and irrelevant interruptions\\", are inherently incorrect because poor Kevin just doesn't understand that these shortcomings are Coverdale's, not Hawthorne's, and the fact that they are constructed so flawlessly is a selling point rather than a shortcoming of the novel.In short, Hawthorne is able to show his mastery of his craft by writing a badly composed story through Coverdale. Because the romance is repetitive, unreliable, and unbelievable, we can synthesize meaning from the story which, no matter how badly Coverdale misinterprets it or how much he covers it up with his vanity and strange insertions, still ring true and poignant for audiences today. Kevin said that while there were \\"three or four noteworthy quotes/observations in the book that I did like\\", \\" You can't carry a whole novel on three or four wisdom soundbites\\". Au contraire, mon ami, because this is not a novel, it's a Romance, and by peppering Coverdale's somewhat inane story with divine truths of human nature, we are able to see how these tidbits of wisdom will find a way to shine through even the murkiest of vain, self-serving Cover[dale]s because, if they are in fact divine truths, they must always do so. Kevin's reading of the book is inherently flawed because he takes it very literally while I believe Hawthorne purposely buried his small nuggets of wisdom deep inside a confused and untrustworthy narrative so that when they, and the purpose for which they were buried is finally discovered, they can shine all the more brightly."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's third major novel, The Blithedale Romance (1852), is a faster moving and more colorful novel than his second, 1851's bloodless The House Of The Seven Gables, but, sadly, that it the best that can be said for it. Like a vaguely - conceived puzzle with several essential pieces missing, the book ambles uncertainly along, thematically a little bit about everything but finally about nothing in particular. As with all Hawthorne's novels and many of his shorter works, there is a barely a paragraph or chapter that is not triply overwritten, and obfuscation, rather than clarity, is the order of the day throughout. Depth of any kind is not one of the novel's strengths, and stilted language (\\"Lip of man will never touch my hand again\\") abounds. Hawthorne's cast - introverted, voyeuristic narrator Miles Coverdale, apparent utopist visionary Hollingsworth, wealthy feminist crusader Zenobia, and guileless ingenue Priscilla - are more like glittering but partially - carved mannequins than substantial characters capable of sustaining a novel.The Blithedale Romance has historically been promoted as a novel about an experimental socialist utopia, but as Brenda Wineapple outlined in the excellent Hawthorne: A Life (2003), Hawthorne himself was unsure of what the genuine focus of the book was. Earlier titles considered were \\"Hollingsworth,\\" \\"Hollingsworth: A Romance,\\" \\"Miles Coverdale's Three Friends,\\" \\"Zenobia,\\" and simply \\"Priscilla.\\" For lack of anything better, \\"The Blithedale Romance\\" was chosen; upon publication, the novel was praised by Washington Irving and Herman Melville, but panned by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who thought it \\"unworthy of Hawthorne's talent.\\" Reviews were generally negative, and James T. Fields, Hawthorne's publisher, said, \\"let us hope there will be no more Blithedales.\\"A socialist experiment in creating a utopia - Blithedale - does figure in the background, and acts as the novel's primary setting, but, except for some very occasional blather, the complex concerns of bringing a functional, working utopia into existence are entirely ignored and have nothing to do with the real impetus of the novel.For most of the book, only the primary characters seem to be claustrophobically present at Blithedale. Caught up in an incestuous tangle, the four are enclosed and cut off from the rest of humanity by the potentially shattering world of nature that lies inherent in the farm itself. Nothing emphasizes this more than the existence of Coverdale's own hidden tree-top bower and surrogate womb, where he finds escape and solace from the explosive emotional realities bubbling under the brittle social surface; a late pagan masquerade, straight out of 'The May - Pole Of Merry Mount' solidifies Blithedale as a liminal space where anything might happen, including free love in all its hetero-, homo-, and bisexual aspects. But caught up instead in a sudsy melodrama of vaunted idealism, unconscious egotism, shrewdly - enacted treachery, and unrequited love, the characters shuffle through a hazy, uneven plot that is little more than an undisguised 19th century soap opera.The Blithedale Romance is also a shaky indictment of Protestant hypocrisy, as its characters are uncomfortably snared between dueling impulses of wishful altruism and a wolfish desire for the absolute triumph of individual will. As presented, the noble society of man is a fragile sham, a frail plywood structure eternally dissolving at the edges, visibly or otherwise.Neurotic temptress Zenobia (a character primarily based on Hawthorne's friend Margaret Fuller) is the only partially successful character, though her ridiculous, syrupy, and embarrassingly off - center platitudes about struggling womanhood (\\"in the battlefield of life, the downright stroke, that would fall only on a man's steel head - piece, is sure to light on a woman's heart, over which she wears no breastplate...,\\" \\"I am a woman - with every fault, it may be, that a woman ever had, weak, vain, unprincipled (like most of my sex; for our virtues, when we have any, are merely impulsive and intuitive,) passionate, too...\\") virtually guarantee her absurdist martyrdom on a wayward altar of feminist suffering.As the story draws to a conclusion, a series of extraordinary and crudely executed coincidences attempt, and fail, to tie the torpid plot into a neat bundle. Hawthorne finally allows semi - warrior, quasi - vampire, and arch hypocrite Zenobia to go the way of masochistic Ophelia, gurgling brook, brisk current, emerald moss, reeds, rushes, and all. Far from shedding light on the inferior status of women in American society in the 1850s, Hawthorne presents the subject like a mocking and garish caricature.Since Hawthorne wanly satirizes everything and everyone, including his narrator, himself (as the author of the book, who is not to be confused with the narrator), and his style, and as his attempts at satire and irony are uniformly without edge, the book sinks, as Ophelia did, like a stone."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"I love Hawthorne. But of all his novels, I like this one the least. It lacks the swift action of &quot;Fanshawe&quot; (1828), the memorable characters of &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1850), the suspense and deep psychological insights of &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot; (1851), or the images of &quot;The Marble Faun&quot; (1860). I would not make time to read this. But then it is not quite a flop either. There is some interesting interaction amongst the characters. Also, Hawthorne does give us an important message about the hypocrisy behind utopia."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"The narrator, a poet, Miles Coverdale, describes Zenobia's bloom as health and vigor. It is determined that they, the community members, would not make good market gardeners and that they should look into the raising of pigs.Hollingsworth arrives with Priscilla who seeks shelter to be in Zenobia's company. She is a thin pale thing, and her origins are not known. Hollingsworth is not really interested in socialism, he is interested in the reformation of criminals.A committee is formed to name the community and Blithedale is the result. Hollingsworth joins the group because its members are estranging themselves from the world. Coverdale feels that the man, Hollingsworth, is fast going mad. May Day is to be a movable festival. Coverdale discovers that neither he nor Robert Burns is able to combine farming and poetry.A stranger, Westevelt, wants to meet with Zenobia privately. It seems that she has another name. Miles Coverdale dislikes the stranger who, among other things, refers to the utopian experiment mockingly. Coverdale overhears Zenobia and Westervelt discussing Priscilla. Zernobia tells the story of the Veiled Lady and throws a piece of gauze over Priscilla who faints.One has to understand here the context of Hawthorne's writing, his immersion in literature--gothicism, orientalism, romanticism, transcendentalism, even melodrama. Too, the novel is titled a romance. Hawthornes's themes and concerns included issues of identity, claustrophobia, detrimental influence, whiteness, purity.The community is planning to erect a Philanstery Coverdale relates. The land has not yet been acquired in fee and Hollingswoth wants to take over the site for his project involving the reforming of the wicked. Hollingsworth invites Coverdale to join his enterprise. Miles learns that Zenobia is to be part of the plan. He decides to leave Blithedale. Emotions are fraught. Zenobia says she regrets not taking Coverdale into her confidence.Situated at a hotel in town, Miles sees Westervelt, Zenobia, and Priscilla. Westervelt has cat-like circumspection and detects Miles's presence. He comes to see that his shadowing of Zenobia at her house in town is absurd and he goes to the house to present himself.Later, approaching Blithedale again, he feels simultaneously dread and gaiety. A masque is taking place in the woods. Zenobia charges Hollingsworth with self-deception. She claims she is sick of playing at philanthropy and progress. It seems that Hollingsworth has cast her aside. She dies by drowning and Miles Coverdale is led to forgive Hollingswoth for hgis role in the catastrophe. In the end MIles Coverdale confesses to the reader that he loves Zenobia's sister, Priscilla.This is, of course, famously based upon the experiences of the New Englanders at Brook Farm, a short-lived utopian community. Notwithstanding the early American notion, particularly prevalent in New England, of the farmer-poet, in truth it is difficult to convert intellectuals into effective day laborers."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"Great shipping. It shipped from New York, and I also live in New York. The shipping took literally a day. I was provided tracking immediately after purchase. Great service. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"No one likes \\"The Blithedale Romance\\". His publisher didn't like it, most of the critics didn't like it, the former members of the Brook Farm didn't like it, D.H. Lawrence mocked it. John Updike does his best to point out the redeeming features of the novel, even becomes a bit hysterical, calling Zenobia a \\"Gorgon before whom Coverdale stands transfixed and fascinated.\\" He praises Hawthorne's use of local color, trying to make \\"The Blithedale Romance\\" into something more than it is.So, it is not Hawthorne's best novel, according to the critics. It doesn't stand up to \\"The House of the Seven Gables\\", let alone \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", the two other Hawthorne novels I have read.Still, reading it is a worthwhile experience. As Updike says, some of the scenes are very evocative. The carriage ride out to the farm in an April snow storm (compare with a modern Boston commuter's experience!), the farmhouse kitchen scene, the woods around the farm, Coverdale's Boston hotel, the search for Zenobia's drowned body; all are memorable demonstrations of Hawthorne's descriptive powers.Of the characters, only Zenobia and Coverdale seem like real people. The rest are \\"types\\" or only half-sketched.The worst aspect of the novel is the plot. Of course it is written from Coverdale's point of view, so we only know what Coverdale knows, but still the denouement makes no sense. Compared to the suicide of Emma Bovary, for example, which is perhaps an unfair comparison, the suicide of Zenobia seems completely out of character. One can almost understand D.H. Lawrence's unsympathetic \\"Boo-hoo!\\" at the end of his review of \\"The Blithedale Romance\\".Hawthorne writes beautifully. Telling the story from the point of view of a character who has limited knowledge foreshadows in a way the techniques used by later novelists like Joyce and Woolf. He was also no doubt trying to create an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue. But his technique hadn't progressed far enough to make the experiment a success, and he leaves us with too many dangling plot threads and half-formed characters. It is an admirable experiment, if looked at in this way, but it fails to come fully to life."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"vintage is always a pleasure, presuming of course that we're talking about the real thing. there's a regal pace about hawthorne's prose that is undeniably hawthorne and no one else. there's that rigid, regimental quality uniquely hawthornian, a sense of iron discipline, utterly lacking in modern american prose. if vintage is what you seek, check out the blithedale romance: it'll set you straight."},{"Title":"The Blithedale romance","review":"This novel is filled with intrigue, mystery and romance."},{"Title":"Easy-To-Make Stuffed Animals and All the Trimmings","review":"I like all of Jodie Davis' doll and animal books, but I especially had fun with this one. I enjoyed picking out all my friends' favorite animals and dressing them up. This book features two kinds of stuffed animals: doll-style (upright with an animal head) and animal-style (more realisticly posed). Both are very cute, and the doll-style patterns include clothing. There is a good variety of projects ranging from cats and pigs to lions and roosters. I would rate the patterns at a medium skill level, since some of the pieces are a little tricky to fit together, and they call for plastic doll joints in the arms, legs, and head. I wish the book had color pictures - the black-and-white ones do not show much detail. Overall, though, this book offers nicely designed patterns with clear instructions.

The board is concerned about the loss of time and passenger discomfort from constant maneuvering in flight. The pilots want to have computers aboard their vessels to alleviate the problem.Steve believes that the problem is not the piloting, but out of position check stations. As the liner travels toward Mars, he finds some check stations well off their assigned positions. He reports this information to Newton back on Terra, who promises to take care of the matter.Newton asks Steve to escort his daughter around the ship. Steve agrees and looks forward to showing the ship to the kid. Then he meets Nadia and realizes that she is not a child.Nadia wants to see the whole ship. He shows her everything from the nose to the stern. They are far back in the vessel when Steve notices an abrupt shock.He takes Nadia into a lifeboat and scans the outside. A small spherical ship is busily cutting up the rear end of the Arcturus with a force plane. Steve and Nadia hide in a three faced compartment until the attack is terminated.The other ship has a force screen that repels even the frightful power of a war beam. It collects the various pieces of the ship with tractor beams and start moving the wreckage toward Jupiter. Any loose pieces and even escaping lifeboats are brought back into the mass of wreckage with the tractors.When they approach Jupiter, Steve and Nadia escape from the wreckage to Ganymede. There they start to build the tools to construct an ultra-radio set to contact Brandon and Westfall. Since they have few tools on the boat, the effort takes months.This tale presents Steve and Nadia with many challenges. Steve starts with little more than primitive tools with which to build better tools. Nadia becomes the provider, hunting and gathering food for the table.This story was originally published in 1931 within Amazing. It starts much like the story \\"Triplanetary\\" (1934), but soon veers in another direction. It is a tale of castaways trying to return to civilization.Naturally the Ganymede presented in this tale doesn't really exist. Like many tales of the period, the planets and moons were usually shown as supporting terrestrial life. Current data on the these worlds of the Solar System shows only Earth capable of supporting humans.This is one of the author's singleton novels. The author has written at least two more standalone works:The Galaxy PrimesandMasters of Space. Read and enjoy!Highly recommended for Smith fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of interplanetary adventure, advanced technology, and a bit of romance.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Spacehounds of IPC","review":"Safe for our kind, that is. You know, two-legged Earthian kind, not those nasty six-legged critters.Brilliant physicist Dr. Stevens is off on a fact-finding mission, to save the honor of the brave pilots of the space-liner Arcturus from the desk-jockeys' imprecations of imprecision - the nastiest insult in his super-scientific world. He and the pilots are right, of course, but that's cold consolation when marauders from the depths of space hack up their ship and drag it off, in obvious violation of salvage laws.Stevens and his beloved escape to an isolated moon of Jupiter, which happens to Earth-like right down to wildlife that's pretty tasty, when cooked up right. There, the fond couple struggle to rebuild all of Western technology from the ground up, and struggle to maintain the chastity of their impromptu engagement - lots of cold showers all around, I guess. They do a fair job of both, while events progress on just about every other bit of planetary real estate around. After much zooming around between worlds, the bad guys are all vanquished, the good guys and gals get properly hitched, and the space pilots protect their manly honor.Parts of \\"Spacehounds\\" date back to the early 1930s, 75 years ago as of this writing. The goofy anachronisms are half the fun here, based on Smith's odd inability to imagine any technology much different from his own. The dated social commentary is amusing, too, for example in his mention of a dozen-plus of the space-liner's female passengers getting married before their rescuers arrived. They obviously didn't marry each other, but it somehow appears that women marry but men don't.The date of writing is closer to Jules Verne than to today's science fiction, but a good bit harder to take seriously. Well, being serious isn't all that much fun anyway. If you want a happy bit of heroic space-silliness, Doc Smith is the man to bring it to you.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Spacehounds of IPC","review":"This book is good for classic book lovers and new readers alike, IMO.

He later created another sweeping multivolume series about the Galactic Patrol protecting all civilized planets of the Milky Way from a gradually unfolding, seemingly all-powerful menace, in the \\"Lensman\\" novels. But SPACEHOUNDS OF IPC stands alone; Smith never returned to this setting (the moons of Jupiter) or these characters. Perhaps one reason is that the technology presented is hardly futuristic. Our heroes somehow get along with mainly late 19th Century gadgets in what might be the 22nd or 23rd Century.Modern readers will be more astonished by the novel's depiction of women, but in fact it is completely standard, as found in almost all popular fiction of the era, say 1880 - 1930. At least in such fiction, whenever nice girls were tempted to \\"do it,\\" they got up, went out, and played 18 holes of golf.What was not standard was Smith's creation of a world in which the reader's sense of wonder was continuously engaged, in an adventure where every page offered amazing action and excitement. STAR WARS started right here. I can't remember when I first read this novel... probably in the mid-1950s. I come back to re-read it about once every 10 years."},{"Title":"Spacehounds of IPC","review":"This is an early 20th century sci fi novel. It has many anachronisms regarding scientific theory.

It covers prehistory through the 1940s (my edition has a 1945 copyright date) and places particular emphasis on the Civil War, the only time when the Valley was a significant stage for historical events. The author's approach is both personal and anecdotal. She brings the main characters vividly to life by means of direct quotes and descriptions of their every day activities: George Washington who surveyed and lived in Fredrick County as a young man, Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson whose Valley Campaign was a brilliant use of maneuver by an inferior force and who taught a Sunday School for black children that he called \\"My Militia\\", and Robert E. Lee the Confederate Commander of the Army of Northern Virginia who became and President of Washington College (now Washington and Lee University). They are complemented by a host of minor actors including Jackson's dashing cavalry commander Turner Ashby who sat with his wounded horse until it died, the colorful Confederate spy Belle Boyd who smuggled information on Union troop locations through the lines in her petticoats, cartographer Jedediah Hotchkiss who facilitated Jackson's campaign of maneuver, cavalry officer Major Edward McDonald who was shot through the throat just prior to Lee's surrender at Appomattox, Jackson's staff officers Sandy Pendleton, whose descendant I met in 2003 while visiting Jackson's headquarters in Winchester, and Henry Kyd Douglas, whose family estate across the Potomac from Shepherdstown is now run by the Park Service, and many, many more.I first read this book during a high school summer vacation and became fascinated with the Valley and Stonewall Jackson. It appeared to me that it was a tale told by a lady who grew up there and learned its history by word of mouth from some of the actual participants. In particular, she drew on Henry Kyd Douglas' personal history, I Rode with Stonewall, which is still in print.I recently learned a bit more which completes my picture of Julia Davis: She was born in the Shenandoah Valley (in Charles Town, WV) in 1900, the daughter of John Davis, the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for president who later served as ambassador to London. Her mother died as a result of her birth, and her two sets of grandparents played major roles in raising her. Major Edward McDonald was her maternal grandfather and undoubtedly an early source of her knowledge of Civil War history. In addition to history, she wrote a number of historical novels. Her most recent publication is an abridged version of The Shenandoah, entitled Shenandoah: Daughter of the Stars, which is supplemented by photographs by Lucian Niemeyer. Julia died in 1992 in a manner as graceful as her prose: At a banquet, at age 92, she asked a friend to dance with her. As they left the dance floor, she said, \\"Thank you, Don\\", appeared to trip over a rug, fell, and died in her friend's arms.

A man named Ellis Leroy, who can generously be called a lying scumbag, offers them a tempting proposition. He will guarantee safe passage out of Russia, and a free, one-way, boat trip to freedom in the West (specifically, Nome, Alaska). In exchange, all that the three have to do is to break into a heavily guarded US Navy ship at the local Navy base. They have to make their way to the Presidential Suite, at the top of the ship, and steal $64 million in confiscated drug money, then make it off the ship alive. Alex does not survive, but Hayden and Monique succeed in getting the money, then conveniently forget about splitting it with Leroy.Five years later, Hayden is happily married to Colleen (a waitress on the ship from Russia to Alaska) and living in rural British Columbia. Leroy shows up one day, with one of his henchmen, demanding to know where Hayden is. Colleen says nothing, so she is drugged, kidnapped and taken to an isolated cabin. In a videotape sent to Hayden, Leroy makes it very clear that unless he gets his share of the $64 million, very soon, Colleen will be going back to Russia, on a one-way trip into the Russian sex trade. Acting as nonchalant as possible, Hayden asks around in the nearby town, and is able to narrow down their location. Armed with several weapons, Hayden undertakes a trek of several days through deep snow to reach them.On the positive side, this is an interesting story set in a part of the world, Alaska and Western Canada, not known as a thriller setting. On the negative side, if there are to be future printings of this book, it really needs a trip, or another trip, to a proofreader or copyeditor.

The everlasting human wish to reach freedom as a person and as a member of the society, society that has been oppressed many years by a communist regime, is the fuel that powers this story. When the political idea becomes a personal agenda or vice versa, be sure (if you're the audience) to buckle up, because this story will take you to the rollercoster ride. All elements are there: love, passion, action, revenge. And fear, of course, the primary human sense. And it is not just the plain fear. It is rather a more &quot;sophisticated&quot; fear that deals on so many levels of the human mind: fear of the personal and collective welfare, welfare of the immediate significant one, fear of both success and failure.Denis Cviticaninwriter, director"},{"Title":"Islam in Transition: Muslim Perspectives","review":"This book is a wonderful compilation of first person sources regarding Islam in the Modern Era from the 17th century to the present day, focusing on the divergent responses of Muslim thinkers to Western influence. It begins with a selection of articles responding to the challenges of colonization and imperialism and ends with a discussion of contemporary challenges, including the notion of jihad and terrorism. This book's advantage is in letting the reader draw his or her own conclusions instead of relying on interpretations of the opinions. Articles speak on a variety of Muslim responses to post-Enlightenment Western concepts, including socio-economic theory; the nation-state; democratic principles; law; and secularism, to name a few. It also presents a variety of perspectives on distinctly Muslim issues, including the role of Islam in society; Quranic interpretation; religious law; gender; and jihad. The articles in this book are best read with a good knowledge of the principles of Islam, and a good knowledge of the historical development of Islam and the Muslim world.

As someone with little background in history, the exerts were crafted in a way that provoked curiosity to learn more. I would suggest that as you read, to pay attention to the writers of each exert, because they range on the political scale. Not everything in the book should be taken as truth. Also, if you are curious about the Arab Spring and recent revolutions in the Near and Middle East, the exerts will give you a background on several famous Islamic scholars, some whose ideology are the backbone of the reform movements.A great read to compliment one's interests in political science, sociology, geography (human), international studies and religious studies."},{"Title":"A Vision Betrayed: The Jesuits in Japan and China, 1542-1742","review":"The subject of the introduction of Christianity into China and Japan in the late 1500's is a fascinating one. Both missions ultimately failed, despite very promising beginnings and a remnant who held onto the faith in secret (the kakure kirishitan of Japan). My problem with the book is that there are mistakes in the Japanese which make it clear that the author could not have consulted any Japanese materials in the original. For example, the artist for the screen on the slipcover is listed as &quot;Namban Byobu&quot;. This is not actually a personal name, but the term for &quot;Screens of the Southern Barbarians&quot; (as western foreigners were called). Also, some of the personal names of Japanese people are romanized in two different romanization systems (si and shi; both stand for the same sound) within the same word. It is not likely that a person competent in Japanese reviewed the manuscript. One wonders what other factual errors exist.Nonetheless, for anyone with an interest in the subject, this is a fascinating tale, including details such as the discovery of a tablet which recorded the Nestorian existance in China hundreds of years previously, which gave additional credibility to the &quot;new&quot; faith.The general theme of the book seems to be a corrective of previous books which seem to have not adequately presented the case of the Jesuits. Their approach to localizing the faith (enculturation) was not sufficiently thorough in Japan and forbidden by the Shogun, and though thorough in China, ultimately forbidden by the Church in the &quot;Rites Controversy&quot;. No wonder it was published by Maryknoll, who uses this once-discredited approach in many different cultures."},{"Title":"A Vision Betrayed: The Jesuits in Japan and China, 1542-1742","review":"&quot;A Vision Betrayed&quot; is the most comprehensive, honest, and thorough evaluation of Catholic Missions to the east in the 16th,17th, and 18th century. Ross blends the fascinating stories of such great men as Francis Xavier, Matteo Ricci, and Alesandro Vilagano with the current political, and religions situations indeigenous to Japan and China. His closing chapter is a brilliant observation on what led to the collapse of these missions. This book is a must read for anyone interested in missionary work either Catholic or Protestant. These early Jesuits understood the necessity of understanding a foreign culture before bringing the faith. It is a shame that many American missionaries today lack the knowledge and grace to bring only the faith to the East not our culture."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is the story of a young boy growing up in the 1840's.

Recently I found a small book from the Barnes-Nobel collector's library and decided to read it. That particular issue is probably not the best to use, especially for a first introduction because it is badly edited and exhibits an inordinant number of spelling errors and misplaced words. Certainly for a volume one will use for quotations in any paper one writes a better copy, like the one above, would be more desireable.Despite his depression in later years, Mark Twain captures the sly sense of humor and dry wit that is a characteristic of American humorous writers: O'Henry and Will Rogers, among them. This is well illlustrated in Tom Sawyer, a novel about being a kid, not just in the 1880s but any time. Twain gets right into the heart and mind of childhood, it's myths, superstitions, trials and victories, even it's great philosophies: \\"He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it, namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain (p. 25).\\" (The latter a gloss on the whitewashing of Aunt Polly's fence.)Truly a Twain and truly a joy.For THOSE WRITING PAPERS: in English literature. How might Twain stack up against a modern humorist? What types of things make this a \\"dated\\" work? Why does that datedness appeal to many readers. How is Tom like modern children? Mark Twain was an adult when he wrote the book. Do you think that that fact makes the story less about a child and how he views the world and more about how an adult remembers being a child? Watch a film about Tom Sawyer. How has Hollywood reworked the story? Does seeing some of Tom's adventures help one enjoy them more? Or does getting \\"inside his head\\" through the book make it more enjoyable?"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"the book was ok because it is so hard and it has some long parts in it! so i would not let kids under 8 read this unless they are real good! and other then that it was GREAT!!! then i would give it 50 thumbs up!!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This story is about a young boy name Tom Sawyer.

Tom and Huck find his treasure, that they seen him hide one night, and claim it as their own.Mark Twain is an excellent author. He makes all of the characters believable and seem as if that was you in your early childhood. Tom is a well-built character; he is fun and sees everything through a child point of view, which is what the reader sees because Tom is telling the story. Huck is the boy that everybody looks up to and that the boy that everybody wants to be. Overall this book was a great book that kept me reading it and wanting to read more."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Tom Sawyer demonstrates Mark Twain's unique style as an author. Despite the fact the language used in the novel may be hard to follow, I think the novel did a excellent job of explaining each of the character's feelings and difficulties by putting you in the person's shoes. I didn't think I would enjoy the novel after reading the first two chapters, bu then when the suspence of the storyline started to pick up, it was hard to put down. This book would be perfect for any teen or young adult due to the humor and action of the story."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"In this novel, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Tom is a very outgoing and adventurous twelve-year-old boy.

It was a quick, enjoyable read and it opened me up to Mark Twain. I have read one more since reading Tom Sawyer and bought a book on him.

Lovely!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is about a boy named Tom who gets into so much trouble. He also has many problems in his life like his mother passing away. Since then he had to live with dear Aunt Polly. Its hard for Aunt Polly because she is already raising her own kids Sid and Mary. His best friend is Huckleberry Finn. He is the key of getting Tom in trouble. One thing that makes his dear Aunt Polly angry is how he minipulates people he doesn't know. Huckleberry and Tom go through rough times together like the scene when Injun Joe murdered the doctor. Tom and Huckle were at the graveyard watching them burry the dead cat, but then realized that it was Injun Joe whom framed Mum which is Hucks close friend.I like this book because it has a lot of passion put into it. This book was made by Mark Twain and he wrote a lot about his childhood. The story is made about him but he adds a little fiction into it. The thing that made me cry a little, but I loved most was when Becky didn't come to school and Tom got worried beacause he had feelings for her. The event that really surprises me is that this story is filled which so much affection in it like friendship, violence, humor, or even romance between Becky and Tom. I think it matters on how much the family loves him because they do but they don't not show it a lot. Unlike Mary who cries when she sees Tom getting punished and when Aunt Polly hates to punish him.What I don't like about this book is that I don't like horror and some of the pranks and jokes are too old. The horror I don't like is when Injun Joe murders the doctor inside the grave and frames it on Mum. Which is really mean. But then, he is sent to court because Tom tells the story to the athorities. He tells them because he was there, whem Injun Joe tried to kill him. Then the pranks were the easier to do like putting a frog in soup, glue for paint, sour milk and even tricking people to do his work which I think is a funny and a great idea. I didn't like the part when Tom and Becky kissed because that was a little disgusting. But it was sad when she decided that they couldn't be together because she didn't like how Tom lied a lot and she was afraid that he would lie to her aswell."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"In the Mississippi village of St Petersburg,Tom Sawyer lives out a life of make believe adventure-as a pirate;Robin Hood putting Guy of Guisbourne to sword and as a notorious gentleman robber who insists on politeness towards women-all in the company of his best friends Joe Harper and-especially-vagabond outcast Huck Finn.But real adventures come when Tom and Huck witness Injun Joe murdering Dr Robinson at a grave robbing,his new found love for Becky Thatcher and being lost in a cave....inhabited by Injun Joe!!Why recap a tale we all know so well? To remind how GOOD it is!Whenever I hit a lull in reading-ie reading a string of books that are so dull I want to quit reading altogether-I dig out a classic like this that not only makes you realise how great books are, but gets better with every reading! AND Tom Sawyer SHOULD be read, as in all the numerous films, Tom and Huck and all of the villagers are never quite up to the ones you create in your own mind from reading. The actor may have 10 Oscars and a medium sized bank vault of awards-and good luck to him-BUT he's not my Tom or Huck orInjun Joe!Its tragic that kids get turned off of Tom Sawyer and other greats like it by pondorous spoon fed lessons and vapid asides by would be achedemics like 'this bit isn't PC or this scene represents a decent into hell and blah blah blah!!! IGNORE THEM!And when you've been left dead by Jonathan Frazen's or Peter Carey's latest 'masterpieces'take this wonderful, fabulous out, dust it off and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I loved this book I am in 2nd grade bur I did not have trouble reading it I strongly recomend this book"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"What makes this book so special is how much kids can learn from it, and how much adults need to remember from it. Tom Sawyer is ornery, saucy, proud, narcisstic and beloved by all. He is the kid I hated in grade school and high school but always wished I could be. He is a winner. What makes him win?He's smart and always has a plan. He knows how to manipulate people. He is coddled by his aunt and cousin. He gets his revenge when he seeks it. He doesn't care for church, school, or civilized life for that matter and brings all authority down to its knees by his sly trickery and pranks. He is able to get the prettiest girl in school to be his girlfriend. He leads... always.Some of his adventures include pirating with his friends on a deserted island with Huck and Joe, going to the cemetary at midnight with Huck and witnessing danger that adults would piss their pants seeing, and exploring a mysetrious cave with his sweetheart. Each time Tom is faced with adversity, he is able to come out of it all the more fortunate because of his cunning, determination, and winning attitude.So what did this boy teach me? Allow me to address it to you: Believe in yourself. Seek out life as an adventure filled with joy and excitment, and life's adventure will return excitement and joy to you.Tom Sawyer is an awesome classic. Its rich language and true to life dialogue gives us a priviliged view of life in the 1870s. A simpler time with simpler living, albeit some awful injustice toward blacks. And a word about reading revised editions with politically correct revisions. History shall be taught and slavery and the \\"N\\" word, as distateful as it is, is part of American history. Tom Sawyer should no way be altered for boys and girls. Be true to our classics. They were written for their time and should be understood as such. If you don't care to read them that way, you don't care to learn the true story which reflects true history. Truth, not lies, is what I preach. I think Tom Sawyer would agree."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Wonderfully written, and it's understandable why it's considered such a classic. There are some very memorable observations by Twain. He certainly captures what it's like being a kid in a way that it's still relevant today. Kinda brought me back to my own childhood.
