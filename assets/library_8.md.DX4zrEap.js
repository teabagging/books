During these parts, the authors came across as being a bit egoistic.In the second section, the book explores research the authors have conducted, and focuses on studies of monks, nuns, pentecostals and others in the midst of religious experiences, in which the authors inject a tracer and study their brains. This part is much more interesting. There is less philosophical fluff, and more exploration of research in interesting areas.Although I'm glad I read the book, it is hard to give a good rating because of the difference between the two sections. For a general review of brain functioning, seek other books.But the studies of brain scans of meditating nuns and Buddhists and people speaking tongues and so forth was quite interesting, along with conjectures as to how the brain functioning is giving a strong sense of reality to the religious experience.

The atheist holds beliefs just as passionately as a religious fundamentalist, but how does each individual decide what truth is? The English word \\"belief\\" comes from a German word meaning \\"to hold dear\\" or \\"to love.\\" Our beliefs guide every area of our lives; what we eat, who we vote for, whom we trust and how we worship or don't. Combining science, psychology and religion Why We Believe What We Believe examines how our brains convert our perceptions of the world into moral, religious, and political beliefs that determine the kinds of lives we live and fill us with a sense of meaning and purpose.These beliefs can be either constructive or destructive, but once they are in place it is difficult to challenge them. If you would like to examine your own belief system with the goal of living a happier, healthier, less biased life this book will give you a lot to think about. Authors Newberg and Waldman consider the Liar's Paradox, whether animals have beliefs, why superstitions are perceived as true, why political parties often seem to despise each other, why there is so much religious strife in the world, how placebos work, how simple it is to implant false memories and how easily many people can be led to commit acts they consider immoral. Newburg, a medical doctor compares the brain scans of Buddhists meditating, nuns praying, Pentecostal Christians speaking in tongues and even an atheist contemplating an image of God.The book is divided into three sections. \\"How the Brain Makes Our Reality\\" opens with a story that shows the power of belief. A man whose cancer goes into remission when he is given what he believes is a miracle cure later dies. His cancer returned shortly after he learned that a Food and Drug Administration report concluded that the medicine he received was ineffective. The book's second section, \\"Childhood Development and Morality\\", covers childhood beliefs and the gap between moral beliefs and actions in adults. The last section, \\"Spiritual Beliefs and the Brain\\", contains brain scan analyses and concludes with a chapter on how to become a \\"better believer\\"; providing a list of 27 biases to examine in your own life and (keep your mind open now) eight steps the CIA uses to teach its intelligence gathering analysts to be more clear thinking, wise and effective.Author Andrew Newberg, MD is a founder of a neurotheology, new interdisciplinary field of study. He is an Associate Professor in the department of Radiology and Psychology and an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. Mark Robert Waldman is an Associate Fellow at the Center for Spirituality and the Mind also at the University of Pennsylvania."},{"Title":"Why We Believe What We Believe: Uncovering Our Biological Need for Meaning, Spirituality, and Truth","review":"This is an important book and will make you think and challenge old beliefs if open.

Our technology can only measure and record empirical data as we observe from the outside as objectively as possible. Beliefs come from the mind whereas scientifically we are observing the brain, so science doesn't 'prove' or 'disprove' anything in this regard as it is personal and ultimately subjective - not external or material.This book was very insightful. There is, however, a bias towards thinking that we can be 'hardwired' to certain beliefs and this is a nature vs nurture argument. As we have free will, we do not have to be victims of circumstance although we can be predisposed towards, say, mental and physical illness or be encouraged towards either in our environment. If we use such bias, in the extreme it can be used to support negative eugenics."},{"Title":"Seismic Design of Buildings and Bridges for Civil and Structural Engineers","review":"Mr. Williams presentation is clear and easy to follow.

She doesn't just tell a story; she becomes a part of her story and brings the reader along with her. When you read it, read it with no distractions and soak in the words.Poet and Dancer tells the story of two cousins, Angel and Lara. When they first meet during childhood, Angel falls in love with Lara and never loves anyone else in the same way. Later, when they are reacquainted as adults, they become roommates and are inseperable and dependent on one another. The beautiful and alluring Lara sucks those around her into her magnetic aura. Conversely, Angel attaches herself to those around her that she holds dearest. Even as Lara struggles with obviously genetic psychological problems, her sensuality and allure to those around her does not diminish.Ruth Prawer Jhabvala tempts when she writes. She sets the reader up with a hint of sensual suspense between Angel and Lara that drives the novel to the end. In my opinion, the story of Lara and Angel could end in no other way."},{"Title":"Poet and Dancer","review":"I thought the relationships between Angel and the other characters got really boring after a while.

The imagery within the story was covered in a deep mist, but as a reader I wanted that mist there to distance me from the at times difficult scenarios the characters found themselves in.Be prepared for a heartbreak of an ending that will drag to you read another Jhabvala's.If you like this book, I HIGHLY recommend &quot;When FOX is a Thousand&quot; by Larissa Lai."},{"Title":"The Arabian Nights II: Sindbad and Other Popular Stories (Everyman's Library)","review":"This is a very rum publication. Five years previous to its appearance Husain Haddawy produced as 'The Arabian Nights' a translation of the earliest extant version of the text (thirteenth- or fourteenth-century), which contains only a fraction of the full text known from nineteenth-century editions. In a polemical preface he denounced the full version as a dilution of a great original by the addition of masses of alien and inferior material. It must subsequently have been pointed out to him that a version of the Arabian Nights that omitted the best known stories would disappoint readers; consequently he then produced the present volume, made up largely of the popular tales 'Sindbad the Sailor', 'Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves', and 'Aladdin and his Lamp' -- even though, as he points out in the preface, the original Arabic texts of 'Ali Baba' and 'Aladdin', if they ever existed, have never been found and we are dependent on an eighteenth-century French 'translation' that is a fine piece of literature but far from authentic. A reader who wants to go beyond Haddawy's first volume would be well advised to go straight to one of the translations of the complete text, which contains much fine material omitted from both Haddawy's volumes. Of these by far the best is the new one by Malcolm Lyons."},{"Title":"The Arabian Nights II: Sindbad and Other Popular Stories (Everyman's Library)","review":"When I have started reading this collection of Arabic stories I was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent translation.

Do not be deceived into believing that the stories are effulgent with simple innocence. In parts, there is mild violence and subtle obscenties. However subtle, one might still consider them inappropriate for children. To make it simple, if this was a movie it would be rated pg-13. This aspect aside, the stories flow smoothly with enthralling tales of adventure, magic, and of course the cliche themes of love.

As Haddawy explains, the need for this separate collection is made necessary by the Night's curious history....When the work was first written down in the 1400s, it was given the title \\"The 1,001 Nights\\"--the length of time Shahrazad beguiled King Shahrayar with her wondrous tales. Despite this lofty title, the early manuscripts uniformly end after about 300 nights. It appears no one in the Muslim world minded this inconsistency, and the number 1,001 was taken figuratively to mean \\"an infinite number.\\" When Europeans first \\"discovered\\" the work in the 1700s, however, they assumed these early manuscripts were incomplete and set out to \\"finish\\" the work by adding enough tales to reach the necessary 1,001 nights--drawn from other collections, folklore or brand-new stories written to order. Among these later additions are several stories that have, paradoxically, become some of the most famous, best-loved tales of all: Sindbad the Sailor, Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp, and Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves.This leads to a difficult situation when translating the Nights. If your goal is to accurately and authentically translate the work, do you include these subsequent stories? Although they may not have been part of the original manuscript, these tales have been associated with the Nights for 300 years... should that count for anything?When Haddawy first set out to translate the Nights, he chose not to include anything outside of the original core collection of tales. He made an excellent case for doing so--the original stories have a thematic uniformity and high literary merit, as they come from one of the greatest periods of Islamic literature. The subsequent stories, while entertaining, have a hodge-podge of ideas and themes and were quite often put together by literary hacks simply to take up space.Still, some of those stories are too good (and too popular) to abandon altogether. That brings us to Haddawy's follow-up volume that puts forth exquisite translations of a handful of stories that, while outside the original collection, have come to define the Nights for the general public. Included are Aladdin, Ali Baba, Sindbad and the story of Qamar al-Zaman. All of the virtues of the first volume are carried over to this one--the translation could not be improved upon and the introduction is excellent. Besides being authentic, Haddawy's renditions are also vivid and immediate, without any of the purple patches found in Burton or other Victorian translations. In fact, as a credit to Haddawy's skills as a translator, you can distinguish the subtle differences in tone and style between these stories, which came from separate sources. I don't know how to describe this other than to say that there are moments in Aladdin when you can feel the influence of the roughly contemporaneous Charles Perrault (natural enough since the story was first introduced in a French version of the Nights), which is not felt in, say, Sindbad (which was drawn from an Egyptian manuscript).This is a HUGELY enjoyable read that you will want to return to again and again."},{"Title":"The Arabian Nights II: Sindbad and Other Popular Stories (Everyman's Library)","review":"I absolutely love Hussein's two books.

A religious revival is a new beginning of obedience to God. It results in the backslidden person or church returning to its first love (Jesus), and in the conversion of sinners. God is involved in the revival process insofar as he providentially arranges for men and women to be encountered with the truth of the gospel. Yet a revival cannot take place without the cooperation of the penitent sinner, he or she must repent of their sins and seek the Lord with all their heart (Jeremiah 29:13). This understanding of a revival shows that Finney emphasizes the work of man right alongside the work of God, which would be anathema for Calvinists.Finney also stresses that people need many revivals. If our love grows cold, or our hearts become crusty, it is because we need to remember the height from which we have fallen and repent and do the things we did that led to our first revival. Finney contends that we need to be reconverted, or a person who was once a revived believer could end up in hell.He points out that a revival can be expected when God reveals to His people that the time is right for one. Also, when the Christian community and the clergy are united in their intense desire to see a revival that will bring about the salvation of the wicked, an awakening can be expected. Finney would also point out that the church would need to be open to God doing it any way He wants.He goes on to mention that in order to promote a revival, Christians should confess their sins one by one. Finney regards this as absolutely essential, since we committed them one by one, they need to be confessed and forsaken one by one. Moreover, it will do no good to merely confess them or to trust that over time, God will grant repentance unto life. God has mandated that we all repent of our sins of omission (things that we neglected to do, such as prayer, Bible reading, giving, self denial, etc) and our sins of commission (slander, lying, cheating, hypocrisy, and envy, among others).Beginning with page 342 of Lectures on Revival of Religion, Finney gives advice to Christians on how to respond when someone asks \\"What must I do to be saved?\\"His advice is to tell the sinner to change his mind about sin, to confess his sins and vow to forsake them, and to believe the gospel of Christ, that He died for us and rose again, and to submit to God completely.Unfortunately, it seems that Finney believes that a person may need to be reconverted again and again. It is hard to know if Finney is suggesting that a Christian may backslide to an unsaved condition and may need salvation again, or if the expression \\"reconvert\\" is merely an expression of being reconverted to a totally sold out lifestyle for Christ. Probably both, since Finney shows contempt for the idea that a person can be \\"once saved, always saved.\\" If this assessment is true, it would put Finney's understanding of the security of the believer in sharp contrast with Edwards, who would only assume the integrity of a revival experience if the person is faithful to the end.I should also say that Finney has a plain way of speaking (these lectures were delivered extemporaneously and transcribed), and he is also quite funny, especially in the lecture about the wrong things to say to a sinner on the verge of accpeting Christ.I recommend not only reading this book, but following Finney's steps in promoting revival in your own life (pages 31-44). But watch out for his erratic theological pronouncements (the need for Christian people to be reconverted again and again, his radical emphasis on man's role in salvation, and in his denial that revival is a supernatural work of God. Get past the theology and take his advice on the practical side of living an awakened life for Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Lectures on revivals of religion","review":"As a trained lawyer Finney's is very organised writer and the Title says Lectures. This is a clearly written and a very powerful book. Finney sees revival the way a farmer sees crops. You prepare the ground (heart), you plow (pray), plant seed(Word of God), you water (repent of sin) Trust God to give the growth. Not a book on over night jack in the bean stalk growth. But a timely book now as when first written. Read Finney auto Biography to more clearly understand the Second Great Awakening in America. The first being 1740-1750's Johnathan Edwards and George Whitefield's ministry. This book when read with Bible in Hand will do no harm and possibly much good. It is one of a dozen or more great books on religion that has had a great impact on my Christian life. You will be stirred if you read it. It is not perfect but written by a man trying to be perfect even a s God is perfect. A great Book on Sowing and Reaping. Note: Finney was not a get salvation lose salvation preacher. He did begin to believe it was possible for a man to chose to forsake Christ after having been converted. This required a active choice of unbelief not an accidental falling away or by sinning to much. This doctrine was a result of his seeing fruit that he thought was once gathered seeming to fall away back into unbelief. This Book will be a great blessing to who read and to all who read it like the Bereans searching the scriptures to see if it is true. W.A. Criswell wrote of one of his books \\"Reading this book is like eating fish, if you come to a bone you can't swallow, just chew around it.\\" So take advantage of this reprint Buy, Borrow it from some one who has it.

I feel so close to the main characters that I feel like I truly know them. Being a widow myself at a young age, I have had so many of the same feelings that the main character had. I don't know how the author can have such feeling for and understanding of her without having been there herself. She weaves such a complicated and heart warming plot. I feel like she is actually telling me the story."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"I have read a number of Charlotte Vale Allen's novels, and this is up there with the best of them, deserving to rank with Mood Indigo. The reader is involved emotionally--intensely, but without maudlin sentimentality. This is achieved through the very skilful treatment of the characters; they are so deftly drawn that one believes in them and cares about what happens to them, even the minor ones. Children are presented as real human beings; the boy Jesse, in particular, is movingly convincing and ultimately heroic. Kyra, the central character, is seen developing through growth in self-knowledge; this can be seen as the great theme of the whole novel. I don't mean to suggest that everything comes up roses for everyone, or that all the characters are charming feel-good types. There is a convincingly cold-blooded surgical technocrat, obviously drawn from life, who reminds me forcibly of some--by no means all--high-powered medical people I have encountered, and the immoral world of chequebook journalism is scathingly displayed. Parting Gifts is far from a preachy novel, but it looks honestly and compassionately at life and takes the side of authenticity and integrity against sneering arrogance and pretentiousness. It expands one's awareness, so that the reader is drawn into sharing the painful but necessary development of the sympathetic characters."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"Charlotte Vale Allen's latest novel, Parting Gifts, catches and holds your attention from the very first page. Kyra Latimer has just lost her huband, Gary, in an accident. Still reeling from the trageedy and the funereal, she returns to her apartment to find a young girl and an obviously neglected three year old in the lobby of her building, demanding to see her. Kyra has no idea who they are and is stunned when the girl, Jennifer claims that Kyra is her mother, Jesse her grandchild, and that she wants to Kyra to raise Jesse or she'll turn him over to foster care. Kyra agrees to take the child, and a marvelous story unfolds.Charlotte writes very convincingly of the challenges of raising a child who has been abused and neglected. Jesse is a character that you won't soon forget, an enchanting, wise beyond his years little boy, who thanks to the love and nurturing of Kyra and her family is able to learn to love and trust. The end of this book was heartwrenching. Both the characters and their stories will stay with you long after you've finished reading the book.I have read all 35 of Charlotte's books, and after each one have said that this is her best work so far. I had the same reaction at the end of Parting Gifts and urge everyone to read this book and any of the ones before it that you may have missed."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"Kyra Latimer lost her husband to a freak accident in Manhattan. She is in deep shock and cannot imagine how she will ever cope without the husband she loved so much. Now their plans for adopting a child would be gone forever. Until one day.A young woman appears out of the blue with a small boy in town. She says that she was the child Kyra gave up years ago, and that she is Jesse's grandmother. Kyra knows this isn't true at all, yet seeing the obvious neglect of the boy pulled at her heartstrings. Kyra agrees to keep Jesse then-and takes on an instant role as his mother.Jesse is no ordinary child as it turns out though, and Kyra no ordinary mom. Jesse becomes ill later on with the worst possible challenge-kidney failure. It is then that Kyra is forced to confront an impossible choice, and that is whether to honor her son's decision on not receiving medical treatment to save his life.A VERY absorbing book. I enjoyed every moment of reading it."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"I enjoyed this book and would not hesitate to recommend to others."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"From the opening line, &quot;The concierge called to say two police officers wanted to speak to her,&quot; Charlotte Vale Allen holds your attention as we enter the world of Kyra Latimer. Kyra has to face reality and conditions that are not easy to accept and doesn't have an hourglass figure: she's fat, real. Sorry, this isn't Harlequin romance dribble. &quot;Parting Gifts&quot; is gut-wrenching, funny, and informative (I cried and laughed once in the same chapter). Kyra's friends and family are real as well. I didn't want the book to end. The book will embrace your heart and then smash your emotions as you keep reading, unable to do anything as the story unfolds. Just like in real life. This book is brilliant and takes you to a place that you soon won't forget. You will hate some characters and love others. I've been an avid reader of Charlotte Vale Allen for years and this book is a winner!"},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"Charlotte Vale Allen engages the reader of Parting Gifts with a moving tale of the profits and losses of love. A family drama set mostly in late twentieth century London, Parting Gifts involves a theatrical extended family. Kyra, a large woman with a heart to match, first loses her pilot husband of 10 years in a hit-and-run accident outside their New York apartment. While she is mourning his loss, a young woman arrives on her doorstep with her \\"grandchild\\". Unable to have children, but anxious to build a family, Kyra adopts Jesse. Her three-year old son is temporarily mute, the victim of abuse and neglect. Kyra and Jesse move to London to welcome the support of her actress mother; director father; and twin actor brother. Kyra's costume design career flourishes as her son blossoms as a budding writer--published at age twelve. Allen involves the reader with the conflicts of a loving family and avoids the standard platitudes of love lost, while dealing with issues of abuse, death and serious illness. One hopes that this novel is not Allen's Parting Gifts for readers eager for more well-written tomes."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"I've read all of Charlotte Vale Allen's books and this one is as good as the best. She is by far one of my favorite writers of all time. She doesn't write 'about' characters, she literally becomes the characters in the story. I loved the complex, unorthodox family relationships in this story...and the touching way the book ended. It left me crying, thinking and meditating on the value of life, no matter how short it might be."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"The first 200 pages of this book are absolutely divine. Watching the newly widowed Kyra cope with the impishly extraordinary but sadly abused Jesse was pure magic for the heart, as was the fairy tale setting of the famous and accepting family. The dialogue was humourous and masterful; the scenes absolutely painted onto the pages. A commanding collection of characters only underscores Ms. Vale Allen's talent, although some of the very earliest characters all but disappear. The dynamics of the child/parent and parent/child relationships are skillfully (and sometimes quite breathtakingly) addressed. However, for this reader/mother, something went terribly amiss with the entire story when the medical dilemma appears. Without spoiling the ending (as some have done!), this reader could not get past what was presented as a viable choice. While modern medicine does indeed pose certain quality of life issues; I have personally seen that this is one of the arenas where there is so much hope, so many answers. The power of the will to live surely should/could have played into this and made a much richer and more believable statement. There is an interesting shifting in the last pages of this story, as well as the miracle of the parting gifts. But this reader is still struggling with the plausibility of the medical issues and decisions, and ultimately believes the story to be a bit past far fetched."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"I love Charlotte's books (owning them all) and Parting Gifts kept me reading until the end. The main character, Kyra, learns about raising children on the &quot;spur of the moment&quot;, as she adopts a small boy who is very wary of her and everyone else. This book is about choices, be it adult choices or childrens' choices. Charlotte is trying to make a point here and succeeds to the max."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"This was my 8th and last Charlotte Vale Allen book. My sister is a devoted fan of Ms. Vale Allen's works, and I've tried to share her love of Ms. Allen's plotting and characterazations. However, Ms. Vale Allen's improbable views towards parenting and the role that parents play in the lives of their children, leave much to be desired.Yes, there are flawed parents out there, and children who are far wiser than their family units. I'm all for realism in literature, but in eight novels, read at random, all with the protagonist being a potential victim of at the hands of a &quot;stupid&quot; mother and a &quot;brilliant but psychotic&quot; father; I'd have to say enough already!"},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"The New York City police inform Kyra Latimer that her spouse Gary died in an accident. A cab spun out of control, jumped the curb, the breaks failed and hit Gary as he was strolling to the bank.Unable to cope, Kyra barely makes it through the funeral when shock number two hits her in the solar plexus. Jennifer Cullen insists that she tracked down Kyra who is the mother who gave her up years at birth. Kyra insists the young woman is wrong, as that occurrence is impossible. However, Jennifer does not want anything from Kyra for herself. Instead she wants &quot;her mother&quot; to care for her &quot;grandson.&quot; Not willing to allow three-year-old Jesse to atrophy in state facilities, Kyra accepts the raising of the child. As Kyra and Jesse bond, illness threatens to take him away too.The EPA will want to ban PARTING GIFTS as a violation of the Paper Reduction Act because readers will need a rain forest worth of tissues. The characters are so very real, they can be you or me. The story line is charged with so much emotion that the reader empathetically shares it vicariously with the cast. Charlotte Vale Allen has written a heart-wrenching tale that reaches inside the souls of her audience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"This is the first book by this author that I've read. I have mixed feelings about it. It took place in London, my favorite city, but I had a couple of problems with the plot.It seems unbelievable that Kyra never told her twin brother, Kyle, the circumstances of Jesse's adoption at the time it happened.Mentions of Kyra's weight became boring. I don't think it needed to be brought up as often as it was.The ending was a surprise and completely unexpected. I re-read the last few chapters this morning just to be sure I got it right. I think I'll give it some time and read again."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"I have read all Vale Allen's books and eagerly awaited latest. Upon finishing same I am left with cold and angry emotions. I found the characters pretentious (including their names)and the little tragic hero (the most unreal). I believe no one would accept a child that is thrown at them as Jesse is cast upon Kyra with the unlikely story of his parentage. Given the state of Kyra's bereavement and her inability to bear children; falling for the sluttish harridan who claimed to be her daughter is totally farfetched. The child's abilities as conveyed by his intelligence, acquiring own attorney, literary skills and fame and his eventual demise due to his 12 year old judgment of his illness and subsequent treatment with the crowning glory of his mother finding a naked lady in his bed to teach him about life while it slowly seeps away,are incredulous. Kyra's relationships with her family and her self-imposed obesity to offset so-called fame does not make too much sense. The characters' sense of wittiness and daily language is tedious and contrived and the whole plot belongs in some sort of far-off planet that has no bearing upon any sensible aspects of life . I feel very discouraged at having to vent such strong emotions for one of my favorites. If there is anyone out there who feels the same way, please communicate."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"It fascinated me to see the negative reviews that complain angrily about the ending of this book. What seems obvious from these angry negatives is that these amateur reviewers are people who would insist on making their children's decisions, without regard for the wishes of the children. What is distinctive, always, about Allen's writing is that she's prepared to take risks that other, more commercial writers, would never dream of trying. She invariably has her characters behave in ways that are faithful to the narrative she has structured. Parting Gifts is a grown-up book that deals with grown-up issues: of the lasting effects of child abuse (which, as a former victim, she knows all too well), of the fears and concerns common to so many women, and, always, of the conflicts between mothers and daughters as well as the tangled ties that bind them together. This is a richly rewarding book, heartfelt and affecting, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"Kyra Latimer loses her husband in a traffic accident, and seems lost in a time warp. Even though they've only been married 10 years, she can't imagine her life without him. On the day of the funeral, an unwed teenage mother shows up at her door dragging an emaciated, filthy little boy named Jesse and claiming that according to her birth certificate copy, Kyra is actually her mother and that the boy is Kyra's grandson. Of course, Kyra knows that it can't be true because she is sterile. Kyra and her husband have tried unsuccessfully for years to adopt a child, and now that he's gone, she has nothing to show for their 10 years of marriage. The unwed mother insists that she can't keep the boy and tries to thrust him upon Kyra. Even while she is denying any relationship, something about the sad, neglected little boy reaches her heart, and she agrees to sign the papers on the spot and take custody of Jesse.Soon after her adoption of Jesse, Kyra decides to move back to London to be near her family, a fascinating set of characters from a renowned British theatrical family. Her mother is a famous actress, her twin brother Kyle an up and coming actor, and her father a director. Kyra is in the business too, as an award-winning costume designer. Kyra is an exceptional and unusual mother, and Jesse is an extraordinarily perceptive and precocious child who wins the hearts of all who surround him instantly. Everyone has high hopes for Jesse's future until a lingering malaise is diagnosed as a serious illness. The manner in which Jesse decides to deal with his illness is commendable but heart wrenching. Kyra is also dealing with her poor self-image and unwillingness to commit to a relationship with a famous director, James Elway.Charlotte Vale Allen builds remarkable characters who inhabit your life for the short while that it takes you to absorb the book. You wish to know these people forever, and turning the last page of the book is a kind of sadness in that you will have to say goodbye to them. I'm looking forward to reading other books by this author, who knows how to touch your heart and engage your imagination with believable, empathetic characters."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"I have read all of Charlotte Vale Allen's books and I would rank Parting Gifts at the top of the list. Her characters become so real that I can always put a face to them and I actually begin to think of actors who could easily portray them in the event that the books are made into movies. Sometimes the characters remind me of people in my own life. Parting Gifts is no exception. I loved the characters of Kyra and Jesse and their quirky relatives. I felt like I knew them and hated to see the story end. The book has a wonderful blend of sadness and comic relief. There are many plot twists and it keeps your interest until the end when everything unfolds. I can't wait for the next book..."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"Charlotte Vale Allen is one of my favorite authors, my passion for her work actually began, with Time Steps, which I have read at least 3 times. Parting Gifts, I will read again, and again. Charlotte deals with very sensitive subject matter with deep insight, compassion &amp; understanding. The subjest of keeping someone alive at all costs, is a subject close to my own heart. I literally crawled inside the hearts and minds of Kyra and Jesse, which is the true gift of Charlotte's writing.Jesse was an exceptionally brilliant child, with talent and knowlege, far beyond his years.Something that has been touched upon before, by parents &amp; guardians of abused &amp; terminally ill children. Just as people have different tastes in food, some have different tastes in authors and books. For those who have criticized, PARTING GIFTS, it is obviouse that that is not the &quot;dish&quot; you expected. So instead of criticizing something you could not even begin to &quot;prepare&quot; yourself, please be polite enough to excuse yourself from the table, and hit the &quot;Taco Bell&quot; of your choice. PARTING GIFTS, is a repast for the heart and soul, from the &quot;cuisine expert&quot; on writing, CHARLOTTE VALE ALLEN."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"This book is the kind that starts out a bit slow then picks up speed as you go along. The background information given in the beginning is essential as the story progresses.It is a fiction story with a non-fiction real life feel to it. I laughed and cried with the characters. It even has a few of those life's mysteries inserted through out to keep you wondering what will happen next."},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"I always look forward to a new Charlotte Vale Allen book as an escape from the stresses of everyday life, and a well written, well researched one at that. &quot;Parting Gifts&quot; certainly met the high standards that I've come to expect from the Vale Allen repetoire. The characters came alive and made me care about what happened to them. The setting of the English theater family brought to mind the Redgraves or the Mills, and was fascinating. The word pictures she paints are vivid. Allen's backdrop of the illness of Jesse as part of the storyline gives the reader some insight into what patients and parents go through in situations like these without becoming 'sappy'. Again, she has researched her topic as she did the vaudeville era in &quot;Timesteps&quot;. I highly recommend this as a good read with a nice glass of wine or cup of cocoa before the fire. You deserve it!"},{"Title":"Parting Gifts","review":"Charlotte Vale Allen has been absent for a few years and this book more than makes up for that absence.As with all of Allen's characters these people jump right at you with their reality. You laugh with them,cry with them and want to be there to share their lives. It is definitely a good read! Kyra and her family are the lovable family we all have desired.Their closeness,in spite of their differences,make them more charming..The interrelationships between the family and the other characters make this an even more likeable book.Jesse,who is dear from the start,develops into a many faceted child. His ties with both his family and extended family make him more endearing as the book develops.After enduring many problems even the ending is able to leave you feeling happy. Charlotte has done extensive research prior to writing this book and it is quite obvious in the reading.

I couldn't wait to begin this title shoving away others which were waiting. By about page 60, I found myself sadly disppaointed. Yes, the book and its various plots had all of the elements long time readers of Allens are familair with but for some reason this time the book didn't appeal to me. While the premise isn't an entirely new one, there was nothing special about this title which made me want to continue reading it. As a matter of fact, in the face of some terrible problems which should make one care, I found Allens characters to be wooden and never felt as though I knew them or wanted to. And the medical portion of the book was a bit much for this type of book, I thought. All in all compared to one of my favorite books by Allen, Leftover Dreams, the end of this book was a welcome parting gift."},{"Title":"Las Vegas As It Began As It Grew","review":"Very interesting history that I enjoyed thoroughly.

He is no longer satisfied with being an Assistant Pig-Keeper (well, he never was, but he's less so than ever), because he is completely head-over-heels in love with Princess Eilonwy (well, who wouldn't be?), and he hopes that his parents were of high enough lineage to make him worthy of her. What he discovers, however, is something poets and storytellers have been telling us for centuries--true nobility is in how you act, not in who your parents are. Finally Taran discovers his father--or is it his father? Since being a shepherd is not much better than being an Assistant Pig-Keeper (probably worse, since the pig was the oracular pig Hen Wen), Taran would just as soon that he wasn't. But if Taran (and hopefully the reader) has learned anything by this point in the series, it is that if you want to be and not merely appear a hero, you have to accept reality as it is, and not just as you want it to be.This is not as exciting as some of the others in the series, but is an indispensable prelude to the magnificent finale, _The High King_."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"The series turns more serious with this volume, as Taran begins to search out his place in the world, trying to find a family and a calling. Full of wonderful moments, great adventure, lyrical descriptions, and character growth. I can't recommend this series too highly; more accessible to younger readers than Lord of the Rings, it occupies the same region of High Fantasy, but never talks down to them or over their heads."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"This book contains a great lesson not only for Taran, but for us as well. The worth of a man doesn't hinge on his rank; both a good king and a good commoner have something to give to the world, and who's to say one is more important than the other. In this book Taran goes out in search of his past, hoping to find he is of noble birth in order to ask for the hand of the Lady Eilonwy.

And like him, I have desperately yearned for things beyond my reach. Who says this is just a children's book?"},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"One of the great joys of Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles series is the steady progression from lighthearted children's fantasy to more adult themes and a grimmer tone, allowing the reader to grow along with the characters. By the end, you feel as if the characters have taken a lifetime of journeys, learning from them as they went.This is very much front and center in \\"Taran Wanderer,\\" a sad, lonely tale of Taran's quest to find out who he truly is. While appropriate for all ages and sure to be enjoyed by young readers, older readers will find the harrowing decisions Taran has to make gripping and heart-wrenching.Because Alexander draws his stories from ancient myth and legend, the themes and situations here will feel familiar, like stories you've read many times before. Yet that never comes across in a tiresome way. It's a story that operates in a welcome comfort zone, nice in a time when so many books try so hard to be different solely for the sake of being different. The story told in \\"Taran Wanderer\\" is a timeless tale because of its familiarity and will engage readers for many years to come.The focus here is more strongly on Taran than in any other volume, though the rest of the cast of characters returns: Eilonwy the stereotypical spoiled princess, Gurgi the crazed Gollum-like creature, and Fflewddur Fflam the hapless bard who is prone to exaggeration. Others from the past also rear their heads.The pacing in this, the fourth of five books, is more deliberate. Some would say slow, but this being the type of story it is, that would be an unfair description. Rather, it lingers in Taran's quest and Taran's sadness and uncertainty.\\"Taran Wanderer\\" and the rest of the Prydain Chronicles are recommended reading for anyone who enjoys fantasy, especially classic children's fantasy, walking the fine line between being accessible to young readers and being appealing and engaging enough for adults to enjoy."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"With all respect to Ms. Rowling, this is one of the best Fantasy Series.

Only Gurgi goes with him, though the two do meet up with an old friend or two eventually. Taran learns where he may be able to find the answers he seeks, and sets off to do so, but finds himself entangled in a number of complications along the way that teach him valuable lessons about the meaning of life, and his place in it. It's good stuff, as usual, though the book eventually takes on an episodic feel that none of the others has; get into a situation, learn a lesson, get into another situation, etc. There's no overlap, which is kind of odd, and made like the book less than those that came before it; still, if you've journeyed this far with Taran and Gurgi, you certainly shouldn't stop now. ***"},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"A friend of my father's brought me a box full of used books when I was 9 or 10.

Indeed, I believe many authors of modern adult fantasy would greatly benefit from studying Mr. Alexanders writing style.I credit this series for the beginning of my 25+ years of affection for Celtic, Gaelic, and Welsh mythology and would strongly recommend this series for any lover, young and old, of fantasy and mythology."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"The novel Taran Wanderer is a sequel to The Book Of Three, The Black Cauldron, and The Castle Of Llyr. In the book Taran, assistant pig keeper, wants to find his parrents so he can be nobel blood and marry the princess. Lloyd Alexander has taken characters from other books and put them in to this novel. Taran goes through lots of adventure and in the end finds out who he is. It is not the best out of the series of 5 books but it is worth reading. I rated it a 3."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"This is probably my least favorite of the Prydain Chronicles. Don't get me wrong though, I liked it, just not as much as the others. I thought it moved slower than the others, and also Eilonwy was left out of the book, and she was always the highlight for me. Anyway, the basic plot of the book was that Taran at last cannot stand not knowing who his parants were, so he goes on a personal quest to try discover his identity. He hopes to find out he is from noble birth because then he can marry Eilonwy, but what he finds isn't exactly what he thought... So, in general this was a great book that asks the ultimate moral question and deals with the truth that it isn't who your parants are the make you you. This is an excellent series that I would recommend to anyone, though it would make more sense if you had read the previous four first."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"I think it was really amazing.I got hooked on the book of three and had to read them all. i am just finishing the high king. i recommend them."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"The Chronicles of Prydain is my favorite series of young adult writing. I highly recommend this series to any child or adult who likes Harry Potter or any other series of fantasy fiction. Taran Wanderer is my favorite of the series because it brings into view the changes the main character has made in the three previous books and sets the stage for the final episode. A wonderful book about the journey to find 'self'."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"In many ways, this forth book in Lloyd Alexander's \\"The Chronicles of Prydain,\\" is the odd one out. It is the only story that does not pit our characters against the forces of supernatural evil (well, except in one small instance). It is the only installment in which Princess Elionwy is completely absent. It is the only story that has no clear destination in its quest narrative. Even the title is a little different, lacking the usual \\"The\\" before the noun.Rather than pitting the forces of good against evil, \\"Taran Wanderer\\" is about the journey of self-discovery, making it a much steadier-paced, introspective book. Although some readers may feel that it's less exciting than the preceding books, discerning children will find many hidden rewards here. The core of this series has always been the growth of Taran from a somewhat foolish, hapless boy into a man, and with each consecutive book he learns a little more about himself and the world around him. \\"Taran Wanderer\\" is the book in which Taran fully steps into manhood.With the intention to ask Princess Elionwy to marry him when she returns from her training on the Isle of Mona, Taran desires to learn more about his heritage. Having never known his parents, he harbours a secret wish that he has noble-blood in his veins, and on gaining Dallben's permission, he sets out to discover the identity of his parents and find his place in the world. His only companion is the faithful Gurgi; not-quite-a-man, not-quite-an-animal, and best described as a benevolent version of Gollum.On his travels he learns of the mysterious Mirror of Llunet which is said to show the true self of anyone who stares into it. With this as his somewhat vague goal, Taran heads out into the world. What follows is not so much a single overarching story, but a series of encounters and problems in which Taran has to solve with his wit, compassion, bravery, common sense, and only occasionally his physical strength. From feuding lords to evil wizards, lawless mercenaries to the lessons of forge, loom and potter's wheel, each life experience leads him closer to who he really is.Yet Alexander also finds time to add commentary on the human condition, and it his greatest achievement that he manages to do so (not just here, but in his other books) that it is done subtly and wisely, rather than just by slapping a moral on the end of every sentence. Taran comes up against the amorality of an outlaw, the injustice of a warlord, the arrogance of a wizard, and the simple dishonesty of a shepherd, and yet never relinquishes his own integrity, even as he faces fear, shame, and bitter disappointment.But it's not all doom and gloom: there's plenty of room for humour, wonder and hope, usually obtained in the presence of Taran's beloved companions: faithful Gurgi, the wandering bard Fflewdur Fflam (who carries a harp who snaps a string every time he tells a lie), the grouchy dwarf Doli and the mischievous talking-crow Kaw (my own favourite!)Another aspect worthy of note is that Prydain itself (based on the myths and legends of Wales) is explored in more detail than in previous books. Whilst we've previously dealt with castles and princes, warlords and enchanters, we now get a look into the more humble - and more important - inhabitants of this imaginary world. The reader learns much from the simplest of folk, including kindness to animals, respect to elders, the beauty of nature, and the simple pleasures of good food and a warm hearth.However, some of the \\"special features\\" of the book are a little disappointing: specifically, an incomplete pronunciation guide and a truly hideous map of Prydain that looks as though it was drawn by a three-year old (seriously, the rivers look like random scribbles). Yet the current edition of the series has new cover-art by the gifted David Wyatt, so if there was ever a time to invest in the complete collection, now is it.\\"Taran Wanderer\\" is enlightening, bittersweet, joyful, thought-provoking and timeless. At its conclusion, all the pieces are in place for the final installment in this series:The High King (The Chronicles of Prydain), a book which is as close to perfection as you'll ever get in children's literature. Seriously."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"A nice fit between the fairy tale innocence of Lewis' Narnia and the epic saga of Tolkien's Middle-earth. Fun to read, with some good morals woven into it."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"Of the five splendid books in the Prydain Chronicles by Lloyd Alexander, my favorite is the fourth, TARAN WANDERER.The previous three books: THE BOOK OF THREE, THE BLACK CAULDRON and THE CASTLE OF LLYR are superb fantasy for children. They share a common theme that nothing comes without work or sacrifice and show that glory is less fine than friendship. The final book, THE HIGH KING, picks up this theme again as the struggle between good and evil is played out to the end.Just as its title is different TARAN WANDERER is different. Here our young hero, the orphan boy Taran, is growing from a boy to a man. Suddenly he is aware of the gap in rank between himself and his childhood friend Princess Eilonwy; suddenly he knows he loves her but can never marry her unless he has land or rank to offer in turn. So he leaves the only home he has known, the farm of the enchanter Dallben and sets out on a quest to discover the truth of his origins. Was he high-born or low?This book is different. Always before when Taran set out with his friends to find some magical item, he would find the unexpected. While some chapters might be grim the quest was always lighthearted and the comrades always entertaining. Here Taran sets out not knowing what he is looking for and he finds the commonplace. The challenge that Taran faces is one that most adults are familiar with: one can search for Truth, but it is not always to be found. Disappointment is part of life and must be faced. Taran's search takes him from the magical marshes of Morva to the rude hut of a shepherd, from evil sorcerer's stronghold to the campfires of a bandit gang. He searches the length and breadth of Prydain and does not find his parents. He does discover the common people of Prydain, how they live and work and love and comes to the realization that nobility is not necessarily found in marble halls.I have loved this book since I first read it more than forty years ago; I love it still. Great fantasy for all ages and all times. A real classic, as are all the books of Prydain. If you have not yet visited this magical kingdom loosely based on Welsh mythology, you have missed a real treat."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"I have been a fan of the Prydain series since I first read them in junior high long, long ago. At the time, had you asked me which book was my favorite, I would have said The Black Cauldron. My least favorite would have been Taran Wanderer. But as I grew older and reread the series several times at different stages in my life, I found myself developing a fondness for Taran Wanderer and today I would say it is my favorite of the series.I cannot say for certain, but when I read the book, I get the feeling that it is not really written for independent readers and early teens. They will, of course, find much to enjoy in it between the memorable characters and the occasional action scene. But I feel that it is a book best enjoyed by those who have already embarked on their own quest in search of who they truly are. Until a person has walked that line between youthful innocence and adult responsibility, the nuances of this book are not fully revealed. At least they weren't for me. But now that I have grown up and had to discover who I am, this particular story has a poignancy that it lacked when I was twelve years old. It was a good book then but it is a better book now and its greatest strength is that it is a book that has meaning and substance no matter how old the reader may be."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"This is the 4th book in a series called &quot;The Prydain Chronicles.&quot; This book is about Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper, and his quest for himself. His quest is to find his parents and to gain the hand of the Princess Eilonwy. When he goes to see the Witches in the Marches of Morva they send him on a wild goose chase to seek the Mirror of Llunet. On the way he gets himself into crazy situations and he finds creative solutions for complicated problems.I really liked this book because it's easy to read when it is really late and you are very tired. There aren't a lot of hard words so you don't have to think, and you can just read for the fun of it. I also liked this book because I liked the way he creatively dealed with his and others problems. I never would of thought of some of his solutions.I would definately read this book and the other three books before this one in the series because they are classic children's literature. Your probably saying to yourself &quot;But I'll look silly reading childrens books!&quot; Everyone should indulge their inner child. Especially an inner child with a love for adventure!"},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"In Taran Wanderer, Taran sets out to find out exactly who he is. It has less action than the earlier three books (or the fifth book), but it's still fun to adventure through Prydain and let Taran develop into a man."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"Taran has finally admitted his feeling for the Princess Eilonwy. The problem now is that he doesn't believe that his bloodlines are worthy of her. She is a princess after all, and he is but a lowly assistant pig keeper, a orphan that does not know where he really came from. So he sets of with the ever faithful Gurgi as his companion in a quest to find out who he is.We are visited by several old friends from previous books in the series and introduced to a handful of new bad guys. I have to say the bad guys are getting better - or more badder? - as the series progresses and more and more inventive plans are needed to foil their plots.Taran learns much about himself through his journey and learns some very important lessons along the way, with one of the most important being about who he really is. I loved the sorcerer, Morda. It seems all of man's faults are wrapped up quite nicely in one little package. Fflewddur returns with Llyan, such a wonderful friend that manages to save the day at least once. Kaw, the pesky crow shows us that help comes from the least likely places. And of course the faithful Gurgi, the best friend Taran could ever have is along for the ride.I think this will have to be my favorite so far in the series. With just one more left, The High King, I can't wait to see how everything ends.4/5"},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"In my opinion, this was the best book in the series by far. I liked how there were kind of different parts to the book - first starting with the three \\"hags\\", then moving on to Doli and his problem, and so on. It was almost like a storybook with different stories in it. I especially liked the part where he was staying at that guy's house.( I forget his name. It was Llonio, I beleive.) This book does not have a lot of action, but I like it because it gives us a chance to get to know Taran better."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"Taran Wanderer is the fourth book in Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain. The book is a tale of Taran's journey to find his identity. He hopes to find that he is of noble blood, and thus worthy to ask for the Princess Eilonwy's hand in marriage. With only the perpetually anxious, yet always faithful almost-but-not-quite-human creature Gurgi as his companion, Taran sets off across the length of Prydain in search of answers. Along the way he meets old friends from the earlier books who join him on his quest: Fflewddur Fflam, the bard-king with a habit of embellishing his own bravery and accomplishment; Doli, the bad tempered, yet dutiful dwarf, and Kaw, the talking crow.The friends face many adventures, including a search for lost cattle, battles with a group of bandits, and an escape from an enchanter who has the power to turn men into animals. However, the greatest conflicts that Taran faces are within himself. In a variety of ways, Taran is offered the noble name that would make it easy to marry the princess, but at a cost of losing her respect. In the end, Taran learns more about his true identity than he ever hoped, but in a most unexpected fashion.The book is even more skillfully written than the three previous in the series. Every scene in the book ties tightly together. It makes for an exciting tale and a compelling presentation of the themes that recur throughout the Chronicles. Among these are: that the most valuable things in life are easily overlooked, that a useful and productive peace is more glorious than victory in battle, and that sometimes, the key to finding oneself is to be willing to sacrifice everything."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"This book is probably my favorite of all the Prydain Chronicles . . . It's maybe not as intense as some of the others are, but I love how Taran travels around and meets so many interesting characters and learns to view life differently by seeing how they live and view their own lives.

So far this is the best one of the series. The first two book were great, but this is even better. The main character, a boy named Taran, is looking for the truth and he learns that the truth can play with you. It's a very unusual book, you won't find many like this.Taran Wanderer is an amazing fantasy adventure book. It's got magic, enchantment, a few funny parts, and suspense. It has a grumpy dwarf named Doli. Doli is the kind of person who always turns up at the exact right moment. Taran is an adventurous boy who tries to gather wisdom and friends wherever he can find them. He goes on several quests. My favorite part is chapter eight, when Taran meets the magician, Morda. It's scary and has an unusual ending.I read this book in less than a week. It just took me captive! I don't want to give away the plot, because I don't want to spoil it.

One obvious difference is that Eilonwy does not appear in the book (except in the thoughts of the other characters). Another is that this book does not contribute to the ongoing battle between Taran and his friends and the forces of Arawn of Annuvin. This book is Taran's adventure of self-discovery, as he traverses the land of Prydain in search of his roots, a search which takes him from the Marshes of Morva, through the kindom of Smoit, and on to the land of the Free Commots."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"I read many Newbery Award winners as a child, and none has affected me as much as &quot;Taran Wanderer,&quot; the penultimate book in Lloyd Alexander's &quot;Pyrdain&quot; series. I was fortunate enough to have found the book at age 12, and the protagonist's coming of age experience paralleled my own coming of age as a reader. Although the first three installments in the &quot;Pyrdain Chronicles&quot; are beautifully written children's fantasies that teach important life lessons, &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; possesses a maturity and complexity making it the jewel of the series. No longer seeking magical cauldrons and oracular pigs, Taran embarks upon a vague quest for self discovery that finds him engaging in lackluster tasks such as weaving and pottery-making that rarely appear in a children's fantasy. While &quot;Wanderer&quot; still contains the requisite evil wizards, talking crows, and magic harps, somehow Pyrdain has become a less black-and-white world. After reading &quot;Taran Wanderer,&quot; both Taran and myself were no longer children, and the action-packed finale of the &quot;High King,&quot; despite being wildly entertaining, could not recapture the innocence of the earlier books. The work introduced me to an adult world demanding diffuclt choices and temperance, a world which sadly replaced the delightful child's land where a magic sword could vanquish evil. However, despite this sacrifice, Taran's journey is one worth making, and Lloyd Alexander gracefully introduces his young readers into an adult world surrounded by a subtler type of magic. Ten years later as a computer science graduate student, I can honestly say that the impact of &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; has not faded."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"I have read these books before when I was a lot younger, and recently I decided to read them again, after I bought the set for Christmas.

Taran defeats the wizard and he turns Dolly back into a dwarf."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"The Prydain series takes a turn for the introspective with this particular book in the series. Throughout the series our hero, Taran, has been sort of an everyboy. He's never physically described in the books, a fact I've always ascribed to the notion that the guys reading the books can picture him as themselves. Up until \\"Taran Wanderer\\", the boy's been alternately foolish and brave. In this particular adventure, however, author Lloyd Alexander decides to do an old fashioned boy-learning-to-be-a-man storyline. Though the writing is fairly fine, in the end this stands as probably one of the weaker books in the Prydain series.As the book opens, we see Taran attempting to come to grips with two things. On the one hand, he has decided that he loves Eilonwy. On the other hand, he wants to know who he parents are. Unfortunately for the reader, Eilonwy remains in this story only as a pretty memory in Taran's mind. She never actually appears in the narrative. That leaves the parentage quest. Taran has decided that he is probably descended from noble lineage. Now, you might think this to be a pretty egotistical idea on Taran's part. But when you consider that roughly 50% of the people Taran comes into contact with in his adventures are either kings, princesses, or princes, it's not that crazy a notion. This series is rife with royalty. Setting off away from his beloved Caer Dalben with the faithful Gurgi in tow, Taran goes to find his destiny. What he finds instead is who he is as a person.As I mentioned before, Eilonwy is missing from this book, and this is a serious failing. With Taran lovestruck and doe-eyed, the girl's caustic wit and good sense are sorely lacking. We get plenty of adorable Gurgi and funny Fflewddur and even a bit of Dolbi, but Eilonwy's space cannot be filled. The fact of the matter is, she always used to temper Taran's melodramatic musings and monologues. With her gone, Taran launches into huge bouts of self-pity and depression without respite. Other small flaws concern the finish of the tale. Though the ending is meant to give the reader an important, rather than easy, finale, it comes off as slightly disappointing. That's the problem with a book that's supposed to be \\"meaningful\\". If you haven't a good sense of humor and ability to laugh at yourself, what good are you to the reader? Taran's so doggone EARNEST all the time. You just wanna slap the little guy and tell him to lighten up. I'm sure Eilonwy would. If she were around.Though the action and swashbuckling abound in this tale, it's not the same. I was disappointed in this particular installment. I'm certain it has its admirers, and certainly it's a fine book. The fact that it doesn't live up to its fellow books in the series doesn't mean it isn't worthy reading. Just don't expect to be blown away."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"Pig boy has status envy and the horn.So, not thinking he can do a princess he goes off instead, and has some magical animal stuff happen again, this time, in the form of a cow.

Like many of us, Taran wanders through life, searching for who he really is. Unlike many of us, in this book, he actually finds out. If you are a wanderer, seize this series of books.

Of course, truth is relative and Taran doesn't get a totally satisfying answer.My favorite part of this book are Taran's interactions with the Free Commots, people at ease with themselves and each other, who allow Taran to be whoever/whatever he wants to be.In Wanderer, Taran becomes a man, leaving behind most of his more childish ways.

It clearly shows how Taran matures from a stubborn boy into a thoughtful, courageous young man. The lessons he learns are full of truth for all people, but the book never preaches.

I believe I read somewhere that this was actually written AFTER Lloyd Alexander finished a complete draft of The High King, and then he wrote this because he decided Taran's character needed some more development. This story takes longer to get through than any other, which is not a big deal for me today, but the first time I read this series when I was maybe 13 (which is really a LOT closer to the audience I suspect Lloyd Alexander had in mind when he wrote the Chronicles of Prydain series), it felt really long. Anyway, aside from the relative length (which is both a good and bad thing), this book has the same strengths and weaknesses as all the series: The weakness is the plot is a bit contrived compared to the very best fantasy novels I've ever read (Tolkien), though I've certainly read fantasy books with bigger plot holes as well, and the plot here is probably tighter than in any of the other books in this series. In contrast, even though these are relatively short books that were probably aimed for kids in middle school, the main characters have depth, staying power, and evolve through each book, and there are basic moral themes present throughout every book (for example power leads to temptation and corruption) that seem even more relevant to me now nearly 20 years after I had to read &#34;The Book of Three&#34; in school. Highly recommended for anyone in the target audience, and still a decent (if short) read for an adult."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"I think this is probably my favorite book in the Prydain series. It is the book in which Taran grows from a boy to a man, in a much more real sense than in any of the prior novels.

All the books are wonderful, but Taran Wanderer has always been my favorite. It has a different tone than the other books. In Taran Wanderer, Taran sets out on his own to discover what he should do with his life. There is something noble, profound, and a little lonely, about this kid wandering around on his own, with only his horse and Gurgi, trying to figure out what type of man he should become. This book is more thoughtful and moving than the other books, and sets the scene for the big finale in The High King."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"The fourth book in the Chronicles of Prydain finds the hero Taran in a state of frustration. In the last book, he discovered his love for Eilonwy. She is now far away on the island of Mona learning to be a princess. He'd like to marry her but he does not know who his parents are. He fears he will be unworthy of her hand if he is lowly born. He sets off to discover whether he has noble or peasant blood in his veins. Thus Taran, assistant pig-keeper, is transformed into Taran Wanderer. He soon finds out that the Mirror of Llunet (forgotten somewhere in the Cantrevs countryside) reveals one's true identity. He hopes to discover a royal origin so he can marry the princess. But he will have many adventures on his way.The book moves at a brisk pace from adventure to adventure, slowly building up Taran's character as he learns much more about the world he lives in and consequently about himself. The descriptions are delightful even if some of the names seem unpronounceable. The ending is satisfying except for one hanging plot thread which I hope is resolved in the final book, The High King. I was going to read something else in between but now I'm continuing on to the next volume."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"This was still a very good story because it is involved with the famous classic Chronicles of Prydain, but the main reason why I did not like this as much as the other books mainly was like the reason for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In the story line, there was just too much traveling for one person to contain, as Taran looks around the entire realm to find out who he really is and who his parents were. This was altogether a good story, but not as much action to keep me in suspense. But I still recommend this if you can tolerate long traveling chapters."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"The book was written in the late sixties for children to be read (that is: not to be interpreted by film makers). The language is very well suited for this purpose.I read the 5 books that make up the Chronicles of Prydain in the late seventies, then read then to my sons in the late eighties, then had then in my elementary class in the nineties. If all the children had to mark these Lloyd Alexanden works, I'm sure they would give it top marks - so much so, that one of the five got 'lost' in my class: Taran Wanderer.Now I've got Taran back, and the book is still very readable. The quest is as big as any other fantasy book, but the humour that shines through is greater, the moods more subtle. Alexander once said (Author's note in The Castle of Llyr) that \\"The nature of fantasy allows happenings which reveal most clearly our own frailties and our own strengths. The inhabitants of Prydain are fantasy figures: I hope they are also human\\".If you measure how real people are by the times they crop up in idle chit-chat in your family, Taran, Eilonwy, Gurgi and Fflewddur Fflam are as alive now as they were when I started reading their story to my sons 30 years ago.I suggest you and your (grand)children enjoy all five books:- The Book of Three- The Black Cauldron- The Castlde of Llyr- Taram Wanderer- The High King"},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"This is my favorite book in The Prydain Chronicles! Alexander dedicates it to \\"For Wanderers still journeying, for Wanderers still at rest.\\" More than any of the other books, this one makes me think of The Wizard of Oz with its routine introduction of new characters and settings. In this way, Alexander has found an ideal way to introduce readers to the varied landscapes of Prydain. Herein, you cannot help but fail to appreciate Alexander's ease in handling descriptions.Cantrev Cadiffor: \\"The countryside had long since changed from gray moors to green meadows and pleasantly wooded lands with farmholds nestled in the clearings.\\"Caer Cadarn: \\"Unlike the palisaded strongholds of the cantrev lords, Smoit's castle was a fortress with halls of hewn stone and iron-studded gates thick enough to withstand all attack.\\"Hill Cantrevs: \\" The farmstead Taran saw to be a stumble down cottage, whose walls of stone, delved from the surrounding fields, had partly fallen away.... In the midst of the high summits, hemmed in closely by thorny brush and scrub, the farm stood lorn and desolate.\\"Free Commots: \\"This was the land of the free commots, of cottages clustering in loose circles, rimmed by cultivating fields and pastures.\\"The place Taran most seeks however is the Mirror of Llunet, which can be found in the Llawgadarn. The significance of Its description, which I won't reveal here, lies in what it reveals to Taran.Like Dorothy, who in The Wizard of Oz seeks a way home, Taran wanders in search of his identity. Taran hopes to find that he is of a royal lineage, so that he might propose to Eilonwy whom he deeply loves. While seeking his lineage, he learns many truths:* The secret of luck is to sharpen one's wit to use what falls into one's hands.* Life is a forge. Metal is worthless till it's shaped and tempered.* One's lives and days intertwine; Wise is he who can see the pattern.* Nothing is ever lost, but comes back in one shape or another.The most important truth, which I won't reveal here, lies in what the Mirror of Llunet tells Taran about his parentage. When upon meeting the herdsman Craddoc, Taran learns that he might have finally found his father. What will his reaction reveal about Taran as a person? To find out, you must travel along with Taran on his journey in Taran Wanderer."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"I was a little guy when I first came across the Prydain Chronicles. I had long since lost the books and had forgotten that they even existed. And then one day I saw &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; on sale for 25 cents at a Garage Sale. Right away my mind jumped back to my youth. Needless, to say I bought the book as well as the complete set. Now that I am an adult I am amazed at how inspiring the books are. There is so much behind the words written in these books and I am grateful that I took the time to re-read them 15 years later! I think the idea of Taran searching for his history is reflective of many things in the lives of all people - young and old! There is a magic to these pages that I hope will not become a rarity in books written by todays authors. Alexander doesn't write books, he creates visions. I'm just glad that he decided to share his visions with many others."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"Taran Wanderer, the fourth book of the Prydain chronicles, is, in my opinion, the best book in a wonderful series.All four books focus on the character of Taran of Caer Dallben, an orphan who is raised by a wizard (Dallben). The plot of Taran Wanderer focuses on Taran's quest to find out who his parents were. Taran hopes that he will find that he has the &quot;noble&quot; blood that he believes would give him the right to ask the Princess Eilonwy to wed him.Needless to say, he does not have an easy time, wandering the length and breadth of Prydain searching for parents he does not know, who can barely remember him.The book's joy, however, does not lie only in its plot, but also in the development that Taran undergoes through the course of the book. In Taran Wanderer, more than any other book, Taran grows into manhood. The trials he passes through temper and shape him, as he journeys through both familiar and strange lands. His experiences teach him lessons, but he learns even more from the people he meets.Make no mistake. This is not a pure novel of character. Taran travels from one end of Prydain to the other, meeting kings and wizards, and also farmers and tradesmen. Along the way, he has many adventures and faces many hardships. As said earlier though, the solid plot is not the highlight of this book. The characters are. The myriad of people Taran meets in his travels provides a welcome break from the pattern of the other Prydain chronicles, where almost everyone seems to be either a king, a bard, or a magician (or some combination of the three). After so many books walking the heights, Taran finally returns to earth.For those who have read the earlier books, you will see many familiar faces, including faithful Gurgi, the (not quite) bard Fflewddur Fflam, King Smoit, and even three old friends from the Marshes of Morva. You'll also be intrigued by new characters, some of whom have had hidden influences on characters you already know. And through it all, the beautiful tapestry of plot that Lloyd Alexander has woven will captivate you.Taran Wanderer is a great book. I recommend it to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"This book is definitely the most unique of all the Prydain Chronicles. Instead of urgent quests to find magical pigs, destroy evil cauldrons or rescue a beautiful princess--with good constantly pitted against the forces of evil--this volume is instead focused on Taran finding out about himself.Instead of a quest resolved in a matter of weeks or months, this story covers a couple of years, years in which Taran travels from one end of Prydain to the other, first in search of his parents and then in search of his own place in the race of men.His motivation lies in a desire to be worthy of the Princess Eilonwy's hand in marriage; she's absent from the story, still on the Isle of Mona, so Taran's only constant companion is the loyal creature Gurgi.Old friends Fflewddur and Doli make brief appearances, though the bulk of Taran's time is spent meeting new people: the old farmer Aeddan and his wife, who fight for survival on a land impoverished by the Death-Lord Arawn; Goryon and Gast, petty lords whose bark is worse than their bite; Morda, the enchanter who despises the race of men in its entirety; the outlaw Dorath and his men; the shepherd Craddoc; and the people of the Free Commots: Llonio the lucky, Hevydd the smith, Dwyvach the weaver, Annlaw the potter, and Llassar the farm boy.The lessons Taran learns in his travels aren't always obvious or profound for the casual reader, and the limited amount of swords, sorcery and peril may be unusual for some. However, the transition Taran makes into manhood is handled convincingly and realistically with each step he takes."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"Taran, who we met as a boy in The Book of Three and whose splendid adventures we breathlessly followed in The Black Cauldron and The Castle of Llyr, decides to find himself and his past in the fourth marvelous Prydain Chronicle by gifted storyweaver Lloyd Alexander. An orphan raised by the wise Dallben, he has none of the history and connections that come from parents and family. Now, he off alone to find some answers - hopefully noble ones - so he can be \\"worthy\\" of his royal love.If you're like me, you didn't love Taran automatically - he could occasionally be sullen, petty, and prickly during his \\"growing up\\" phases in Books 1 to 3 (necessitating Eilonwy's great put-downs and quips). Continuing his growth, Taran Wanderer marks his first journey into adulthood. This is the one where my respect for this character solidified and I really began to care for him. This is the least \\"heroic\\" of the books, and yet, I believe this is one where Taran is most admirable.He explores the land he has been fighting for by connecting to the common people as well as kings and wizards. We are introduced to more excellent characters (besides some old ones) and a deeper understanding of Prydain with the intricate ties that bind all of them together. On a quest for the Mirror of Llunet, Taran roams old and new territory from the Marshes to the Free Commots doing everything from making pottery to facing off against kingly challenges. The change is how he sees the world, with its ugliness and beauty, as he searches for his place in it. Along the way, he learns about himself: humbly, intelligently, honestly, and courageously.As it closely builds on the last book in particular, and is in general an evolution of his maturity, reading the books in order is strongly recommended. (Considering how wonderful the others are, this is no chore.) It's a relatively quiet book compared to the rousing chases of the previous ones, but Taran Wanderer is ultimately more powerful and moving."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"Taran Wanderer was not given the Newbery Award like it's successor The High King; nor was it awarded a Newbery Honor medal such as it's predecessor The Black Cauldron. However, Taran Wanderer is the most complete book in the Chronicles of Prydain. Lloyd Alexander deftly tells the tale of Taran's quest to find his parentage in hopes of being decendant from noble blood. Gurgi, Taran's faithful sidekick journeys with him through far off parts of Prydain. Along the way, old friends and faces reappear such as Fflewwder Fflamm the bard/king, Doli of the fair folk, Kaw his hijinxing bird, Llyan the giant cat who Fflewwder now rides as his mount and King Smoit whose army rescued Taran and his companions at the end of The Black Cauldron. Taran's journey to find himself takes him to a number of different trades such as metallurgy, weaving, farming and pottery. He also meets his fair share of adventure and enchantment along the way. At 254 pages Taran Wanderer is the longest book in the series but it reads the fastest because there is so much action and uncertainty in what Taran will finally find out about himself. The Chronicles of Prydain still stand as some of the greatest fantasy stories ever written and Taran Wanderer is the BEST book in the Chronicles of Prydain. Highest Recommendation."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"Unlike many of the older readers reviewing the Prydain chronicle, I have never stopped reading them. The series was almost permanently taken out in my name from the childrens' library in town for about five years, from second or third grade on. Finally I broke down and bought paperback copies of all five, which are now dogeared and mangled, the biding broken. Not from mistreatment; from my sheer love of the books. These are the &quot;Star Wars&quot; of books for me; I've read them countless, countless times.While all five books are excellent in their own personal way, Taran Wanderer, I believe, is my favorite. It didn't used to be; as a child I liked The High King, which was admittedly more action packed. I think the switch came around adolescence; Taran Wanderer was then less a boring filler between books and more a boy's journey to adulthood and to find himself. Somewhere along the line I began to appreciate this for what it was, and what the other books, though infinitely wonderful, were not. There is subtle poignancy in Taran's friendship with Gurgi, mediation between Gast and Goryon, attempts to peaceably deal with Dorath, and most of all his finding of value and nobility in even the common folk of the Free Commots, where he proves to himself that he doesn't necessarily have to be a hero to be a man.You don't have to have gone through adolescence to appreciate the beauty of this book. Maybe not the most action-packed of the Prydain chronicles, or the most climactic, but so much more than filler: literary wonder."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"I read it at six. I read it at sixteen. I read it at twenty-six. I read it at home. I read it wandering. At all times and all places, I have identified with Taran Wanderer more than any other literary character. I'm not excluding Shakespeare, the classics or modern novels.Taran is a boy trying to become a human (it applies to girls just as much.) This is the beginning of all great mythology, as the late Joseph Campbell would have agreed. This boy travels through a world of magic swords, undead warriors and medieval villages. It is an escape. Or is it? Taran deals with truth, the true worth of himself and others, the search for meaning in a career and in life, the excitement and high price of violence and love. I AM Taran in 1997, as much as he is in an imaginary world. I bet a lot of you are, too.Alexander never talks down to you, whether you are young or old. It is fun and meaningful. This fourth book of a wonderful five-book series is an excellent encapsulation of the entire series. This is not a book for adults or children. It is a book for people. A great one."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"Taran Wanderer is perhaps the most personal of all the Prydain Chronicles, as the story focuses on Taran searching for his lineage. Taran is an orphan, raised by the wizard Dallben, and he wondered for a long time who his parents really were. Now he has an intense urge to find out if he is of noble line, because he wants to marry Eilonwy, enchantress and princess of Llyr. Of course he didn't tell her his feelings, as he is not sure that he worthy to ask and also because Eilonwy is not in Prydain throughout the story of Taran Wanderer. As a result, this Chronicle has a distinct feel from the other Chronicles. Taran roams around Prydain, looking for clues and having his own personal adventures, and the book really shows that he is clever and intelligent. There's a part that ties the third Chronicle in very good with this one. Taran finds out many different things about himself, but what he set out to look for yields surpising results. A good book, but a bit slower than the others in the series. It has many life lessons though, and it's still interesting despite not having large battles; it has personel encounters and small skirmishes. However, Lloyd Alexander more than makes up for that in the last Chronicle, The High King."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"In essence, the entirety of the Prydain Chronicles is a journey, Taran's journey from boyhood to manhood. Well, &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; traversed a mile of the journey with a single bound.After &quot;Castle of Llyr,&quot; we know that Taran is pretty obviously bonkers-in-love with Eilonwy, but since he's an Assistant Pig-Keeper and a Princess, he doesn't plan to ask her until he can discern who he is, in terms of rank and birth (she'd probably think he was nuts to think this, and make some amusing comparison, but she sadly doesn't appear in person in this one--warning to Eilonwy fans).Taran first travels to the Marsh of Morva to ask for advice, then sets out on his journey with Gurgi, who shows the levels of his faithfulness in this story. He comes face-to-face with amorality, selfishness, greed, and various other human failings. But Taran manages to handle them all with grace and wisdom...... until he meets a crippled shepherd who might just be his father.After he meets the shepherd, Taran's journey becomes far more mature. He is forced to face his own failings and his own beliefs about whether he would be worthy for Eilonwy, as he tries to change his life. Is Taran a prince? Or a prince among men? And which matters more?Such favorites as King Smoit (a personal fave of mine--his last scene with Taran is wonderful), Doli of the Fair Folk, and Fflewddur Fflam appear in this book, but it's really Taran's story, with a good dose of Gurgi thrown in.This takes all but one step toward adulthood--the last step is taken in &quot;High King.&quot; Taran is one of the most unique and sometimes haunted heroes in fantasy literature, for children or adults. His journey of self-discovery is amazing, truly amazing.Why this book never won a Newbery is beyond me--it doesn't have a lot of swords clashing or involved battles. It's a journey of the heart, and possibly one of the finest books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"As a child, the Chronicles of Prydain were among my favourite books. One summer, between 5th and 6th grade, I read each book of the series over and over again, perhaps 8 times each...except for this one. Taran Wanderer, I could only read once. Although I love all the books in the series, this is the one that has bore a hole in my heart.At the age of 11, when I read these books, I felt much pressure to grow up and become \\"a young lady,\\" but I wanted to remain a child forever. Reading of Taran's powerful and painful transformation from a young person to a bonafide adult was \\"proof\\" for me that life beyond childhood was abhorent.Over the years, I had no choice but to grow up, and the memory of Taran's journey always guided me."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"This is a replacement. I don't remember if it was used or new when it arrived. Lloyd Alexander books get snapped up and passed around in our house. It doesn't look new any more."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"\\"Taran Wanderer\\" is a bit of a different take for Lloyd Alexander as he continues the \\"Chronicles of Prydain.\\" Unlike the action stories featured in earlier volumes, Alexander presents a story more focused on character growth and familiar faces from the previous books either do not appear or play a much smaller role in this book. Taran grows a great deal in this story and Alexander shows more of the land of Prydain than he does in the earlier books--including a touching look at farmers and other people looking to etch out a living even in the shadow of epic conflict. It's an angle often overlooked by fantasy writers. There is much wisdom here and Alexander does a wonderful job of making his points in a subtle manner. It's certainly different than the other books in the series--and some readers, especially younger ones may grow weary of it. Nonetheless, this is book is ideal for most young fantasy readers."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"Besides being one of the best children's books ever, this book is also part of a great 5 book series. I read this book aloud to all my children, now that my children are adults reading this series is almost a requirement for their spouses in order to be part of our family! A requirement their spouses fulfilled with pleasure, I might add. Besides the basis in Welsh mythology, I feel that the theme of the series is Taran's search for identity as he slowly learns, with mistakes along the way, what it means to be an adult of value in the world. Though Eilonwy isn't in this book, she is a good, strong role model for girls throughout this series as well and does have \\"her own\\" book in The Castle of Llyr. I cannot recommend this book, or the Chronicles of Prydain series, enough."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"Finally, books I remember enjoying as a kid that still stand up to re-reading as an adult!They are sometimes described as coming-of-age stories, and that is true in the best sense of the term. Alexander is deeply concerned with growing up, and he examines many of its central, deepest, and most profound aspects, such as discovering one's personal identity, and responsibility. Each book in the series looks at these themes in different ways and builds on them a little more. My favorite in the series, Taran Wanderer (which I had expected to enjoy the least), deals with these issues so simply and directly that it acquires an almost allegorical quality. He teaches many important life lessons that are every bit as relevant to us grown-ups as to young adolescents just beginning to struggle with these issues. And he does so through engaging stories and a memorable cast of characters. From now on, whenever I find myself in a situation that tests my courage or integrity, all I have to do is think to myself, \\"A Fflam never falters!\\"Some people like to complain about the supposed similarities between these books and those of Tolkein, but apart from some basic structural features stemming from their common mythological roots, there really isn't a lot of similarity in the details. Even in the most obviously similar part---the ending---what is really interesting is how it differs. I can't say much without giving it away, but let's just say that Alexander, to his credit, ultimately says almost the exact opposite of Tolkein. No, Alexander's fantasy world isn't as complex and well-developed as Tolkein's, but these books were written for a younger audience, and let's face it, nobody can stand up to a comparison with Tolkein as far as that goes. I think if people, of whatever age, take these books on their own terms, they will find them to be a rewarding experience."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"Like many of the best children's authors, Lloyd Alexander created a fictional universe to teach his readers how to understand and live in the real world. His Prydain books are fantasy for kids, but full of the introspection of a thoughtful adult. All the books have nice moments, but some of the best writing in the series comes in the second half of TARAN WANDERER (the fourth book). Taran, an orphan who wants to be a hero, wanders through Prydain (based on medieval Wales) to find information about his parentage and meets an aging shepherd who is struggling on an unproductive mountain farm. The shepherd claims he is Taran's father, hoping that Taran will stay and work, which he does. When the shepherd dies, he reveals that he is not his father. Taran is first happy, then ashamed for wanting to be free and for being embarrassed to claim the poor working man as his father. Taran decides he is not worthy to return home and journeys on through poor counties, meeting a blacksmith who offers to apprentice him (I know I'm over-explaining why I love this book, but hear me out). After toiling at the smithy, he meets a weaver and, thinking that weaving is woman's work and probably easier, offers to work for her. After a month of cleaning wool and operating a loom, he knows better. Then there's an interlude where he stays with a fisherman, who tells him that life is a river and you have to be ready to grab things when they come to you (very true). Finally, in a moving chapter, he meets a famous potter and asks to learn his trade. The potter tells him he can learn the craft but maybe not the art, and Taran eventually learns he is right. Then robbers who have been pursuing Taran (and who represent the destructive element in all societies) kill the potter and burn the county where Taran is living, so he leads them away and finally reaches his destination, a pool which is supposedly magic and will answer the question of who he is. He looks in the pool and sees himself, changed by the people he has met and the work he's learned to do. The robber stomps in the pool and kicks the water out, but Taran has found what he wanted to know."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"This one stands apart from the other books in the series, as it has far less action and far more character development.I read it something like 12 years ago and still remember most of the plot!"},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"So, in the last book, we had one person get taught their station in life, in this one, we have another go searching for their station in life.

The result is not only another amazing entry in Lloyd Alexander's classic series, but also one of the best fantasy novels ever written.Taran Wanderer again follows the journey of the assistant pig-keeper Taran as he seeks to find his place in the world. Except for Gurgi, most of his adventuring companions are absent for this journey. Fflewdur Fflam and Doli only make short appearances, and Eilonwy is absent entirely - indeed, it is because of the distant princess that Taran undertakes his latest adventure in the first place. The lack of a slarge supporting case allows Taran to really grow as he seeks his true parentage and learns that it takes more than swordplay to make a man.Taran Wanderer does not have one epic storyline to tie the book together, but instead is a series of minor adventures that each help Taran learn more about himself. While Taran has matured bit by bit throughout the series, this book is the one that will finally turn him into a man. His adventure is humorous at times and heartbreaking at others. Overall, this novel represents one of the best character-driven narratives in the entire fantasy genre. Whether you are familiar with the Chronicles of Prydain or not, you should definitely give this story a read."},{"Title":"Taran Wanderer (A yearling book)","review":"A friend loaned me her copies of this series.

It's not clear if the author likes banjo music or even listened to much of it. The author is critical of both those who would describe banjo music as \\"that half-barbaric twang\\" as well as anyone who actually plays the darned thing. The author's elitism and ivory tower perspective can be forgiven because of the many interesting historical details she provides. It will take another person, probably someone without a PhD, to reassemble the details in a meaningful way for those of us who simply love the sound and the music for what it is."},{"Title":"That Half-Barbaric Twang: THE BANJO IN AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE (Music in American Life)","review":"This book reads as if it were written to fulfill a thesis requirement, and not out of love for the banjo. The author only touches on banjo technique and music, instead she prefers to base her arguments on iconography. I gave it two stars since it provides some interesting perspectives on race relations in the U.S., but it severely falls short for anyone who loves banjo music and the instrument itself."},{"Title":"That Half-Barbaric Twang: THE BANJO IN AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE (Music in American Life)","review":"The book is exactly what the title claims- concerned with the *image* of the banjo in American *popular* culture. In other words, the book is about the ideas (sometimes good, sometimes bad) folks from different parts of society got in their heads concerning the banjo- what they thought about the instrument & the people who played it, why they thought these things, & how this changed through time. Basically, the reputation of the banjo. It is written in a scholarly [dry & impersonal] fashion, and I will admit that I had to wade through parts of it (re-read some sentences, and occasionally put the book down and ponder what was meant) but overall I enjoyed the book for the historical tidbits and for the author's insight. You won't find the music in here, nor is it written in a way that indicates her own musical preferences, but she does give the names of individual artists so you can go hunt recordings down & give a good listen.What you will find is evidence of how American's perceived the banjo- how it was portrayed in advertisements, cartoons, photographs, magazines, paintings, and literature. I found all this really interesting. My favorite was the snippets of literature & illustration from the 1880's that portray saucy young women as banjo players! She discusses the instrument's African origins, the banjo before the Civil War (briefly), the Southern black banjo, the banjo in minstrel shows, medicine shows, vaudeville theatre, 1890's college clubs, the parlors of upper-class victorian women, the jazz & ragtime banjo, the dance orchestra banjo, the urban banjo, the banjo in Appalachia [mostly how it was viewed by folklorists], the banjo in early country music, what record companies chose to record and why- which affects our perception/ideas/understanding today. Good stuff- though keep in mind that each one of these appearances of the banjo probably deserves it's own book. :) Also, I appreciated the author's break-down on authenticity, esp. considering all the argument in music over the topic, whether or not something is \\"authentic\\". For moments you really step-outside your own cultural perceptions when you take a good look at WHY people thought what they did- and you question where your ideas of the banjo (or anything else, for that matter) came from. Awesome. Worth reading.I gave it four stars because I felt that the book was missing the opinions of people from WITHIN banjo culture- very little here from musicians, more from outsiders looking in & forming opinions. Though that is not what the title promises (\\"popular culture\\") I feel that it is important for context and would have greatly added to my personal enjoyment of the book. How the banjo is perceived within the culture that plays the instrument is just as important as how \\"outsiders\\" view it. Also I felt the coverage was a bit uneven, more on the \\"largely unrecorded\\" African American string bands would have been good, more on medicine shows- I am guessing that rather than this being the preference of the author that she was working with what information she could find. These subjects & more deserve further attention- or perhaps my curiosity is insatiable."},{"Title":"That Half-Barbaric Twang: THE BANJO IN AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE (Music in American Life)","review":"This is one of the best books on the nature of cultural perception and the wars between reality and the stereotypes of the dominant culture, as well as the relationship between capitalism and culture, race and capitalism in America, as well of class race and style. This book belongs in every home.Linn deals with the social image of the banjo from its African and African American origins, to minstrelry's role in popularizing this instrument as well as the conflicts between the racism of minstrelry and the explosion of an instrument suited to popularize African American music. She continues by charting the now-forgetten age of the classic banjo from post civil war period until the first decade of this century, when manufacturers and teachers tried to elavate the five string instrument from its working class and African American roots, to becoming a polite and priviledged possession for the rich. She then charts the evolyution of the instrument and its image into the jazz age with the various 4 string banjos. Finally she deals with the images in the culture created by the persistence of the instrument in appalachia and its revival in the folk scene of the 1950s through today.This is a gross summary of a subtle, well written book, that provides pictures about how stereotypes and misinformation based on the racial and class conflicts of society both cloud our knowledge of the real culture and constitutes part of it.This is a fascinating book about American history and culture and race under capitalism, even if the reader is not interested in the banjo. If one is interested in the banjo in any way, you Need this book!"},{"Title":"If You Are Afraid of Heights","review":"A dreamlike novel. Fairy tale, fantasy, fable. Exquisitely devastasting, clearly gritty, but ultimately optimistic and supremely haunting."},{"Title":"If You Are Afraid of Heights","review":"A haunting novel which takes the reader to new heights on the back of a crow, Jha's latest novel tells three mysterious and unsettling stories from three points of view, all with overlapping imagery. Neither realistic nor magical, Jha creates a whole new realm here, the world that exists between dream and nightmare, and between imagination and memory, which all of us inhabit for most of our everyday lives. Motifs (a crow, a red dress, a brown dog, a house with a balcony that looks like a frown) appear and reappear throughout the three different sections, with each part recreating the inner world of a different character.In the first section, Amir, a young man who has been injured by a tram, is nursed back to health by Rima, a young woman who brings him back to her apartment, gets him a doctor, and makes sure that all his needs are met so that he can recuperate in peace. In the second section, Mala, a young newspaper reporter, has gone to a distant village to investigate the death of a child, who has drowned in a canal after being raped. The final section returns to the city where a neighborhood has suffered a rash of suicides. A young child is worried that her parents might kill themselves and confides in a friend, who promises to follow her father and mother.Two italicized prologues and a brief conclusion summarize the novel thematically, while the first person narratives illustrate the sensual responses of Amir, Mala, and the child to what is going on around them and provide insights into their emotional states. The novel requires the reader to form hypotheses about what is happening and how the characters connect, with the author confirming the connections and the meaning of the novel in the conclusion, which draws all the visual details and motifs together.Jha emphasizes the process by which we all bring order and \\"sense\\" to our lives, how we live our dreams, and how we deal with our fears and our memories. The reader must be committed to letting this impressionistic novel unwind, accepting the mysteries that exist, as they do in our own lives, without worrying about the characters or the direction of the \\"plot.\\" The author fills in any blanks at the end. Unique in its approach and fascinating in its construction, this novel captures the essence of its characters' lives and connects directly with the reader's own inner life. In this, it achieves a universality rare in fiction.

Currently developing a cure for ovarian cancer, Claire is reunited with foes from high school and a friend who has something to hide in THE WAY HE MAKES ME FEEL by Tamara Sneed.Raised by her older sister and father, Claire began high school at age eleven and was always fascinated with the sciences. This love sent her to Harvard and subsequently MIT, and she has won rave reviews for her work. Settling outside of Los Angeles, she only has time for her research and her immediate family. Unbeknownst to her, a chance encounter puts her in the midst of a bet with player Duncan Hillston and danger with her girlfriend Annabelle.Claire was dubbed Medusa in school because of her age, bookworm appearance and her knowledge of science. Because of Duncan's tales of pummeling the opposite sex, his goal is to get Claire to fall in love with him and win the trip of his dreams. If he fails, he must admit to his friends, who have suffered years of listening to his tales, he is a first-rate liar at an upcoming block party. Duncan has two weeks to achieve this feat.An interesting and daring story, THE WAY HE MAKES ME FEEL has fully developed characters, and through their musings we are able to capture their ups and downs of the past and the present. Sneed has included important family members, who matter, to further develop the characterizations. Other characters add the right element to this story with their humor and their strangeness. At times the plot is implausible however, the story is filled with intrigue, where rules are made to be broken. Included is a setting that is quaint, while fast-forwarding to extravagant.Reviewed by Dawn R.

I had only read Yoral Vow by Tamara and really wasn't impressed with that one. But this book was great from start to finish. Duncan was just a player and Claire thought a good evening was spent in her lab. Put them both together and they were combustible. The sex scenes were hot, but even better the love building between the two had me warm in all the right places. Definitely a book that I will place on my bookshelf and read a few more times."},{"Title":"The Way He Makes Me Feel","review":"Electrician Duncan Hillston brags to his friends Hawk Morrissey and Patrick Morley that he made it with Hollywood star Janette Baxter who makes Halle look ugly. His friends have listened to him boast that he is the player since ninth grade, but this time they feel his hyperbole is outrageous. He insists he can pick up any woman through his time tested three step process of soothe them, entice them, and finally seduce them. They offer to pay for a Europe trip if he can get Claire \\"Medusa\\" Scott to fall in love with him by accompanying him to the Westfield annual block party in two weeks.Though he puts up a front, Duncan remembers Medusa as the brain of school, graduating with his class though three years younger. Her intelligence intimidated him then and he fears she still does. Unbeknownst to him, Claire had a crush on Duncan and never forgot him though he avoided her. As Duncan applies his scientific method to score, a strange thing happens; he falls in love with Claire, but though he believes she reciprocates, he fears how she will react when he mentions the wager something he believes he must tell her.THE WAY HE MAKES ME FEEL is an enjoyable contemporary romance starring a likable player who succeeds with the women (though at times exaggerates his prowess) because he treats females with respect. His counterpart Claire is a genius in the lab as a research pharmacist, but the little ninth grader resides inside her. Together, Duncan and Claire make for a fine reading experience for sub-genre fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The cookie tree","review":"As an adult collector of children's literature, this book is one of my favorites, too.

I wasn't even sure of the name but I knew the publish date was close. The book is in pretty good condition."},{"Title":"The cookie tree","review":"In the middle of a prosperous medieval walled village, a tree suddenly appears in the town square. It is covered with silver bark, and under its golden leaves are small fruits that look like chocolate cookies. A girl name Meg is the first to see it - when she tells her parents about it, of course they don't believe her. Eventually, though, everyone in town does see the tree, and the adults begin to argue about what it is, where it comes from, what it means, and the dangers it might pose. The children, though, have simpler - and clearer - ideas.Jay Williams has written a beautiful little story about how sometimes adults tend not to see the forest - or the cookies - for the trees, and how bureaucracy and endless worrying about doing the right thing can sometimes obscure simple beauties in life. Having worked in a cooperatively-run business for quite a few years, this really rang a chord when I found it in my parents' house and re-read it after 35+ years. My copy dates from 1967 and appears to be the first edition, so it may be one of my earliest reading experiences. The book also offers magic as something indefinable, mysterious, and with a purpose of its own that may be quite different from our ordinary way of thinking, and in that regard it reminded me more than a little of Tolkien's SMITH OF WOOTEN MAJOR.Blake Hampton's illustrations are every bit as lovely as the text, looking something like a cross between actual medieval illuminations and American primativism (think somewhere in the range from Grant Wood to Grandma Moses). Wonderful and timeless."},{"Title":"The cookie tree","review":"This one has been around a few years, and hopefully it will remain so. This is a delightful story pointing to the obvious fact that child's preception can be, and often is, much clearer than that of an adult.

The illustations are colorful and simple in a way, at first glance, but the more you study them, the more complex they become. Quite detailed, as a matter of fact, in a strange sort of way.

I was so delighted to find it so that I might share it with my granddaughter."},{"Title":"Extreme Culture","review":"The predispositions of culture as defined by the \\"intellectual side of civilization\\" are part of the subject phenomenon to deconstruct society. Therefore, subculture, even further splintered from its original base definition, is the adjunct to the study - the wayward child throwing the uniformity of the normal out of balance. The fundamental significance of subculture interrupts the principles of unity and can offend, but is designed to redefine and illustrate the unique.Pockets of non-conformity have been acknowledged throughout history, but became associated with style in the Dada art movement of the early 20th century. Ultimately, the revolutionary discourse unfolded with the polarization of the working class society, sparking the mod movement of the 1960s and thereafter the punk rock outlaws. Coming full circle, our society still marginalizes the fringe of humanity, most evidently seen in contemporary youth culture.The real power behind subculture relies on its statement, but is it art? In his new book, \\"Extreme Culture: A Photo Anthology\\", San Diego based photographer Greg Passmore explores the fascination with severe subculture and molds a photographic narrative of the disaffected consciousness of counterculture. In it are individuals painted, sculpted, and etched, resulting in an artistically intrinsic menagerie of the sexual macabre and at times, poetic images of personal expression and young human frailty.Passmore is known not only for his innovative technical uses of 3D laser scanners for special effects photography, but also as a forerunner for fetish and alternative fashion photography. This book culminates all of his devices on a palette of technically advanced photo work and complex and seductive subject matter.The models in the book, with respect to genres, aren't just punks, goths, vampires, cyborgs, and heavily modified derelicts. They are women and men with passions and talents who feel their self better fits on the hem side of culture. Passmore includes with his photographs, text of his impressions of his subjects, giving identity to the sometimes overlooked and nameless faces behind the camera.The appeal of the book points to its large format color photographs, where we are confronted with erotic latex-clad figures, zombie-like insanity, the haunting pallor of death, bloodied appendages, and beautifully tattooed and pierced bodies. The reality of suicide, drug abuse, and brutal confrontations are fully explored behind the facades of the images, perhaps to offend, but more so to push the envelope of radical privilege. These are significant issues that society needs to come to terms with. It's not necessarily about acceptance, it's about recognition.While Passmore leans towards darker sensibilities, the book balances the images between the morbidly eccentric and the strikingly statuesque. Not meant just as a coffee table book, \\"Extreme Culture\\" exists as a voyeuristic interlude into a bizarre, but deeply personal realm. The challenge to investigate falls into the lap of the curious or experienced, whichever decides to dive into the deep end first."},{"Title":"Guide To Understanding the Bible","review":"This book is a must-read for any serious student of the Bible -- especially anyone who supposes that the Bible is the \\"word of God.\\" The book traces the evolution of six ideas -- God, man, right and wrong, suffering, fellowship with God, and immortality -- through the centuries over which the various books of the Bible were written.When I first read this book, I was trying to decide whether the Bible was really the word of God.

First you paint a cage, then you paint flowers and plants around it, a beautiful sky, and so on. You wait. Your painting is bad if a bird doesn't come and land in the cage. If one does, it is good and you can erase the cage and sign your name to the painting of the bird. Putting aside the cuteness of all this, what made me realize how much I disliked the sound of French was the continual, unctuous, caressing repetition of 'l'oiseau' ('the bird'). It is a word the French believe to be one of the most beautiful in their language. It is a word that cannot be pronounced without simpering, a word whose use should be restricted to children under five.\\"Confere Anthony Burgess's hatred of the consonant deficiency of French: \\"The French seem determined to destroy their Roman inheritance by chopping up words until they become as short as possible, and as capable of being confused with other chopped-up words as only a genuinely morbid condition of language can allow. Even when a French word or name bears some visual resemblance to its classical original, the spoken form submits to the axe. I can never grow used to pronouncing 'Jesus Christ' as 'Jezu Cri', and I feel that if the French could cut the holy name down to something like 'Je Cr', they would.\\""},{"Title":"The Philosopher's Demise: Learning French","review":"When Richard Watson tries to learn to speak French decades after having learned to read it fluently, he has trouble. He tries very hard, hires a tutor, labors hours every day over exercises and audio tapes, but it just won't come. He spends months in France and still, he can't pass his exam.Watson is a philosopher, therefore he must analyze the situation to death. He dissects his failure, perhaps it is because French sounds un-masculine, maybe he doesn't like the French, perhaps it is something deeper. Well, seeing as how he has evidence that his French really has improved by the time he leaves France, maybe he just set his goals unrealistically high.The self-analysis gets tedious sometimes, but the story is interesting and understandable. Everyone has difficulty learning something, no matter how smart they are. And the observations of different cultures are eye-opening. Watson's story about an American who speaks fluent Japanese, traveling in Japan, being refused lodging in an inn because he didn't speak Japanese, even though the lengthy conversation with the proprietor took place entirely in Japanese, was amusing."},{"Title":"The Philosopher's Demise: Learning French","review":"Richard Watson's book was an entertaining read -- it was hard to put down once I started reading it. It is not just about his struggle to learn French -- it is about how it feels to be on the outside looking in, and about how it feels to face unprecedented, inexplicable failure. The author is introspective, and he relates his experiences in an amusing and thoughtful way. Although he gives us a peek into a world most of us will never encounter (that of Parisian philosophers specializing in Descartes), we can easily empathize with his feelings of frustration, humiliation and cultural confusion. Since I am also struggling to learn to speak French for the first time, I was gratified to see I am not alone in my frustration."},{"Title":"The Philosopher's Demise: Learning French","review":"At 55, Richard Watson, a distinguished Cartesian scholar and professor at Washington University, lived a linguistic paradox: he could read French like a native; but he could not actually speak the language. Then, Watson was invited to deliver a paper at a conference in Paris celebrating the 350th anniversary of Descartes's \\"Discours de la Methode\\". The director of the conference was sure \\"...that all participants would want to present their papers in French.\\" Thus begins Watson's quest to acquire a passable French accent and learn conversational French.In learning to speak French, Watson encounters several obstacles. First, he is hindered by a middle-aged \\"ear and tongue [that] were stiff as boards.\\" Second, he, a scholar, remembers what he understands but finds \\"...it nearly impossible to pick up phrases and patterns by sound alone.\\" Third, Watson is assigned an arrogant and inflexible teacher at the Alliance Francaise, where he, a professor, becomes a mere student in an intensive class meeting four hours a day and five days a week for four months.In class, this teacher uses the French lyc&eacute;e style. Here: \\"You are to do exactly what you are told in prescribed lengths of time, and for everything there is a rule.\\" And: \\"If you are told to do something by a teacher in France, you follow instructions exactly, or you are punished for it.\\" This--a pedagogical issue--ultimately causes Watson great tribulation. He observes: \\"I was struck... by the fact that what we award students for--initiative, inventiveness, going beyond what is asked for, smart-a**ed showing off--is ruthlessly, even with great relish, punished in the French lyc&eacute;e system.\\"In THE PHILOSOPHER'S DEMISE, Watson proves to be a wonderful guide through French culture. Certainly, he enjoys Paris, despite its noise. But he also bristles at its imperious and aloof elites and spares us the usual obsequious observations about French food and French style. Further, he laughs at the complicated and imperfect solutions that the French sometimes devise for social problems. In New York, clean up after your dog or pay a fine. But in Paris, during Watson's stay, there was a fleet of motorcycles equipped with special tanks and suction devices hunting for doggy doo.Ultimately, Watson learns to speak perfectly adequate conversational French, even on subjects in his highly specialized field. But the process is fraught and there are moments when the professor and his associates find joy in resistance. Here, for example, is the story of a distinguished English historian of science presenting at the Paris conference. He \\"...didn't do accents. Instead, he read French words as though they were English, with particular stress on all the endings that are silent in French. \`That'll bloody well set them straight,' someone whispered in English behind me.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Philosopher's Demise: Learning French","review":"No, this is not a book about &quot;learning to speak French&quot;, as the subtitle indicates -- rather it is a book about a man trying to overcome his linguistic shortcomings in fluently speaking the French language, while skewering the Alliance Francaise (language school), French scholars of Descartes, and French bureaucracy, all in one extended essay (too short to be dignified as a &quot;book&quot;, really). It passes all understanding that the author believes that anyone other than his nearest and dearest care about his traumas in taking French lessons or being snubbed by his fellow scholars in Paris (or being stung by a yellow jacket in the good old U.S. of A., for that matter). A total waste of a long afternoon. Watson and the reading public would have been better served had he just bought a set of Pimsleur CDs and then shut up."},{"Title":"Anita and Me (New Press International Fiction Series)","review":"A very wonderful and touching tale of a young Indian girl growing up in a small Midlands town in 1960s England. The book succeeds on two levels, both as the coming of age tale of young girl, dealing with her &quot;differentness&quot; and desire to assimilate, and as the story of a whole generation of immigrants from the subcontinent. In many ways it has that &quot;young adult&quot; book feel to it, lots of familiar clich&eacute;d plot devices and characters, but the nicely drawn setting makes it very different from what American readers may be used to. In particular, the use of slang stand out as particularly well-written. The only quibble I have is the jumbling of pop-culture references which don't seem to make any sense: 1960's &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is called a &quot;new&quot; book from America, whereas fashion references seem to place it as late 60s, whereas teen heartthrob references (Donny Osmond, Shaun Cassidy) seem to place it in the 70s, and skinhead fashions are of the 1968-9 era. These are minor annoyances though, and barely distract from the touching and sometimes gut wrenching story of a little girl learning about herself."},{"Title":"Anita and Me (New Press International Fiction Series)","review":"This is truly one of the best books I have read in a very long time. Syal's prose is not meerly proficient but utterly engaging. In Meena she creates a character who is so utterly charming that even her darkest deeds (like losing her mother's diamond necklace) seem excusable lapses in a temperament which is essentially both good and clever. Meena's cheeky and almost achingly accurate narrative of what it is like to be young and growing up in a small village when all you want to do is grow up and get away will strike a long-buried chord in many readers, it certainly did in me. In this extemely funny novel Syal's political agenda is suitably both understated and omnipresent, never overshadowing Meena's hilarious antics and inevitable (and literal) fall from grace. I will be recommending this book to anyone who will listen, buy it now - its fantastic.Angie Ryan."},{"Title":"Anita and Me (New Press International Fiction Series)","review":"Oh how I enjoyed this one my dad asked me to read it and I absolutley adored this book about the Kumar's living in the 1900's or so and racism she endured. It was hilarious at SSR I would be laughing my heart out, and everyone would look at me funny. It was sad, but enjoyable. Meena is not accepted into the English world, but doesn't seem to fit in with her Indian family. You can relate if you are a kid who lies a lot trying to make your life exciting. Meena is a very enjoyable character she's smart, funny, imaginitive, creative (same thing i guess), charming, and witty. This is a book as a kid I reccomend for everyone!"},{"Title":"Anita and Me (New Press International Fiction Series)","review":"The story of a few years in the childhood of Meena, an Indian girl growing up in a Midland's village in the early 70's. The clashes and harmonies of the Indian and English cultures are the backdrop and the simple style describing life through the innocent eyes of a child make this a joy to read. There is a beautiful mixture of humour and pathos. The little girl who wants to join the Girls Gang led by Anita who slowly grows up to be the friend Anita needs and rejects. My only criticism is that the book had to end."},{"Title":"Anita and Me (New Press International Fiction Series)","review":"This is one of my favorite books written by an author of Indian origin. Being Indian I could identify with so many aspects of the tale. Her wit, intelligence and sensitivity is prominent in this book, from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Anita and Me (New Press International Fiction Series)","review":"I recommend that everyone should read \\"Anita and Me\\" by Meera Syal. This story, that of a young Indian girl growing up in a British town, is really a universal tale. Feeling the temptation to rebel against your parents, needing to be one of the \\"cool\\" kids, and struggling between what is right and wrong are all important things every child must go through. Meena, the main character of \\"Anita and Me\\", is no exception. Although she is Indian, she has many childhood experiences anyone could relate to. That is what makes this story so great. It points out that underneath our skin color, everyone is human. Unfortunately for Meena, not everyone in her town always feels that way. Meena's family is accepted by their British neighbors, but only when they act \\"British\\". Whenever they showed even the smallest aspects of their Indian culture, they were ignored, or even shunned. \\"Anita and Me\\" reminds us not to fall into a trap of prejudice as so many in Meena's town did. Meera Syal, the author of the story, challenges every reader to reassess what we consider \\"civilized\\" and to look beyond the color of someone's skin to find their worth, but to look at their character."},{"Title":"Anita and Me (New Press International Fiction Series)","review":"This book did what all good books do - it dragged me into the world of the characters. Meena is the 9 year old daughter of Indian immigrants, living in a small town called Tollington.Through her eyes we see her world, her impatience to grow up, her wish to fit in with the local people, her naughty streak and her desire to befriend the bad girl of the area, Anita.It's a tough time for Meena growing up in this town. She sounds like a local, yet doesn't look like them. She is accepted as one of 'them', yet when another Indian is beaten and ends up in hospital, openly jeered and ridiculed by her friends, she finds herself stuck with the knowledge that she is stuck with a foot in both worlds.Her Namina (grandma) comes to stay and during this time Meena discovers and learns more about her family and history and slowly embraces the old customs and language.It is an adventurous year for Meena, as she begins to see that people around her are not always what they appear to be.Meera Syal has done a superb job in capturing the small world of a child. There are laughs, frowns and sighs to be had, whilst reading this wonderful tale of Meera. Can't wait to read more from this author."},{"Title":"Anita and Me (New Press International Fiction Series)","review":"touching story that is sincere and funny. through the eyes of a girl, we see the racist poverty-stricken English suburb with immaculate clarity. syal blends in issues of second generation immigrant, adolescence, race, sexuality and culture effortlessly.

We read it in our reading group and the girls liked it especially. I think if you are in your early 30s and around the same age as the author (I think?!) you recognise so much of what it was like to be growing up in the late 60s/early 70s. The stuff about being in a girl &quot;gang&quot; was so perfectly evoked! The exploration of growing racism in the village and how it relates to industrial growth and unemployment was revealing yet understated.

Many works have been written on the same theme, this one however stands apart. You can feel that the author herself has had or has been a witness to many similar experiences, which she describes in the book. Overall this was a fun read. I will also recommend the reader to see a movie called \\"Bhaji on the beach\\" for which Syal is the scriptwriter.I really thought hard and could not think of anything other than five stars."},{"Title":"Anita and Me (New Press International Fiction Series)","review":"Many parts of this book reminded me of what my own childhood was like; yearning to be with the &quot;In&quot; crowd, getting into constant trouble with my family, having a field day making fun of my neighbors. I also like how Meena seems to blossom from a being hostile, confused girl to being a confident young lady, considering that she is only nine. Maybe this is a result of all the zany activities Meena goes through in the book.Though the novel is called 'Anita and Me', it really seemed more about the relationship between Meena and her immigrant family and friends. The book really gives an insight into a family that has to deal with culture clashes and strident racism on a regular basis.I also like the colorful characters who live in this English hamlet. From Anita to Auntie Shaila, they make the book as a whole look complete with their eccentricities and good old English/Indian humor! A must read for those who want to get into a mature and fascinating book about a 'different' type of childhood."},{"Title":"Anita and Me (New Press International Fiction Series)","review":"'Anita and Me' is a funny and catching book which deals with racism in a light but effective way.

Her transformation from a 'follower', seeking to fit in, to an assertive individual is well described.The scenes from British &amp; Indian life are very accurate &amp; part of the books endearing quality is that you can identify with the diverse aspects.To summarise, a great story about establishing &amp; surviving without compromising on who you are!"},{"Title":"Anita and Me (New Press International Fiction Series)","review":"I came across this book by accident while I was visiting England. It is a great story. As a young 30 something myself, who grew up as an &quot;ethnic minority&quot; in a small community in rural upstate New York, I was amazed at the similarities in experiences that faced English Meena and the American me. I really applaud the way this book was written. Instead of making the reader feel sorry for Meena, we laugh with her, and share in her natural exuberance of life. The book also follows Meena's loss of innocence from childhood through adolescence; a loss that is unfortunately part of growing up. I felt that this book crossed cultural boundaries and would appeal to many people. I really liked the book and couldn't put it down until I'd finished reading it. A &quot;must read&quot; book."},{"Title":"Anita and Me (New Press International Fiction Series)","review":"Meena's descriptions of her conflicted self were truly identifiable. Too young to be with the tough crowd, too old to be with the little kids. English, but Indian. I appreciated that Syral didn't sugarcoat Meena's story too much, especially the racism so prevasive in England during the late 60's / early seventies. This book was hard to put down. My only criticism is that I wasn't always sure exactly what time period the story took place."},{"Title":"Anita and Me (New Press International Fiction Series)","review":"One of the best Christmas gifts I received last year- I was upset when I finally finshed it!

I'm not a great reader but I found this book very enjoyable and I would definitely read it again."},{"Title":"Anita and Me (New Press International Fiction Series)","review":"Our book group (9 women in the UK Midlands) reviewed this book. We all enjoyed it, although it was the background and the meticulously described setting and details of everyday life which absorbed us. The plot is very light. However, it's not set in the 1960s as it claims. We all grew up in the late 60s and 70s in England and we recognised the details as early seventies e.g., &quot;Two years earlier we went to see Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; for my birthday. This film came out in 1971. There are many other examples we recognised from our own seventies schooldays. This flaw detracted from a richly evocative portrait of the life of a little Punjabi girl trying to be like the English people around her. White English all, we were able to step outside ourselves and take a look at our childhoods from another point of view."},{"Title":"Copper","review":"The Butte, Montana mines were in full swing in the 1880s, producing large amounts of gold and silver with copper being a nasty by-product. Along came the Copper Barons and Marcus Daly decided to build his own smelter in Anaconda to save the costs of shipping the copper ore to Wales for smeltering. Several stories are intertwined throughout the book and it keeps the reader's attention. A good book, very factual, but the story ends leaving too many threads that need to be tied up. I was hoping for a sequel."},{"Title":"Mount Allegro (Morningside Book)","review":"Jerre Mangione's writing is so vivid that reading it brought back my childhood years in the 20's and 30's. His Mt Allegro (NY) was my Silver Lake (NJ). His parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, neighbors were mine with similar names. His family gatherings were mine, too. In this land of immigrants, each era has its own stories of growing up in America. Mangione tells his with the greatest affection, bitter-sweet nostalgia, and tender humor. Recently,I gave a copy of Mt Allegro to my Aunt Angie for her 87th birthday. She plans to pass it along to her older sisters."},{"Title":"Mount Allegro (Morningside Book)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I had to review it for a seminar in grad school.

It is filled with amusing stories and familiar family behaviors ... Fun to read ..."},{"Title":"Mount Allegro (Morningside Book)","review":"I loved this book so much that I bought one for each of my four adult children, and one for my cousins, for Christmas. Although it gets just a tad bogged down in the middle, it is overall a wonderfully entertaining book with valuable information for my kids to know (like - \\"Hey! I'm not crazy! I'm Sicilian! :)\\" What I mean is, sometimes we do things and we really have no idea why. It's what we learned. This book helps us to diagnose which parts of our culture we want to keep, and which things are flexible. I especially love that he shows and appreciates all the positive attributes of Italian culture: the warm generosity, caring, family oriented virtues, which make people feel instantly welcome. It's a talent I have that I now realize not every culture passes on to their young. I also loved that the book is SICILIAN and ROCHESTER. He describes in detail people I remember (like the street vendors)."},{"Title":"Mount Allegro (Morningside Book)","review":"This is by far the most entertaining book I've read on Italian-American culture so far. The author has a unique way of speaking about the good, the bad and the ugly part of the Sicilian culture and experience, but he does it without offending anyone. I can't count how many times I burst out laughing at the behavior of some of his many colorful characters. I am not Italian but I am married to a Calabrese and I felt like I was reading about many of my in-laws. Now that I am done reading it, I am passing it on to my husband. I told him it was a must read for him and everybody in his family. He would relate to it more than me, but even if you are not Italian or Sicilian or even married to one, this is definitely a book to read just for entertainment purposes. Though many of the stories are hysterical they are very well written. I don't think the author was trying to be funny, he was just writing from the heart and his experiences growing up stuck between two cultures and that's about as funny as it gets."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF THE FARM. THREE VOLS.","review":"After watching Victorian Farm, I bought this book immediately. I live off off-grid in Central Texas and much of what we do here is live our lives according to the old ways. This book seemed to be a great asset for us. What Alex Langlands wrote and offered is really good. I'd love to read a book from him. In my mind, he is very close to figuring out what is wrong with the world, and he hints at it in this book (suggesting that perhaps knowing how to operate a horse would be a great thing if society were to collapse, etc.). Unhappily, the book itself has been heavily, heavily abridged, and much of what would have been great information for people living like we do has been left out. What we'd really like is the whole Book of the Farm in an unabridged version. That was what I was hoping to get, and that is not what this book is.That said, I want to remind the customer that what is here is very good, and I'm not upset that I bought the book. I would just have liked to have the whole Book of the Farm and not an abridged version."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF THE FARM.

THREE VOLS.","review":"On the whole, Henry Stephens's Book of the Farm offers excellent and in depth insight into farming during the Mid 19th Century. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of agriculture and to modern day organic farmers. This book has a lot of information that can be gleaned and applied to small scale organic farms in operation today. I'm very impressed with how efficient some of these so called low-tech methods are compared to our current mechanised practices.The Kindle version of the book is somewhat lacking (at the time of writing this review). It is only Vol. 2 of the two volume set of the unabridged version of the Book of the Farm. As far as I can tell it is missing the first half of the book.The kindle version does have at least some of the gorgeous illustrations which show up really nicely on my kindle (version 3).Until the Kindle version of this book is fixed, I would recommend the abridged version of Henry Stephens's Book of the Farm, edited by Alex Langlands.

Shaver does not try to glamorize the life of the soldiers. He mentions that they had no shoes or food in the winter, as well as the absolute misery of the trenches of Petersburg. He should know, because he was there, and the book does contain things that a former Confederate soldier might pine over-especially the idea of the \\"Lost Cause\\".

It was explained in the Introduction to this book that \\"If you wanted advice in our family, you went to Uncle Kasimir:Polish emigre, self-made millionaire and enigmatic genius (and you always called him Uncle Kasimir, even if, as with both of us, he was actually your great uncle.\\" During the Second World War Uncle Kasimir was a soldier and later a spy. After the war, he came to England, and by the time he was 30 he had made his first million. In 1980 he moved to the Swiss Alps with his dog, Anna Karenina III.After Uncle Kasimir disappeared his old camphor wood chest was sent to the Czerniak family. In the chest were discovered hundreds of letters, photographs, notes, half-completed manuscripts and so forth. This book is a collection of this material. It is obvious that although Uncle Kasimir may never have married and had children of his own, he had special feelings for his grand niece, the author of this book. It is also clear that Gabi Czerniak loved her great uncle very much as well. In fact I think as she explained in her Afterward she was really hoping that in getting the book published Uncle Kasimir might discover it and find her.This book is very endearing to me as a first generation Lithuanian American. My maternal grandfather, Bronius Stasiulis, was very special to me also. He was our family sage. He emigrated to Canada from a displaced person's camp in Germany with his wife, my grandmother, and his two sons following one of his younger daughter's emigration on a work permit. My mother (his oldest daughter)father and older sister were the only ones in our family to emigrate to the United States. We lived in Detroit and used to spend our summers in the Toronto area where most of the other relatives lived. My grandfather was the one everyone turned to for his learned opinions. Like Uncle Kasimir he had been a soldier in the old country, a Lithuanian Army officer in fact and later a police chief. We lost him due to illness in 1980 but he left a mark on all of us our family admiring him the same way Gabi Czerniak admired her Great Uncle Kasimir.If you want to read a heartwarming book full of amusing stories about family and friends and rich with old world advice this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Wisdom Of Uncle Kasimir","review":"The setup is simple. Descendants of an amazing Polish millionaire feel a duty to share his advice and wisdom with a wider audience, the contents of a small chest and the correspondence sent him by his extended family over the course of a lifetime.What follows is an extremely funny selection of material, something like the Pickwick Papers, as Uncle provides military strategies to outwit a bully, advises a drama student on the mysteries of attracting women, details the preferred means of painting his dog, and so on. (for anybody who is a fan of the dreadful Arthur Sarnoff paintings of dogs playing poker, this part is great!)Mr Kasimir has a unique way with the English language, for sure, and his tales of his past make for a really funny and stimulating book. While outwardly absurd, the content of Uncle's ruminations do indeed contain many pearls of wisdom, and the breadth of his experience, his mad dash through history, provides a rich background to this little gem of a book.As Uncle says, i am waiting for next Uncle Kasimir instalment like \\"like pike who observe duckling\\"!"},{"Title":"Sitting in my box (McGraw-Hill Reading : leveled books)","review":"This is a cute story about a young boy sitting in his box, and all the imaginary animals that come to visit him while reading.

All around, one of the best books I've invested in since making cards."},{"Title":"QUICK & CLEVER HANDMADE CARDS","review":"The card projects in this book have a good balance of efficiency and attractiveness. Most of these designs and instructions are nicely applied to individual cardmaking as well as mass-producing for invitations and announcements.Author Julie Hickey starts with a section that explores basic tools and supplies, including the card stock and envelopes. I can honestly say that this is the first cardmaking book I've come across that explains the logistics of stocking up on supplies so thoroughly well.She has also perfected a standardized system which uses a few basic card sizes/shapes for all the designs. There are even patterns included for making envelopes (thank you!) so that if you can't find suitable envelopes at the craft store you won't be stuck with the ugly industrial kind to ruin the effect you worked to achieve with your custom card.Hickey seems to start from an assumed beginner level and progresses the crafter though different projects to the more advanced cards at the end. All the steps are carefully illustrated with photos. I will describe the overall look of her designs as simple and elegant, but except for a few, not particularly innovative. A nice range of popular materials and styles are explored in the projects, including buttons, charms, microbeads, vellum, copper, shrink plastic and rubber-stamping. These are fun cards you might make up ahead for the sheer enjoyment and file safely away until an occasion calls for one; and yes as promised, there are card ideas to suit any occasion, or that can be easily adapted.Recommended for card crafters that are looking for enjoyable, pretty projects that don't take up much time or money.-Andrea, aka Merribelle"},{"Title":"QUICK & CLEVER HANDMADE CARDS","review":"I just purchased this book and am a new scrapbooker / card maker.

Roberts is probably the leading expert at this sort of thing, especially when it comes to uncovering surprising connections, like the British royal descent of Karl Marx's wife (whose grandmother was Scottish), and he carefully lays out examples of what might be called &quot;genealogical evolution,&quot; demonstating that genealogy really is inclusive, not exclusive.

Of course the fair maiden in distress is also a frequent theme. If you love this kind of art then this book is highly recommended. The master, Frank Frazetta, also gives a nice two page introduction to Kelly's work."},{"Title":"The art of Ken Kelly","review":"First of all Ken Kelly was not only a student of Frank Frazetta but Frank married Ken's cousin. For those familliar with Frank Frazetta's work you will notice a lot of similarities in the two artists work like you can in comparing any student and teacher work. But Ken uses a lot of dark backgrounds mixed with bold colors making your attention focus on where he wants you to look. Also using the dark backgrounds makes the colors stand out and look vibrant. Ken Kelly's figures always seem alive in his paintings, as if he captured the event with a camera. He's without a doubt one of the best fantasy/sci fi artists out there."},{"Title":"The art of Ken Kelly","review":"Remarks:- Too many blank pages.

These are attractive pieces, with powerful male and female figures, even if the women are more often behind the mighty male than beside or in front. One compositional oddity recurs throughout this collection: his tendency to leave lots of blank space at the top of each picture. Although I don't recognize them, I believe that most of these paintings were intended as cover are for paperback books and needed space for book titles. In context, that quirk makes good sense.BTW, Frazetta contributed only an introduction to this book of one of his students, so listing him as an author isn't the most honest of advertising. And, despites the many merits of Kelly's work, it often lacks some emotional intangible that Frazetta had mastered. No matter, these are enjoyable paintings and will hold their own in any collection of fantasy art.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The art of Ken Kelly","review":"Kelly advertizes himself as a \\"student\\" of Frank Frazetta, but he hasn't learned anything except how to imitate the master. Stiff, uninvolving, poorly designed, lifeless figures go through boring rehashes of Frazetta motifs. If a student showed me this work, I'd encourage him to keep going in the hope that he might eventually find his own style. He once did a Famous Monsters of Filmland cover that wasn't too bad, because he was copying from photographs. Boris is another one that has built a career scavenging from Frazetta, but at least he has slick craftmanship. Kelly is an incompetent draughtsman and his compositions are awkward. Did his family connections get him this book? Sorry to sound harsh, but this stuff is junior league."},{"Title":"The art of Ken Kelly","review":"Personally I don't care who taught who,or who came out first.I just care about who I think's the best.And I admit that Frank Frazetta's stuffs good,,but it's nothing Boris Vallejo,Julie Bell or this guy Ken Kelly couldn't do,and sometimes even better.As a matter of fact,I think some of Frank Frazetta's stuff suck's.I mean for instance,let's take the fact that I like the Egyptian Queen poster alot,and the aparition one,but I hate the neanderthal one,and the Ocean Witch one,those one's are just stupid,and I don't think that they look that good at all.And if you want a more artistic analogy.Well,I think they looked badly drawn,unrealistic,and blurry,not to mention their themes sucked.To me it looked like something a novice might of drawn.Now as far as Boris Vallejo's stuff go's,In which he happens to be my personal favorite Fantasy artist of them all,I may at times disagree with some of the style's that he uses.although ofcourse that's not very often,but I never,ever thought his artwork was anything less than amazing.The fantasy people depicted in his art,are alway's realistic looking,and very well drawn.As is Julie Bells,and Ken Kelly's,now Luis Royo could use a little bit of work,but other than that,I think their all great!Including the over rated Frank Frazetta.I think instead of only liking one artist,and despising the rest,we should just thank God that there are people out there who can draw this amazingly.So,ofcourse I highly recommend this book,for all the Fantasy art lover's out there,along with the other artist's that I mentioned...."},{"Title":"Knowles' A Separate Peace (Cliffs Notes)","review":"This book helped me to help my grandson answer the questions that would promote thought.

The stories wonderfully demonstrate the unique way Filipinos look at their environment and surroundings. The stories are exquisitely told - always using just the right voice, just the right tone, and just the right amount of detail to help the story and characters come alive.

It alone provoked many thougths and many lessons of my own, and will continue to do so. I found Tim Ward to display his experience in a very precise,beautiful, and funny way. The point of everything...to be able to laugh."},{"Title":"What the Buddha Never Taught","review":"&quot;What the Buddha Never Taught&quot; is not unbearable, especially if the reader has some interest in Thai monastic life, but the author's glibness suggests that perhaps he was more interested in contriving an interesting story than learning what the Buddha really taught."},{"Title":"What the Buddha Never Taught","review":"Personally I really liked this book. I'm just now starting to learn about Buddhism and I feel that reading \\"What the Buddha Never Taught\\" has greatly helped in my understanding of some of the important concepts of Buddhism. The main concept of what the Buddha never taught was related to the teaching of \\"no self.\\" It took me a couple times to read it and understand that Tim and his buddy Jim figured out that everything is suffering. They concluded that the ego/self/monkey-mind causes the suffering, but the Buddha mentioned that ego was an illusion. However, they agreed that suffering was real. They then tried to figure out how to kill ego. They discovered that the ego lives by pointing into the future, and making points stick; so if you stop trying to make points, you will cut off the ego. They found though that if everything is pointless, there is no reward/no happiness because it's the ego that gets happiness. That's kind of a sad lesson to learn. The book also tells of some Buddha stories, one was the story of the mangy dog. \\"What the Buddha Never Taught\\" talks about the spiritual journey that the author, Tim Ward, took to Thailand to study Theravada Buddhism at a monastery by the name of Wat Pah Natachat. The book tells how Mr. Ward chose to become a pahkow; how he had to take vows, shave his head, wear robes, and what his daily duties consisted of as a pahkow. It showed what the monks daily lives were like, such as going out for bindabhat, how everyone in the monastery got their own little kuti to live in, the daily duties like sweeping, and the rules that monks have to follow. The book also gives insight into the loop-holes that monks have to break the rules; for instance they aren't allowed to cut plants, but if a pahkow says the word \\"koppy\\" then the monk is allowed to cut the plant. There were some issues I had with the book though. Tim Ward tended to get off topic a lot throughout the book. He mentioned numerous times throughout the book a red coffee cup. He was obsessed with the cup. I thought there would be a lesson at the end of the book; something like realizing that he was attached to the coffee cup and had to give it up, but there was no lesson. It was just senseless rambling. Furthermore, I didn't like the amount of characters he chose to include in the book. There are about twenty five characters in the back of the book, but he probably could have gotten by talking about only ten of them because a lot of them were relatively unimportant. To add more confusion, he gets the bright idea to call himself and Jim, the names Bob and Boomer. Lastly, I didn't like that Tim Ward complained about Theravada Buddhism a lot. He seemed to judge everything from complaining about the hierarchy, how the monks kept Ajahn Chah alive just to make more money, and that monks shouldn't be locked up in the monastery but to go out into the world and help people. I feel his book should have reflected what he learned by his stay, not his political views. I also, recommend this book to anyone interested in the culture of Thailand. The book discussed some interesting social norms that the people of Thailand have. For instance, the opinion they have on suicide and their fear of pee bahs. A pee bah is a forest ghost. In the book, Tim Ward tells about how a monk had to be transferred to a different monastery because the Thailand villagers around them feared that he was one of these ghosts, and the other monks didn't want the villagers to get scared and stop donating food to them. Even though Tim Ward included some stupid things in this book, I still recommend it to anyone new to Buddhism, feel they might like a little more insight into Buddhism, or if a person is interested in Thailand in general. He did bring up some really good principles about Buddhism, and give good insight into the daily lives of monks."},{"Title":"What the Buddha Never Taught","review":"Ward's account of his stay in a famous Thai forest monastery provides a profound glimpse of the potential rewards and the many difficulties of Buddhist practice. His unvarnished, well-told story is a far more realistic view of what that path is all about than you are likely to find in most Buddhist how-to manuals."},{"Title":"What the Buddha Never Taught","review":"It's striking to me how Buddhists are typically upset by this book. Most of them, I expect, have never been monks for even a short time, yet they seem sure that a monk's life is wonderful and richly rewarding...for someone else, not them! There's no need to argue about whether the author got it all wrong about Ajahn Chah and Wat Pah Nanachat, one need only look at the numbers: Very, very few people are able to live, prosper and be happy in the forest tradition of Ajahn Chah for even a short time. Of the hundreds who did take vows and become monks since 1970, almost all have disrobed.Why such attrition? Let's be frank. It's because for almost everyone, being a monk just plain sucks. Nirvana isn't achievable, and boredom reigns supreme. Therefore, long term monks are rarer than hen's teeth. The numbers don't lie and prove this is so. If it were true that a monk's life was that of being blissed out in jhana and the joy of the 3 gems, wouldn't being a monk be a tad more popular? But it's anything but popular, as only a very few even try this life, and those who succeed at staying in robes for years are generally, in my experience, extremely strong willed and idealistic individuals. Many of them seem to be just enduring monkdom, not thriving. After all these years, how many Western monks are there in the U.S.? Far fewer than a hundred, and most of them have been monks for less than 10 years. And yet, ask a Buddhist if a monks life is wonderful, and they're bound to say yes. It's just a romantic notion, nothing more.I read a recent interview by a Wat Pah Nanachat resident who disrobed after 9 and a half years. He said that he lasted 9 years longer than the average monk before disrobing. That is, most of those who come to that monastery, fully self assured this is the life for them, leave after only 6 months.I visited the Ajahn Chah monastery in California about a year ago, and met up with someone there who became a monk 13 years ago. I thought he'd be happy: I was shocked to hear him somewhat dolefully remark that he would leave the holy mountain, but he lacked a car with which to leave in. Not quite a ringing endorsement of the joys of the holy life. Few of the monks I met on my visit seemed to fit the description of happy; most of them seemed far more enthralled with monastery building projects than with meditating. And why not? To work, to build and create things, is necessary for human satisfaction. Work and human interaction are a human need. On the other hand, doing little all day, and keeping silent, is generally frustrating to the human psyche. We aren't built to be monks, we're built to be everything monks are not. This isn't because we're of \\"much dust,\\" full of karma, in illusion. It's simply because we're human beings.But being a monk is an exercise in frustrating oneself in just about every way possible, and not just for lack of creativity and human interaction, but in basic comfort, sex, even touching others. Also in very restricted hours of sleep, lack of comfort in sleep (no mattress or pillow), lack of mobility, lack of financial power, restricted diet, being forbidden to kill even insects and vermin, see a movie, or listen to music. No exercise unless done in secret in your kuti.Can't even wear underwear (somehow, this seems to me to be one of the most harrowing restrictions of the monk's life!)If all that's not enough, the monk must live with the knowledge that his livelihood is largely financed by poor Asians, who support him only because they've been told their \\"dana\\" will give them good karma.It's just a very tough life, and not because of the sin of attachment to material things. It's tough because it's based on superstition about karma and reincarnation and nirvana, \\"kilesas,\\" and too much else to list here.What's the upside? Oh right, nirvana. Enlightenment. Sure. Hey go for it, fly to Ubon tonight and take vows. Then you'll be able to criticize the author of this book, who has done a great service in trying to dispel the romantic notions of armchair Buddhists."},{"Title":"What the Buddha Never Taught","review":"What The Buddah Never Taught is an exhilerating, real to life account of the daily life and ordeals of living in a Buddhist monastery.

If your the average Western thinker looking for insight into the life of a monk and one man... READ THIS BOOK. For me, the average American, this book spoke volumes to me, it was smart, clever, humorous, and very benificial. So please READ THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"What the Buddha Never Taught","review":"Inscribed on the inside cover of this book is the saying: \\"do not speak unless you can improve on silence.\\" If the maxim was followed, this book would never have been written.The author travelled to the Thai Temple for International Monks, Wat Pah Nanachat, and spent a brief period there practicing the dharma. Most of what he found out there is essentially valid. Namely: 1.) you don't need to be a monk in order to meditate; 2.) many of the rules in the vinaya don't always make sense in modern life; 3.) Samsara is a mental state; and 4.) disciples can and do misinterpret their teachers.As someone with a philosophy background, he was also quick to pick up the fundamentals of the philosophy of buddhism and buddhist practice. By the end of the book, he was at least able to recognize and apologize for his passive-agressive attacks, tests, and harangues of the monks there, which he describes with admirable frankness. I was very impressed by the restraint exercised by the monks in the face of this. The monks were remarkably kind and tolerant; they must have regarded Tim Ward's personal attacks and outbursts with compassion.I read this book because I was interested in Wat Pah Nanachat, and this is a book about a brief stay at Wah Pah Nanachat. Tim Ward is a journalist, and was on a trip through asia in which he sampled various different religions and temples. It was interesting in its own right for being a beginner's tale, but would have been more illuminating had the author been more experienced by the time he arrived at Pah Nanachat, or spent much more time there sincerely practicing.It is also written from the standpoint of a journalist who appreciates scandal and drama more than peace and harmony. In the book, Mr. Ward has real difficulty following the part of the eightfold path dedicated to right speech, and also observing the fundamental rule of not looking to others to judge how they are practicing, but rather looking inwardly.The author remarks several time throughout the book about how he is an author, and how he made plans during meditation time for writing books, teaching at a university etc. It almost seems as if the dialogue in the book was engaged in for the purpose of putting it into this book.Still, there were some remarkable facts about life at Wat Pah Nanachat that stand out: giant cobras, killer centipedes, scorpions and spiders as big as a hand, huge flying insects, pervasive swarms of biting insects, olives pickled in cow urine to fight constant constipation caused by eating all food for the day in one meal, and descriptions of strange Thai fruits. The Jungle around the Wat was reminiscent of the description of the garden of eden in Paradise Lost, with more thorns and biting insects.On the whole though, this book is not recommended for those on the path."},{"Title":"What the Buddha Never Taught","review":"More than ever, Buddhism requires a good old fashioned spring-cleaning. Every school of Buddhism has its own biases, problems, hypocrisies and sheer nonsense...all are now tending to stray further and further away from the original point. Theravadan Buddhism is no exception.Tim does a good beginner's job of highlighting some of the obvious question marks about Theravadan monastic life. Since Tim never professes to be an expert in Buddhism, one should read the book from this point of view. His views are not \\"expert\\" but neither should his views be dismissed out of hand.I was very fortunate to get my hands on a used copy prior to going to Wat Pah Nanachat myself last summer and thought it provided an interesting if dated observation (his stay was back in 1985). I stayed at WPN and another Theravadan monastery in Thailand for a few weeks and was able to compare notes, 20 years on.While I concur with many of Tim's observations and questions (such as the almost excessive degree of veneration that the Thai people tend to show these mostly Western monks, many of whom were dropouts or ne'er do wells in their society), I felt that he may have spent a bit too much time observing and writing notes and not as much time practicing the Dhamma in such a conducive environment. WPN is extremely spacious, both in the physical sense and spiritual sense. It really gives one the feeling of silence and emptiness, at least when I was there.I was expecting a very exciting and dangerous environment after reading his book. Instead, I found WPN to be extremely clean, empty and very still. There was little chance to speak with the monks or other lay attendees (except at the beginning with the Guest Monk); in fact, excessive speaking and interaction were discouraged and frowned upon. I felt the atmosphere was quite strict in terms of practice, not unfriendly, just a solemn serious tone. The days were pretty routine...there was some structure, but most of the time was for individual practice. Boredom, loneliness and sexual desire were the main manifestations or \\"defilements\\" that came up right away. The food quality at WPN was first rate (\\"temple food\\"), even for lay visitors at the end of the line at the morning meal.I walked the full length and breadth of WPN, both on and off the paths and in the jungle areas. I found no evidence of cobras, scorpions or other dangers as mentioned in Tim's book. There were a few mosquitos, but not many. The temperature was in the mid to high 20s and much less than the 38C I had just come from in Taiwan. I really didn't feel the environment at that time was harsh or austere. The facilities and kutis at WPN were first class...nothing compared to the grass shacks that I had imagined.This is not to say that in fact Tim was lying or exaggerating to make his account sound more interesting than it was; as mentioned, he stayed at WPN at the tail end of the Ajahn Chah era when things may have been quite different, more bustling, energetic, and still a bit Wild West. My experience and impressions of WPN were quite different, but then again, I am a practicing Buddhist, who had a lot of foreknowledge of the Thai Forest Tradition and was visting 20 years later.I think the real value of this book is that it offers a rare challenge to the often stagnant conservatism and at times outright elitism of Theravadan Buddhism. It also highlights the challenges that Theravadan Buddhism faces if is to make inroads into Western society and be taken seriously. A lot of the other forms of Buddhism nowadays in the West are either packaged as attractive relaxation meditation pablum or seductive worshipping of some charismatic guru or lama in technicolour robes...nonetheless, these forms of Buddhism seem to have much greater appeal than the relatively dour and backward-looking Theravadan approach.As Ajahn Chah has said, there are many roads to enlightenment; the Theravadan Thai Forest tradition at WPN is one of them and for my money one of the best and purest, despite it's limitations. Nevertheless, many now feel that Theravadan Buddhism desperately needs an overhaul; Tim's book is one of the first to dare to suggest this."},{"Title":"What the Buddha Never Taught","review":"For me a newly practicing Buddhist, reading &quot;What the Buddha Never Taught&quot; was like being in a support group with a whole cast of characters failing where I fail and doubting where I doubt.

The author's focus, however, is on the physical discomforts at Wat Pah Nanachat in Thailand and the all-too-human faults that commonly arise in groups of people gathered for whatever reason, even a 'higher purpose'. Kind of interesting for readers that may not expect such goings on in ashram life. For those interested in techniques of sense introversion, see God Without Religion."},{"Title":"What the Buddha Never Taught","review":"Everyone can be a fundamentalist. This &quot;problem&quot; is not limited to Christians, however much we Buddhists would like to think so. Tim Ward shows how Theravada Buddhism, with its stress on the &quot;perfect Dhamma&quot; and hundreds of rules, can be corrupted in practice. Example: monks seem to take advantage of ignorant laypeople. Not surprising; monks are people, too. Example: cliques form in the monastery, and monks can be catty and nasty to each other. Not surprising, of course, but you never hear about it. Example: monks aren't allowed to kill anything. So, they take a layperson with them into the jungle, and say, &quot;Get rid of this&quot;, pointing at weeds or whatever needs to be cleared. This is not consistent with the spirit of the rules, but it follows the letter of the rules. Thus the problems of literalism raise their head.

An excellent, insightful, and entertaining read well worth the time spent with it. Perhaps problematic for folks actively struggling against dogmatic tendencies or elements of pride and/or identity. As with all teaching--take from it that which proves truthful and useful, and leave the rest."},{"Title":"What the Buddha Never Taught","review":"This is a sweet book of self discovery on a path that many Westerners have taken over the past forty years using Asian ideas and practices to come to terms with an inner world they find uncomfortable. Tim Ward ended up in the Western monastery in Thailand of the Buddhist monk Ajaan Cha who was teacher to Jack Kornfield and Ajaan Sumedho. Ajaan Cha is the lineage head of the many monasteries Sumedho has help found in England, America, Australia, and elsewhere around the world. By the time Tim arrived in 1985 Ajaan Cha had been disabled by water on the brain for more than five years. Tim's tale of the monastery is revealing of the outer flaws of monastic life and his own struggle to come to terms with them. Monks influenced by Ajaan Cha and his students often promote monastic life as the answer to life's problems. The world Tim reveals is all too human. There are personalities, there is blind submission to Thai culture which treats monks almost as magical persons. Laypersons earn merit for themselves in this life and future lives by feeding and serving the monks, and the monks rationalize what they know to be a way too simple understanding of Buddhism because it maintains their lifestyle. Tim befriends another novice with whom he can talk about all these contradictions. The friend leaves and, although apparently not there much longer, Tim becomes really angry about what he feels are compromises. The anger is palpable and the reader senses how out of proportion it is to the inconsistencies in monastic life. The book is redeemed and Tim begins to understand what he has been missing when the very monks he dumps his anger on respond to him with authentic compassion. Their monastic life has imbued in them both a love and equanimity so they are not at all hooked by what they recognize as clearly Tim's discontents whatever the actual problems of Thai monasteries may be.This is an engaging book. There are wonderful descriptions of the discomforts engendered by mosquitoes, ants, scorpions, and snakes of a countryside which had once been wild and was giving way to civilization. The dialogue between Tim and his friend, his taunting of others in the monastery, his easy explanation of Buddhist ideas make for interesting reading. The book flows nicely and, as reader, I looked forward to what challenge would come next for Tim. These days Buddhism is presented as a cure all touted on the covers of popular magazines. The Dalai Lama has become a hero. While Buddhism can offer some people relief from their problems, it has a long diverse history as a religion with all kinds of awkwardnesses not revealed by its promoters. It is refreshing to get a look into one man's experience in a monastery. It has many familiar ordinary human failures along with redeeming qualities. And of course, other people in other monastic settings have had quite different experiences. I think this is an important book to read for both Buddhist practitioners and people for whom Buddhism has been placed on a pedestal.Charlie Fisher author of Dismantling Discontent: Buddha's Way Through Darwin's World"},{"Title":"The Story of Jesus","review":"This book was very helpful for my children.

The story unfolds as Carie tells her story to the writer. Who the writer is is not clear though she is Chinese and knows Carie for 30 years. Carie comes from a Dutch family who immigrates to the US for God and liberty. Continuing in the family tradition of being a exile, she and her husband become missionaries to China. Carie always loves the US as home, influencing her children in the same way. Ultimately she is an exile in China though she has chosen to be there. Ironically as she returns to the states for her last furlough (which were very few and far between), she is no longer at home there either and returns to China where 3 small graves remain. A woman of courage and ingenuity, she finds her place of usefulness in her called life, committing herself to those in need, mending physical bodies, bringing beauty to a difficult life, and struggling with the suffering around her. She views her husband's call as the real call because it is focused solely on the spiritual. This brings a sadness (my perception) to the whole story as I considered how different her life might have been if she had understood her life as partnering in value with her husband's call. One of the best episodes in the book (p. 155-162) which reflects her faith and pluck recounts her response to the threat of violence against herself and her children. During a long period of drought some of the Chinese begin blaming the foreigners and there are threats made on her life. She prays \\"if it is Thy will, save us, but in any case, help me not to be afraid. If the time comes to die, help me to have the children go first.\\" When darkness falls and midnight comes, she and her helper/friend Wang Amah set up for tea, cleaning and preparing for guests. She opens wide the front gate to the street with all the lights in the house on. She awakens and dresses her children, bringing them downstairs to play. She sews and waits. When the voices draw near she goes to the door inviting the men with sticks, clubs and knives inside, saying \\"Come in, friends, neighbors! I have tea prepared.\\" A few come forward; she serves them as if royalty. When she hears one of the men say \\"strange she is not afraid!\\" she responds \\"why should I fear my neighbors?\\" Some leave, some stay to try the organ, play with the children. Eventually the leader announces \\"there is nothing more to do here. I go home.\\" She and her children have survived another day. The daily lives of missionaries, especially women, have not received significant attention. That is one of the strengths this book has to offer. Honest in recounting her inner most spiritual struggles, Carie lives the life of a servant for the Chinese people. The book ends with her death and the writer's appraisal of her life: \\"But if she judged her life fallen short, to us, among whom she lived, what a life it was! I do not think one of us would have called her a saintly woman. She was far too practical, far too vivid and passionate, too full of humor and change and temper for that. She was the most human person we have ever known, the most complex in her swift compassion, in her gusts of merriment and in her utter impatiences; she was best friend and companion to us.\\" The last statement is \\"to all of everywhere who knew her this woman was America.\\" (This is a far cry from the blame and poor press given to some missionaries today, unable to grasp the love that impels Christians to share the love of Christ.)In reading this book I came to care for the main character, both respecting her and wishing greater joy for her spirit. After doing some research on Buck's own life, I am guessing that this book is about her own mother named Caroline."},{"Title":"The Exile","review":"I read this after Pearl Buck's classic, \\"The Good Earth\\". As much as I adored The Good Earth, I loved The Exile even more. It's the true story of Pearl's mother from her childhood in the United States to her marriage and move to China. The story of her courage during the Boxer Rebellion was inspiring. Her sorrow over the loss of children was almost unbearable. Her strength through it all was a triumph."},{"Title":"The Exile","review":"Beginning with an image of her pretty mother, strong, sturdy, hard at work cultivating an American garden in China where she is shown impassioned with pity for a distressed mother bird whose nest has been destroyed, then moving to an account of how the liberty-impassioned Dutch and French parents of Carie Stulting came to America to escape religious intolerance in Holland, Pearl Buck begins the process of drawing readers into a loving, in-depth memorial of her mother's life as missionary wife and mother. (The story picks up about 30 pages into the book when Carie takes up the story strain herself.)In this biography of Carie Stulting Sydenstricker, Pearl Buck repeats again and again but in differing phrases one underlying theme. It is that her mother and father were Christians of two opposing temperaments and that their marriage was lacking. Seemingly, Carie suffered most from this circumstance. She agonized also because of a lack of confidence that her own response to God's call was wholehearted and adequate.Actually, however, the story of Carie's life seems to show that she was a veritable saint, even if a practical, earth-interested one. She was a vibrant, brave, and gifted woman, always unrestrainedly responsive in an effort to relieve sick and suffering people, which service she performed out of a wellspring of pure natural instinct rather than out of premeditated piety. This immediacy and spontaneity were key character traits of hers. Her impetuous, unpremeditated, feelingful response-ability seems to have derived first from natural, inborn qualities backed up secondarily by her dutiful Christian ideals. Although she was fastidious, artistic by temperament, and cared to have beauty in her surroundings, always remembering and longing for the lovely life of her American girlhood, she was heroic in bearing living conditions almost entirely devoid of beauty, cleanliness, healthfulness, or comfort (except for a get-away place late in life in the cool mountain wilderness of Kuling). Her husband, who was fixated always on the work of God and evinced little concern for family life, was absent most of the time and Carie was left to deal alone with dangerous and harrowing threats in Chinese life that arose to confront her and her little children.Carie raised and lost to disease four out of seven children in China, yet she overcame bitterness. She fought out of the heritage of her own brave spirit and her own determined renewed effort of blind trust in a God who was always inexplicably unresponsive to her plea for a sign from Him that she was pleasing Him in her works and life choices. She repeatedly rose up bravely from overwhelming disease, loss, sufferings, enduring these great blows to her strongly emotional nature. Too, it seems clear that however much her husband may have seemed like a stranger to her, she consciously and willingly tried to serve as helpmate to him.I wanted to think there may have been more depth of meaningful relationship for the out-of-sync temperaments of her parents than Pearl, who greatly favored her mother over her father, liked to admit. Sometimes the conversations that she recreates seem merely typical of many ordinary marriages which are basically devoted and loving despite the misunderstandings and clashes of temperament involved. I'll give an account of just one such conversation [in which I've used slashes to indicate paragraphing in order to save space]. It occurs after an incident in which Carie realizes that a Chinese woman who chose to devote herself to Carie as child-care maid, an abused woman Carie befriended and brought to live in her house, is dying of cholera. Instantly Carie throws herself into nursing the woman. For a week she spends herself furiously and determinedly caring for this friend in a little hut set up apart from the family for quarantine purposes. Pearl states that Carie did this because she was moved by an immediate battle call of anger toward disease and death itself. When the very sick servant recovers, the following account of an exchange occurs between Carie and Andrew:\\"Carie, with troubled eyes, said, 'I am afraid I did not do it for the Lord's sake.' Somehow she was always forgetting that. /'If you would just remember to do things in His name,\\" said Andrew, anxious for her soul./ 'But, Andy, I don't have time,' she protested earnestly. 'When somebody is dying you haven't time to think why you save them--you have to start doing it right away!'/ But there was the world and all between these two and they looked at each other uncomprehendingly. Andrew was never without thought of God in all he did. To Carie life was so nearly enough in its own richness.\\"As if appropriate to the two different personalities, it seems to me that Pearl Buck's writing style in the two biographies about her parents differs. The style of her father's book is plain and almost dry. There's a great deal of humor which reflects on the one hand the simple and spare wit of Andrew's direct, quiet personality. There's also Pearl's subtle poking of fun at her father's idiosyncratic ways. By contrast, there's little humor in this book about Carie, although there is a good deal of Merriment which Carie is shown creating with her very great talents for making a pleasant home, for music and singing, rhyming, story-telling, and for an outgoing gift for friendship. There's also a rich, almost lyrical descriptiveness in this book. Carie loved life in a \\"sensuous\\" (or down-to-earth) way, according to Pearl, and Pearl is eager to defend the Natural loveliness of her mother against the strictures of the type of religion that would denigrate her for taking joy in the loveliness of earthly life, earthly people, and the beauty of earthly things. (A descendant of artisans who crafted fine furniture and jewelry, Carie had no nice things in her married life except that she once discovered and purchased in China a fine old secondhand table that reminded her of a family table in her distant, longed-for, felicitous, American home. Although Andrew disdained it as unnecessary, the table that Carie cherished and enjoyed served to renew her desperately flagging spirits and to hearten her over many years.)I disagree with Pearl's characterization of Andrew as \\"mystic\\" in his religion. (I guess she may have chosen the term as conveying her father's interest not in things of \\"this world\\" but in matters relating to the \\"other world.\\") His religion was a purely intellectual approach to the Word of God, to Presbyterian doctrines, and to the evangelical work of saving souls. He could be described as \\"passionate\\" about the object of his intellectual religious devotion, but this book makes even more clear than Pearl's book about her father, \\"Fighting Angel,\\" that he gave himself to his missionary vocation entirely out of a sense of Duty. Duty was his passion. It seems to me perhaps that for him there was little sense of the Love relationship with God which is also a factor in religious \\"mysticism\\". Actually, Carie's personality and temperament, although basically practical, appear to have been more typically capable of mysticism, but a deep relationship with God never developed in her because she threw herself so fully into a selfless active life, spontaneously caring for her family and all others in the range of her human capacity for love.Carie's last years, her illness, and then the details surrounding her death do clearly depict the pain and disaffection experienced by Carie in eventual reaction against Andrew's attitudes which Pearl several times characterizes as puritanical. About the last phase of Carie's life, when Carie admits to herself how far apart she and Andrew are, Pearl writes: \\"She had married a man for the stern puritan side of her, but as life had carried her on it was the rich human side of her that had deepened and grown....His somewhat pedantic speech, his slow rare humor, his complete absorption in his task, his inability to face or to understand the practical difficulties in human lives, his own ascetic and rigorous life which held no place for beauty or pleasure, came to repel her, even while she admired his self-control and his exaltation of spirit....She had had visions once of working with him side by side in a comradeship full and invincible....[Once the children were grown and gone,] she plunged with all her old gay vigor into this new period of her life, joyously, never questioning whether Andrew wanted her help or not....She said to herself that surely Andrew would gladly use her strength, as she could use his, each supplementing the other. But she was wrong....[He didn't like her remarks or efforts to share with him spiritually.]... He was imbued, moreover, with the Pauline doctrine of the subjection of the woman to the man and to him it was enough if she kept his house and bore his children and waited on his needs....Through man only could she approach God. So the Scriptures taught....What--was she not to go to God direct because she was born a woman?....It was as though she had come bearing in her two hands her rich gifts of brain and body, giving them freely and as touchingly sure of appreciation as a child--and her gifts had been thrown back at her as useless....she shrank into herself in those days and lived alone in spirit as she never had before in her days of busy motherhood.\\"Carie subdued herself after this realization to an attempt to grow in religious and spiritual devotion, but she was very lonely in the effort. In response to the painful spectacle of her mother's loneliness, Pearl expresses her one single blast of religious rebellion in the book.Carie continued up until she knew she was would soon die to do joyful spiritual and physical ministrations for people. Although she had poured out her life in Christian service to China, she began to wish toward the end that she were able to do more for her own land. She had always loved and revered America longingly from a distance--whence comes the book's title, \\"The Exile\\".Once Carie accepted that her death was imminent, she decided that she would be selfish and do some things to please herself. She said, \\"There are so many things I have not heard of or seen--so many pleasures. Not one of you knows how I love pleasure! I want a victrola. I want to hear music of all the kinds I have not heard.\\" So, her grown-up daughters sent to a far city and got a victrola for her and Carie listened to music by the hour, but to none that was mournful. One daughter brought her mother a new lavender dress that had long been a desirable figment in her imagination. A professional nurse who knew how to lift and care for Carie's weakened body had to be hired and although the nurse turned out to be a worldly, disreputable woman, Carie was kind and made friends with her. Being curious to see dancing, Carie asked the nurse to perform for her the new thing called a fox-trot and commented afterwards: \\"Well, that's a pretty thing--so graceful and light. I should not be surprised if Andrew is all wrong about God. I believe one ought to choose the happy, bright things of life, like dancing and laughter and beauty. I think if I had it to do over again I would choose those instead of thinking them sinful. Who knows?--God might like them.\\"This is a good, delightful book--because it's about Carie, whose personality and character were delightful. For lack of a better metaphor, I'd liken her to condensed sunshine--and she shone on one and all alike. You have to read the book to really appreciate her through Pearl Buck's gifted re-creation of Carie as she alternately shines and flags beneath the weight of the crosses in her life. The detailed account of her last days is particularly moving.The book also offers some vivid glimpses of late 19th and early 20th century missionary life in China.(I feel thankful that Carie and Andrew were given a child who grew up to be an excellent enough writer to tell both their extraordinary, heroic stories so well.)"},{"Title":"The Exile","review":"As wonderful as \\"The Good Earth\\" is... was... is..., no dedicated Buck reader should pass up an opportunity to delve into this Poignant biographical work about her mother.I was a young newly wed when first introduced to this novel, and for several days could think of nothing but this book, and the amazing woman upon whose life it was based. Pearl Buck's father was a missionary in China, and she spent several years of her young life there... thus her intimate knowledge of the ways of the Chinese people. Her father was totally dedicated to his life there,and his work of translating the Bible into a Chinese dialect. Her mother Carrie, on the other hand, was dedicated to her children, and trying against all odds, to give them a normal upbringing during a very turbulent time in China's history. Carrie had been born and raised in Hillsboro, WV. (Pearl Bucks birth place) and desperately longed for the stability of her old home place in America. (I believe Bucks novel,\\"Portrait Of A marriage\\" is loosely based on the marriage of Carrie's parents, Pearl Bucks maternal grandparents.)

As the story wound on I kept waiting for chemistry between Emma and Lachlain. But he kept being forceful and she kept hating him. When I hear about relationships that are like this from friends I think \\"Those two need to break up...now!\\"What really bugs me is if Emma can't lie and she's \\"the good one of the two\\" (if that's possible--they're both monsters!) why doesn't she give a damn that her people have tortured Lachlain for 150 years and that's the real reason he's been so gruff with her, because he's still hurting about that. And she's mourning the fact that she's an outcast hybrid breed. Both have parents who are dead, so, I guess that makes the couple even more of \\"headcases\\".The bottom line is as the story goes on, your hope for these two fades faster and faster and by the time they actually \\"do it\\" on page 250, I really don't care anymore. The author has made it such an unenjoyable read and I don't believe that they'd want to \\"do it\\" at that point. Why??? What has changed so much by page 250? She just took his gifts (a locket and horse), and didn't even say thank you. What a spoiled princess! If it was me, I'd be highly insulted and would snatch the gifts back.Honestly I might skim to the end, but after page 250, I set the book down and just want to go to her next book.

Emma growing up at the end was great.EDIT #2: After reading all six books in the Immortals After Dark series, and the prequel \\"The warlord wants forever\\" I have to say, I LOVE THIS SERIES.

Kresley is awesome!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I really don't know how to rate this book. It didn't feel like a book. The characters lacked character; they were creatures of some sort, shallow, in pursue of needs alone, and with no depth to speak of; they weren't silly or annoying, just nothing to write a review about. The story felt like an underdeveloped kids' tale that I have read or heard a thousand times before only without any meat in it (no pun intended): a beast is released from his jail after centuries, goes after his woman, abducts her, and they live happily ever after, gorged on each other's blood and sex. Actually, I don't think the author intended for the story to take up much space on the pages. It was just the setting for the bestial sex scenes, which were not erotic or shocking or remotely sensational, just... pawing and growling and blood sucking. Oh, and smashing walls and furniture along the way. Fine literature for discriminating readers. I understand why this book sells so well."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Books like these should really have a \\"RAPE FANTASY\\" genre label emblazoned across the front of them. I'm on page 42, and I want to cry and throw up from this book so far. I can't read it anymore. Maybe if I thought it was a horror book it would be barely tolerable, but I was looking for and expecting a paranormal romance. I really find it awful that this thing is masquerading as a romance. I hope the rapist dies an awful death, and that the victim recovers. I can't read any more to find out though because I am guessing from the other reviews that they wind up together. That's about as appealing as child porn. Horrific, awful, YUCK."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Based upon the very good reviews, I was expecting something better. Someone said on \\"Lover Awakened\\" forum that it was a very good read, while waiting for J.R. Ward to produce her next opus. Very similar writing ...Alas, I could not find anything similar ... I found the book boring. Could not finish it, stopped at page 100 and browsed until the last page to see what happened ...Even the cover is not OK (look at the PAWS of the male !)Would have rated ZERO stars if possible ..."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"this is a book that would be good looking on the coffee table, I didn't really understand it."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"These books are sex books and I am not into books like these. I gave it away because I like good books with good storie lines. I guess I enjoy the Young teen books without all the sex stuff."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I love a good romance. This book has a nice mix of mythology, vampires, and romance. This book was so well written that I could not put it down. Thank god I purchased the second book. I read this book in a little over a day and can't wait for book three to become available."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I usually read historical romances (medieval, Georgian, regency & Victorian), but the trend in romance seems to be going in the paranormal direction so I figured I'd give one a try. I was seriously afraid of what I call \\"rolling eyes syndrome\\" ; some things are just unbelievable and I was hoping that this wasn't going to be just a bad B-movie read.I am so surprised! I love this book! It reminds of some of my fav Scottish romances, but MUCH more intense and WAY edgier/darker! The alpha male hero is totally hot Scottish highlander hunk (a real treat for this Julie Garwood fan) and the heroine is this a shy little thing who eventually turns into a kick a*s woman. There's werewolf's, vampire's, Valkyrie, witches, wraiths etc., and Cole (author) does a excellent job introducing and giving background information on each one of these. She does this so well that I became instantly engrossed in the book and simply couldn't put it down. There are tons of really cool secondary characters that each have their own unique powers and personally I can't wait for those sequels!So if you like historical romance or contemporary for that matter, this is a great place to start checking out paranormals. As for me, I have a feeling this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I read a TON of romance. And not the \\"paranormal\\" kind. This is really the first book of this kind that I've read and I LOVED IT! The powers these characters have and the fact that they are immortal, dealing with other types of immortals is really very interesting to read. Stretches the imagination. And Kresley Cole certainly knows how to stir a body up with the romantic scenes!!!! Being this book is part of a series, I also read \\"No rest for the wicked\\". Also a another awesone story. I am honestly chomping at the bit for book three that comes out at the end of October."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I totally agree with someone else on these pages who said she'd give it 10 stars if she could.Kresley Cole is rapidly becoming my favorite author in this genre. She writes with terrific humor, and a great 'ear' for contemporary culture. Plus she's assembled a rich world of immortal creatures, and woven it together in an entrancing way. Well Done! Brava! Other reviewers have commented on the basics of the plot, so I won't repeat that story outline here. I just have to say that of all the authors out there, Sherrilyn Kenyon, Susan Krinard, J.R. Ward, that Kresley Cole takes the cake.My favorite things that she's done with this series are the creation of the Valkyries' culture. Val Hal is like a big sorority-house. The Valkyries on the phone are the biggest crack up.In this story, I loved that Emmaline is the daughter of Helen, of Troy. Kresley Cole never really says how beautiful she is, but the escalating sense of who Emmaline is - growing in Lachlain, who as her mate in the opening of the story is so dissappointed to discover that she is a Vampire, to Emmaline herself, on a mission to learn about her parents who abandoned her, and who does't think she can do anything well, to the surprising, and empathetic role that her father plays in confirming her pedigree.Lots of authors are writing about paranormals and 'mating' - see Lora Leigh, Jaid Black, and Marly Chance, to name a few in addition to the one's I mentioned above. None of them really gives you a well rounded story to balance the sexual conflict. And, in my view, only Sherrilyn Kenyon has as well developed a universe of paranormal creatures. A Hunger Like No Other is a very enjoyable read that will have you laughing, and the Immortals After Dark (IAD) rock! Just so you know, the first story in the IAD series is found in an anthology called Playing Easy to Get by Sherrilyn Kenyon, Jaid Black, and Kresley Cole. It is the story of Myst and Wroth. You gotta read it!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"While searching for another title on Amazon, the search engine suggested this book. I'd never heard of Kresley Cole, but the reviews were extremely positive, so I decided to give it a shot. So I spent the first morning of my vacation doing my favorite thing-shopping for used books. But A Hunger Like No Other was nowhere to be found. My assumption is that people who buy this book, KEEP this book-and with romance readers there is no better compliment. The Romance section is always the biggest section in used bookstores. I couldn't even find this novel NEW!Out of sheer frustration, I purchased an eCopy of the book, something I've never done before. When it comes to books, I'm from the old school. I want something I can carry about with me. Still, I'm extremely glad I did.Vampires and Werewolves may be currently thick on the ground, but this is the best take I've read on the genre in ages. The characters are appealing; the plot is riveting; the romance is steamy (WOAH BABY!!) and the world building will bring me back for the rest of the series. It kept me glued to the computer for FAR too long yesterday-making me late picking my husband up! Kresley Cole definitely has my attention and I'm willing to buy her novels new-if I could jut find them!!! I want to read No Rest for the Wicked, the second in this series-NOW-so it looks like another eBook for me!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I was first turned on to vampire romance novels by Christine Feehans Dark novels. After about three books I was very bored by not only the exact same plot that seemed to jump from book to book, but also the heros of the book were to stuck in the old world. The books were inventive, but not fresh. Sherilyn Kenyon was a relief and I am still addicted to her novels, but new commer Kresly Cole has stole my attention from the dark-hunters to the immortals after dark.Her writing is fresh, hip, and fast paced. Her characters are well rounded and dont fit the same stereotype from book to book (they actually have diffrent personalities)! The sexual tention is scorching through the entire book and the love stories tender.A Hunger Like No Other is actually the second book in this series. The Warlong Wants Forever is the anthology Playing Easy To Get first introduces the words and characters with Myst (Valkrie) and Wroth(Forbearer).A Hunger Like No Other is a great read that keeps the reader spellbound, a hard thing to do when you relize the characters are alone together with little to no secondary character interactions or action scenes until almsot half way through the book. The interactions between the two characters are riveting. Emma a young, weak \\"halfling\\" fighting against a half mad werewolf king who has taken her hostage. In the first few chapters he sexually assualts her several times and rips thier hotel to shreds while also driving up the balance of her credit card and new clothes and rental cars. Little by little he gets his sanity back. Emma gets stronger, little by little, as she faces the worst of her fears (daylight, vampires, physical plain of any sort) while he drags her from Paris to his castle in Scottland. This all builds until she has to face her father, a powerful vampire who tortured her mate for two hundred years, and seize her own destiny to become a formidable creature."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"After reading many books in the paranormal/romance genre I was very pleased to find a new and refreshing voice. Yes some of the characteristics may seem familiar, such as the vampire vs. werewolf plot but this book is fast moving and exciting. The characters are interesting and fun. If you like the following authors Charlaine Harris and Mary Jane Davidson then I believe you will greatly enjoy this author's take on the sexy world of vampires/werewolves etc. This is a very entertaining read and I am looking foward to more of Kresley Cole's work."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Lachlain is the king of the Lykae, a Scottish clan of werewolves.He has been a captive for over 150 years suffering the agonising torture of constantly dying and regenerating; until one day he smells the scent of his Mate and that is enough to make him master the strength to release himself from the bonds that lock him in the catacombs where he is being held. Strength enough to make him chop his leg off once he realises he is too weak to release that last cuff. He does that without so much of a second thought. This is only to show how much finding his Mate means to him- he has been expecting her for over a thousand years. He has dreamed, fantasised and hoped that one day he would finally meet the one that was destined to be his.So he chases her scent and finds her and is completely horrified by the fact that his Mate is a Vampire!That poses a lot of problems. Not only vampires are natural enemies of the werewolves on the particular mythology of the book, but also it was a vampire that has kept him prisoner for so many years. He is furious; he is confused, it abhors him to think that she is leech, a killer. This Mate of his who is to be the Queen of his people is supposed to be his enemy! On top of everything, she is weak and has no idea of what being his Mate means. So yes, he behaves in a horrifying way towards her in the first few chapters. He is overbearing, he threatens her, he wants revenge as much as he wants to mate with her.Now, Emma is a complete coward. She is meek, she is a ninny and that makes her feel sick about herself. She is known as Emma, the Timid amongst her people - a Coven of Maiden Warriors from the Norse Mythology, for Emma is half Vampire, half Valkyrie. She has a lack of confidence that comes from not knowing what is her place in the world; she never reached the balance between her two halves. She has grown up amongst these women warriors who are powerful, strong, cold in the face of danger. She has the potential of being all that but her vampire half brings vulnerability to her for not being able to go into the sun and for the need to be nurtured with blood whereas her people don't even eat. So it is no surprise to me that Emma is such a coward and even though she received training in fighting she never really mastered it. She doesn't know what she is capable of, because she has an identity problem - she is a vampire but she has never been allowed to actually live like one, to suck the blood out of a living being (she drinks from a blood bank) and her Valkyrie half never truly surfaced.When she is taken by Lachlain, she is even weaker for she has not fed in days and yet she still manages to try and fight him the best way she can even though she is terrified of him. But then, she realises that his touch does strange things to her, things that she never felt because she never felt connected to anyone and that spikes her curiosity. And that is enough to make her start to feel comfortable in her own skin. Lachlain also starts to understand that he cannot escape his destiny and that this woman is indeed intended for him. He cannot avoid feeling protective towards her -it is his duty after all. And as soon as he realises that she is not a killer, he decides that he is going to be the one to feed her - from his own blood. And that makes her stronger - not only because she is taken the blood from a strong being but also because she is finally allowed to see who she really is. This is where they start to connect and to bond.I liked that as the story moved forward they were both changed. Emma started terrified of him, lacking self-confidence and horrified at the thought of being attached to him forever - this is what being a Mate to Lykae means and Valkyries are independents beings. But as she feeds from him she gets physically stronger, enough to feel so confident in herself that she fights him (she manages to break his jaw), fights one of the females from his clan and eventually she meets the King of Vampires and vanquishes him. That was the culminating point of the story where Emma became what she was always supposed to be and Lachlain realised that this woman is very capable of taking care of herself.I also loved the secondary characters specially her Valkyrie Coven and his Lykae friends. I want to learn more about them and about this universe so I will definitely be picking the next one up.[...]"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Plenty of details about the book can be found on other reviews..so I'll go ahead and dive into a different sort of review! I've been reading romance novels since I was 13 years old and much to my dismay the genre has taken a downhill nose dive lately. I'm a huge fan of Feehan but I find that her newer books in the Dark Series lacked the excitement of previous installments! I was skeptical when I picked up my copy of A Hunger Like No Other but much to my utter delight I adored it! Run out and grab a copy you won't be disappointed! Ms. Cole does an amazing job with this book and I'm very eager for the next installment! If you feel bored with romance lately, you won't with this!!! Sizzling, Funny, and a perfect story is all found between the pages of this one!

AAA+++"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"What an immagination! Valkerie, Lykae, Vampires, Witches, Phantoms, Fey. . .the entire world of the Lore is truly inspired. Kresley Cole is one of those rare, brilliant authors who can unfold all the sexy details and still keep the big picture organized and interesting. \\"A Hunger Like No Other\\" was the first of her novels that I read, and immediately I fell in love with her vivid characters and smart story telling skills. You get a perfect sense of the character's personality and mental status without the legnthy monologues or roundabout conversations that make some other romance novels tedious.Emma the Timmid (part vampire, part valkyrie)is kidnapped by a not quite sane Lachlain MacReive (Lykae King). Having just escaped 150 years of torture by vampires, he is seriously ticked off that the little vampire is his fated mate. Disgust, lust and protective instinct clash and tumble around in his damaged mind while he tries to figure out a way to get at the vamp king and pay him back for the torture. Terrified, Emma starts out obedient and docile, not wanting to do anything that would set off the mad man and cause her pain. As the story progresses (with some seriously blush-worthy one on one scenes entwined) she finds a courage and a sense of self she didn't know she had. She also discovers she's falling for the Lykae King and as he returns to sanity, romance blossoms where distrust and misunderstanding once existed.After reading this book in two short days (I couldn't put it down!!) I was so impressed that I bought the rest of the series. It doesn't dissappoint! The story gets better and better with each book, even though a single novel could easily stand on it's own. Also, the way each story touches and intertwines with the ones around it is purely entertaining, it's like she's weaving a basket of novels!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I never was really a reader, I read the Twilight series in a week and wanted something else to read, I found this book after looking at many on Amazon.

The world is original, and includes valkires, vamps, werewolves, witches, and more. I found the characters engaging and storylines kept me on the edge of my seat. Very sexy but not overdone if you get my drift. Each book focuses on a relationship that develops between two main characters, but other supporting characters appear throughout the series.The first few books have cheesy covers. The books are still worth reading. I liked the cover on Kiss of the Demon King. Should have made the entire series covers as good as that one!If you are on the hunt for more books like this, check out my list of paranormal romance favorites...http://www.amazon.com/Paranormal-action-romance-must-reads/lm/R214ESW3HL12HM/ref=tag_lag_rb_munk_lmfull(copy and paste into your browser window)"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I started this book after reading the Twilight series and Sookie Stackhouse series. In contrast to those mentioned, \\"The Immortals After Dark\\" series focuses on serious passion rather than romantic teenage longing or suspenseful mysteries. \\"A Hunger Like No Other\\" is smoking hot and I could not put it down. I was a little concerned with the beginning of the book. The hero possesses over-the-top alpha male traits, survived decades of torture, and is extremely rough with the heroine. However, as their attraction grows and they build trust, the hero softens and the story heats up.

He is angry, bitter, mentaly unstable, strong as sin, and so hot its painful.He is tourtured undergrown by Vampires for almost 200 years when he finally escapes. He finds the streagth to do so because he smells his fated mate above ground and thinks that his only refuge will be to find her; that with-in her he can heal his emotional wounds and all that good stuff.When he gets loose by tearing off his own leg (no worries it regenrates in a week), hits the streets of Paris on a rampage and finds her. Its then that he discovers to his outrage she is a Vampire. He lothes Vampires, which is understandable, seeing how he was toutoured by them for 200 years.The chapater in which he captures her, by chasing her down in the rain and climbing ontop of her in a park is oh so shamefully good!She is scared near to death. One -- she's never been away from home, has never seen a Werewolve, and was raised by druid/elfs/witches so she has never even seen a Vampire other then herself. She has no idea what he wants of her and no idea of what he entends to do with her. She is young for an imortal only in her 70's and her name is Emmaline.He makes her take him to her hotel room where he plans to make up for all that time in hell. Since she is a Vampire he can't help but treat her badly; he doesn't want his mate to be a leach. Then again he is torn, he doesn't want to loose his mate after waiting for so long. the guy has been underground for 200 years and isn't right in the head to put it midly.Emmaline is pretty liakble, you feel for her. She is young minded and neive. In the middle of the book she is a tad inmature and annoying, but that changes. The story is great. Emmaline never knew her parents. Her mother killed herself and her father just happens to be the head baddy Vamp of the \\"Horde\\" a warring faction of Vampires who drink to kill. When Emmaline finds this out its a shame because her father just happens to be the man that put Lachlian away for all that time.Emmaline has to do some soul searching and it envolves confronting her father - I won't spoil it sorry, but the last half of the book is thrilling!Great book!!! Super hot Werewolve!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This book starts off with almost too much of a bang. When I first read a sample chapter (on my Kindle), I decided to skip it because it seemed like there would be rape involved between the hero and heroine. Then I read on these reviews that no rape occurs, so I downloaded it and whew... I'm glad I did! The tension and conflict between the hero and heroine was sustained throughout the novel (almost too long, but not quite) - making this book very hard to put down. The plot was fast-paced, with plenty of sizzle, and the author built a wonderful world to immerse the reader. The only drawback was the occasional childish dialogue of the heroine. It wasn't often, but it was jarring when it happened, taking me out of the story. It wasn't enough to lose a star, though. It's a keeper, and a reread for me, earning it 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"A Hunger Like no Other was the very first romance novel i have ever read. most of my personal library is filled with Anne Rice books & this was my first attempt to read any \\"quote\\" romance book. After have reading all of the Twilight books, I was looking for something a little more adult. I'm 37 years old so after reading a love story for teens, I was looking for something that was a slight more sexually expressive, and boy did I get more than I bargained for. There were a couple of places that I have read more than once & bought books 2&3 when I was only half way through A Hunger Like No Other, which I read within 3 days. I'm not much of a reader & it takes me a while to read through books, but this was a fast read & very hard to put down! There was action starting with page one and sexual scenes throughout the book along with a romance that would make your heart melt for the leading characters. I wasn't quite as thrilled with the other two books, although the third was a close 2nd, in fact all of them just seemed to be the same type of story line, just with different characters you briefly are introduced to from the previous books. Same plot except with different characters in different places, however this one had a little sexual tease and play, the 2nd not as much, but the 3rd had a lot of play & tease to it. While I gave this book 5 stars for it being my first in this particular area & I was not at the least disapointed, I would give the 2nd 4 stars & the 3rd 4 & 1/2. The 2nd & 3rd books had more characters in it from the mystical lore, which I loved, but once you read A Hunger Like No Other, you want the other books to be more about them instead of them just being background characters. However you still do end up getting caught into the relationships of the other books."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I judge books by their covers, unfortunate, but true. That said, the cover art for Cole's A Hunger Like No Other is thankfully misleading--incredibly so in fact. I sat down to what I though would be a simply smutty paranormal romance. Five hours later I got up, got a glass of water and then proceeded to read it again. It is Fantastic! Wonderfully written, rich characters, a fascinating take on lore, and incredibly hot besides!Our heroine is Emma, a vampire/valkyrie mix who has travelled to Paris in search of the mysterious vampire father she's never met. Emma is young for an immortal, only 70, and at first rather timid and weak. Enter Lachlain MacRieve, a vicious Lykae(werewolf) warrior and king who has spent the last 150 years being endlessly tortured by vampires. As an immortal he is forever burning to death in the fires beneath the catacombs and has gone mad gone mad with hate for the entire species, despairing at how he never found his mate, at least until he scents her and tears himself free of his bonds...only to find Emma, with her fangs, pink tears and penchant for the liquid diet. Outraged at her and with Fate, the chaos that ensues is absolutely delicious!five stars! six stars! a sky full of stars!

I was immediately drawn into the story with the first scenes of Lachlain, a Lycan (werewolf), imprisoned and tormented by fire. He'd been there for 150 years, then he scented the woman he knew to be his true mate above him, in the streets of Paris. He manages to escape his prison and seeks to find and claim her. He can't believe when he sees her and realizes she is part-vampire. Lachlain hates vampires, since they are natural enemies of his, but also, it was a vampire king who imprisoned him. He can't deny she is his true mate, and he kidnaps her in an attempt to force her to agree to be his mate. Emmaline is a meek, shy, timid part-vampire and part-Valkyrie. She's terrified to be with a Lycan, especially one so dangerous and powerful. Lachlain is destructive and frighteningly angry all the time. There are times when Lachlain is tempted to force his way on Emma, but he always manages to \\"control the beast\\" and does not force her sexually. Over the course of the book, Emma develops strength and becomes the fierce warrior she was meant to be, and she and Lachlain discover they are, in fact, true mates. Watching the back-and-forth banter, and the sensual scenes where Lachlain attempts to awaken innocent Emma's sexual side, coupled with the fighting scenes and battles between different Lore creatures combine to make this book a fascinating take on paranormal romance. I loved it and can't wait to read more!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is one of the hottest romances ever!

I felt the butterflies, the frustration, the yearning, the elation, and more! I will be reading on in the series, and am happy to say that I am a new fan of this author! I look forward to more books by her. Thank You Ms. Kresley Cole for such a wonderful treat!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Emmaline and Lachlain, the beauty and the wolf-beastie...I loved their story!Lachlain is able to escape 150 years of brutal torture by vampires when he finally senses his one true mate.When he finds Emma he is completely in shock that she turns out to be a vampire, a creature who belongs tothe same race that murdered most of his family and kept him locked up for 150 years.But somehow he still wants her, craves for her... and he will make her his mate no matter what.So Emma finds herself the captive of a tall, dark Lykae and doesn't know Lachlain sees her as his mate.She is terrified of the Lykae but also strangely attracted to him.The world of the Lore that Kresley Cole created is amazing, so diverse and strange.I love the quirky Valkyrie! They seem like fragile, delicate women but are in fact fierce warriors.I can't wait to read more of this world!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This book is staying on my keeper shelf. I LOVE werewolf romances, and this one sucked me in right from the beginning. Talk about torturing a hero! Loved it. The hero is an alpha, yes, but he has to learn to bend as the book goes on. He has to prove his love for the heroine (and I really enjoyed the way her character grew through the story). Lots of different paranormal characters appeared, a good background mix. Great pace for the story, steamy scenes. Definite recommend."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Ahh the book that started an obsession. This book was awesome and I loved the way the author developed her characters. As you are finishing the book you can't wait to purchase the next to see how the stories of the other characters turn out. Consequently I purchased all the books in rapid succession and I've now read all of the books in the series and can't wait for the next. Nix really rocks.

Emma is known as the \\"timid one\\" but I still think a little more courage or fire would have been nice. Especially with Lachlain as a mate - such a dominating, powerful hero. Overall, I loved Ms. Cole's quick witt and sarcasm through the novel. Emma's valkyrie family is hysterical and the characters for future books were set up nicely."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I bough this book about two or three years ago and now have all of them, but I just finally started with this first one. The book has its flaws, the writing was a little difficult to read but not impossible, the premise were pretty much the same as J.R Ward or Lara Adrian, the characters especially Emmaline wasn't...relatable!?It wasn't that Emma was weak, soft spoken, gentle, fragile etc...that bothered me, no Emma was sheltered all her life and lived like a princess, still acts like it. She's a spoil brat, whiny and selfish, always feeling sorry for herself. Emma was lacking personality, her character wasn't appealing and almost unlikable. I feel the only reason Lachlain is with her is because of she's his mate. I find it unbelievable what she was able to do to Demestriu, there's no way! (if you read the book you'll know what I mean!)She called Lachlain \\"A Monster\\" yet she drinks blood from a cup, when she's mad her feature change and looking like one herself!Moreover, her reaction after P.250 It as if a switch went on and the light came in out of nowhere! The story just didn't flow. The book has good idea behind it but was poorly executed(another one!) Could it be that this book was written in 2006(?) maybe! But I hear the serie do get better, so I'll give it another try since I have all of them."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I have to admit that I had a problem with the kidnapping and everything in the beginning of the book. I thought about just putting the book down then. However I finished reading and it got better. It took forever for main characters to make a connection.

Hurry up Amazon and send it to me!!!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I thought this was a very original story with a different take on the paranormal theme that has taken off with such tremendous popularity! I loved the many characters, besides Lachlain and Emmaline, and can hopefully see a long line of books to follow, or at least I hope!! Whew! Lachlain is HOT, HOT, HOT, and Emmaline certainly is his match! Can't wait for \\"No Rest For The Wicked\\", which is the next installment in this new series!! Read this book!! You won't be disappointed!!!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I love Kresley Cole's series. This is a must read for all paranormal romance book lovers. A must read series"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed all of the books in this series - however, The MacRieve men have a special place in my heart and on my bookshelf (Lachlain, Bowen, Garreth - YUM!! These Scottish Lykaes are sexy!) Can't wait for the next book in the series (MacRieve July 2013)."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is the beginning of a new and wonderfully hot paranormal romance series. It has it all. Kresley Cole is a terrific writer and story teller with a great sense of humor. Just read it."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I was looking for a new paranormal series to get into and was intrigued by how many 5 star reviews this book and most of the others in the series have received. Needless to say I was slightly underwhelmed based upon the perceived hype. As a start to a series it wasn't terrible. Cole does a great job of world building and has created some interesting new paranormal types that are worthy of further exploration. There is some decent character development and some witty and humorous dialogue. Other than these positives the rest (aka the most important aspects) were pretty disappointing. I had a hard time finishing the book and was driven to extreme periods of frustration in the meantime. I liked the lead characters but was not convinced by how they came about loving each other. I liked how Emma progressively gets stronger and more fierce and independent but the first half of the book waiting for her to get there is very long and drawn out. Cole really draws out the sexual tension but in a frustrating and unbelievable way. By the 8th time they almost get it on and then she suddenly realizes that shes scared of him right before she climaxes I thought my eyes would stay permanently rolled into the back of head. Also the plot is a good one but not executed all that well. It gets jumpy and sloppy and a little confusing. And lastly when she kills Demestriu- it really was not earned. You have to have a lot of suspension of disbelief to get past this part of the story. All of the most powerful immortal beings that exist have tried to kill this guy and failed and Emma has barely finished being scared of her own shadow and slays him in seconds??Anyway, like I said it wasn't a total loss. If the rest of it gets better from here than it's worth it. Fingers are crossed."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This was a great story with great characters.

LOVE this book!!!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I bought this book because I was looking for some romance reading that was not cookie-cutter harlequin-ish junk, and because it had gotten good reviews. I'm not even into the paranormal/vampire/valkyrie/lykae stuff, but I figured if it was written well, I'd at least appreciate the romantic aspects of the story....WELL, I really, really enjoyed this book! I stayed up almost all night reading it! And holey moley, be prepared because this is a very steamy, sizzling hot book. I was impressed that the erotic scenes could be written in a way that was not cheesy. Lots of animal magnetism, romantic suspense, passion, destiny, and desire. And it's all for TRUE LOVE and being mates for life, which, for immortals, is a pretty darn long time. You will fall for Lachlain, ladies. Trust me, lol. Just go with it. He's even got a scottish accent, c'mon!! And it's got good plot too - it kept me wondering what the heck was going to happen next.There are some really funny parts too. I was laughing out loud with some of the modern language and \\"human\\" predicaments that these immortals were experiencing.I've just placed an order for the next four books of this series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Wow, I just found my new favorite author! All the characters were fascinating and there never seemed to be a dull moment throughout the book. I will definitely be reading the whole series!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I wish I could give this book 10 stars and the WHOLE immortals after dark series 5+ stars! The romance between emma the timid and the Lykae king Lachlain MacRieve is sooo steamy. Now I want a naughty lykae. This is the best book in the series for me."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This book is amazing so far.... I'm only half way through it, but I can hardly put it down. The story is fast paced and well thought out. Not a lot of explinations into the 'species' terminology, but it still flows very well. Very exciting. This is my first experience with this author, but I will definatly be purchasing more. :o)"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I loved this book and hope it becomes a new series! I will totally be getting more books by Cole."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Don't walk...run as fast as you can to get this book!!! It is a must read and a must for your collection. I was honestly not expecting such a fabulous read. It was recommended to me at a local used book store. Just when I thought the paranormal world couldn't get any better, Cole jumps in with a whole new world of story and adventure and love. I laughed. I cried. I sighed. I sat on the edge of my seat totally aborbed in the tension and emotion. I felt the joy, pain, fear, and courage as my own. I fought to keep my droopy eyelids open because I couldn't put it down. And was left hungry for more and so glad I had bought the next 4 books!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is my first time reading Kresley Cole and the book was pretty good. I read it in two days. I did get irritated with the characters on occasion. The heroine is timid, shy and secretive while the hero is bossy and arrogant. He-man hear me roar type. He showed complete lack of regard for the heroine even though she was his mate and his instinct is to protect her above all others. The supporting characters did everything they could to separate the two even knowing that the heroine was his mate. The different factions of what Cole calls the Lore are at odds with each other and no one group seems to mingle in harmony in any way. This makes every meeting between different species a confrontation and I just got annoyed reading about hisses at each other. Other than that the plot was pretty good, even though I felt like some of the history of the Lore could have been explained more in depth. I would recommend this book to others that like paranormal romances. I also hope that in the rest of the series author tempers down the confrontational attitudes of the different species within the Lore and allows the characters to have a conversation without bloodshed."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This book was full of erotic scenes but held a plot at the same time with suspense, likable characters, and believable fantasy. I've already ordered books 2-6 in this series and can't wait to read more by Kresley Cole."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This was the first IAD book that I read--and I was blown away. Fabulous characters. Great twisting plot. This story definitely puts a new spin on paranormal romance. The hero was dark, and he struggled with his growing feelings for the heroine. The action was non-stop, and I couldn't put the book down. I like werewolf heroes, but Cole took her hero to a whole new level. And pairing him with a half-vamp heroine...so good! Definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"My thoughts:I actually started with book 10 or so, fell deeply in love and knew that this was the paranormal romance series for me. So I read book 1, which is a novella (you can get it for free on her website), and then this book. And what I felt then I felt again, she is so good!At first I was a bit taken aback. Lachlain was crazy, too demanding, a brute, a barbarian, I called him so many names. And with any other book I would have frowned, but somehow Cole made me fall for that dog (as some of Emma's family happily calls the Lycae). I have no idea how she manages it, but he just creeps under your skin and stays there.Poor Lachlain, tortured, dying, and brought back to life for 150 years. No wonder he was a bit crazed. He was all alpha, so very alpha. He was also later very protective and sometimes the whole mine thing just makes a girl weak in the knees. Then we have Emma, she is no kickass female, she is actually weak and timid. But all women do not need to be kickass. She just does not want conflicts, but little by little this little weakling gains more strength. They are suited for each other.This is what I want paranormal romance to be like. I am smitten and I like it. The book has plenty of passion, and two people that are so unlikely to fall in love, they are enemies, but they are destined to be together and the road there is not easy.The whole universe is interesting with many different \\"creatures\\" running around, making alliances and waging war against each other.Conclusion:Would I recommend this book, yes! Will I read more, I sure will :DRatingMade me love Paranormal romance again"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I am not much on writing long Reviews but I will say that I am very glad I read the whole book and didn't put it down or stop in between.

I am so glad I did, this was a great book with characters that kept me riveted to their story. This book is for anyone who loves this type of dark,otherworld romance books. I would recomend this to everyone. I can't wait to read the next story in this series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"After reading the first tale in this series in the anthology 'Playing Easy to Get', I greatly looked forward to reading this story and I was not disappointed.Kresley Cole is venturing into a new block in the supernatural genre neighborhood by selecting the Valkyries as her heroines and selecting very dishy immortal males from other breeds among the supernatural as their mates.In this tale we have Emmaline, a Valkyrie and Vampire halfling, who has been raised by her foster mother, Annika, a ferocious Valkyrie, among the others, yet she has a fear of pain and avoids confrontation at all costs, a complete opposite from her adopted mother and doting aunties.Her mate, Lachlain, the king of the Lykae(werewolves) is fated to be her husband/lover/mate, for eternity, and he is imprisoned below Paris in a catacomb where his immortal body is perpetually consumed by fire only to be reborn ( as all immortals are) so that he can endure the agony of being burned alive over and over... for 150 years, imprisoned there by Vampires.Somehow Lachlain is able to get a faint whiff of scent, the scent of his Bride, the female whom he is destined to be mated with for all time, and it is the only thing that he can think of and what drives him to literally tear himself apart to get free from his prison and find her.Once these two get together the sparks fly, both of them knowing on a physical level that they are meant to be together, but emotions, old blood feuds and personalities keep conflicting, yet the conflicts do not bog down the relationship or the storyline.The steamy sex scenes are hot, don't get me wrong, but the anticipation and build up to them, as well as the genuine emotional components on Lachlain's part make this a great and satisfying story.While Emma tends to be a bit wishy washy and petulant, it is easy to see why she digs her heels in now and again, despite the undeniable truth she knows in her heart about Lachlain.I look forward with great anticipation to the next book, No Rest for the Wicked, as well as the others to follow in this Immortals After Dark Series, and hope that they are as well written and rewarding as their predecessors.Definitely worth the cover price and more!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Lachlain should be cloned! This book is definitely a page turner...I had finals to study for and I couldn't put it down! Yes, I was that addicted!!! Lach is a little angry and tends towards the whole He-Man thing but other than that, he's romantic to the core. I suppose if you're overly feminist, you might have a problem with this book but I certainly didn't!Definitely a book I literally climbed into at first sight. The cover is deceiving, as is the first chapter. But don't be fooled, this book is a fun, engaging read.

I was hooked within the first few pages, and literally could not put it down. Lachlain is a macho, alpha male, yes, but he tempers that with growing respect for Emma. I also loved Emma's growth throughout the book - instead of the now-common \\"feisty female\\" character, she slowly picks up a spine as the book progresses. Believeable and likeable character.The erotic tension was very well-done, I haven't read many books that ratcheted up the tension the way this author did. I'm going to check into more books by her, she rocks!I think the thing I loved the most was the beginning; Lachlain is very sling-my-woman-over-my-shoulder from the second he tracks down Emma. It made me feel positively Victorian with delight. Can we clone him? Because that? Is hot."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"For creativity alone Ms. Cole deserves five stars!Blending the \\"real\\" world with one entirely conceived from her skill and creativy, Ms. Cole delivers a brilliant universe and a darned good read. The storyline is the eternal Romeo and Juliet--with otherworldly complications. A most unsuitable fellow, Lachlain, falls in love with an equally unsuitable lady, Emmaline. They meet, obstacles abound--she can't handle sunlight, he might get fleas--they fall in love, they over come other obstacles--but who ever imagined obstacles that thrive on lightening and, even worse, might turn out to be your inlaws?This is a light read with stunningly dark elements. The contrast between subject matter and style, however, is entirely complimentary. The obvious contrasts, such as dialog among creatures hundreds of years old versus the \\"young\\" heroine who is only seventy is engaging. Ms. Cole's dialog is pithy, quick and effective and moves the story along at a good pace. The story very briefly drags but only because one is so intrigued by the foreshadowed climax that one is in a hurry to get there.The characters are fully developed and all evolve in a believable manner--even if the setting is wildly supernatural.As romantic figures, Lachlain and Emmaline might not achieve the imortality of Rhett and Scarlett, but not for lack of trying. Their interactions sizzle and the sensual scenes are extraordinary. The blend between their otherworldly characteristics and their \\"human\\" sexuality is exciting and shocking but not sordid. The scenes, while explicit, are exceedingly well written and captivating.If you like romance, sex, intrigue and boundless creativity, this book is for you.Best regards and happy reading,B.

The Intensity of Lachlain paired with the sweet fiersness of Emma made for an explosive combination of heat and passion! my only gripe with this story is that perhaps Lachlain satyed \\"angry\\" over his past torture too long and took a little too much of his aggression out on Emma.

Paranormal/supernatural stories are over-the-top by nature, of course, but this one was very well written. Kresley Cole does a great job of making you fall for these characters and to root for them. The suprenatural stuff is interesting (he's a werewolf, she's a half-valkyrie/half-vampire) but it isn't overdone and distracting. She also writes some fabulously hot sex scenes! It's also quite funny at times and very action packed in others. Check it out if you are into the whole shape-shifter/vampire/other-worldly creature romance stories.

Big mistake. Should have read the reader reviews more carefully. Make *no* mistake. What happens within the first two chapters of this book is sexual assault. No \\"sort of\\" or \\"almost\\" or \\"close to\\" as suggested by other reviewers.

Can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This has to be the best vampire romance I've read in a really long time. Kresley puts it together just right, setting it apart from all the others in its genre. I pulled an all nighter on this one, and lets just say there hasn't been a book I've been willing to do that for in a long time. The characters will pull you right in and soon you'll be wishing you were one of them. I am glad its a series because I can't get enough."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I didn't make it past the beginning where the main character is abducted and sexually assaulted. She is practically raped by a guy who can't seem to form an articulate thought. I knew from the nature of the book and reviews that they were supposed to end up together, and I was supposed to cheer them on, and I just find that disturbing. Near rape by the hero is not my idea of a good read."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"WOW. I love Kresley Cole's Immortals after dark series. I read all of J.R Wards books and i was so sad when they were over so i picked up Lara Adrians midnight breed series( which is also very good).. then i ran out of those... i started to read this series and omg! i love it. i totally fell in love with the characters!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I have only 2 complaints. First my book is defective with parts of the printing missing and two, the glossary should have been in the front instead of the back of the book.If the people who only gave this book 1 or 2 stars had read the glossary, they would understand why they were having problems with this book. They were reading it with the wrong prescription glasses.I LOVED the characters. Different, new and interesting. It is a whole new fun paranormal world and with all the wild battles and illicit love affairs between the different kingdoms, vampires, werewolves, valkeries, demons, shapeshifters, wraiths and humans around, there is bound to be combustion and lots of fun fire and smoke.Some of the complaints made me feel they did not really read the book.Of course, our hero, is a crass, brutish bully in the beginning. Lachlain MacRieve is the king of the Lykae who are a race of Warrior werewolves. His father and brother are kidnapped by an evil Vampire King and are murdered, he is jumped and imprisoned in a catacombs where fire burns him to death every day for 150 years. The daily deaths, suffering and endless agony, who make a person a bit testy. The only thing that helps him escape, is his need to find his mate, whose scent he picks up above ground. In desperation, he has to saw off his leg in order to escape. I think that little bit of torture, might make him less than a gentleman when he crawls out and see his \\"mate\\" tiny Emmaline Troy, who is half vampire and half valkyrie. Yeah, she is a frightened little thing who is completely thrown off by Lachlain. Who wouldn't be? This tiny creature has been loved and loathed and babied by her \\"coven\\" of Valkyrie aunts who haven't told her much about her background except to yell epithets and curses about vampires right in front of her. So yeah, Emmaline she has a lot of self loathing, fear and confusion to get over. Goodness, critics, cut our hero and heroine a little slack here.I loved how this unlikely pair, figure out their place in this deadly, terrifying universe and fall in love. They both \\"grow\\" up and grow in love with each other despite the fact that they are supposed to be mortal enemies. The scenes at the Castle Kinevane are great. Delicate political balances have to be made to explain how a halfling non Lykae will be the Queen. On top of all this, the evil vampire HORDE is plotting world domination and strange kidnappings and deaths have been going on all over, which has all the different \\"worlds\\" on edge that there is going to be a big battle bubbling up soon. Finally, when our heroine Emmaline comes into her own, knowing who she really is, what her family was and is going to be in the future, she shows herself worthy of the best of romance heroines. She is no longer Emma the Timid, but Emma the .... don't want to spoil the ending.What is not to like about the book? Great fantasy world created. Fun side characters. Wonderful alpha male and a blossoming alpha female causing the sky to light up with multiple lightening flashes for their lovemaking. Yikes, grabbing the next book as soon as I can."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"A Hunger Like No Other was far from what I expected. I thought that it was going to be a vampire love story that I was going to be bored with before I reached page 5, but Kresley Cole proved me wrong, by page 5 I was hooked. Emmaline is an inspiring and suprisingly sweet and gentle character it's hard not to fall in love with who she is as soon as you learn about her. When she is run down by the all powerful brooding Lachlain, a Lykae, he introduces her vulnerable personality to his extreme rough need for her. Lachlain is quite the invigorating character himself, being locked away by the vampires repeatedly burning him to death for more then 150 years until he escapes to find Emmaline, his life mate, and when he finds her he realizes she is one of the very kind who had been torturing him for all of these years. The story is about their struggle together, as well as their own seperate struggles. I was more then pleased with this amazing romance. It is hot and always keeps the reader on their toes wanting more."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is a new series for me. It was a pleasurable read and I look forward to continuing the series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I have been reading romance novels since I was 15, so a good 20 years now. In my mind nothing like a cup of tea and a good romance novel to escape and unwind at the end of a day.Just to give a sample of my taste, other authors I enjoy are: Jen Holling, Connie Brockway, Johanna Lindsey, Julie Garwood, Christina Dodd, just to name a few.This entire series is such a page turner. I had a hard time putting any of the titles down. More evenings than I care to admit I stayed up way to late \\"just to read one more chapter\\".In A Hunger like no other. I found the pull of Lachlain to his mate to be such an amazing draw. Gosh what this guy put himself through to get to her. Yes it was a bit disturbing that he kidnapped her but being tied under the earth in a fire to die over and over and having to take your own leg to escape might tend to make a man less than mannerly once he finds his true love.The deep love you feel in the main characters not only in this book but in all of this series is truly moving.I enjoyed the glimpse of supporting characters so you felt that any of them would be enjoyable to read about in their own series. The entire series is fast and there is not a lot of review of what happened in a prior book. You open the book and off you go. These are not slow moving. I laughed, I cried, I blushed. Boy Ms. Cole writes some steamy scenes. Wow! And I am amazed that nothing repeats. Each book is so different, the plots are so different and the way the main characters relate is so different. Yes they do all have hansom men and lovely ladies. But the dynamic relationship between the main characters is simply fire from page 1 to the end. Out of all my years reading romance. I have never read modern romance before. I can say without a doubt that these are the best romance books I have read and that is truly saying a lot considering how many authors works sit on my shelf."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"this is the 1st Kresley cole book I have every picked up and I am so glad that I did. I love the story and characters and the way that the author builds the world and entwines everybody in some way or another.I found myself getting entranced in the book. It is like watching a movie.Favorite new author, I rank her up there with JR Ward. If you coming off the BDB, then you will like this series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is the first Kresley Cole book I read. I just loved it!!!!! It's the best story I've read in a while. I loved the hot male lead. The way she wrote this character surprised me and made my toes curl. Very steamy and a page turner, I was never bored and couldn't put it down. I also loved all the female characters. I have read the most recent two books since then and loved the too. I even ordered the books I missed from Amazon and are waiting for them to arrive. This is the first series I have been excited about in a long while. Please don't let it end too soon. I'm hoping for at least a dozen stories. With so many great characters I could see this series going for a long time. I know there is supposed to be a war at the end but I hope it doesn't come too soon."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I was expecting yet another objectionable Paranormal Romance/Urban Fantasy mesh when my friend gave me this book, especially after having just strongly disliked Kenyon's Dark Hunter series. Therefore I was pleasantly surprised that this book worked for me. I found myself enjoying it quite a bit and rushed through it in hours. In my opinion, this is a great example of good writing - the author took a very predictable story that is similar to many in its genre, but added her own unique voice making the characters come alive on paper.The narrative begins with Emma, who is a half breed Vampire and Valkyrie, setting out to Paris to find information about her vampire father. The quirk is that Emma is a complete coward and this is her first act of independence in 70 years of her life. Having been brought up in a Valkyrie coven by her powerful intimidating aunts and being part vampire, Emma's calm and reserved personality was quite refreshing, especially since everyone we meet from those two lines is explosive and fierce. As more becomes known about Emma's personality, we can see that despite her timidity she is in no way weak. Her growth as the book progresses is steady and realistic and makes her a very likeable protagonist.And then there is Lachlain - who has been tortured in the catacombs of Paris by his nemesis vampire Demestriu. Then one day, as he is about to finally succumb to madness after decades of pain, he scents his mate and goes through extraordinary lengths to free himself and find her. Lachlain is a Lykae, a very ferocious breed, and they search for eternity for their mates to calm their violent natures and complete their souls. Expecting a strong and vivacious Lykae like himself, Lachlain is stunned to find a small vampire with pointy ears to be his eternal mate. This extraordinary twist of fate doesn't just attach a very pissed off Lachlain to a woman whose vampire brethren murdered most of his family, but makes a faint-hearted Emma potential queen of all the Lykae.The story evolves around their relationship and sets up the rich world of magical creatures of the Lore. The existence of each race is well established with suitably defined traits pertaining to their people. The characters are witty and entertaining, and their personalities come alive, which is the main reason why I enjoyed this book so much. The antagonists are not all out evil creatures and there is a good rationale for their madness. Overall, the tale is light and engaging, which is what I think the author meant to create.You won't find too many tortured souls (I call them poorly developed characters) and extraordinarily dramatic scenes (I call them page fillers), but a great cast and a fun story."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I must admit I did not particularly care for how Lachlain treated Emma in the beginning of the book and how Emma would just let him practically control her. But I knew the book would eventually turn into the type of romance story that the series is known for. Great read!PS: This isn't the first real story of the Immortals After Dark Series, it starts in the anthology Playing Easy to Get."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I happen to be a sucker for both romance and paranormal fiction - this novel had the best of both, with every page intense and exciting. The plot was cleverly constructed, the characters seemed well developed, and there was a good balance between the romantic passion, action, etc. I recommend this novel to anyone interested in slightly off-beat romantic fiction."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Kresley Cole has created a fabulous world that I want to know more about! Emmaline Troy is half-vampire, half-Valkyrie. She has been raised by the Valkyrie and fears her vampiric side as her foster aunts refer to vampires as leeches and have ingrained in her that blood should not be taken directly from anyone. While in Paris searching for information on her parents (she doesn't know the identity of her father and her mother is deceased), she is kidnapped and forced to go to Scotland by Lykae King Lachlain MacRieve. Lachlain is half-mad initially as he has escaped (by chewing off his leg!!) from the fiery catacombs where Demestriu of the Vampire Horde had imprisoned him for 150 years. Emma is terrified of Lachlain at first, although she is terrified of just about everything as she has been taught to run and hide when trouble starts. However, Emma quickly learns to stand up for herself and evolves into a very strong female character. Lachlain doesn't know how to treat her as part of him is horrified that his mate is half-vampire but he learns through trial and error what Emma needs. Meanwhile, vampires are terrorizing the Valkyrie, looking for Emma. Lachlain defends Emma from the first attack but is horrified when she willingly traces with a vampire during the second attack. I will not spoil the story by revealing any more but will add that it was great to see Wroth and Myst appear (albeit briefly) in this story as well. This was a very original take on several overused themes (vampires, werewolves) and I highly appreciated the author's creativity. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Perhaps I'm expecting too much from a romance novel, but I was very disappointed by this book.Lachlain nearly rapes Emmaline several different times. She flat out tells him that HE IS MAKING HER UNCOMFORTABLE. He doesn't leave her alone. He forces her into sexual situations that she is not comfortable with, and I DO NOT find this to be an appropriate and loving romance.He hates her because she's a vampire and he continues to tell her this. He insults her and her heritage. This has all the signs of an abusive relationship.THIS IS NOT an okay relationship to be presenting as \\"good\\" and \\"romantic\\". I'm sorry, but I cannot read anything else written by this author."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I don't get why there's so many good reviews. Because of those good reviews, I wasted my money on this series. My problem is if the book is part of a series, I must start from the first book, and if it sucks, it's hard for me to continue onto the next book in the series, whether or not it's a different story or continuation.Ok, I couldn't find myself falling into the story. It was just basically disgusting with almost none of the things I usually look for in a romance novel. What do I look for? I don't know, maybe character/relationship development, a connection between the main characters. I saw none of it. All I saw was Emma hating Lachlain for kidnapping her and imprisoning her to him. Oh yea, she hated him for 3/4 of the book while only lusting for his muscular and built body. I hated her. Seriously, why couldn't she lighten up like Lachlain. Yea, Lachlain hated you because you were a vampire and the one destined for him. He just went through a century and a half of torture from the vampire kind, so I don't see how he wouldn't be. But as the story progressed, he started to accept the fact that she was vampire, and love her for her(and of course, he was horny after being denied pleasure for so long). But that seemed like that was all the book was about. Emma hating Lachlain, Lachlain wanting her, and graphic sex. That was it... it's like this book was written for the sex. Who cares about an actual love story? No matter how unlikely the characters, as long as they end up having sex and loving each other.. AT THE VERY END, it's fine? I don't think so. We'll see if I continue with the rest of the book since they seem to be more liked by those who hated this book(not very likely though)Also, did anyone notice all the missing words? Really bad on a few of the pages; I felt like I had bought one of those Fill in the Blank books and sadly, I didn't know all the words. What happened?"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Read this book for the first time when it first came out in '06 and I absolutely loved it!There's action, romance, getting to know yourself/the characters and love.Emmaline and Lachlain's first meeting is a bit extreme and they have to go through a lot to finally be happy.But all of these challenges are what eventually makes them who they are and at peace with themselves.I've seen so many people moaning about how this first meeting is 'basically rape' and 'assault'.Granted, it is not a loving first meeting but it is exciting and brutally honest. What I would like to remind people is that we are dealing with a completely different species! Vampires, werewolves, valkyries, witches and so on and they are not like 'normal' people.If you cannot look past this fact, do not read the book (I'm sure Kresley would prefer this as well). BUT if you are attracted to alfa males, the extreme, fantasy and you can accept that not everything has to come in a neat little package with roses, chocolates and sweet and innocent kisses then this might be more you thing.BASICALLY: If you feel strongly violated by things that are not what you expect, are not politically correct and do not include the typical package of marriage, virginity and vomit-provoking innocence and self-righteousness then this is not for you. Find something else.If you are open to a different kind of romance that is breath-taking, extreme and all-consuming then Mrs. Cole is your woman! Give this book (and all of her other books) a chance and prepare to be swept off your feet!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"***I would like to thank Kresley Cole and her assistant Brooke Meyer for providing a copy in exchange for a honest review! :D***It's no secret that I became a huge fan of author Kresley Cole after reading her YA debut novel, Poison Princess. At first, I was hesitant to start reading her Immortals After Dark series, but after hearing high praise - and some heavy consideration on my part - I finally gave it try. With her first installment in the series Ms. Cole, once again, proved that writing to her is child's play. A Hunger Like No Other is the epitome of why we should kick our hesitations to the curb. A dark and seductive storyline driven by brilliant characters and a passion-inducing romance, this book was far from disappointing.Vampires and werewolves are nothing new to the paranormal genre, but when coupled with a brand new twist on mythological legends surrounding them; the paranormal takes on a whole new meaning. By mixing vampires, lycans, witches, valkyries and even wraiths, Ms. Cole created a vivid and dynamic world in her book, called the Lore. Right from the gripping and sensual opening of the story, you can't help but appreciate the rich world-building. Unfortunately, the events that occur, (in the next 2 chapters) after that, are undesirably drawn out and the characters' first meeting offensive (for lack of a better word). Aside from that, the plot is exceptionally enchanting. Full of intense action scenes, brilliant dialogue, shocking revelations and beautiful imagery of Scotland, A Hunger Like No Other had me glued to it's pages. And albeit it's few and far between short-comings, I can't wait to explore and learn more of this fascinating world.The main aspect of this book is the romance. The story is heavily focused on this, and while it may come as a hindrance in books such as this, where the world-building should be at the forefront, Ms. Cole managed to keep a perfect balance between the two, and keep a smooth plot-line. Lachlain's hatred for vampires put a strain on the relationship between him and Emma, but it also made it very interesting and fun to watch his character overcome that and accept Emma for who she is - a half vampire half valkyrie. On the other hand, Emma's more confused attraction towards Lachlain (insistent to push him away in the beginning and then giving in way to easily) was less appreciable. It would have been nice to have her one-minded and then come together with a notable flow rather than in a rush. Thankfully, the chemistry and steamy love scenes were a great distraction for that minor issue.Lachlain and Emma are both easily likable characters. They compliment each other in every way - Lachlain is tough, attractive and an alpha male, whereas Emma is feisty, witty and timid. Their interactions with one another are entertaining and provide just the right amount of light moments in the story. They made a great pair, and despite the sudden change in Emma's romantic decision, it was nice to see them together in the end. Ms. Cole did a brilliant job in developing well-rounded characters, and by adding unique history to their heritage (Lachlain's lycan heritage and Emma's valkryie), only made them more intriguing. It was very easy to fall in love and connect with the characters and appreciate them both individually.Another aspect I truly enjoyed, was learning about the valkyries. It was a new experience, and what mind-blowing creatures they are - strong, independent women all tagged with their own afflictions - Nix seeing the future, Lucia cursed to feel pain if her bow misses a target, Kaderin the Cold loosing all emotion - it was simply fascinating and I hope to see more of them in the next books.With A Hunger Like No Other getting my interest right from the start, and providing an addictive escape from reality, I am anticipating the next books in the series, of what I am positive will be more pleasant surprises."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"A TOUCH OF SPOILER, SO BEWARE....I DON'T REALLY LIKE PLOT LINES THAT REDUCE WOMEN TO PRETTY PLAY THINGS; WHERE THEY ARE DOMINATED AND END UP LIKING IT.

I was immediately hooked. I've not read another author who writes with Cole's combination of sexiness, sensuality, and suspense, while being mercifully free of cheesiness. I was surprised by the heroine, Emma's, timidity in the beginning of the novel, but she gradually gains strength - both mental and physical. Lachlain, Emma's pre-destined mate, is a werewolf who was tortured and imprisoned for more than a century. To say he is angry and vengeful is an understatement. He's a perfect counterpart to Emma, and the scenes between the pair sizzle with incredible hotness.You will root for this couple from their initial (brutal) meeting.

It has all of the elements I enjoy in a paranormal romance. I was a little shy to start because I have a problem with werewolves in steamy romances (the yick potential). None of that here. What it has is an alpha-alpha hero who comes on too strong and jerkish (not that it's his fault, all things considered), discovers the error of his ways, and earns his way back. It also had a heroine who starts out very meek and frightened (again, understandably) and grows to become a force to be reckoned with. The heat and tension between the two is relentless and scorching, the romance develops slowly and thoroughly. And then there's the whole new world of vampires and werewolves and demons and valkyrie, witches, etc. One thing to be aware of, this isn't actually the first book of the series; there's a novella \\"Warlord Wants Forever\\" that precedes it (which I didn't read and can't say that I missed)."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I think this book at the beginning it is a wtfrench situation but just seeing enemies (do to their kind) fall in love is just plain awesome.

I prefer urban fantasy and paranormal fiction that just has romantic undertones. Although I read Paranormal Romances and enjoy them, they tend to not be my all-time favorites. (Two authors I have read the most paranormal romance from are Lynsay Sands and Kerrelyn Sparks) Let me say that I have thought about picking up \\"A Hunger Like No Other\\" for some time now, but I just wasn't sure about another series that was heavy on the romance. I couldn't have been more than a few chapters in when I realized how addicting the story, and Kresley Cole's writing was. The story's plot revolves around Lachlain, a Lykae (werewolf)king, breaking free of centuries worth of torture at the hands of evil vampires. He literally scents out the fact that his 'mate', whom he has never met, is near. The woman is Emmaline Troy, a half breed of part vampire, and part Valkyrie. Emma is a meek creature who finds herself taken by Lachlain against her will. While he is mean to her at first, she finds him attractive. While Cole introduces the idea of sex, and sexual tension very early on, the actual sex act is a long time coming, and all this did was ensure that reader's can certainly feel the snap and crackle between the two. I have yet to read a romance that jumped off the page like this one. Usually, I get bored with the sex stuff and mostly skim through those pages. That wasn't the case here as I wanted to read and savor each of Cole's passages. The beginning, while gripping, played it very close to being over the top because Lachlain's treatment of Emma felt almost like abuse. Some scenes near the beginning actual made me feel a little uneasy. I was overjoyed when Emma stepped things up a bit, and became more sure of herself and didn't let him walk all over her. Another thing that kept this book from feeling like every other paranormal romance I ever read, was the continual action going on. The story had a bigger picture dealing with a war on the brink between the weres, the vampires (both good and evil) and the Valkyrie. Emma's Valkyrie aunts were a hoot and I would love to read more of them in the future. Cole's fantasy world is unique and unlike any other, and I think it has the potential to be one of the best drawn of these parnormal worlds. Although I had a few gripes with the story, mostly with Lachlain, I have to say the book far exceeded any expectations I may have had and I will certainly be grabbing up the next book in the series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This was the first book of this genre that I read- and it was very steamy and fun. I liked it so much I got the next 3 books in the series. This book by itself was very witty in dialogue and a good plot. I have already re-read it!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"A hunger like no other was really a delicious read but what stopped me from giving this book a five star review was that Emmaline (the Heroine who was half valkyrie and half vampire) managed to get on my nerves quite a few times. But even that didn't stop me from enjoying the chemistry her and Lachlain shared.Both the hero and heroine's coming together was just sizzling H-O-T. It left me wishing that my room had an air conditioner. What made it even better was all the sexual tension the two shared right up until that moment.Lachlain is one of those alpha-males (and he's a werewolf!) that you don't want to miss reading about. By the end of the book, I was waiting for my very own Lachlain to appear, claim me as his mate and then kidnap me away.I warn you ladies, if you're going to pick up this book, make sure you have either a box of chocolates or an available man handy so that you can take out your sexual frustrations after you're done reading!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I stumbled across Kresley Cole and I am sooooo happy I did. Her writing is awesome and addictive. I love her humor and she does an excellent job at developing characters that I actually care about. She ties everything together so well! I have not found a book of hers yet that I don't want to read in one sitting. I can't put the things down once I start!Looking forward to this developing series!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Well I wish I was one of the Lore because Kresley Cole's characters are sexy and have a lot of fun! This is the first Kresley Cole book I've read and it was excellent. Fast-paced, exciting. I could not put it down and I've read a lot of books. If you're a Christine Feehan fan, you'll like Kresley Cole's take on things. Her characters are real and believable. Lachlain is this sexy beast of the Lykae who happens to be King! Emma is his intended; half-vampire, half-valkyrie who isn't too excited to find out she is his truemate. He's not too crazy about it either, but neither can stop the attraction they have towards each other. It's very well written. I warn you now, if you read it you won't be able to put it down! Excellent!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This book was a guilty pleasure. Sure, it's not the greatest piece of literature ever written, but it was good.

But this series is a little different, because it involves the major character being a werewolf. So its really a werewolf/vampire romance.Recently released from a very long imprisonment by a vampire, this werewolf has recently smelled the scent of his mate and comes looking for her with a vengeance. Needless to say, he isn't happy when he finds that his mate is a vampire as well.He's not so nice to his mate in the front part of the book, which is what some readers didn't like -- but it actually makes total sense based on the history of the character. So hold out - it gets better. And you need to read this book in order to really get the full benefit of the rest of the series, which is really a great read. I'm looking forward to the next release in the series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I actually read the 3rd in the series first on accident, so I had to go back and read the first 2. I was no disappointed. Emma and Lachlain are extremely sexy together :)."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Be prepared to be taken in to a world of Lykae, Valkyrie and Vampires with The Accession that is upon them. Every five hundred years there is a power struggle among all Factions altering the balance of power among all beings of magic. But that is not the only thing that is changing as Lachlain, trapped under the catacombs of Paris, smells his mate. He tears himself free of the chains that bind him to the walls and for the first time in a hundred and fifty years he is free, free to hunt the woman that is meant to be his mate.Emmaline is in Paris for one thing, to find out more about her birth father but instead is facing a savage beast of a man that has one thing on his mind: complete possession. This does not sit well with Emmaline but what she doesn't know is that she is meant to be the mate of this man who is the King of the Lykae's. Through circumstances they travel to Scotland together but still events unfold the truth...and it is up to Emmaline and Lachlain if they have the strength to handle it.Kresley Cole has created a refreshing new world with Factions of Lykae, Valkyrie and Vampires and an interesting Accession that happens every five hundred years and is basically a battle where it is survival of the strongest. This is the background for an enthralling love story, it starts with Lachlain recognizing Emmaline as his mate, the tortured feelings of Lachlain, desperate to claim his mate grabbed me from the very first moments and drew me in to a story that I savored from start to finish.The characterization is strong, presenting me with background information that explains the world and rules to me and shows me where the characters are coming from. This is important to me for the emotions of Lachlain and Emmaline are experienced all the more intense for that very reason. With sparkling and interesting dialogue and a well paced plot this is a novel that you quickly ease in to and before you know it you've reached the last chapter of it, instantly wanting more of this world, more of these characters and first and foremost more of this kind of love and claiming. The secondary characters all bare enough depth to become leading characters in next novels and I for one am very interested which ones it will be.Though I have already read much in this genre I feel that Kresley Cole has given her own voice to all the myths and legends creating a vibe all of her own that will reverberate with many readers. For all who cherish this genre, this is an intriguing start of a series to watch out for!With A hunger like no other Kresley Cole has made a strong statement and proves to be a welcome addition to the paranormal genre.reviewed by LeontineCourtesy of Realms on our Bookshelves"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I liked the start of the book but after a while it was a little fustrating. It took for ever for them to have sex. The theme was good and the characters are enjoyable. I think the character Emma went a little overboard by playing really had to get. Took her for ever to come around. However, I still plan to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I really like Kresley Cole novels and while I did enjoy this book, I enjoyed her historical romances better. I liked the main characters, but once again I think it would be sooo much better if she could insert more humor into her books or make the characters have a more quirky personality. The loves scenes as usual were smokin' hot."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"When I fist began reading this book I dreaded it was going to be an excuse for sex, because it begins in sucha a hot manner... But then you go on on reading, waiting for them to get it going, and when you realise that, you're hooked on the book! (no pun intended).The characters turn out to be great ones, Lachlain is simply amazing, how she carea for her is great, and Emmalinne is just... so sweet and dangerous!A great book in its genre! ;)"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Although the author has created an imaginative paranormal world, the writing style and sputtering plot line just couldn't carry it out. There are many very positive reviews for the book and based on those, I eagerly gave it a try. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for fantastic sexual tension, paranormal romance, and a masculine hero you can't help but admire, but it wasn't too long before I just couldn't continue on with this book. The sexual tension isn't hot... it's tedious. They almost do it, or he almost forces himself on her so many times, it just gets annoying, not steamy. It got to the point where I was beginning to dislike the hero and never wanted her to sleep with him at all, and that just seems like a fantastic waste of a sexy Scottish accent.Additionally, the momentum of the plot line is repeatedly interrupted as the author provides us with the extended and frequent inner monologue of her two main characters, jumping from one to the other in a jerky manner. She uses this inner monologue technique to give us the backstory on the characters which has the effect of coming across like a forced summary.Finally, the reason I just had to put the book down and move on to something else, was the writing style. While the author's creativity for constructing a new and interesting mythology should be noted, her amateur writing style was distracting to the point that I couldn't get into the world she made. It felt forced and fake - like bad special effects. Sure, the idea is cool, but if it it badly done, it takes away from instead of adding to your project. If a big part of the enjoyment you get out of novels are all those times you stop to reread something that was so impressively well written, this author will leave you feeling frustrated.If you'd like a recommendation, how about any of JR Ward's 3 series. I'm sure a Ward fan out there just squealed if they didn't know she had 3 series : ) Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I have to agree with Erskine, Emma drove me nuts until I wondered why I was reading the book. By dumb luck I had bought the second book in the series, No Rest For The Wicked, and it WAS the best book of the series.

IMO, the only great thing about this novel was the cover. Intrigued by a review in a magazine, I purchased this book and was more than willing to give it a try. I read several chapters, attempting to get involved in the story, but none of the characters appealed to me. I skipped forward in the book, hoping it would improve, but it didn't. The hero and heorine weren't likable and their actions and situtations were a cross between boring and disgusting. The heroine was weak and the hero was a slavering, violent monster. I understand all about him being imprisoned and tortured which could make anyone half-mad but I just didn't feel anything for him, and if I can't at least like the hero, why bother. I definitly won't be reading any more of this author's paranormal books. Ugh! Not my cup of tea at all!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"so boring! I bought it because of the great reviews.... Yah, not hot at all. The guy is barbaric, the girl is timid and mousy. Tooooo many back stories and side stories. The whole flow is hard to follow.

If you like sexy warewolfs, try the mating series by nicky charles, much hotter!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This series has been recommended to me constantly on every internet board and from all my friends and family who read books similar to me. I finally gave in and bought a few of them. Paranormal Romance and Urban Fantasy are two of my very favorite genre's. I've greatly enjoyed many different books from the Dark Hunter to the Carpathian series and from Kate Daniels to Mercy Thompson.I cannot think of a time I've been this disappointed in a book or series. I didn't like the characters at all. Emma was a whiny, spoiled, timid little thing - and even the ending could not save my opinion of her. Lachlain deserved far better than what she was offering that's for sure. As for him he started strong and then deteriorated to some whipped puppy giving Emma baubles and trinket's and hoping she'd stay. He's the Lykae king? Really?There are some other characters introduced as well - I found all of Emma's \\"Aunt's\\" to be obnoxious and without too many redeeming qualities. They're very weird as well. I still, after I finished the book, hardly understand what they are, what that means, and how they are all connected. And the way they talk - OIY! Juvenile and insipid - they sound like they are trying to be teenage girls. It just comes off as extremly lame. Lachlain's contingency was better - his brother, assistant, and the female werewolf were pretty good.As for the plot it too started out strong like Lachlain but it fizzled mightily in the middle wandering a bit aimlessly. The last 50 pages actually brought my rating from 1 star to 2. To be honest much of the book left me confused about how this world worked - and why. It was too much and not enough information at all once.And the romance - start, stop, start, stop, start, stop and so on and so on and so on until you want to scream. Unfortunately not in a good way! The sexual tension seemed forced and awkward. The scenes themselves were written fine - the characters just didn't fit well.I see this book gets good reviews but I cannot figure it out. When my sister called last night to ask me how the books were even she was shocked at my reaction. I did ask about the rest of the series and if they got better and then she told me \\"the news\\" that the next book is about one of the \\"aunt's\\" (the ones who raised Emma). Ugh. No thank you times 10! I don't think this series will be for me but I'll try one more. If you've got a recommendation for which one you'd recommend please share it.I don't have to love a character to like a novel - and on occasion I've even hated a character and loved a novel. However I cannot deal with characters that annoy me so much I want to throw the book across the room. Probably the biggest book shock I've had in years as far as expectations."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"If I wanted to read a book for the soul purpose of some good sex scenes, then I would have rated this book higher. However, I don't think good sex scenes alone makes a good book. I like to appreciate the characters (at least the main ones) and I simply did not. Lachlain was okay, I felt like I understood him, even if the Scottish accent was very distracting. My mind doesn't do a very good Scottish accent and he often sounded silly in my head... ya I know that is my own personal problem but it added to my difficultly in bringing these characters to life. I couldn't wrap my head around Emma... her characteristics seemed to change a few times while the book progressed and I never saw what brought these changes on. I hate being so vague on why I couldn't appreciate these characters but I don't know how else to explain that they just didn't jump off the page."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"When you read the book's prologue you'd think that you'll read a spooky book. So if you like eerie readings this could be it. The problem is that since the first chapter KC tried to make antic after jest and that only makes the book boring.

Popp. That book has a really spooky love story."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I honestly don't understand why this book has so many 4-5 star reviews, because it was really yawn worthy, and the main female character was weak and foolish. 70 is plenty old enough to be wise, yet she was not. The plot line wasn't very appealing either, and there was a lack of \\"good\\" love scenes. I skipped many pages of boring dialogs between other characters because the back story just wasn't exciting.There are better romance authors out there, ones who actually put an interesting plot inside - please avoid this book."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Witty and interesting characters. I would like to read more from this author."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews from other people. They did a great job at persuading me to buy both books in this series. I bought \\"Playing Easy to Get\\", which I didn't realize was a trilogy. (Don't read the first story. It was the worst one I've read in a very long time!) But the story about the Vampire and the Valkyrie, Roth and Misty, got me hooked. I liked their strong personalities and it's short enough to seem more like a comic book than a corny novel. I could visualize the fighting scenes intertwined with great sex in a fantastic castle, in this underground world. Actually, this idea would sell wonderfully as a comic book. It has a lot of gothic imagery...Anyway, \\"A Hunger Like No Other\\" was supposed to top that. It really didn't. However, I must confess, it did get better toward the end. I won't ruin it but there is vampire-history that reminded me of the movie Underworld. But I had to endure the endless chapters about a whooped man (or a tamed animal--take your pick), the trying-to-be-hip language from a silly character, and how trivial this \\"supposedly smart\\" woman/girl is. As you can see, I can't even remember their names because their character development had no depth. It's a great story for teenagers, sans the sex scenes, but for an adult...or maybe this is meant for teenagers? Not sure...but I wouldn't let my [...] niece read this.

His escape is spurred by his sensing of his eternal mate, but when he finds her, he's maddened to discover that she is a half vampire. Emmaline Troy is a half vampire/half Valkyrie in Paris searching for information on her biological parents. She's accosted by Lachlain and forced to accompany him back to Scotland. All the while, they are pursued by vampires trying to steal Emma back, as she's the only female vampire left.Oh, where to start on this book. Cole writes a very sexy book, with fascinating characters. If you like your heroes alpha, then Lachlain fits the bill. The book moves rapidly, and the secondary characters really come to life. I started out not liking Emmaline very much. She seemed weak and wimpy and indeed, the character herself says she's a coward and weak. However, Cole grows Emma from a scared, timid heroine to a very strong and empowered woman able to stand up to the alpha male trying to run her life. And considering her \\"youth\\" (she's 71 years to his 1200 years), she needs some assertiveness to handle him.Cole also captures the essence of each \\"creature.\\" Emma is sexy and there's no question, but she talks about clawing and pawing things, and she hisses. Lachlain's beast really comes out, and even in the cover, the model's hands are very beasty looking. I like the realism.Cole's book completely captivated me, but I did have some issues. The primary problem I had was that her dialogue tended to leave the subject out. Quite a bit of the Lykae dialogues were incomplete sentences, and I could never figure out if it was just a trait in their speech patterns. Whatever it was, it didn't work for me as I read the book. Maybe if I heard it spoken out loud the way the author heard it, it might sound more natural, but unfortunately, it bothered the bejeezus out of this English major. Also, Cole tends to switch points of view pretty frequently, almost like you're watching television. It was disruptive for me.My other issue was that Emmaline's foster family -- the Valkyries -- were interesting, but seemed there to provide nothing but comic relief. The book started out pretty intensely serious and dramatic, but as it progressed, it felt like the author decided on twisting it into a bit of comedy. Not too over the top, however, and I grew to really like them.And for those who are bothered by rather forceful sex, and near rape-scenes, you might need to skip this one. Lachlain is a touch crazy in the beginning (I would be, too, after 200 years of having the flesh burned off my body), and has a very strong dislike of vampires, so he treats the heroine very shabbily and while there isn't any actual rape, there are some close calls that made me uncomfortable.Overall, however, despite the sentence syntax and the switch in styles, I really enjoyed the book and I'll look forward to the next one."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is quite possibly one of the most awesome books I've read in a while...and I read A LOT! I first ordered this book after reading Cole's short story \\"The Warlord Wants Forever\\" in the book Playing Easy To Get. I have always wondered why romantic fantasy writers have neglected to address the mighty Valkyrie, and finally stories are written that do these strong, complicated women justice! I've already ordered Kenderin's story in No Rest For The Wicked, and am breathless with anticipation!Emmaline Troy is (probably) the first and only half-vampire, half-Valkyrie..but she doesn't really know who she is. As her mother died shortly after her birth, she has no clue who her Vampire father was..or is. Growing up protected by her Valkyrie coven who kill vampires daily, she fears her own nature to the point of not even recognizing what that nature might be, and feels utterly alone. So, in order to not become one of the insane killers she has never drank \\"straight from the source\\" and is scared to death of pain and confrontation. In a stroke of rebellion, she leaves her coven in New Orleans to travel to Paris to \\"fulfill her destiny\\". All she hopes is to discover the secrets of her conception.Lykae King, Lachlain MacRieve, has but two goals in life..to rid the world of vampires and to find his destined mate - the women who will quiet his beast and complete him for all eternity. After being imprisoned by the vampire horde and tortured for the past 15 centuries, his is on the brink of insanity.....when he finally scents HER! He finally escapes his hell and tracks his mate, only to discover that she is Emmaline - who, as part vampire, should be his bitterest enemy.Lachlain kidnaps Emmaline trying to determine if she is really his mate or if he has lost his mind, only to determine she is sweet, compassionate, innocent and nothing like her ancestors. Convinced she is his mate he must accomplish the un-accomplishable -capture a Valkyrie who only wants her freedom.Can Emmaline overcome her timidity to seize a life with a wild man who despises her kind and fight an ancient evel to protect those she loves? Can Lochlain overcome his hatred of all vampire-kind to love Emmaline, as well as acquirine his vengeance? Together can they learn the secrets of her conception...and if they do, can they live with what they find?"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Kresely Cole's lastest venue into the paranormal is a smashing success!! Though I don't usually enjoy contemporary set novels, I loved, loved, LOVED this tale of destined lovers. Sensual, thrilling and humorous at times, HUNGER has all the elements (and then some) necessary for a great read.Don't let the beautiful cover fool you...this is not your ordinary vamp tale. Ms. Cole has managed to pen a unique, fast-paced paranormal of the likes I've yet to read. Instead of the normal, \\"Buffy\\"-esque heroine, we have Emmaline. A timid, self-conscious, scaredy-cat of a vampire--something I found to be a refreshing change. However our hero, Lachlain, is the true gem of the book. He's a werewolf whose been imprisoned and tortured for the past 150 years. Only when he senses his mate, the one woman he's been searching for, for a thousand years does he manage to escape. His joy quickly turns to rage when he discovers she is a vampire...a creature no different than those responsible for his years in \\"hell.\\" Ms. Cole accurately portrays Lachlain's mental instability from his years of pain and repeated death.

The author didn't take up the whole book with superfluous love scenes, but the love scenes it did have were well integrated, storyline appropriate, and definitely left you panting for more.Emmaline Troy is a rare female vampire/valkryie hybrid. She lives with her coven of Valkyrie who have raised her since she was a baby when her own mother, the legendary Helen of Troy, died. She doesn't know who her father is since her mother refused to tell anyone. On a trip to Paris she hopes to find information that will lead her to her father. Unbeknownst to her Lachlan the king of the Lycae (werewolves) lies trapped beneath the city, burning continually. With his superhuman senses he detects his mate in the city above. In a crazed, mad frenzy he amputates his own leg (don't worry it regenerates) in order to get free and find his mate who he has waited for for over a thousand years. Following her scent he tracks his mate down. To his horror (and hers) he discovers his mate is a hated vampire, the very creatures responsible for his imprisonment and continual burning for centuries. Outraged and half-insane he takes out his fury on Emma. Eventually, his anger ceases but its too late now for Emma (known as Emma the Timid) is terrified of him. Eventually, they come to love each other. But just as they are settling into their relationship Emma comes to a horrible realization. Her father is Demestriu, King of the Vampire Horde, and the one responsible for killing Lachlan's brother and imprisoning him. Believing that she is tainted, and that Lachlan will hate her because of her father, Emma flees to Demestriu's hidden palace to kill him. Surprisingly, she accomplishes what so many have failed to do, her father's death. But she is mortally wounded and heads back to her Valkyrie coven. Lachlan tries to see her but the Valkyrie distrust him and refuse to let him see her. Eventually everything gets worked out and they all live happily ever after.

I've read is numerous times which is really rare for me. And I don't think I've ever posted a review before. I've really enjoyed Kenyon's \\"Dark Hunter\\" series and Feehan's \\"Dark - Carpathian\\" series but Hunger is my all-time favorite. It's totally sexy, there's great character development and it has laugh out loud moments. Examples involve the character Nix who is a seer and her impatient, random complaints about having \\"seen this part before\\" and that \\"this is rerun\\" during high tension moments. I'm almost worried that the following books won't be able to live up to this one. But of course I'll be getting every one."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"To say A Hunger Like No Other is the best adult paranormal romance I have ever read is a bit weighted since I have not read much in this genre. The reason for this is because I had two bad experiences with adult paranormal romance: Dark Lover by J.R. Ward and Sunshine by Robin McKinley. Both failed me miserably, and ever since, I have ignored this genre completely. The first read like soft-core porn and the second was just so boring.Therefore, when a friend recommended me A Hunger Like No Other, I just brushed her off with one look at the book's cover. I mean, look at it! It screams SOFT-CORE PORN INSIDE. The cheesy summary on the back was no help either. Let me first say that I am not a prude; I do like sex in my books, as long as it is written tastefully. I also love steamy scenes of foreplay. It's just that I get really turned off by books with (1) love at first sight and (2) unnecessary scenes of intercourse in every three chapters. I believe that true love develops over time, not just in a week of knowing each other. Also, if the main characters are constantly having sex, it would seem they are more in lust than in love.I love an author who can create amazing sexual tension without actual sex happening yet. A Hunger Like No Other is exactly this! The chemistry between Emma and Lachlain was very believable (and hot). You will love reading about them. They have some pretty funny scenes that got me laughing out loud. Plus, A Hunger Like No Other has a great storyline with action / adventure! The characters are all very fleshed-out as well, especially Emma's eccentric Valkyrie family. They are all bad-ass yet hilarious at the same time. I was so sad that the story had to end but am glad there are more books to this series, featuring some of the characters from A Hunger Like No Other as the protagonists!I also want to mention that Kresley Cole is a brilliant author. She switches between Emma and Lacklain's POV (point of view) very fluidly in third person without giving each protagonist their own chapter. I read a lot of YA (even though I'm 22), and this feat is usually accomplished through first person narrative and separate chapters. In addition, Cole's writing style was simple yet descriptive enough, making it a very fun read and not a burden on the reader. It seems like a lot of adult novels these days try too hard to be sophisticated and end up straining my eyes and brain.All in all, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND A Hunger Like No Other if you enjoy paranormal romance! It was s hilarious, fun, and sexy ride. However, the publishers should really change the cover to something a little more sophisticated . . . I don't know how many other readers have put off this book because it's a reminisce of bad Harlequin novels."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"It was cliche. It was werewolves and vampires and valkyries, oh my! It was even a little trashy. But god help me, I really enjoyed it. I also have to praise a romance author that uses anatomical terms in lieu of 'throbbing manhood' and 'wet heat' (although there was some of that, too). Overall it was enjoyable, and I look forward to reading another book by this author."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is one of the best vampire / warewolf romances that I have read in a long time.

This book has a nice mix of mythology, vampires, and romance. This book was so well written that I could not put it down. Thank god I purchased the second book. I read this book in a little over a day and can't wait for book three to become available."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic book!!!Most def a keeper - I've only just discovered this author! - this book is outstanding!!! If you enjoyed this novel - and I LOVED it I would also recommend JR Ward - another supernatural romance author - again excellent!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"After enduring years of torture from the vampire horde, Lachlain MacRieve, leader of the werewolves (Lykae), is enraged to find the predestined mate he's waited millenia for is a vampire. Or at least partly one. Emmaline Troy is half Valkyrie / half vampire. After her mother's death, she grew up sheltered by the Valkyrie coven and she's rather fearful and very shy. When she finally sets out to uncover the truth about her parents, the powerful Lykae finds her, claims her as his mate and forces her back to his ancestral Scottish castle. Despite the tension arising from his initial anger and their differences, the two are getting closer and Emmaline discovers her strengths. But will they be able to conquer an ancient evil resurfacing from their past?This is Kresley Cole's second story set in the world of the Lore (vampires, werewolves and other mythical creatures living hidden from us, but in our world). \\"The warlord wants forever\\" (from the anthology \\"Playing easy to get\\") introduced this world and the Valkyries while telling the love story of the Valkyrie Myth and the vampire Nikolai Wroth. While I find it makes the experience of reading \\"A hunger like no other\\" richer, I think that one can also read it on its own and still understand what is going on. The series will continue with \\"No rest for the wicked\\".\\"A hunger like no other\\" is at once suspenseful fantasy, sexy romance and often very funny (but not in a slapstick way like Lyndsay Sands). I simply couldn't put it down and enjoyed it very much, mostly because I really liked the characters, the (sexual) tension between them and how Emmaline grew as a person (which is unfortunately rare in romance novels). There were also a lot of interesting supporting characters that I'd like to see again in other novels (maybe with their own story). In addition, Crole doesn't simply warm up the clich?es about vampires and werewolves, but gives them an original touch and also centers the story around the Valkyries, which are partly based in Viking myth, but as a whole quite original. I'd say Cole is in the same league as Kim Harrison, Adams / Clamp (Sazi-series, \\"A touch of evil\\") or Lynn Viehl - new authors who manage to write paranormal romances with originality and their own touch. So I can highly recommend this book to anyone who likes intelligent and entertaining paranormal romance with an alpha-hero and a strong heroine (Emmaline has to find her strength first, but when she does - beware!)."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Man I cannot say enough about this new series! I love anything about Vampires, Lore, Werewolves.. etc. But add a Celtic Hunk and I will die a happy woman! And if that isn't enough Cole provides an incredible storyline with characters just screaming for a story of their own. I cannot wait to read the next one. Do yourself a favor, get this book, shut off the phone, lock the door and ENJOY!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This book is utterly amazing and wonderful, and Kresley Cole is my new favorite author! Run, run, run and get it! I could not put this book down. I was hooked from page 1, literally, and could not stop reading it. And then when I finally finished, I couldn't sleep because these characters kept talking to each other in my head, all night long. It starts out wonderful and never lets up. The hero, the werewolf king, is to-die-for! Sexy, sexy, sexy! And the heroine, Emmaline (half vampire, half Valykyrie), is wonderfully unique, fey, charming, and hip at the same time. This is one of the best romances I've ever read - the emotional pull and sexual tension between the main characters is superb. The dialogue is excellent, the action is nonstop, and this unique world is populated by all kinds of supernatural beings - vampires, werewolves, Valkyrie, demons. This is definitely one of THE BEST paranormal romances I've ever read. I know this one will go on my Keeper shelf to be read over and over again. Not many books make it onto my keeper shelf, but this one is definitely going to the head of the line. (Now, what else has Kresley Cole written? Gotta find it!) I can't wait for the next book in this series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"After much searching, I was despairing of ever finding another series as good as \\"The Fever Series\\". However, after the first few pages of the Immortals series, I am in awe! The action is compelling, the love scenes are realistic and not overdone. The main characters are relatable and manage to be modern and ancient at the same time. The Lore characters of the supernatural world are very inventive and unique compared to the supernatural characters of other books in this genre. Overall, I am thrilled to have found such a fantastic series!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"If I'm honest, the first time I read this book I liked it, but had a hard time loving it. I had to focus on learning the new world, the new types of characters, etc. But I liked it enough to keep reading, and I'm glad that I did because Kresley Cole is now tied for my favorite romance author (the other is Julia Quinn). After reading all the books available, I went back through and picked up a lot of little things I missed the first time. If you haven't re-read the series, I highly recommend doing it because you can tell how much advanced planning went into it.Like most first books of a series, it has the difficult task of introducing you to a new world (the Lore, basically beings from various folklore), and most likely a new writing style. The thing about the Immortals After Dark (IAD) series is that the writing balances fun with serious, and keeps you on your toes. Not to mention you come to care deeply for the characters and usually cheer when they makes cameos in other books.If you're interested in buying an intoxispell from a witch to feel drunk, marvel at the strength of Lykae werewolf, and want to meet Nucking Futs Nix the crazy-yet-awesome soothsayer, this is the book that starts it all. I highly recommend giving it a chance because the series only gets better from here (with maybe one exception, but I won't hold that against KC!)."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I love this author and I love werewolf romance, so this was the perfect combination for me. I didn't want to put it down. Of course, as in all series I have read, I have not read this 1 in order either, but the series comes together. Readers, no worries about reading out of order or a single book, these books can stand on their own! Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"What I Loved: The 2nd half of the book! It would have gotten a solid 4 maybe 4.5 from me. I really enjoyed the characters, the suspense, the action, and the story from about half way on. Once I got past my initial reservations I fell in love with Lachlain and Emma. I thought they were both compelling and well-thought out lead characters.What I Liked: I am really looking forward to the rest of the series where I get to learn more about the secondary characters in this book. I thought they were all fun to get to know (didn't realize this was the 2nd book in the series so I will have to go back and read the first one).Complaints: The 1rst part of the book did not really thrill me with the very violent way that Lachlain treated Emma. I understood why but it still did not sit very well with me. Luckily it never crossed a line that I could not come back from.Why I gave it a 3: This is a really good book but the first part really lowered the rating for me. That being said, I am going to read the rest of the series and can't wait to see what it holds.Who I would recommend it too: PNR readers. This has got a great mixtures of paranormal characters in it and is a very good read.Author Website: [...]Books in this series:Playing Easy to GetA Hunger Like No OtherNo Rest for the WickedWicked Deeds on a Winters NightDark Needs at Nights EdgeDark Desires after DuskKiss of a Demon KingDeep Kiss of WinterPleasure of a Dark PrinceDemon from the DarkDreams for a Dark Warrior"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"BDB fans recommended this book as I finished the BDB series, and I am glad I listened. Now, I enjoyed BDB more, but I really enjoyed this first book to the IAD series. This book has more creatures than vampires (i.e. fairies, werewolves etc) but it's all good.I enjoyed Cole's writing and I enjoyed the evolution of their Lachlain & Emmaline's relationship. It was nice to see Emma growing up and taking control of herself and her destiny. No more puny Emma, hello Demestrius slayer. I really liked the scenes when Emma drank from Lachlain.I was curious as to how other Lykes can see that you have been marked. Does your skin glow where he bit you?

The H/H are both fantastic characters... yes, it is a bit \\"hot and steamy\\" and I wouldn't necessarily read in public - but she is an automatic buy for me."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I picked up this book to read on my Kindle based on reviews from fellow Amazon readers when trying to find a new series to interest me. I had no idea what to expect, I was hoping for strong urban fantasy and not \\"vampire romance\\". Didn't really get either one, but liked it anyways. I, too, am sick of vampire heros and the whole vampire thing that's been happening in books lately. This definitely doesn't do a vampire proud. We don't entirely get away from that genre, as it is the same theme, just different race of beings.I liked the introduction of \\"The Lore\\" and the Lykae, the Valkryie, and all the rest. This author has exceptional talent, manages to get the action going from page 1 and keeps it at a pretty intense level throughout the book. Also does a good job of putting words in to make me laugh. Heavy on the sex scenes, more than I need/care to have, book is definitely graphic. Yet another trend in the genre I'm not too thrilled with. But darn good ones, ok, I have to admit that!Perhaps too quick to bring a very tortured (in every sense) hero and a very timid heroine to the center and balance them both? But not altogether unplausible. Extreme circumstances will drive extreme changes, and the author was good at setting that up and making it believable.I've referred it on, and I will pick up the next book in the series when I'm in the mood."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Kresley Cole has an almost singular talent for creating dialogue and elucidating character emotion and private thoughts without making readers cringe because of mawkishly sentimental crap. Her sex scenes are phenomenal, her use of slang in character dialogue is absolutely awesome, and even though there are some of her novels that I love more than others she has yet to release a novel that has not been rich in plot,struture, and character depiction/presentation. This particular book happens to be one of absolute favorites in her IAD series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Even though I didn't really care for the wimpiness of the heroine, I loved this book.

I love that it has a happy ending, just like all books in the IAD series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"The was a good story. A lot of twist and turns. It had a wonderful ending but it was not strong enough to pull me on to the next book."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Emmaline Troy is a half vampire and half Valkyrie. Sheltered all her life by her Valkyrie aunts, she finally decides to leave the nest and go to Paris, to seek answers about her parents. There she is attacked and kidnapped (and mistreated) by the sexy, handsome, just-to-die-for Lykae king Lachlain MacRieve, who knows that she is to be his destined mate. Lachlain had just escaped from being tortured by vampires for the last 15 decades, so you can understand his shock and disgust when he realized the mate he'd been searching for the last thousand years is a vampire. Needless to say, his treatment of her most times is rather harsh. This was kind of a turn-off for me when I read it. If someone had treated me that cruelly, I don't think I would've forgiven them that easily.Anyhow, moving on.I do really like Emmaline. Heroines who start out weak sometimes can sound whiny, but she's so adorable. And I love how Ms. Cole slowly let Emma grow into the strong creature that she is destined to be, not just suddenly decide that oh, she should be strong now, but the character development is worked out in detail. Another thing I really like about this book is that the protagonists don't just jump into bed together. Yes, there're a lot of sexual scenes, but they only service to build up the sexual tension between the characters. (And must I say, there are a lot of sexual tension there.) The woman doesn't just give in to her sexual need and have sex with him. In fact, the female actually have some backbone in resisting the male and can actually call off the encounter even when she's horny as hell.Over all, this new series by Ms. Cole totally surprised me. I've read plenty of paranormal romance considering the genre's popularity (Feehan, Kenyon, Ward, etc.). To be honest, I am a little jaded by the genre, but this hooked me from page one. Or actually, before that. I have to say that it would be a good idea to read Ms. Cole's story in the anthology Playing Easy to Get as that is a very good introduction to the world. This book might be less confusing if one's got the background from the anthology story. One bone I have to pick is that everyone seem to hate everyone in this book (Valkyrie hates vampires, lykae hates vampires, valkyrie hates lykae). all those hating and narrow-mindedness got on my nerves a bit, but they weren't that distracting, overall. I mean, I just kind of skip those parts when the Valkyrie are hating on others.Other than that, wonderful book. Can't wait to read the rest of the series. I can already tell that all the other books on my to read list will be pushed to the back until I finish this series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Chemistry, action, humor, fantasy, this book has it all. This great introduction into a seductive para-normal romance series will captivate you, make you blush, make you laugh, and make you burn through the pages. Once you are done, you'll empty your bank account just to possess the rest of the series! I've read all of Kresley's selections and while none of them will disappoint, this is still my standing favorite!

I have read everything Kresley Cole has wrote and have to say she is by far the best romance author I have ever read (though JR WARD would have been very close if the bdb series hadn't gone out of the romance genre in my head). All Kresley's books are good and even though you don't have to I require myself to read everything in order and it does help. This book is a little bit edgy as in there are some parts that seem very close to rape, but she still makes you fall in love with the characters."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"And I bought it 3 months ago.

I went on to read the rest of the series, and I highly recommend this book as an introduction to the Immortals After Dark world."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Lachlain MacRieve, the leader of the Lykae Clan endured years of torture from the vampire Horde until, while trapped in the dungeons in Paris, he scented his predestined mate and escaped. He tracks her down in the city and captures her, only to find out she's a vampire herself. Emmaline Troy is half Valkyrie/half vampire (unbeknownst to Lachlain) and has been sheltered by her Valkyrie aunts her entire life. This was her first venture outside of their protection and she's claimed by a powerful Lykae as his mate.I cannot point to one aspect of this story that hooked me so I think it was a combination of many things as there was quite a bit going on. First, the idea that Lachlain spent over 150 years in the dungeons of Paris being tortured daily was awfully intriguing. The idea that the power of sensing his predestined mate gave him the will and ability to free himself after all of that time was pretty alluring and a sign of interesting things to come in that relationship. I also liked that Emmaline, who was extraordinarily timid and insecure after spending a lifetime with her batty aunts, struck out on her own for the first time in her life and was learning to fend and think for herself. It was uplifting to follow her metamorphasis to a young woman of confidence, strength and intelligence. She held her own with Lachlain. Lastly, the secondary storylines were awfully exciting and provided intrigue and suspense as the romance between Lachlain and Emma developed, which was gradual, well paced and sensual.Initially, I thought the premise sounded absurd but it works. Lachlain's initial barbarism was authentic and we immediately got to see that Emma had game as she seemed to know how to handle him and diffuse the situation. Her quick thinking and adroitness was more of a surprise to her and ultimately prepared her for the final showdown with her aunts. There were a few twists at the end that you could sort of see coming but the scenes delivered in spite of it being somewhat predictable. I really like the start to this series (I'm not counting the prequel) and cannot wait to continue with the next book."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This author knew exactly what she wanted and how to accomplish it.

I had only read one or two other series from this genre (JR Ward and Tina Folsom) by the time I read Kresley Cole. I found the book (and most of the books in this series) to represent a refreshing change of pace. Since reading this book about 6-9 months ago, I have read numerous others in this genre written by other authors, and I continue to go back to Kresley Cole as the standard for a select subset of paranormal romance. She has a smart style about her with likeable characters and a clear pace. The humorously debauched nature of her heroines (and heroes in some cases) is so refreshing. I'm not sure if she was the first to develop this style of character for paranormal romance, but her execution is flawless. Others appear to be a poor imitation unfortunately. Great book - highly recommend."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This whole series is fun, but I think this was one of my favorites.

The character introductions and plot were smoothly interwoven. The title implied steamy sex and romance and it was indeed HOT! It was tastefully done and we were invited into the authors beautiful mind. I won't get into details about the story, its not necessary. What you were offered is exactly what you got. I am glad that I took the chance on this author and the book, its worth every penny. I am no doubt going to buy the rest of the series and I'm sure I will still be starving for more of these characters. If you enjoy steamy paranormal romance, don't miss out on this one.

I can't say I particularly like their first actual sex scene together, especially considering it is highly unlikely a virgin would enjoy that. I do, however, like Emma's character development as the story goes and her affect upon Lachlain as their relationship evolves.

I love the way the dialogues are very witty and hysterical. It is very easy to be involved and really immerse yourself in this world K. Cole has created.

Id like to group the books into Lyckae Clan (Lachlain-Emmaline, Bowen-Mariketa, and Garreth-Lucia), Forbearers (Nikolai-Myst, Sebastian-Kaderin, Conrad-Noemi, and Murdoch-Daniela), and Demons (Rydstorm-Sabine and Cade-Holly) so far.

From page one, the main characters draw you into their captivating world filled with a plethora of supernatural beings as lycans, vampires, valkyries, furies, and wraiths.Lachlain and Emma are extremely likeable characters who are strong, witty, and passionate. I adore lycan and prefer the stories with the intense, volatile, devoted Lycan males. I fell in love with the tortured, complex, and sexy lykae king, Lachlain. His half vampire/vakyrie mate, Emmaline, is adorable, sassy and smart. It is during their road trip from Paris to Scotland that their attraction and relationship builds into one of trust.My only picks are the clich&eacute; cover and the relentless sexual tension which began to grate after while.Their story is full of action, drama, romance, suspense, and intriguing secondary characters which propels the story forward.

Ms. Cole has done this genre proud."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Kelsey Cole's Immortals After Dark is one of my all time favorite paranormal romance series, and this first is my favorite of them all. She has created a world of wonderfully rich immortal characters (including vampires, Valkyries, demons and werewolves)--all with noble sides that will win you.This one tells the story of the Lykae Clan King and his mate...who quite a different woman than he expected. After years of torture (from which he self heals each day) to find his long predestined mate is a half vampire (his enemy), he is disappointed but bound nonetheless. To watch him adapt to his fated mate, and come to love and respect her as she faces a dark and dangerous past, and to realize how perfect she is for him, is the story of how love can change us. Emmaline is a half Valkyrie/half vampire--a unique creature--who wants none of this Scottish Lykae male, but she goes along with him thinking to escape.The action is great, the plot interesting and the love story heartrending. The Valkyries are women you want to hang out with; their dialog is so funny I found myself laughing out loud and wishing I was there with them painting my toes. (Don't you paint your toes different colors for your mood?) But the romance is what won me...it's so believable and so well done it's addictive. And, yes, I've read it twice already.You find yourself lost in the characters' lives and wishing for a love only the Wroth brothers (noble vampires) or the werewolf king and his brethren can provide.

I wasn't that connected with Lachlain due to the fact that his personality fell a little flat for me, but I still enjoy his part.

The story is told from both Lachlain and Emmaline POV and a little snippets here and there of her Valkyrie family POV as well. I love Nucking Futs Nix, she is just too hilarious.

Kresley Cole does have this hability.Now you could readthe books without following the order because although Immortals after dark is a series, the story within each book has enough independence to stand alone without problems but I recommend you to read them following the order beause osmetime sthe author mentions this or that couple and it is just a loot of fun to remember what happened to those. When I bought \\"A hunger like no other\\" I had just started my vacation and Iwas longing for some worries-free reading, so I bought only the first three books from he series... great mistake... I read them fairly fast and after mere 4 days I was starving for more.This book has everything you would like to find. Romance, action, great world building and characters developments. The story goes fastwhere it should go fast and turns a bit slower when it is worth it to wait.You ill not be disappointed if you are looking for a nice sexy reading to fill your free time with!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I think this one is one of the best in the series, I enjoyed it a lot and will highly recommend it:)"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"When I started this book, I was unsure that I would like it because the main male character is forceful in the beginning. However, I ended up loving this book! I love the different species that Cole introduces in this book. I loved the character development between the two main characters. I do admit that the sexual tension in this book gets annoying, you just want to say \`do it already!' It's interesting to see that two different people from different species have to begin to coexist and learn and accept each other. Even though Cole introduces a totally new world to the reader, she makes it easy to comprehend. I'm looking forward to reading more involving Cole's different species."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"A Hunger Like No Other(the first in the Immortals After Dark Series) was a fantastic read! The Alpha male leader of the Lykae, Lachlain, was one of the hottest alphas I have ever read. His instant hatred for his mate sets the reader up for great, uber hot sexual tension. I love the dominance of his character. He is a true alpha! And Emma, the shy and fearful female lead's transformation into a strong, sexy and capable half Valkrie is a smooth transition and fits into the story very nicely. I couldn't put this book down! It reminded me of when I began the BDB series!!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I was looking for something after Black Dagger Brotherhood Series and this was a PLEASANT surprise to say the least.

If I had any quibble, it was that I didn't get enough of Garreth and Lucia but that's a minor quibble."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This was in my TBR pile for a long time. I guess I didn't pick it up because I need a break in-between vampire/paranormal or they all start to blend together. I am up to date on the Black Dagger Series, the Midnight Series, and even the Lords of the Underworlds series, so after reading a few historicals I picked this up.What a fun read! I liked the way the romance played out, and even though the heroine claimed to be timid and shy, she really wasn't and the way the book was written showed that. This was first published in 2006, so there are 5 more I need to read, looking forward to them!A tip though, there is a glossary of terms in the back, that I didn't see until the end. It would have been helpful to see that at the begining as there was a lot of information introduced on the different characters!Don't let the \\"cheesey\\" cover fool you - it's a good read."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This book has probably replaced Jude Deveraux's masterpiece A Knight in Shining Armor as my favorite romance of all time. Kresley Cole's writing is seamless, the sexual tension builds to a fever pitch, and the love scenes?Oh-my-gawd.There is just so much to love in this book (and the whole series for that matter). Complex and loveable characters, a fascinating universe that begs to be explored, sharp and witty humor that employs the most hilarious pop-culture references, and...did I mention the love scenes?I am thoroughly obsessed with the Immortals After Dark series and can't wait for the next volume."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I started with the second installment, read through a few and had to go back to the original, worth it even if I already knew many of the developments.

She wasn't portrayed as a 'strong,intelligent, independant woman' only to turn out to constantly be doing and saying silly, pathetic, contradictory things - the heroine was actually portrayed as being quite weak and dependant initially (still not stupid though) but then really comes into her own.One of the standouts for me from the first two books in this series is that I find the characters beleiveable (apart from the fact that they're valkyrie, vampires, werewolves etc.) - it's a nice change to be reading and not stopping constantly shaking your head and rolling your eyes over what characters do or say."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This book is fantastic!I was looking for a new good series and decided to pick this one after reading the reviews.I'm so glad I did.The book will keep you reading until you can't fight your eyes anymore.It'll even follow you in your dreams!I didn;t want the book to end and was very angry when it did so suddenly.Looking forward to the next!*** NOTE: I read this book first because it said \\"Book 1\\" but then learned that there's a story by Cole in the book \\"Playing Easy to Get\\" that tells the story of Myst and gives a lot of back story to the Valkyrie clan. Reading Hunger Like No Other first confused me at times because I didn't understand the characters and their actions but once I went back and read the short story, it all came together. Excellent short story, don't skip it! ***"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is the first book from Ms. Kresley Cole that I read, and I instantly fell in love with her writings. I went and bought all the other Immortals After Dark Series that are available and all of them have proved to be fantastic reads.Although some readers have mentioned that they did not like the idea of fated \\"mates\\" I find that Ms. Cole made the idea merely a way for the characters to meet and get to know each other. When it comes to subjects such as \\"fated mates\\" and \\"love at first sight\\",\\" it is generally easy for authors to fall in to the trap of not being able to explain/show why or how the two became so deeply in love with each other. However, this is not the case with Ms. Cole. As much as the two characters are destined to be together, and insticts did urge Lachlain to \\"protect\\" and \\"provide\\" his female, the emotional attraction between the two was never left out. By the end of the story, you will not have questions as to why they were so deeply in love with each other.The character development of both Lachlain and Emmaline were great too. As much as Lachlain is an alpha male, and that he is very dominating in personality, he never overpowered the existance of Emmaline. In fact, with her being so timid, she personality stood out as much as the dominatign Lachlain did. Her change towards the end of the novel was also something that made her a very unique character. She was never annoying and stupid that you'll think she's too dumb to exist, nor was she ever so strong and stubborn that you'll want to kill her off just so the story can keep moving along. All in all, by the end of the novel, I've fallen in love with both of the characters and couldn't wait to see more of them in the books later on the series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is a nice change from just werewolves or vampires. This covers all the other's. With that said, I think there should have been another book before this one telling about how it all began. Each has their own stories, but they are still one family."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"It's a good book that the author told really well, and I'll enjoy reading it numerous times"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I have been reading about how good the IAD books are for a couple of years now. It was not until I read Gena Showalter's The Darkest Night that I decided to pick up this series. For most part I am a fan of all things supernatural and enjoy reading different authors take on various mythos. I did enjoy the direction the author is taking her story when it comes down to the lore and that is what took this 2.5 to maybe 3 star book up to a 4.The underlying story is the story of the Ascension/Accession. A battle that happens every 500 years between the various Lore, which is what Vampires, demons, witches, wraiths, Valkyrie, and the Lykae are called. The story that is focused on is one a powerful Lykae who was imprisoned and tortured by vampires. He senses his mate and breaks free, the thing is she just happens to be of the race that tortured him...so he believes. Emmaline is weak and not what Lachlain expected. He easily overpowers her and they ensue upon the typical romance blueprint of meet, unwarranted attraction/obstacle, acceptance, another obstacle, and happy ever after.The book starts off good and then there is a drag and this gets repeated at least 2 more times before the novel completion. I totally felt unsatisfied at the end and I did not get the urge to go out and buy the rest of the series. What I find myself disliking about Showalter, Cole, and Ward is that they find it necessary to introduce characters and their soul mates in another characters book. Which ends up ruining the suspense and making the stories predictable."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I read a lot. So much so that it makes my husband angry and my friends tease me. I tell you this so you know I mean business when I say Kresley Cole's \\"A Hunger Like No Other\\" is the best Paranormal Romance book ever. The story centers around Lykae king Lachlain MacRieve. At the start of the book, he is chained in the pits of hell (for lack of a better word) and has been burning to near-death and resurrecting for hundreds of years. But then he scents his fated mated above ground. He busts free and finds her... only to discover she is part vampire. Lachlain hates the vampires, though, since they chained him that fiery prison and all....Anyway, Emma is sweet, timid and not at all worldly. An innocent in just about every way. Lachlain kidnaps her and uses her to help him acclimate to the new era he's facing. He pushes the envelope of a sexual relationship with her... and slowly begins to form an emotional relationship as well.Emma helps Lachlain journey back to his home in Scotland. (His accent is to die for, BTW.) And he reunites with his people he hasn't seen in centuries.While all this is happening, bad-guy vamps are trying to kidnap Emma. It creates lots of drama and sets up a great twist at the end.The world of the \\"Lore\\" that Kresley Cole establishes is unique and so easy to lose yourself in. The events in this book integrate seamlessly into other books in the series. I can't recommend the Immortals After Dark books enough. And this is the book that made me fall in love with them all.I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is a great start to a new series. Lachlain (werewolf/lykae) and Emma (1/2 vampire), the two main characters are both loveable and likeable. I have read all the books in the series and this book (1), book 2 (Sebastian and Kaderin) and book 3 (Bowen and Mariketa) are the best ones. Books 1, 2 and 3 are ones you will want to buy so you can re-read them!But starting with Book 4 (Conrad and Neomi) they just go downhill, each one getting worse then the previous one.

It was entertaining. sexy and kept me turning the pages--wanting more and more."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"There is only one reason to read this novel. It starts at around page 250, lasts for about 10 pages and then the story reverts to the d.r.i.v.e.l and padding of the previous 200 pages. The chapter concerned is pretty gross but the heroine seems happy enough. Takes all sorts to make the world. The story is contradictory, full of discontinuities, plot holes and narcisistic materialism. The cover is misleading in that it gives the impression that the hero is a vampire when he isn't. Why are people using swords in the 21st century? And there are just too many characters in it."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Ok so the accent that Lachlain has is a bit much, and Emmaline is annoying. This book was ok. It's not as good as JR Ward, no one is though haha. It's better than watching TV though, at least there's some adventure and they finally do get together in the end. I know I didn't spoil it, that's what always happens."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I had a little trouble with the first couple of chapters, the main male character is such a domineering alpha-male *&^% (insert expletive here).

If you like this one and haven't tried: Charlaine Harris or Kelly Armstrong you should."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I bought this book based on all the excellent reviews it received.

I have been waiting forever for another author to come up with another series that is as good as Mrs. Feehan's and Mrs. Cole has done it. Her new series has the same dark romance that leaves you longing for more.The story is about Lachlain who is the leader of the Lykae Clan (werewolves or war-wolds) and his search for his soul mate. His soul mate Emmaline is half vampire and half valkyrie. Lachlain's love for her is so deep that it will leave readers longing for more. I can't wait for the next book in the series. If you love paranormal romance where you feel the long deep connection between the hero and the herion this is definately the book for you."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"OH MY GOSH!!!!!! I loved it more than I could possibly imagine! After just coming off of a very disappointing read of Christine Feehan's new Carpathian series, I was feeling let down. Until I read, A Hunger Like No Other. I couldn't put it down and in fact have read it twice already. Kresley Cole so blew Christine Feehan (one of my fav. authors by the way) out of the water. You go girl!!!! I will be reading all of Kresley Cole's stories now. Thanks a million."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I liked the story at first. The heroine is young (for an immortal), and this is part coming-of-age story for her. She starts out with a reputation for being easily frightened, and weak. Once she meets Lachlain, she finds her inner strength. That's the good part.The bad part is all the constant non-consentual touching and kidnapping of the herione. It got to the point where I just really wanted her to escape from the hero and never see him again. I lost all sympathy for him or his situation, and wanted him to be alone and miserable.There was never any emotional connection between them. It was impossible to believe she fell in love with him at any point in the story."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"There's no question I'm a Kresley Cole fan - I loved her MacCarrick brothers Trilogy - If You Dare - If You Desire - If You Deceive, but this new series of \\"A Hunger Like No Other\\" just doesn't bring it into life for me. Obviously reading the many great reviews, I know I'm in the minority here, but although Lachlain is a sexy alpha male, something is missing from the other characters - no one seems to fill the page with any depth, or interest except for Lachlain. I can't help but remember being spellbound by Anne Rice's \\"The Vampire LeStat\\" series many years ago. All of the characters came to life on the page and worked their magic on you and you were drawn into a world of unknown mysteries. I loved Lachlain, but the rest of the characters felt like filler and not real characters. Let's hope Kresley Cole goes back to her Highland Warriors."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"The author takes a lot of familiar supernatural creatures and remakes them into something different. Emma is a vampire/Valkyrie cross and a little wallflower when we first encounter her in Paris. She is 71 years old which is quite young for an immortal. Later on, we are told she is the equivalent of a 24 year old human. Lachlain, the King of the Lykae (werewolves) escapes from 200 years of torture when he scents Emma, knowing she is the lifemate he has been seeking for 1200 years. Emma is known as a charming but out of place beauty who isn't sure of who she is and where she belongs.The descriptions here are somewhat vivid in that Emma hisses and Lachlain is beastly. They are still gorgeous beings, but the author goes beyond bloodsucker and furry.I do have a few issues with the book though even though I think it's a great book.Other readers took issue with the near-rape scenes in the book. They were a little alarming at first, but the characterization laid out by the author shows that Emma and Lachlain are not normal humans. Their drives and emotions are close to the surface. Considering they did not consummate their relationship until around page 260, they controlled themselves fairly well.Lachlain was tortured for around 200 years by the vampire king, being killed by fire each day and then being reborn to be killed again. He was unstable at best when he escaped and found Emma. Somehow he quickly recovered and became quite lucid.The vampires are a real threat in the beginning of the book, but Emma changes the situation in around 1 page toward the end. The resolution seemed a little abrupt and convenient.Another issue was that sometimes I wasn't sure who was talking and even when I tried to determine the speaker by backing up, it didn't make sense. I only noticed that on one page.I wasn't sure what was going on with the author's usage of a 4 letter word with an -e at the end of it. I really thought she was talking about Shi'ite Muslims at first...I do recommend this book. I liked it and I plan to purchase other novels from Ms. Cole."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This was the first time that I have read anything by this author. I read alot, so when I came across a new author in the genre I was very excited. I don't do plot replays, because I know that many others have already done that, so I'll try to focus on the things that I really look for in a review. This book had its moments. Sometimes I would find myself bursting into laughter. In fact, to be honest, this book made me laugh more than I have in a long time. Yet unfortunately those times of laughter were too far in between me wanting to put it down. I initially liked the hero but I began to strongly dislike him because of his attachment to the heroine. That's right... I said heroine. Emmaline got on my nerves. Too comic--too witty (if you want to call it that)and too ridiculous. I find it hard to believe that she wanted to get in this guy's pants but found him disgusting. If she was not his mate then I would have cheered for him to get rid of her. Instead he became very attached (a.k.a whooped)and I found it to be a weakness. I like sensitive alpha males, but these writers need to make sure that they build strong and intelligent heroines around these males. Also, the increasing comic aspects of the book are unbelievable. There is a such thing as too many jokes. I gave this book three stars because I can see how some readers may be attracted to this kind of writing. It is very close to Kenyon (now-- not when she first started her Dark Hunters when they were great but now when they are disturbing)."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I just finished this book and I must say I was highly disappointed. After I read the reviews, I rushed out and bought this book the very same day. The first four or five chapters were pretty good, especially when Lachlain first meets Emma, but after they leave for the Highlands it is not the same book. The main problem was I didn't like Emma. She wasn't nice to Lachlain at all. He is like a doormat. She walks all over him the whole book, except for the first couple of chapters. I don't know maybe it is just me, but I like for the heros in my books to be strong and not begging for forgiveness or walking on egg shells every other chapter. Also, during most of the book I knew more about how Lachlain felt for Emma, then how she felt about him. Chapter after chapter he went on and on about how perfect she was and how he adored her and how he would do anything for her.(gag)!! There just wasn't any feelings on her part until the very end of the book. So I do not recommend this book, unless you like weak male characters."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"He searched for his soul mate for a millenium before the vampire horde captured him in the catacombs below Paris. However, after a seemingly endless captivity, Lachlain MacRieve senses the scent of his Beloved One; this gives the leader of the Lykae Clan the incentive to escape, which he does.Lachlain's euporhoria turns into a rage when he realizes the irony that fate has wrought to him. His chosen mate is a hybred vampire-valkyrie, two natural enemies merged inside her soul and body. Even worse following his abduction of Emmaline, he realizes she lacks the strength of either species. Instead she behaves like a frightened rabbit, which Emmaline is as she has heard horror tales about the torture and violence employed by the Lykae. However as scared as she is, Emmaline finds courage in her attraction to her chief kidnapper Lachlain. Her fortitude makes him realize that his beloved has an inner strength few contain. As the soulmates fall in love in his remote Scottish castle, the vampire horde seek both of them at the same time her irate valkyrie relatives seek to liberate her.Romantic fantasy fans will appreciate the return to Cole's world (see the novella \\"The Warlord Wants Forever\\" in PLAYING EASY TO GET) as this character driven star-crossed lovers tale is so much fun to read. The action-packed story line plays out on three levels: the lead couple's seductively sexual encounter while falling in love in his castle; her Valkyrie aunt coming to her rescue; and the vampires wanting to kill him and abduct her for her different blood type. A HUNGER LIKE NO OTHER is a superb thriller that will allow NO REST FOR THE WICKED as this is a fast sensational read.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I completely enjoyed this new book.

Not knowing anything about Ms.Cole I went purely off the short amazon synopsis for the pre-sale of the book & thought it sounded mildly entertaining.It ended up being one of the 2 best books I've read this year. (The other being J.R. Wards Lover Eternal)In the style of Sherrilyn Kenyon or Ward, Ms. Cole gives us Lachlain an extremely aggressive, tortured, but ultimately lovable male who shocks us with his pain & actions in the first 3 pages. After 1200 years of life, the last 150 of which have been spent in constant torture, this werewolf king in Paris NEEDS his mate. He scents her high on the streets above him and must go to her. But when he finds Emmaline he's shocked to find that she is a vampire, the very species which has imprisoned him.Emmaline is just a co-ed from Tulane touring around Paris trying to find out who her mom & dad were. Yes, she is a vampire- or atleast partly one. She's also a Valkyrie and was raised by her warrior aunts. When the growling crazy guy tackles her on the streets of Paris she freaks! Who wouldn't? But he quickly forces her to experience steamy hot new adventures. Does she have Stolkholm Syndrome to be bonding with this shocking weirdo? Or are they destined to be together?

It's got everything you could ask for in a series- great characters (every character is distinctly different and every character is a joy to get to know), humor, good plots that build as each books comes out (and the plots are not redundant either), every interesting creature you can think of that is explained in a manner that is believable, and ROMANCE.

I was blown away by Kresley Cole. I the story sucked me in and I could barely put it down to go to bed. Since reading A Hunger Like No Other, I have read the rest of the Immortals After Dark Series, and have experienced the same thrill with each novel including my reluctance to put them down.Thank you Kresley Cole for reigniting a passion for reading!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I think you should read the prequel (The Warlord Wants Forever) before reading this book. Its a free novella but characters from that book are referred to in this one (which is typical of paranormal romance books). What I liked about this book is the focus on immortals - male or female. I am use to reading the male dominated series and their search to find love. This one tells their story pretty evenly from both perspectives. There is not a lot of detail at this point about they history of the different breeds but I hope Cole goes into it more later in the series. There is definitely love and romance, the sex so far has been pretty tame.I would recommend the series based on the 2 stories I have read so far and I look forward to reading more."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Do we deserve our own bit of porn? Yes we do ladies! The rest of the series frankly has better fighting-action and plot, but so far this one is by far the sexiest, in my opinion. If you're looking for page after page of steamy scenes this is the book for you (and me)!!!I checked this out from the library intending for a bit of reading before bed. I was literally up until 4am cause I couldn't put it down. I finished it the next day. I had just started the second book when I was spending the weekend with a visiting girlfriend. I suggested she just start A Hunger Like No Other... and the SAME EXACT thing happened! We were up until 4am reading our respective books.I have lots of respect for this author.. but not much for the person who picked the cover art. Clearly they haven't read the book, lol.&lt;3 for Kresley Cole!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This series was recommended to me by the same friends that recommended the Black Dagger Brotherhood books. I'd have to say that I really enjoyed it. I loved the struggle between Emma and Lachlain...her struggling with her developing feelings and him struggling with trying to make her \\"his\\". The world that Cole developed is quite interesting, and makes you eager to learn more about all the creatures of the Lore and how they all relate with one another. Fans of other vampire/paranormal romance will enjoy this read, no doubt."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I will be the first to admit that I am experiencing Twilight Saga withdrawal and was looking for a little Vampire Romance. I am an old school Anne Rice fan from the 90's and hadn't read much in this genre for awhile. Well, this series is no Twilight and is certainly for mature audiences. But, I enjoyed the book. I also think she is a funny writer. Half-way through the book, I looked the author up to see how she looked because her writing was so humorous and contemporary. I am glad I found this series. She definitely has a new fan."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Well I happen to love Kresely Cole books and so far this was my favorite.It is steamy and has just enough paranormal element to keep me intrigued.I love her large Scottish leading men and this one was a Lykae king as well. His innocent half vampire, half valkyrie heroine was just perfect for him. It's one a the best paranormal romances I've read."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is the first book in the series and in my opinion the best so far. Lachlain is the king of the Lykae who has been tortured almost to point of madness by vampires. Emmaline is the much sheltered daughter of a Valkyrie and an unknown vampire trying for a show of independence in Paris. Emma is gentle and easily frightened(in the beginning) and when she finds out Lachlain is her predestined mate she has reason to fear, for he hates all things vampire and with good reason. I can't express how much I LOVED this book. The storyline was intriguing and well written, the lead characters quickly pulled you into the story, you wanted to know what happened to them and cheered each new victory. This goes on my keep shelf!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I usually prefer historical romances, especially Regency & Georgian era, but there has been so much interest in paranormal romances that I've tried a sampling the past 6 months. In the past, I have not been a fan of vampires or sci fi but I did find two great authors: this author and the entire JR Ward series.The best part about this book was the fabulous attraction between the two main characters. And the author found a way to make the attraction palpable but also able to keep them apart in a believeable way.The other terrific talent this author possesses is great humorour dialogue. My favorite scene was when the heroine patiently explained why the hero (who has been locked away from hundreds of years) must wear a seatbelt in her car. He lets her drone on and on until he finally looks at her and says one word only: \\"Immortal.\\" I laughed until I cried!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This book is what I would term \\"high-quality\\" romance, bordering on light erotica. It certainly doesn't suffer for this; you keep reading, all right.And for about the first half of the book, it's because of the extreme sexual tension. But there is a plot to the book as well, and Cole has the good mind to wait until the reader isn't thoroughly distracted by the romantic subplot before setting it in full motion.But you don't buy paranormal romance covered by an image of tall, dark and handsome male about to take bloodred-nailed blonde for world-questioning depth, do you? Nah, didn't think so.But still the same, it's a rewarding book as far as the romance genre goes. I give no complaint to the world-building of this fertile universe, bound to be enriched and expanded throughout this series.The characters are very enjoyable. Tormented, dark male meets witty, young, blonde female. Nothing new, but Cole introduces enough twists in their character to make their banter and back-and-forth love-hate as believable as you get with a werewolf and vampire.My only major complaint goes to the fact that the action-of-the-not-hot-kind feels... forced, rushed. It's not a devastating flaw, and it's not even distracting -- but there is hardly time for villainry and tension to mount before the dramatic scene has ended.An enjoyable book that I'd recommend readily to fans of the genre."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"As not much of a paranormal romance reader, thought I'd read the reviews before settling on what to purchase.Did not regret investing in this book, and it won't be the last from the series for me to buy.Lot more adventurous of KC, and enjoyable.Liked how Em's character changed to become more of a fighter, and how Lachie supported that change. Would have liked to have seen more interaction between Lachie and Em's family - very funny, KC's wit shone through..."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Since there has been quite alot of people reviewing the book with vivid descripton's, this means I won't have too :-) I loved this book ! I have 2 types of books: the books I have read and just couldn't get in too or finish and then put on amazon to sell then there are my keeper's that I would read again and sit proudly in one of my many bookcases waiting to be picked up again. I am usually a slow reader, but I read this in a day, then I went to pick up the other two in the series. The characters are so well developed, I loved the tension between them, their world was so well writen. I never read anything about valkerie's in paranormal romance novels before,well not untill now. Kresley Cole will be on my auto buy list now, and I'm spreading the word to my friends, book club and customers ( I work in a bookstore )If you want a really amazing paranormal romance , pick this one....you will love it too!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Must read the last story in \\"Playing Easy To Get\\" first to catch the first character's (Myst) story if you like reading books in order. This writer has a great style of blending many different beings into one world with hard love and thrilling stories. Still reading this series but so far they've been a page turner!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I have never liked romace novels until now. Let me just say I now have a new genre of books to read, A Hunger Like No Other had me hooked from the first page, I read this book in 18hrs, only breaking for sleep.If your not really into romance novels, please read this one before you make up your mind.Ms.Cole you now have a new fan!Great Book."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is such a great book!! You can really feel the love between the characters...great relationship development!! Loved the heroine and the hero!!! If you plan to read this series you should start with the novella in \\"Playing Easy to Get,\\" just for chronologies sake although the stories are happening simultaneously at certain points. I'm not a fan of short stories, but that one is EXCELLENT, there is full character development and you don't feel cheated like in most short stories."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I read this book about 2 years ago after seeing this series compared to other paranormal series' I enjoy. After reading it, I had no desire to continue on with the rest of the books in the series. (Thank goodness on a whim I recently picked up the 2nd, No Rest for the Wicked - now I'm hooked). I just really didn't like the heroine and I found too many of the sex scenes forced (in more ways than one). It just didn't click for me at all. I realize (based on the reviews) I'm in the minority, but if you are like me and didn't care for this book give at least the 2nd in the series a try."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I feel like I will be one of the odd one out. I was spilt in the middle with this book.*****Lachlain I actually liked him, I know most reviewers who rated it one star thought he was too aggressive, I thought he was restrained for so long it's understandable his reaction, I think that is what the author was going for. Through out the book I began to really like Lachlain more and more because he just wanted his mate and to protect her.*****Emma she was very naive most of the time for me through out the book which annoyed me a bit but I applaud her for not wanting to be man handle by Lachlain. I also understand though that her being naive was apart of her up bringing and being sheltered and protected by her adoptive family.In a whole I liked the book and the plot. The scenery was amazing as they traveled a lot the moment they met, we were introduce to her family and protectors we assume will be in books to come or that has been written already, but some sections felt a little drawn out mostly between Lachlain and Emma, it made me frustrated, this is how it felt between them most of the time ( not their first encounter when Lachlain might have been aggressive) written below.Lachlain: Mines, I want youEmma & Lachlain: Kissing and touchingEmma: No, you promise not to touch me.Lachlain:I will have you soon etc.They did this communication back and forth, they had a very strong chemistry but the back and forth wore me out. Other than that it was a good story.***********************"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Admission: I have never read a romance novel before A Hunger Like No Other. I write myself (don't we all), and I read mostly things with cobwebs on'm. Faulkner, Dostoevsky, Handyman's Guide to the Cursed HomeOwner--you know, no modern fiction. But I've always been fascinated by the vampire myth, and it hasn't left me. Quite the opposite as I approach death myself. The dark world is darker around me, but this Kindle demanded to be fed, and I said, read some good vampire book, thriller. Stephen King is too wordy and not much there anymore. What to do? I scrounge around the net (like a lykae through a Valkyrie garbage dump), and I finally found this K. Cole who many said wrote interesting things. Well, god bless its little heart, the Kindle delivers up samples of the books it's offering, and I think that if a book can't start well and grab you, then screw it. I downloaded \\"A Hunger....\\" and it caught my interest. Try reading the beginning offered unto you, and you decide. My screenwriter side said immediately, this is very visual. That means movie or t.v. series. Why, you ask? Because it's a love story struck from the white marble of wildly improbable lovers, a world unseen by humans that coils around our reality, and a great gift for writing supremely erotic passages but staying within the bounds of eumpemistic altruistic good taste (and believe me, there's a lot of tasting going on between various creatures). Ms. Cole obvious realizes that even werewolves and vampire and strange critters from the halls of ancient pagan imaginations need to lick and suck and swat at shapely butt. Our author wraps quite a deep seated wildness around the cobwebs of darkdom, and it works! Plus she weaves the language of the modern world in with mythical creatures that seem would only exist outside the world. No, we are in the world, but this world of Ms. Coles is big enough for lots of furry, hot-bodied critters. I read Ms. Cole is married and has kids. I would imagine, that Ms. Cole has padded her bedroom with foot thick oaken walls, redolent with the scent of old blood and screams of pleasure kept from her kids. Her descriptions of love making and lust are so real and so accurate, that no imagination could have conjured them up without at least experiencing most of what ere she writes. And it goes to show yah, that even regular folks, walking around the mall may be incredible lovers and romantic as all get out, but we only can hope, huh?One more thing I admire about her book: she knew how to finish it. Usually, the hardest thing to do with a movie, book, play is to have a good ending. Beginnings are a dime a dozen. And working one's way through from the beginning is just labor, usually. But to have a coherent whole, and a day new mount of edible proportions (with a bit of incest hinted at) makes for some wild narrative directions and conclusions.If you want a sexy, strange, but vaguely familiar book to read with one's hand perched nearby, just in case--then read this one. You can hold a Kindle with one hand. I promise you. And so, in Florida, lives this blond housewife with her family, and her very lucky husband from in the depths of them all springs forth red hot writing, writhing, and wanton abandon. And lots of cool sword play and nasty ways of torurting vampires.... stuff I'd never thought of--the ramifications of being immortal and always being able to heal...... Ms. Cole coldly makes that the stuff of a level of Hell Dante's Virgil could never have stumbled across.Buy the thing. Read it. Emma, you hot little wench. Such a baby-doll of a vampire, but what a supremely carnal and sensual babe you became!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This book was an excellent read. While it seemed like it got off to a rough start, and Emma seemed a little... naive and ubelievably obedient to the shocking demands presented to her (i.e. getting naked and letting herself be touched by a complete stranger, allowing him to stay with her, etc...without argument) it progressed into an enjoyable story and the series only continued to get better. There are definitely more story lines presented to follow, and I encourage anyone to read the 2nd book and proceed from there! Once I got going with the series, I couldn't stop until I'd read them all!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Ahhh, this book is what started my current obsession with PNR novels. I was bored at work and so I looked up new things to read on Amazon. Read the chapter 1 teaser and was hooked.I love Lachlain and I love Emmaline. I thought both of their storylines were very authentic and honest. After I finished it I ran out and bought every Kresley Cole IAD book I could get my hot little hands on. That to me is a mark of a great story and an even greater author. After one book Kresley Cole had me chasing down the rest of the series at full price at B&N.; I even got Myst and Nikolai's book.She has created a fantastic world with AHLNO, one that I had never immersed myself in before and I'm loving it.I even like the cover."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I stumbled across this book at an airport bookstore.

So when we saw it only got a 4 1/2 star review we shook our heads furiously! (HOW DARE!) Anyway.... You must read this book!!It's about a vampire half breed that becomes coincedentally the mate a of a vampire hating Lykae (werewolf) and she soon learns to trust and love each him over many hard fought battles of her own and he learns to love who she is.CAUTION I repeat..

Please forgive the spelling"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This story put me in a good mood and eager for more. When I wasn't reading it, I was pleasantly thinking about it. I loved Lachlain's single-minded obsessive love for his one mate. I was surprised and delighted several times within the story. This is Book 2 in a series. It was good even though I had not read Book 1 before it. Book 1 is a short story within the anthology \\"Playing Easy To Get.\\"OTHER BOOKS:The author has more than a dozen books in this series \\"Immortals After Dark.\\" This book was my favorite.

I actually had to go out and buy the next one at the store because I couldn't wait for it to be shipped to me. If you like women who are, or become confident, in themselves and their own talents then read this book. It's a vampire/valkayrie and a werewolf love story that hits a more believable possibility for being around now. It balances the need we women have to feel protected with the ability we find in oursleves to protect those we love and how we want our partners to not only accept but love that. Finding that Emaline is not the weakling or monster she fears echoes many of the fears most women have of not being enough for those we love or being to selfish in what we want. Emaline finds, just as we all do, that real love wants us to be selfish and that gives us the courage to slay any demons in our paths.The sex scenes are hot and if your shy you may blush, but I have to say my husband didn't mind(:)) The storyline flows nicely and you even get glimpses of other stories that are to follow or happening along side.Hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This was a good book read it in 1.5 days. Couldn't seem to put it down. I have already order the 2nd book in the series. At the end of the books Emma is strong and knows what she wants. Lacklain (werewolf) all he knows is he must have Emma no matter what it takes. Over all great book."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"The best way to describe this book is a train wreck. The grammar is off, and even the spelling in some spots. If not for that, then the characters are very two-dimensional and predictable. The hunky wild werewolf that has a primal lust, and the demure blonde vampire that finds her fiery spark. It's all been done and rehashed a million times in series that involve both werewolves and vampires together.So, why so bad? Because it's so blatantly predictable! Not just the characters, but the plot devices can be seen a mile away before you even reach the chapters containing them. Also, the sex scenes that were written felt like I was reading a fourteen year old's fan-fiction story than anything that was actually published and part of a series of books. They were so over the top, it left little to the imagination and felt like the author was trying to push me into her own fantasy.Oh, did I mention how horrible the Scottish accent is written? Well, it's terrible. I have a bad pet peeve with anyone writing any sort of accent phonetically, and this just missed the bar half of the time that some dialogue points were just incomprehensible.Why did I continue reading if this book is so bad? Plain and simple: It was like watching a train wreck and I couldn't keep my eyes away. The story does flow well, and albeit being very predictable, it does carry us from point A to point B with a purpose. So, I must give credit where credit is due. The mashing of the mythos and lore wasn't bad, but not entirely believable. Regardless, this book is far from a best seller or anything to be taken seriously. I can't say how the series goes as I only read this book. But, this would be good for a light-hearted summer read or something to indulge while in the bath or while in bed."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"What a great vamp/werewolf romance! Full of witty lines, this book was such a joy to read. I highly recommend it! This is my first book by this author, but I going to look into her backlist of historical romances as well. I can't wait to see if this author spins sequals off this book."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Why is this book getting such high ratings? The prologue is great, I wanted to read more. Unfortunately, the rest of the novel can't compete. I was trying to find a new series after JR Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood; should have saved my money. The writing is amateur. The author jumps perspective multiple times a scene making for a disorienting read. The characters are generic and unlikable. He's tall, dark and brooding. She's fair, delicate and naive. What characters aren't these days? But that is all there is to either one of them. Personalities? Not so much. And I'm still not entirely sure what the plot is. I would hate to see the rough draft. Save your money and time, read something else."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Unfortunately I read the other two books in the series before breaking down to read this one. Although it was entertaining, it left much to be desired. Like another reviewer stated, \\"it took forever for them to have sex\\"--and while that it not a deal breaker in and of itself, their continuous starting and stopping was."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Although I found this book to be enjoyable, it did not require or engage my entire attention. I was able to read it at work between calls and was able to keep up with what was happening. This book to me seemed to drag at times and at other times moved along. I am not yet certain if it is going to stay in my collection or be passed on. I have not yet started the second book in the series although I will read it and have purchased the third book. It just did not reach out and grab me."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"The back of the book didn't sell me but I'd heard enough good things about it to give it a try. I'm glad I did.

This was just one long, dragged out will they won't they and I didn't really care if they ever would. I am not a big fan of the word 'shaft' and it appears far too many times in this book. Just for the record, being married to a Scot (albeit one who is not a werewolf like chap who has been burning for 150 years) I can confirm that they don't talk like the guy in the book.....who's name I have already forgotten. Fans of the BDB series would like this I'm sure (I thought that was just as bad), but if you fancy a good read, try Briggs, I Andrews, Mead or Frost. I've just recently read Chloe Neill and really enjoyed her books. This book was just bad."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I thought this book seemed promising but I was disturbed by the heroine's interraction with the hero. Essentially he kidnaps her and threatens her with rape. Gag. Not a scenario I expect to find in romance. Yeah I know he'd been tortured for centuries, but Yuck. I can't get into a romance novel with such a brutish thug for a hero. 1 star."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"After reading the fantastic reviews for this book I decided to order the first 4 books of this series. Although i can easily read a book this size in 1-3 days, I found myself struggling to finish it. The main guy Lachlain is a Lykae with a scottish accent which was extremely distracting to read. I couldn't hear that voice in my head and I found the style of talk with Emma and the other Valkyrie very cheesy. Emma seemed to have split personality jumping between wanting him and not wanting him only in the midst of a passionate scenes (which weren't that good either). The book also almost purely focuses on those two characters which makes for an even more boring read.It may be since I had just finished the black daggar brotherhood series that there was too much to compare as that series is fantastic. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because although I didn't enjoy it, at least I was able to finish it."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Nevermind the title- I almost didn't bother reading this because it sounded so over the top, but I can't tell you how glad I am I took the chance.This is the first full book in this series. I admit to not having read the short story that actually begins it! Ms. Cole has created a compelling world with many supernatural species and clever ways of bringing about fated romance.Although the romance side of things is somewhat predictable and at times cliche, it is actually more of a comfort than anything else. The characters can be ridiculous and fun and the romance starts of rocky (to say the least). Watching them work through seemingly monumental issues of birthrights, cultural disparities and prejudices is just downright fun. At times, it can feel like a guilty pleasure to read this book- and the ones that come next!In the end, the important thing to know about this book and the ones that follow is that they are very much like chocolate. Sinfully delicious, guilty pleasures. You have to read them!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is one of the best paranormal romance series EVER!

Nope, didn't happen. After the first chapter I was so hooked I skipped dinner and continued reading in one straight shot all the way through. There is so much going on in this book, but it is amazing. It has a sweet new twist on the whole mythological creature genre. It also has a bit of the Carpathian feel with the bonding and mating, but that's ok...it wasn't the same at all.

For me, at first this book have an exciting \\"hero in pursuit\\" kind of romance, which I adore the sensation. But sorry, after 3/4 of the book - the story is rather plain - without an interesting twist, and make me struggling to finish it.So for me the whole romance of this book is wonderful, however not \\"that\\" perfect or remarkable."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"If you've read some of the flames you know that she falls completely in love with him in the matter of days, that the whole story seems to be about him nearly raping her and somehow throughout that she somehow finds herself and he also falls in love with her in between insulting and maltreating her. That said, this author truly has a gift for writing and her characters developments are extremely well done without hindering the plot. So one does find it credible. Amazing I know! Try the sample, and yes the book is mostly like that (angry foreplay) however I enjoyed it. Not the most scintillating book but it does grab your interest and one is motivated in what happens next. What I disliked is the fact that it seemed as if she wanted to make a series and was setting the precursor for it in this book, but that's all (i.e. divergent romantic plot-lines). The story, or rather, the erotica-slash-filler content keeps you slightly curious, although that tapers off towards the end with outlandish occurrences. Not bad all in all though, and I don't regret reading it."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is the the second book in the series( first book is in an anthology tittled playing easy to get) and one of my favorites. if you like to laugh as much as you like passion and down right steamy sex senes, you will love this book.(as well as the series)a brief desciption of the story..lachlain is a lycke a.k.a werewolf who has been trapped and tortured for over a 100 yrs. when he smells his mate from his dungen, he breaks free to find her. only to realise she is one of his most hated enemies, a vampire.this book is fast paced, funny and very sexy, can't say enough about how much I love this series.

For me, this book has it all, engaging plot, a little mystery, action, wonderful characters and lots of really HOT romance. I really like the authors writing style, she manages to make this world come alive. I am SO happy there seem to be quite a few books in this series. I am looking forward to reading all of them.

(was a bit iffy on the ghost thing but it ended ok!)I love all of the characters. They have different qualities (both good and bad) and I can imagine them so clearly and feel a kind of connection to them. I believe that feeling only comes from great writing.Each book has a unique storyline but with a deeper backstory to embrace and more of the Lore being revealed. There's romance, action, adventure and a WHOLE lot of laughs.I think it's just a really good series and can't wait to read more."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I love her books and this series is not different!

A quick, easy, and entertaining read. On the third book in the series now. A Hunger Like No Other is my favorite so far."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Kresley Cole is a genuis. She manages to combine fabulous sex, with just the right recipe of romance, seduction, and virile alpha male behavior. She uses a long courtship of sorts to set it all set up right. She solves the feminist issue and modern romance by having both characters be powerful immortals in their own right. This is true of the whole series. Much to the shock of the men, the women are just as strong and powerful. This book establishes the series. I think each book gets better.In this novel, Lachlan a werewolf who has been tortured by vampires for over a hundred years \\"scents\\" Emmaline a half female vampire who happens to be his mate. He escapes to find her by ripping off his own chained leg. Werewolves mate for life and have an instant recognition of their mates. When he finds her, he doesn't know how to reconcile that his mate is his \\"enemy.\\" Hence, the source of tension for our poor besotted wolf. Emmaline as a half vampire in a coven of valkyries has been sheltered her whole life and hasn't even seen a real vamp. Hence, she spends the book trying to flee from Lachlan the big bad wolf who is torn between thinking she is satan-incarnate and the beautiful mate that fate made his. Makes for a great read."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Ordered this as an audio book and couldn't put it down. I plugged in a set of headphones and listen to it all day. LOVE this series, though I am upset that the audiobook editions end after 3. I am going to wait to get the 4th when it does finally come out on audio, its so worth the extra money to hear it. Great book and story line, love the characters as well. Must read if you like fantasy and romance."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed this book very much! The characters were lovable, and after they spent a couple days together I started to want them to be together.

If you liked Shades of Grey and you appreciate a good vampire/werewolf/witch book this is a great one to try!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"The energy of this novel! It's years after I first read this book and I still sit around thinking of how fun the trailer would be... option this whole series--get Joss and watch the millions roll in! This was the first novel I ever read that had the immediacy and diction of my every day interactions. Ms. Cole has stayed current linguistically speaking, enabling you to more closely relate to her non-human characters-- who seem all-too-human. Her multi-dimensional characterization is just one reason to enjoy these action-packed books."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Have read all of the books in this series, they are all amazing!

This book is in my list of top 5 favorites and that is saying something as I usually read a new book every week. The series as a whole is my top favorite Paranormal Romance Series. Buy this book, you won't be disappointed!! I have given this book out as a gift to many of my friends and have only heard glowing reviews back! I will continue to purchase any of Cole's work."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Ms. Cole's latest effort is \\"wildly\\" delicious and entertaining. She has taken the paranormal genre and created her very own legends and lore...filled with ultra entertaining characters.Emmaline is half vampire and half Valkyrie. She is known in her coven as Emma the timid. Her family is shocked when she decides she wants to travel to Paris alone to find out the truth about her father. While there she is attacked by a handsome, yummy, strong, yummy, scary...oh yes yummy man who scares the stuffing out of her. She is even more shocked to find out that in order to return to Louisiana she will have to help Lachlain MacRieve the leader of a Lykae Clan return to his home in Scotland. She'll do it believing she will be allowed to return home. She has no idea Lachlain is her forever mate and he has no plans on ever letting her get away.Lachlain has spent the last hundred and fifty years being tortured by the vampire Demestriu. He is slowly going mad and then...he scents his mate. He has been waiting an eternity to find her and he is not going to let her get away now. He is shocked and somewhat disgusted when he finds out his long awaited mate is half vampire. But despite this he can't keep himself from feeling things for the wee little Emma. She fires his blood and he will do what he must to keep her...even if it means to lie to her. Anything to get her home to Scotland where he will be able to keep her safe and protected when he goes to get revenge against Demestriu. But, life doesn't always go according to plan and wooing Emma is just one of those things. Will he be able to keep her safe and with him or will the vampire horde take away the one thing he needs to live?Lachlain and Emma are wonderfully constructed characters. These two are both strong likeable characters. Their conflict is entertaining as is their way of dealing with what they face. Emma is sassy and quick witted...Lachlain is patient and yummy. This is a great new series and I truly can't wait for the next installment. Ms. Cole has made her mark on the paranormal genre and is an author you need to add to your must read list!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Lachlain MacRieve is the King of all Lycans. For hundreds of years he's been waiting for his mate to appear. He knows that he will recognize her the moment he sees her, or scents her. However Lachlain never expects to find his mate is half vampire. Lycans and vampires have been at war for a long time and the King of the Vampires imprisoned and tortured Lachlain for over 100 years. So when Lachlain finally finds his mate, he can't accept the fact that his enemy will be his Queen.Emmaline's mother, Helen, was a Valkyrie. Before she died, Helen made arrangements to send Emmaline to her coven, with strict instructions to never let the vampires know of Emmaline's existence. On her first trip away from the coven, Emmaline is on a mission to discover information about her parents. She didn't bargain on meeting Lachlain. Before Emmaline knows what's happened, she finds herself captive to what appears to be an out-of-control Lycan.Lachlain forces Emmaline to travel with him to his clan's home in Scotland, where he is determined that she will accept her position as his mate. The more time they spend together, the more the passion builds between them. But once Emma's coven discovers that Lachlain has taken her, they wage an all out attack to bring her home. And just to make things worse, the vampires have discovered Emmaline's existence and are determined that Emmaline belongs with them. Can Lachlain fight all these opposing forces to keep his mate? As the emotion deepens between them, will Emmaline accept her place as Lachlain's Queen?A Hunger Like No Other surprised me! I've read Kresley Cole's historicals and certainly enjoyed them but with A Hunger Like No Other she surpasses her previous work. By turns sensual and laugh-out-loud funny, A Hunger Like No Other brings together the best of paranormal romance. Lachlain and Emmaline hooked me from page one. Filled with vampires, lycans, witches, valkyries and wraiths, you never know what's coming from one page to the next. Readers of Angela Knight and Christine Feehan will find what they are looking for here. E-book aficionados who are fans of Shelly Laurentson will definitely find A Hunger Like No Other right up their alley. I anxiously await the next installment from Kresley Cole in what I am sure will be a must-read series.MelissaReviewed for Joyfully ReviewedNOTE: After I read this book I realized that there was a prequel to this book in the anthology Playing Easy To Get. I read Kresely Cole's story in the anthology and highly recommend that readers also get Playing Easy To Get as they will also find Ms. Cole's addition to the anthology just as enjoyable as A Hunger Like No Other. It will certainly help set up Emma's story and explain away certain comments made by characters. You can't go wrong with these books!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Lachlain MacRieve is leader of the Lykae Clan. After enduring centuries of torture in catacombs beneath Paris by the vampire horde, he's finally found a reason to escape when he senses his destined mate nearby. When he finally holds her within his arms though, he's literally disgusted to find she herself is a vampire...and something else too. Intending to deal with the detestable female in due time, he cannot dismiss the eerie calming effect she begins to have on his long raging mind. Lachlain intends to have his revenge, and just maybe through their connection as mates, his little vampire will be able to help him focus.Emmaline Troy is tired of living under her very powerful family's shadow. She's taken a trip to Paris in a first step bid to win some independence. Dismissing the dire warnings of her family, she nevertheless regrets her behavior soon when she's taken prisoner by a mad Lykae. Not only is this deranged, too-sexy-for-words male making her life miserable, but the vampires, a race she's never had occasion to meet, is hunting her as well. Could it be her half Valkyrie nature they're after? Whatever the case may be, she's got plenty to deal with in terms of her captor, a frustrating, mesmerizing mess of a Lykae king who's all to ready to Kill her one minute and protect her the next. It's enough to make this vampire/Valkyrie hybrid more than a little mad, and more than a little leery of her heart.Now THIS is paranormal romance! Action, drama, suspense, wit and more intriguing supernatural beings than we can shake a broomstick at coalesce into one of the best paranormal romances ever. This is an amazing intro into a very promising series, one with plenty of well-rounded secondary characters to carry on what begins here. Lachlain is at once a rough, anti-hero alpha and achingly caring and sexy. He's very complex given the nature of his last several centuries and he couldn't be better complimented by Emma's sweet, yet not-so-biddable nature. She's weak in the beginning, yes, but morphs into a powerful, kick butt type the longer she interacts with our hero. She's smart, witty and possesses a timeless grace that others around her can only dream of possessing. Her family of Valkyries is very intriguing and I'm glad to see Cole keeping their stories coming as well. This is a very fresh, very consuming addition to the world of paranormal romance. Very much worth as many rereads as the book itself can handle. It's on to the second in the series next, No Rest for the Wicked and the third, Wicked Deeds on a Winter's Night, releases October 31, 2007."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I tried to read this one some time ago, and gave up, frustrated. So I gave it another go, and I liked it more, but still had some issues. In fact, I started off wanting to rate this one star, but after a second chance, and some thought, I'm going to give it three (more like three and a half stars).I'll start with what I liked.Once I got into it, I really did like the main romance a lot. The main characters do change a lot, learning to become who they need to be in order to survive together. They make a lot of mistakes along the way, and there are struggles, but that makes their romance all the more special. If it weren't for the distractions of all the other characters I think I would have rated this book much higher.The love scenes were imaginative, but the constant build-ups to sex only for something to happen to stop them - over and over again - became annoying. But the relationship was wonderful, with the oddest mix of caring, passion, hatred and desire. I loved that they were thrown together even though it's the last thing either wanted. I love that they found their way to each other.The twists and turns in the plot were great, and the final third of the book was really exciting...until the last few pages when the author turned cutesy on us and I wanted to groan.Now the bad.The side-story with the aunts is uninteresting and distracting, with far too many characters to either remember or care about. It was clearly the set-up for later books in the series, but I didn't enjoy being hit with all of them at once. And then right when the story became interesting again we'd be hit with an information dump.I think my biggest problem with the story is that I like paranormal romance to have some connection to the real world. My favourite books in this genre involve some characters who are human or strongly connected to humans. This series has so many different species - many of them hundreds or thousands of years old - so it felt more like a fairytale (albeit a very grown-up one!). I missed that link to humanity as we rushed from ancient Lykae to a Russian castle full of vampires and on and on.Every point in the story where the Valkyrie came in the feel of the book changed. It was so cutesy I was downright annoyed. In this genre you have to decide what kind of book you're writing. Either it's charming and quirky a la Charlaine Harris, or it's more serious. It can't be both.The American expressions (such as \`I could care less' - it's \`COULDN'T care less') were out of place, grating. And outside of North America the \`first floor' is known as the \`ground floor' - the \`first floor' is the first one up. Things like this should be researched. Non-Americans know the differences; there is no excuse for American writers not to know cultural differences. Additionally, the author generally worked hard to show us how it would be for a man who's had no exposure to society for a few hundred years, but there were times where she slipped up and had her hero too modernised.I did not enjoy the way all of the characters seemed to have connections to real icons. Helen of Troy, Dracula's Mina...everybody seemed to be somebody else. Once or twice it might be amusing, but more than that and it's just stupid.But, in the end, I did enjoy this book enough to keep reading in the series. It wasn't perfect, but there's something captivating about Kresley Cole's writing. She may not be up to the standard of Jeaniene Frost, but her books are a good choice for an entertaining read.Spoiler warning!Romance novels - of any kind - are notorious for their obsession with babies. This book annoyed me to no end, because it was PAINFULLY obvious from the first mention of Emma's infertility that she was going to find out by the end that she CAN have children. I hate this kind of thing. It's like in the horrendous Twilight series; Bella thinks she's sacrificing babies to be with Edward, but bang! - suddenly she has one. I hate a deus ex machina of any sort, and this certainly appears to be one.Another deus ex machina favourite is the heroine suddenly developing one skill after the other - whatever she needs to save the day, that day. Emmaline goes from one strength to the next, She doesn't learn anything, quite simply \`discovers' she can do these amazing things, at the exact moment she needs them for the plot to develop. It's frustrating to read."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Now comfortably organized among my favorite novels, I can't plug this title enough to friends and family who are fans of romance - paranormal or otherwise. Super hot page turner, it had me giggling within the first naughty (*ooo! naughty!) ten pages, and two days later I'm ready to pick it up again for the long weekend. This is one you hold on to and keep rereading.Thank you Kresley Cole! My tastes run more historical with romance genre rather than preternatural, and after my last fiasco into the category, I was ready to call a major time-out (see my reviews). However, this is as perfect as it gets - a super-charged attraction, endearingly flawed hero and heroine, compelling backdrop. You don't have to wait before it gets going. The tension starts on the first page and doesn't end until the end... ah, wonderful, wonderful cheese!He's the ancient werewolf king (of course, heh) recently escaped from a tortured imprisonment, and she's a recently-spawn half vampire / half valkyrie, but a compassionate wimp - a creature who can't bring herself to harm anything - even to nip enough blood to keep her healthy. Admirable, but worrisome. I've a penchant for the whole 'alpha-male / alpha-female / trouble ensues' and usually slink away from the 'weak, whining female stereotype,' because normally, I just want to slap them, but fragile Emmaline Troy has enough modern-style chutzpah to take on overbearing protagonist Lachlain on her own terms. On the streets of Paris, she's seeking the story of her unique lineage, and when he scents her deep within his horrifying confinement, he draws strength enough to break free in search of his one true mate (ahhh, me). Enter the conflict: vampires, werewolves and valkyrie tribes have been battling for countless centuries... the gods must hate them both. When he abducts her, the journey is a never-want-to-end romp of desperate desire, hilarity, property damage and ooooh, mature sexual content... mmmm mmmm good!Kresley Cole is able to masterfully mix the familiar with her own spawned lore, and throw in a few contemporary references to make you laugh out loud. She adeptly mixes IPods with primeval weaponry and nail polish with ancient customs. It's a smart book, well-written and an absolute keeper. The characterization is fully formed, locations lushly depicted, supporting characters quirky and interesting... and I'm sure I'm not the only one impatiently waiting to see which one stars in her next novel. You'll just love Emmaline's doddering valkyrie aunt Nix, and feel for Lachlain's friend Bowe's misery. Try not to double over in laughter when you learn who Emmaline's mom is. The boyfriend almost made me stop reading for fear I would choke myself with it. Poor guy, he had to sit so patiently when I was compelled to give him a play by play of the plot.Read this book, it's so entertaining. Warning: don't bring this as beach reading, you're likely to forget to turn before you get a serious sunburn. Get all the chores done, find a quiet spot indoors, turn ON the air conditioner and enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"After being unable to put down each of the three MacCarrick series books I raced to grab this too. But sadly there are so many things off in this book, I'm absolutely astounded by the rave reviews.Main Characters: Both are unbelievable and borderline cliche. Lachlain is your classic super hottie, powerful, werewolf king (thus making him also extremely wealthy), who is good at everything he does. For bonus \\"hot points\\" he's also a scottish werewolf because we love it when gravel-voiced men say things like, \\"Lass, I doona want you to leave, ken?\\" Well OK we do love that but lets keep it for Highlander books or other historicals where its reasonably germane to the plot and not just tacked on for fun. Supposedly he is tortured by the 150 years of pain he suffered at the hands of an evil vampire. Although frankly this barely surfaces other than as a somewhat weak basis for his poor behavior at the beginning of the book.His mate, Emma, is little better. She's a small wafish beauty who is gentle, sweet, and innocent. Although she also seems to prefer to dress an extremely provocative way that seems to go against the \\"sweet and innocent\\" description (the picture on the cover says it all - read leather S&M; ensemble?). She is supposed to be younger (a mere 70 years) and her only interests prior to traveling to Europe and meeting Lachlain were watching movies, her iPod, and regularly painting her toes. She never comes together as a plausible or interesting character.Mythology: So the main immortals are the vampires, the werewolves, and the valkyrie. They all have some concept of finding the ONE (though they go by different names) which brings out a huge passion and has the men using the word \\"MINE\\" a lot. Clearly Kresley is setting the stage for a long and lucrative series of romance novels here.However the Valkyrie were particularly frustrating. They are warrior women who live on electricity (instead of food). However they also seem to produce lightning whenever they're upset. Or they poop lightning, I couldn't quite figure out how that worked. They also seem prone to screeching and histrionics. When not screaming they also have a fondness for toenail polish, movies, and making popcorn which they don't eat but like throwing about like a hoard of 12 year old girls. Supposedly they are unearthly gorgeous although it was hard to anchor this fact alongside all the screeching and popcorn throwing.There is an enormous cast of background characters mentioned briefly and they clearly placeholders for future books. Every mention is a mildly annoying distraction - throwing out 1-2 leads for future books is acceptable (Ward heavily leverages this technique) but I felt like this book was planting the seeds for a 20 book series.Romance: As many have mentioned, their first encounter is unsettling in that it is borderline rape. Their next real encounter is when he marks her under the full moon. I think it was supposed to be a lusty romp in the woods but frankly it was too abrupt a turnaround for the innocent virginal girl who wanted nothing to do with him 5 minutes ago and now is rutting in the mud with wild abandon (I think she has like 18 orgasms, I lost count and started skimming at a certain point).JR Ward is flawed but I would recommend over this book. The MacCarrick trilogy is fantastic and I hope to see more from Kresley Cole!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"As far as vampires go, Emmaline Troy is a petite and timid half-breed. Guarded by her overprotective Valkyrie aunts, Emma has a strong aversion to pain and conflict and much prefers to study other Lore creatures. If cornered, her grand fight strategy is to run.As far as werewolves go, Lachlain MacRieve is a massive beast on the edge. The Lykae Clan's leader, it's been over a century since he disappeared into mindless torture, and the world has changed.Mortal enemies, vampires and Lykae aren't supposed to like each other, let alone fall in love. So when Lachlain is led to his mate, he's horrified to learn Emma's true nature. Emma isn't thrilled either, but at first, she's too intimidated to escape the warrior's grasp.While Emma is held captive at Lachlain's castle, all hell breaks loose at the Valkyrie coven where Emma's aunts live. Soon, it's more than her family that's threatened, and Emma must connect with her deeply buried strength and courage in order to save them all. If she's lucky, she might find the love of an immortal lifetime.In this dark and edgy romance, Cole has created a vivid story with characters that clutch the heart. This tale is about more than fighting evil creatures and falling in love. It's about betrayal, pain, forgiveness, passion, and coming of age.Some readers may be uncomfortable with the level of violence and explicit love scenes, but this is truly a tale that cannot be told without it. These events are catalysts for the changes that occur within the characters, and therefore worth the journey.Although a large cast is introduced, the secondary characters' unique personalities come to life without overshadowing the hero and heroine. This new series promises one fresh story after another with the wonderful assortment presented here.Definitely a recommended read for fans of paranormal romance.Reviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer5-11-2006"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"JR Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood \\"Lover\\" series got me hooked on paranormal romance. I've been on the look-out for anything that is even close to as good. I've tried Nalini Singh's psy-changeling series and although interesting, it's not in the same class as the brotherhood. After reading Cole's first two Immortal After Dark books....the first being the novella in the book Playing Easy to Get and now A Hunger Like No Other, I'm convinced that this series rivals the \\"Brotherhood\\" in it's intensity and appeal.This is a story about a Lykae king and his half vampire/half Valkyrie mate. Lachlain is the king who was imprisoned and tortured heavily by a vampire. He is in agony, chained to a wall in a fiery furnace like hell when he scents his mate. He amputates his own leg to escape and find her, only to find that she is a vampire...the same kind that imprisoned him and are his sworn enemies.Emma is none to pleased either when she is taken to his home and told that she was his mate. Their journey to Lachlain's home is laced with humor and sexy interactions as both try in vain to fight their growing attraction.I really like this world that Cole introduces us to. It's not difficult to understand like I've found Singh's to be, and I really like all the different aspects of the Lore and how they relate to each other. As in the first book, The Warlord takes a Bride, this book is speckled with fun secondary characters that would make great books of their own.No matter what, \\"A Hunger Like No Other\\" will remain a favorite. I loved the evolution of this relationship. What begins as disappointment and disillusionment with each other becomes \\"oh so much more\\" as they realize just how suited they are despite the seemingly unsurmountable odds they face.

He does the unthinkable to escape and track her down. But upon doing so, he is enraged to find that she is a vampire, a bloody leech! It hardly matters that Emmaline is half Valkyrie too. Yet she is the one, no question about it.Emmaline \\"Emma\\" Troy never knew her parents. She grew up with a coven of Valkyries at Val Hall Manor, just outside New Orleans. At the young age of seventy, Emma sets out to uncover the truth about her deceased parents - until a powerful Lykae claims her as his mate and forces her back to his ancestral Scottish castle. There, her fear of the Lykae, and their notorious dark desires, ebbs as Lachlain begins a slow, wicked seduction to mark her as his - forever!As the Valkyries prepare for war to get Emma back and Lachlain vows to never release her, there is another ancient evil searching for Emma. Will their desire deepen into a love that can bring a proud warrior to his knees and turn a gentle beauty into the fighter she was born to be?***** OMG! You have GOT to read this one! If I ever find this title in hardback I will not hesitate to buy it. I plan to search the book clubs immediately. But I simply had to spread the word about this enthralling series! Author Kresley Cole has created a world that DEMANDS another visit from readers. I was so engrossed in reading it that my husband asked if I had super glued my eyes to the pages. I can hardly wait until \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\" is released later this year. Do not worry, each title is a stand alone story. But the author will have her hands full to top this one. On a side note, my favorite secondary character is Nx. She is a soothsayer. Uh, excuse me, she is \\"predeterminationally abled\\". I look forward to seeing her again! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This book was recommended to me by the many people who thought her work in \\"Playing Easy to Get\\" was the best in the anthology. I've been leery of trying new paranormal romance books because the market seems to be flooded w/ a great deal of them that are not very good. I'm glad I tried this book however. This series will now be an auto-buy for me.With all the paranormal entities in this book, I'm surprised the author kept everything on track so that the reader wasn't inundated about this new world.The plot was set at a great pace. The love and sensuality was appropriate for the length of the book. The best feature of the plot however was the characterization.The hero is a werewolf who has been tortured for the last 500 years, and when he gets a whiff of his mate, he gets the strength to free himself to hunt for her. Since he's been dying and rebirthing for the last 500 years, it's understandable he's a little caveman and crazy like when he kidnaps his heroine.The heroine is a half Valkyrie & Vampire. She's been so intimidated by her Valkyrie aunts so long tha she has no self esteem and is a truly cowardly lion. Emma the Timid is what they call her. So many paranormals these days, the heroines are so strong, snarky, and independent, that Emmaline makes a nice change in flavor. I loved her character. The entire plot is paced so that she begins to peek out of her shell and grow a back bone. It's wonderful that Kresley Cole was able to make her heroine transition smoothly into a stronger and likeable character w/ insecurities instead of making her into an overnight superhero.Some people may be cringe from the near rape scenes in the beginning. But rest assured there was no rape in the book, in fact the true love scenes aren't until the mid 200 pages so this makes the connection between the heroine and the hero all the more realistic.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Since the plot has been so thoroughly summarized by other reviewers, I'll just go on to second all of the wonderful things that have been said about this book. It was electric from start to finish and I read it in only four hours. I literally could not put it down. Kresley Cole has created a world filled with vampires and werewolves, ghouls and demons, fairies and wraiths, but all of it is cohesive and all of it makes sense. In Lachlain MacRieve she has created a hero willing to go to any lengths to be with the woman to whom he is bound even breaking down all the barriers she has erected around herself to keep from falling in love. In Emmaline Troy she has created a likeable heroine who, though initially giving the appearance of being shy and unassertive, is actually strong and confident once she finds the life mate whose sole purpose it is to bring out the best in her. This is one of the best paranormal romances I've read this year and I cannot wait to get my hands on the second in the series, No Rest for the Wicked."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"With alomost all of my favorite Paranormal/Paranormal Romance authors letting me down with thier latest releases, Sherrilyn Kenyon and L.K. Hamilton being the biggest let downs, I was beginning the think the genre was on it's way out.Thank you Kresley Cole for restoring my faith! This was a huge breath of fresh air and brilliant writing. Her paranormal world is vast, interesting and filled with wonderful people you can't wait to know more about. Her Hero and Heroine are spot on! I can't thank KC enough for helping to keep the genre fresh are exciting while others are failing."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Ah! Great book. Looking at the cover art, I thought this book would be mostly sexual-based situations with a thin plot. Hey, I have no problem with that. But this book not only had great sex, but was CLEVER. There was an entire world created involving the Lore, the creatures humans think of only as myths. Cole created a world in which Vampires run PR to promote themselves as sinful and sexy while investing in Middle Eastern oil for long-term financial security. Werewolves (here, Lykae), lacking the same foresight, are depictd in human movies as vile, monstrous creatures. Everything in the book corresponds correctly with situations in the real world. It's fascinating to see the ways Cole has firmly placed the habits and situations of the ancient Lore creatures into modern life.The characterizations of the main characters are great. I cheered for Emma as she grew in strength and confidence. I smiled like a dope for a good half hour at blunt and slightly brutish Lachlain's fight to express his astounding sweetness. The secondary characters are also finally drawn. Emma's Valkyrie family is a collective of interesting, sympathetic creatures. The residents of Lacklain's Scottish estate are individuals with distinct personalities.All that and good sex with a minimum of morning-after awkwardness and pained regret. I was very impressed by this book and will be seeking more Kresley Cole works in the future."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is one of the most exciting sf/erotic/romance/horror books I've seen in a while. I'm constantly checking for the next in the series. Despite the potential to be stereotypes, vampire/valkyrie Emma and werewolf Lachlain are totally appealing and absolutely sexy together. The story is intricate, interesting, and funny!!! After being so disappointed by recent stuff by Hamilton, Feehan, and Kenyon, Kresley Cole is a breath of fresh air. More please!!!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I couldn't put this down. I can count on one hand the numer of times that has happened. I can't recommend this enough! Now I am wary about trying her other books, because how can they possibly match up?"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I love Kresley Cole books. It is no surprise that I took this book out of the library already loving the book. I am really into reading about Vampires and Werewolves so to have this and a Cole book, WOW!The story opens up in Paris where Emmaline is searching for information about her deceased parents. She is part Vampire and part Valkyrie. We are also introduced to Lachlain the main male character. He is in a Hell created by vampires. He is an immortal werewolf. He is searching for his soulmate. When he smells her, he decides that he must escape and go after her. Well, he amputates his own leg in order to catch her. Surprise, it turns out to be Emmaline.In the beginning, Lachlain comes off as abusive, a rapist, and filled with hatred. He torments poor Emmaline especially after finding out that she is a Vampire. The Vampires and Werewolves are extreme enemies. Emmaline has empathy for Lachlain. Don't ask me how when he treats her so horribly! However, she does fear him and calls him a monster. He begins to show a more gentle side after finding out how innocent and caring Emmaline is with him.I felt the ending was a bit rushed and the fact that she was able to fall in love with such a cruel character really incredulous. This is the reason that I gave it four stars. I do want to read the next book of this trilogy. I recommend this book, if you can take it out from the library."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Wow, this book is really, really hot....YUM, I love a good steamy paranormal romance that you just can't put down and I couldn't but this one down. The characters were great, the story like was great. I would rate it higher but I couldn't."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I just finished this book, after having read Wicked Deeds on a Winter's Night not too long ago. I was interested in the vampire angle in the Immortals after Dark series. (by the way, why is it called Immortals After Dark when it's only vampires that have to wait to be outside at night?) The book was only ok. The heavy petting that Lachlain forces on Emma the night they meet is a little too close to rape. Even if he feels she is his true mate, you would think he would have more consideration for her feelings and not push himself on her. Not hero worthy behavior.The author's attempts at humor grew old during the duration of the story. I guess giving a vampire a penchant for an iPod and earbuds is somehow amusing, and having a 1000 year old werewolf learn how to drive is supposed to be amusing. Let's not forget the uneaten popcorn. Fortunately the humor is not as snarky as Wicked Deeds. I guess Ms. Cole hadn't got in her groove yet. (Just a thought, why was Wicked Deeds on a Winter's Night entitled as such? They were in a Guatamelan jungle, where's the winter in that? I pictured snow. Was there any snow in that book, or was it just a cool title?)Another thing about this series that stands out is that in these two books definitely, and from the reviews I have read about her other 4 books in the Immortals series, is that the main goal of the book is for the male character to find his \\"wife.\\" Cole refers to these females as mate, bride, lover or whatever name the female takes, depending on the type of immortal group that male belongs to. Does Ms. Cole have a wheel that she spins to decide which group of the Lore she is going to write about? So for instance in book three it was another werewolf looking for his mate? Where in another book it was about a demon looking for his lover?If this were a stand alone book it might not be so bad, but as a series that focuses on everyone finding fated love over and over again it gets a little old.I'm just not sure about all those five star reviews."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"What do you get when you build a world in which vampires and valkyries, werewolves and nymphs are your central characters? You get Kresley Cole's Immortals After Dark series. Beginning with A Hunger Like No Other, Cole starts setting the foundation for a new realm of paranormal romance.A Hunger Like No Other is the story of Emmaline Troy, the product of a union between a vampire and a valkyrie, something pretty much thought of as impossible. Raised by her mother's kin, the valkyries of Val Hall, Emma sees herself as the weakest among them, always thinking of herself as \\"other\\". Until she is accosted while in Paris by a brutish Lykae. His name is Lachlain and he's been imprisoned by the vampires for the past fifteen decades. All that gave him the power to escape was scenting out his mate, and he's sure his mate is Emma. But can a crazed werewolf king and a timid half-breed ever love one another when their kind are enemies?All in all this was a very good book. Cole writes vividly and her world creation is well researched. Making an adventurous move she has steered away from the classic vampires versus werewolves format seen in many of today's paranormal stories. Instead her world is shaped with other creatures of myth, the valkyries being a truly original and entertaining addition. The relationship between Emma and Lachlain is a little Stockholm Syndrome-esque, but even Emma makes mention of it within the story. If you enjoy paranormals and like a lot of descriptive sexual content this book will certainly please. If \\"romantica\\" bothers you I would not suggest this one."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"A fun, interesting and sexy read, this book is definitely a keeper. Ms. Cole aptly combines romance, action and adventure in a compelling, detailed backdrop that seamlessly meshes the mythical with the contemporary. The main protagonists in this story, Lachlain and Emma, had interesting personalities from the start and grew more and more appealing as the story progressed. Their interactions were witty and smart, not to mention laced with sexual tension. This book certainly breathes new life into the supernatural romance genre.A side note: though reading its predecessor, \\"The Warlord Wants Forever\\" from the anthology novel \\"Playing Easy to Get\\" is not required to enjoy this amazing book, it would really enchance your overall experience if you did."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Absolutely the best book I've read in the past 2 years, it has great character developement, the personalities leap right of the page and the writing style sucks you in. I can't put the book down; every couple of months it begs a re-read."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"WOW! That pretty much sums up this book. This is one of those books that you can't put down, can't forget and will reread over and over again!! Kresley Cole worked her magic again when she told the story of Emmaline Troy a Vampire/Valkerie on a mission to find her father, and Lachlain MacRieve, the King of the Lyakes (basically werewolfs) who is also on a quest to search for his mate. But when he finds that the one person meant for him is Emma he is at first confused and repulsed (he was imprisoned by the King of the Vampires a couple of centuries ago and was senteced to a life of never ending pain by fire). But Lachlain is still fiercely attracted to Emma. And when he almost loses her to her vampire family he realizes that he cannot live without her. This story is soooooo sweet and fun and sexy!! And this is not my usual cup of tea, but I love it from the first moment I read the book and now I have also finished NO REST FOR THE WICKED (second installment) another truly wonderful story. I'm waiting with barely bated breath for the third installment, WICKED DEEDS ON A WINTER'S NIGHT. My moneys on this book! Please I beg you, do yourself a favor and read this book.

There we met Myst and her story with Nikolai and I HAD to read Emma story and it definitely was not a let down.Others here have written details on the book so I don't need to repeat them here, but I will say that the dialogue is believable, the characters and their love and their challenges seem real... the background stories of the Lore, the Horde and the different factions within them really rounded out the story. The love scenes were as intense as you would \\"expect\\" between a werewolf and a half vampire/half Valkyrie! I devoured the book in one sitting. No kidding! It was that good.I would encourage you to pick it up and make it a keeper on your shelf."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Torture of mythic proportions--like Tantalus from whom food is always just out of reach or Prometheus whose liver is devoured by an eagle during the day and regenerated each night so the torture can resume anew in the morning--Lachlain Mac Rieve, leader of the Lykae (werewolf) Clan, is being toruted by the vampire horde. Burned in an unquenchable fire, his body regenerates to allow unceasing torment. He's endured 150 years of this torture, kept sane by the hope of meeting his one true mate.The moment Lachlain scents Emmaline (Emma) Troy, he knows she's the one--his true mate. Unfortunately, Emma is half vampire. Can Lachlain reconcile his desire for his beautiful, sheltered mate with his need for revenge against the vampires?Kresley Cole's aptly named paranormal romance A Hunger like No Other pits prejudice, fear and loathing against fated love and desire. As Emma searches for the answers she needs to reconcile her vampiric half with her Valkyrie half, will she be able to overcome her prejudice against werewolves to accept her growing attraction for Lachlain? In the growing tensions that precede an all-out war in which Lykae, Valkryrie, and several different vampire factions all battle each other, Emma and Lachlain must fight nature and nurture to find a love that fulfills their destiny and satisfies A Hunger like No Other."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is my fist book by the author and I LOVED it!

The werewolf was tortured for 200 years in the catacombs of Paris by the crazy, evil vampires that want to rule the world. He finds his lady and brings her back to his place in Scotland basically to tempt her to stay since she doesn't know that she's his lifemate. Interesting tension emotionally and physically arises between these two at the beginning and throughout the drive to Scotland; they learn things about each other that ironically humanizes them in the other's eyes instead of being a monster. I know it's kind of hard to understand about the human and monster twist, it's not literal just a saying. If you like vampire stories you'll enjoy this story since it's another race of species intermingling in forbidden fruit instead of the usual twisted soul of a vampire reaching for the beautiful, light filled human girl that he can never have but oh so craves. Pardon my melodrama."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Being a fan of Paranomal Romance and ownly liking Christine Feehan, I thought I would try this author and this book.

If the rest of the series will be as well written as this one it will be a series worth purchasing. The story flows nicely and has a great ending, she brings all the loose ends together. This is the first in the \\"The Immortals After Dark Series\\". I hate it when you want to start reading a series and there's no way to tell which book is the first.

I felt the development and backstory was well-thought out. But when I finished the book, I knew I would never re-read it. It had a mary-sue/fanfiction after-taste with the very random video-watching scene. And there wasn't much depth to the conflict. Maybe it just needed more time in production or to have gone over one more proof-reader's desk.

Cole obviously did not have the same freedom for creativity for her historicals."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Having just finished reading the Black Dagger Brotherhood, I was searching for a new series to obsess over. I purchased this book because it appeared in my \\"Recommended for You\\" section and because the reviews were mostly positive. My first reaction when I finished this book was how could I get my money back and if the author would compensate me for the time I wasted reading this mindless dribble. There are several issues I have with this book that affected my ability to draw into it. First of which are the characters; there are waaaaaay too many of them and they are so underdeveloped that I couldn't form connections to any of them. Many of said characters, Cole doesn't give you any descriptive details to what they look like so I am left to my own imagination. Plus, I couldn't pronounce several of their names and just had to stumble my way through the majority of them. She also doesn't give you enough details about the main characters to draw you into them. I found most of the situations surrounding them to be confusing and poorly written. I was about 60% through the book before I really started to care about what was going on. The ending was predictable and I actually thought she made her character's sound stupid by not picking up on what I found to be completely obvious. I found Lachlain's character to be barbaric and her aunts completely overbearing. Emma's character is, as another reviewer so eloquently labeled her, \\"mousy.\\" She is not the heroine that I long to be and therefore I just couldn't get on board with her. The only part of the book that actually WAS worth reading is the scene in the woods where they make love for the first time. This book was a complete waste of time and money. If you're into supernatural romance, check out JR Ward and Keri Arthur. Both are amazing. Kresley Cole.........not so much."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"After reading Kresley Cole's novella in \\"Playing Easy to Get\\", I went directly to the bookstore to buy \\"A Hunger Like No Other\\". And yeah baby, it is good! (... just the cover is worth the buy all by itself; awesome, isn't it?) If you read the publishers' summary, you know what it's about: Lachlain MacRieve, king of the Lykae, was shackled in Paris' catacombs by the Vampires - mortal enemies of the Lykae - to be burned alive again and again. For 150 years he endures the pain and only when he finally smells his mate does he get the desperate strength to break through the chains. But when he puts his paws on Emmaline however, it's to discover that she's a cursed vampire; as he's still three quarter crazy from the last 150 years, he's much rougher on her than he should. As for Emmaline, half Vampire/half Valkyrie, despite being raised in a Valkyrie coven, she's not tough, and not brave either (her usual response to confrontation is flight). So Lachlain's harsh treatment does not to endear him to her.... despite the way he raises in her a desire she never (literally) felt.This book is Cool (no, the uppercase C is not a mistake) and the world Cole develops, with the intermingling Lore creatures and everything, gleeful; the posturing and reparties between the Valkyries, for example, are terminally hip. As for when Lachlain finally let go of his prejudice... yummy-yum! Also, the way Emmaline finally comes into her own make for good moments - even though it takes her a loooooong time to do it. In fact, and this is the only bad thing I have to say, the way the relationship between Lachlain and Emma goes (take-tow-steps-forward/take-two-steps-back) becomes annoying after a while..."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I don't have a lot to say good about this book other than the fact that the sexual tension kept me motivated to turn the page right up until the point where.... the vampire and the werewolf finally have sex. The book basically starts when the werewolf finds the vampire and recognizes her as his mate. They take a long road trip from Paris to Scotland and in the process, we are strung along as the MANY many near misses for actual sex happen again and again. When, about 3/4 into the book, they finally do have sex, you're left with two completely boring, uninteresting people who exist in a cliched and trite existence where nothing is fresh or new, everything is predictable and contrived. The plot is utterly simple, which in some cases can be a good thing, but in this case wasn't. Reading this story was like sitting down to a dinner of cold white rice and tepid water. I don't recommend it and as it turns out, the sexual tension and its lackluster resolution made me feel stupid for even bothering. So, skip it."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"It seems I'm in the minority but I just didn't think this book was all that good. Ordinarily I don't have to force myself to continue reading but I did this time.For one thing, the \\"eternal mate\\" concept has worn pretty thin. It seems like almost all of the \\"paranormal\\" writers out there feel the need to bond their hero/heroine in a choiceless, irresistible relationship. Personally I think it makes for a lazy author -- you don't have to work to get two people to like each other enough to stick together. It's a \\"life mate\\" thing so the hard part is over. Gets boring.Another thing with this book is the fact that neither the hero nor the heroine are particularly likeable. He's the werewolf king who's been tortured via vampires for a few centuries. So he's rough 'n tough and growls a lot. She's a half vampire half valkyrie who is a whimp on a good day. Of course the two of them are \\"mates\\" and 3/4 of the book is stretched to trying to maintain a sexual tension between them before they actually do the deed. Very unrealistic. Even the \\"he's old fashioned she's modern\\" theme is over done and trite. She plugs into her iPod, he wrecks keyboards with his inexperience. Yawn.The two stars are for the background characters who, although not much more than cardboard cutouts, are more interesting in a potential sort of way. Not an author whom I'd recommend when there are much better out there."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Thrift stores are goldmines for trashy romances, and the Salvation Army in Hudson, NY proved no different. I picked up a gem of a title (along with 9 fabulous clothing items). \\"A Hunger Like No Other\\" by Kresley Cole is about \\"a fierce werewolf [Lachlain] and a bewitching vampire [Emmaline]\\" (the latter actually half Vampire - half Valkyrie, raised by a posse of Valkyrie aunts in New Orleans).Aside from all the Valkyries talking like aging valley girls trying to be current (it would have been ok if just Emmaline was being all ditzy), and the frail innocent victim heroine character, I thoroughly enjoyed the book (lots of fun sexy passion), and even felt a little tuggy on the heart strings at times.The characters and dialogue were snappy, and there were more than the usual plot intricacies: battles between the vampires, werewolves, valkyries, witches, wraiths, trolls, fairies, ghouls, and demons replacing the standard societal machinations in period/romances. And there was a nice thread about Valkyries needing their freedom, even upon finding true love, and so the women were all strong independent types and often had separate homes from their partners. Yay for (free) love!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"cause I was left \\"starving\\" with this one. I only give this one 2 stars because it was just okay IMO. It started off really good, but once you start heading towards the middle of the story it gets kinda irritating. I didn't like that I could never really get a clear picture of what Lachlain looked liked, and there were alot of instances in this book where you get kinda confused about what is going on during a particular scene. It's like the dialog (the way it's written & how quickly the characters would respond to one another)confuses what's actually going on physically in a scene. Especially when there were more than one character involved in a scene. I found myself re-reading certain scenes just so I could get a clear view of what was actually taking place. So as far as that goes the story did not flow.There were a few interesting characters in this I will say. But Emmaline's Aunts, I did not like any of them they were so irritating! All around they just grated my nerves. Emmaline I liked, but even she had her moments when I wanted to pop her.. I did love Lachlain and his brother Garreth. I liked Demestriu as well. Even though Demestriu was suppose to be the big bad evil in this, I felt he was barely talked about, nothing really deep was revealed about him. Which was a grave disappointment. Especially when he's the one who held Lachlain captive for over a hundred and fifty years, and who he is concerning Emmaline.This one just did not do what it could have given that all the ingredients for making this one a great read were actually in the \\"receipe\\"."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"With the detailed outline of the book provided by other reviewer's, there is no need for mine.What I will say is, this book is a wonderful take on preternatural beings, their interaction and feelings about each other (talk about intolerence, jeez) and I loved it.I have read some of the reviews that comment on the intensity of their first meeting. Okay, so, Lachlain'a a bit 'testy' and his first impression wasn't all candy and flowers for Emma.#1. He's been chained and tortured daily for 150 years. (you don't want to be around me during that time of the month with no chocolate in the house.) He's due.#2 He's found his soulmate and discovered she's related to the captors. (in-laws, can't live with em, can't kill. Oh, wait, you can in books. Where's my pen and paper?)#3 He's been chained for 150 years, alone. (Hey, a guy gets 'anxious' after so long without a free hand to 'comfort' himself with.)#4 They guy gave up a leg to get to her. (Some women are so hard to please.)Emma and Lachlain prove that any couple of any 'race' can over come their family shortcomings and grow to love each other and their differences, teaching their families, along the way, to become more tolerant of each other.I can only hope that the series will continue and soon.This was my first book of Ms. Cole's and it will certainly not be the last."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"There are so many paranormal novels out on the shelves with each author putting their own spin to the world of vampires, lycanthropes, fairies and what have you. As this is a genre I enjoy, I thought I may as well get acquainted with Kresley Cole and delve into her world.Lachlain MacRieve has been imprisoned by his enemies for over a century. Trapped in the catacombs below Paris, he was virtually going mad until he catches a whiff of the one person he has waited centuries for - the one woman made for him alone. Using the last ounce of strength left in his battered body, he breaks free of the chains that have bound him and goes after his mate, only to discover that as cruelly as fate has let his mortal enemies capture him, so does it unkindly present him with the cruellest joke of all - a vampire for a mate! Yet mortal enemy or not, Lachlain will do anything in his power to convince his part-vampire mate that they are destined to be together.As the only one of her kind - a hybrid - Emmaline Troy has come to Paris in search of the truth about her parentage. Part vampire, part valkyrie, little does she know that life is about to get more complicated in the city of lights. For a woman who has been wrapped in cotton wool from the time of her birth, Emma finds herself knee deep in adventure and trouble merely days after meeting this arrogant stranger who claims to be her mate. Is Emma the timid ready for a life as queen of the Lykans? And what do the vampires want from her?A HUNGER LIKE NO OTHER was quite an enjoyable read though certainly not a book that made me go \\"wow!\\" after finishing it. The prologue gave me the impression that this was going to be a dark story, yet the pages that followed convinced me otherwise. Cole has woven pop culture and cheeky humor throughout the novel providing much amusement to the readers. Emma's Valkyrie aunts are a blast. And it is the humor, shallow as it was, that made me overlook the thin plot and inconsistencies. Unfortunately, I expected Lachlain to speak with a heavier brogue considering he has been imprisoned for a hundred and fifty years. Instead, we get a few \`naes' every so often and apart from his ignorance on modern technology, he spoke like any modern man you would meet on the street. This may be a minor quibble but I couldn't help but notice. Overall, Kresley Cole has blended a cocktail of relationship issues that Lachlain and Emma must overcome such as his resentment over the fact that she is half-vampire, the lies that he had to weave to get Emma to go to his ancestral home and, finally, Emma's insecurities. The way they prevail over these obstacles provided a nice ending to the story."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Lachlain is the long lost king of the Lykae Clan, taken captive by the Horde Vampire Clan for the last 150 years tortured endlessly in the fire pits below the city of Paris, France. Emma the Timid is the cherished, sheltered and protected half Vampire and half Valkyrie raised by her Valkyrie aunts. Emma has never seen another Vampire and certainly not one of those animalistic Lykae. Emma is in Paris looking for information on the father she never knew, Lachlain is chained to the fire below the city when he scents Emma and knows she's his mate. Lachlain severs his leg to escape the pits to get to his fated mate. Emma is alone and hungry in the city when an enraged beast grabs her and forces her to take him back to her hotel. Lachlain is enraged that fate would give him a vampire as his fated mate! He decides then and there he will make her pay for all the years that he was held captive by her kind. Will Emma the Timid's gentle nature tame the wild beast?In this book Emma really grows as a character going from Emma the Timid to Emma the King Killer. Throughout the book you watch as Emma develops a back bone and starts living up to both sides of her heritage. Using the training her aunts forced on that she never excelled at, no longer is Emma the Timid running from sword practice and avoiding conflict but a true Valkyrie in the flesh with silver in her eyes and passion in her heart. By the end of the book you kind of feel like a proud momma watching your little girl grow up and become a woman as she stands up not only to her fierce man but her exceedingly difficult aunts.Lachlain as a character I am somewhat torn. As a male that was tortured for 150 years I expected him to be more tortured in mind and spirit. I tend to like my \\"tortured\\" males to be more brittle and haunted in spirit except for a couple of rages he seems to keep it together better than you would expect of a man/beast that was kept in the pits of hell for over a century. As an overbearing over protective Lykae he plays the part perfectly. You can't help but like him and keep hoping he is able to win over Emma in his botched attempts to win her heart. Kresely Cole really helps you get into Lachlain's character while writing with the Scottish brogue. It is absolutely delicious!Overall this is a great read; there is plenty of action in and out of bedroom. You get to watch Emma grow as a women and Lachlain struggle not only to win Emma over but to acclimate to the 21st century that he has been thrust into, having never seen a TV or a car. You are introduced to new characters that you will be seeing in several books to come. And as always you find yourself laughing from Kresley Cole's humor. I love a book that can make both your heart race from the steamy passion and then turn around and make you laugh."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I have a used kindle and I discovered that this series was on it and decided to give it a try. I am now hooked! I am a new fan of this authors style for keeping you heated up and wanting more. Very well written.

This is the first book in this series I have read and I am eager to delve deeper into the Lore. I will not be reading them in order but I am told that it doesn't matter much. I loved the characters and although Emma was a little weak for my tastes, I still liked her as the female lead. My library didn't have the prequel to this story but as soon as it becomes available, I am curious to find out what the deal with Emma is. Her Valkrie family protected her so much and I want to find out why.

I love them! I can not wait to read the rest. I love the mixture of action and romance. I also love the fact that it is the man doing the pursuing in this story. I love the evolution of Emma from meek and mild to strong and determined. I enjoyed reading along watching her come to life. The same thing happens in reverse to Lachlain. He is wild and overbearing in the beginning, but he evolves into a caring and unselfish hero. All of the others characters and the greater story add to the excitement and make me want to keep reading to see what happens to everyone in the end.

This Emmaline is a small, ethereal half Valkyrie/half vampire, who somehow begins to soothe the fury burning within him.Sheltered Emmaline Troy finally sets out to uncover the truth about her deceased parents -- until a powerful Lykae claims her as his mate and forces her back to his ancestral Scottish castle. There, her fear of the Lykae -- and their notorious dark desires -- ebbs as he begins a slow, wicked seduction to sate her own dark cravings.Yet when an ancient evil from her past resurfaces, will their desire deepen into a love that can bring a proud warrior to his knees and turn a gentle beauty into the fighter she was born to be?Wow!!!!!!

Rating, yes. Reviews, noooo. Takes too much timefor me to complete them. The reason I'm doing this one is because I gotemotional. Another rule I broke. I don't do reviews emotional because myjudgement gets clouded. But after reading AHLNO for the n-th time, took moretime with the details, I just had to.If you don't know what paranormal romance is, do yourself a favor and don'tread this book.If paranormal romance is not a genre you appreciate, do yourself a favor anddon't read this book.If you don't feel comfortable with the idea of Immortals, Valkyries, Lykae,romance, endless fun, belly-holding humour, alpha males, scorchingly sensualscenes and witty lines, do yourself a favor and do not read this book.Because all of this and even more is what you 're gonna get with 'A HungerLike No Other'. And then you're gonna get stuck for good with the ImmortalsAfter Dark series that so far numbers 11 books. (I am so waiting for Lothaire'sbook...)Now, when it comes to the story, you can read the sum and excerpt everywhere.Lachlain king of the Lykae escapes his \\"prison\\" in Paris to answer the call ofhis Instinct and find his mate after she entered the premises. It's fate. Butfate's pairings don't mathematically equal to mutual love. The how and whys areinside the book. Now don't go and turn the first page if you're not ready. Wetalked about this.And be fairly warned. This book is hot. Fun. And addicting. You may feel alittle overwhelmed in the beginning having to adjust in this new world calledthe Lore. But really, it's not the theory of relativity you need to understand.Now if you're expecting to get infused in the depths of a world equivalent tothe 'Lord of the Rings', well, you'd better pick up 'Lord of the Rings' indeed.'A Hunger Like No Other' is meant to keep you company in a light, fun andraising-body-temperature way, not to answer your inner call ofpsyche-deciphering quest.That being said, 'A Hunger Like No Other' follows the short story of Myst theCoveted (in publishing) which can be found in \\"The Warlord Wants Forever\\", andofficially launches the \\"Immortals After Dark\\" series. In terms of the series'timeline, you're gonna find out that every installment is a part of a jigsawpuzzle. One completes another, with a different couple each time on thespotlights. (No, this is not urban fantasy either.) Some of the stories evenrun at the same time with the current event being the Accession. Again, don'tread the book if you want to whine about paranormal romance installments, it'sstarted getting old...Cole's writing is one of the best you're going to find out there on this genre,weaving a plot of romance around a persistant alpha male that will make yourtoes curl and a timid female that discovers the world -and herself- under hisministrations. The world of Lore, that is.The secondary characters are delicious and promise to show up in the next IADbooks, the lines are witty, the plot flows unrushed -I get headaches when abook spans over a large timeline just to prove its existence, and thankfullythis is not the case here- and it accelerates when it needs to accelerate. Intimes, you may feel the need to swoon, even if you're not the swooning type-I know I wasn't...So.

Her most recent stuff is better but that doesn't mean that I don't give two thumbs up to this one. Lachlan, after being tortured for 150 years scents his mate and will do anything to get her. Poor Emmaline is gentler than a fly but after meeting Lachlan she toughens up and becomes his Mate. Even killing a vampire in the process. It wasn't easy to make Emmaline fall for Lachlan though.

I will say her lust for him was one key part ;)"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I have read all Kresley Cole\`s books and all of them are 5 star reads.

I can't put it down because the character are so engaging."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is the story about Emma-a half Vampire,half Valkyrie innocent who gets abducted by Lachlain the king of the Lykae otherwise known as werewolves. Lachlain has just spent 150 years being tortured by the leader of the vampires and only when he senses his life mate nearby is he able to escape. Emma has left her family of Valkyries in New Orleans to travel to Paris to try and find her father who she has never met.She thinks Lachlain is a crazed madman. Lachlain is kind of crazy in the beginning due to the torture he has gone through. He doesn't tell her that she is his mate at first although he expects her to come with him to go back home to Scotland. He has a hard time with her vampire status as vampires are his enemy as should be expected after the torture he has endured. She is timid in the beginning (that changes) and has been sheltered her entire life. This is how their love story begins. There is lots of action in the later part of the book and some gore but mostly it was a sweet love story. The book was published in 2006 and is the start of a series. The price of a Kindle book this old should not be higher then what a discount store sells it for when it is first published in paperback. All of the books are priced like this and I really don't think it was good enough for me to want to pay that much for the rest of the books. There are just too many good Indy books out there for very reasonable prices and publishers should really start realizing this!Addendum: It's 5 days later and I just looked at the prices of these books again and the prices have come down. This is good news!Hope it stays that way!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"** spoiler alert ** EXCELENT READ! I absolutely loved this book, I am so hooked to this series. I have to say that I now have a new favorite author and this series is tied with my favorite series by J.R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood Series.Kresley Cole does a wonderful job with this romance and you fall in AWE and in love with all the characters. The story wraps around Emmaline Troy and Lachlain MacRieve's romance. The history of each of these characters is what makes this story so interesting.Emmaline, a half Valkyrie/half Vampire (Valkyrie is fey) has been raised by her Valkyrie Coven since her Valkyrie mother Helen died. The coven took her in and protected her from all the evil out in the world of the Lore - \\"those sentient creatures that are not human shall be united in one strata, coexisting with, yet secret from, man's.\\"The coven has protected Emmaline from all the dangers and has put such a fear in her about everything that she grown up to be so innoncent, loving, caring, but most of all scared to do anything. She is very nieve about her sexual feelings or even about sex, she doesn't even know what a vampire looks like even though her sisters of the coven have told her many stories of all the creatures in the Lore and who their enemies were. The sisters in the coven forced her to learn how to fight and protect herself since she is very small and not as strong as her sisters and other vampires and that the fact that she was scared of her own shadow. By the time she desides to do something on her own away from her sisters, she is 71 years old.Lachlain MacRieve, however has lead a different life and a lot longer life at that, such as 1200 years. Lachlain is the leader/King of the Lykae Clan (were-wolfs). Lachlain has been captured for 150 years by the evil bloodlusted vampire Demestriu - the vampire who killed all of his family but one other brother Garreth. Demestriu tortured Lachlain by putting him into the fires to burn over and over for eternity since he was immortal. The only thing that kept Lachlain alive was his will live and love to find his destin mate.Emma ends up going to Paris to get away, learn more about herself, and to find out more about her parents. She knows who her mother is but doesn't know who her father is. While Emma is in Paris walking around, she walks by a catacomb that she doesn't even know exist and her scent is carried down to debts where Lachlain is chained within the fires. Lachlain becomes even more inspired when he smells the scent and knows his mate is within reach, he has finally found her. Lachlain lets his were-wolf beast take over and he bust through the chains that hold him prisioner all except for one that is attached to his ankle, he is desperate to find his mate and get to her so he chews his ankle off and escapes his prision.A week later from following Emma's scent, Lachlain finds his mate and grabs her and forces her to take him to her home. Since Emma's home is not in Paris, she takes him to the hotel she is staying in. Lachlains foot has grown back but he is still healing and his leg is weak. While in the hotel, Lachlain tries to seduce his mate several times but she always finds away to keep him off. She doesn't know she is his mate. Lachlain tells her he needs her to take him to his home in Scotland. He has no money and doesn't know how the times has changed while he was kept captive so he ends up using her credit cards to buy himself clothes and rent a car for Emma to drive him to his home.Lachlain's enemies are all vampires, he had heard of a group of vampires who were not blood lusted led by Kristoff, the rightful king of the vampires but that was years ago. Lachlain knows Emma is a vampire but she is different, he doesn't know she is Valkyrie, she has pointed ears and seems scared of everything, she is not a fighter or a killer.While in Lachlains castle, he finally tells Emma that she is his mate but she is in denial for her feelings towards him even though she is extremely attracted to him for there as been several close calls to losing her virginity. Emma thinks about the Coven and all that they taught her about who their enemies were and knows that her sisters wouldn't like the fact that she is with a were-wolf and can not see how any type of relationship would work out between them. However, as the full moon approaches, Lachlain's desire gets stronger and he knows that if he doesn't claim her before then that his beast the were-wolf side will have her. The full moon arrives and the were-wolf finally has her and she finds that she wants him more and more and they make love under the moon until dawn. Emma now feels love toward him but is still scared of how her sisters will react.The sisters of the Coven (which by the way I love them all - they are so funny and they cracked me up with all their comments and the way they treated each other and how protective they are over Emma) - Annika, Emma's foster mother, Lucia, Regin, Cara, and Kaderin finally show up at Lachlains castle to get Emma and bring her home and to kill the were-wolf for keeping her away. They not only bust into the castle, but the evil vampires have followed them and they bust in behind them and then a fight is on. Emma realizes what her destiny is and she goes to one of the vampires and grabs his hand and then traces (disapear) to Demestriu's Lare - she finally realizes that Demestriu is her father and her destiny is to kill him because by drinking Lachlain's blood, she was able to see what all the torture Demestriu did to Lachlain by burning him in the fire for eternity. Now her goal is to kill her own father.When Demestriu and Emma finally come face to face with each other and Emma finally gets the answers she has always wondered about and why he never came for her, Demestriu tells her she is just another obsticle in the way for someone to use to get to the throne. By that statement alone, Emma tells him she is there to kill him. When Emma finally gets him down, he looks in her eyes and tells her how to kill him and how to keep him from coming back to life which was by cutting his head off, his waist and his legs and separating them. Demestriu tells her she is now \\"Emma the Unlikely...the killer of kings\\"In the end, Lachlain and Emma end up together and her Coven sisters finally accept their union along with accepting Myst (Valkyrie) and Wroth (Vampire).There was so much that happened, I couldn't put it all in but there are many things to look forward to finding out about hopefully in her next books in the series. For instance, they find out that Fury their Valkyrie sister is still alive, the sister that had been captured by Demestriu and chained beneath the ocean to drown over and over for eternity - I look forward to hearing of her rescue. Also, Lachlain's brother Garreth has found his mate which happens to be Lucia - so I look forward to reading about their romance.Also, the sisters tell Emma that she and Lachlain will eventually have children and I wonder if their children will be included into this series.Such a great and excelent story."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"...gawd I love this story. Emmaline Troy, half Vampire, half Valkyrie is in Paris researching information of her parents. She knows her mother is deceased..but knows nothing of her father. Hence, the search.Emmaline, even though a figure of the Lore, is a very gentle, timid and shy creature. She is fearful of just about everything and she wears her fear like a flag. She's unable to tell a lie suffering excruciating pain if she does. She is not courageous or fierce and she is never cruel. She's never accomplished anything grand in her young 70 years. All she's ever done is attend College in New Orleans.Lachlain is a Lykae werewolf who has been held prisoner by the Horde Vampires for 150 years. While imprisoned in the catacombs 3 miles below Paris, he \\"scents\\" his mate....Emmaline. The woman he's been seeking for a over a millinnia. He claws his way to freedom in his desperation to reach her, taking off his own leg in the process.Lachlain is King of the Lykae. He is arrogance personified. Even though he is ignorant of the new technologies of the modern world, nothing shakes his colossal arrogance - - and he teaches himself everything. He learns very quickly, reasoning out his own answers and deducing much as he soaks up knowledge. He is highly intelligent and without meaning to, he intimidates Emma.After escaping, he quickly finds Emma and even though she is half Vampire, he knows beyond any doubt that she is his true mate. However he doesn't tell her upon first meeting her (fearful she will flee)...and instead forces her to take him to his homeland of Scotland. He doesn't hide his disgust of her being a Vampire (he's killed thousands). But the longer he is with her, his Lykae instincts guide him and he begins to care for her. He begins to realize she is far from the typical vampire.I've read this story many times over the years, but have never written a review on it. I love this story just as much as the first time I've read it. When Emma is forced to take blood from Lachlain for her survival and then soon begins to experience and see his memories...I'm always amazed. How Ms. Cole thinks of these stories is absolutely fascinating.This HAWT paranormal romance is full of adventure and mystery as well as the political power struggles of each faction of the underworld Lore. I've read all of Ms. Cole's novels - - this particular story has always been one of my top favorites. The hilarious and humorous antics of the ferocious and graceful Valkyrie are to die for...and told in delicious detailed precision. They, of course, all have their own delightful personalities but as a collective...highly hilarious!This story lays out the foundation of ensuing stories...those of Myst and Russian General Nikolai Wroth, Kaderin The Coldhearted, on her amazing race (Hie) and whom she meets and falls in love with (Sebastian Wroth)..as well as Lucia and Garreth, Bowen and ??

Book 1 & 3 are my favorites. I suggest reading these in order. Begin with the short story introduction to the IAD world- the book is titled Warlock Wants Forever. (This is inside a double book titled \\"Playing easy to Get\\".Then pick up with \\"A hunger like no Other\\" I have read up to Lothaire and waiting for the release of The Dacians. I love the way the author keeps so many characters involved through-out the series. You get so in depth in all their stories and become so familar with all of them. The infamous Nucking Futs Nix is one of my favs. Shes a Nut alright. All of he books kept me laughing out loud, gawking at some of the unexpected actions and you can't beat the intense passion between these alpha males and their just as fiesty females! Highley recommend this entire series! You will never be bored and you may loose sleep and lack of interest in eating, or doing anything other than reading these books. Watch out for the withdrawals when you read the whole series and are spoiled on this author and her charaters. So much so that you don't want to read anything else.The only thing I dislike is having to pay full cover price for an electronic copy that i cant even share without difficulty or time contraints. Some books )these included) do not even have the option to share. I honestly could care less if a kindle edition is a hardback and am a little ticked off that would be taken in to consideration for pricing of the electronic download.All of these Reader companies need to drastically reduce the cost. Besides, going electronic is more environmentally friendly and reduce printing. So why are we paying full price?!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I really liked this book. It was a good start to the series.

I read this book in 7 hours; while i was home sick, and I didn't want to put it down."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I have discovered yet another great series! I've been told by my tweeps (that's twitter peeps for you non-twitter people out there) that the Immortals After Dark series is a must read. I decided I'd check it out since my tweeps have yet to recommend a book or series that sucks. A Hunger Like No Other was no exception.When I started reading A Hunger Like No Other, I wasn't sure if I was going to like Emma. Even though she's a vampire, Emma is very timid and non-confrontational. She's scared of her own shadow and I wasn't sure I would like a weak heroine. Especially one when she's going to have to go toe-to-toe with a thousand year old Lykae. Throughout the book, we see Emma come into her own and by the end she is no longer Emma the Timid.I found Lachlain to be a bit of a bully in the beginning. Lachlain escapes his prison and kidnaps Emma. When he discovers that his mate is a vampire - an enemy to his clan and to his kind - he treats her badly Emma is destined to be his mate and he does not want her to slip away. He has waited over 1,000 years for his one true mate and will do anything to keep her with him even if she is a vampire. Lachlain is very aggressive with Emma. He wants her to be his like yesterday. He almost forces her to have sex with him.But instead he makes her do other things that make Emma uncomfortable. He thinks that she's like all vampires - an aggressive, pathological killer. Imagine his surprise when he realizes that she's the exact opposite.I enjoyed the banter and dialogue between Lachlain and Emma. There is definitely a generational gap between them. Because he was imprisoned for so long, Lachlain is not up to speed with the 21st century. He has to learn the technology, the clothing and the language. The language barrier provided moments of levity throughout the book.\\"Her tone defensive, she said, \\"I'm immortal, too, usually, but if I get in a wreck and get knocked out till morning, that sun allergy card my aunts make me cart around won't do jack. Okay?\\"\\"I understood fifty percent of that,\\" he observed calmly.Emma and Lachlain are very sexy together. Emma tries to fight her attraction and who can blame her. She's been kidnapped, assaulted, insulted and bullied by a man who hates and kills vampires. But you can't fight destiny. Or a sexy Lykae with a Scottish brogue that'll make you cream your panties.\\"You're going tae make me come like this. If you doona stop...\\"A great cast of characters are introduced in A Hunger Like No Other. It made it a little difficult remembering who was who but by the end, I had it figured out. Hey, better late than never. Emma's aunts were a wild and weird bunch of characters that got on my nerves with their meddling. But they're her family, so you wouldn't expect anything less.A Hunger Like No Other is a great introduction to the Immortals After Dark series. There's also a novella that provides more background information. I didn't read the novella but was still able to follow the plot. I loved the mixture of mythology and lore. This is the first paranormal romance I've read that included Valkyries.This was a great read and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series. I would definitely recommend A Hunger Like No Other to fans of paranormal romance.Favorite quote:Emma:She shook his hand free. \\"How - old?\\"\\"Roughly twelve hundred years.\\"She gasped. \\"Do you know what \`robbing the cradle' means? I am almost seventy-one. This skeeves me out!\\""},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"So after reading this entire series out of order, I finally finished the first book, 'A Hunger Like No Other.' While I have my favorite books in the series (Dark Needs at Night's Edge, Kiss of a Demon King), and while being partial to Cole's vampires (oh, those Wroth brothers...) and the witches, I can't deny that Lachlain and Emma's story is fast-paced and high-octane page turner.I wish Cole had written these characters with a little more substance, instead of Lachlain being bent on hate and revenge and Emma going on and on about being babied by her family. No the ending wasn't surprising, but having more details leading up to the end would have definitely improved the story. What I love about this series is that whether or not the series is read in order, the reader can easily grasp the stories of all of these characters. I love that even though these storylines are repeated throughout the subsequent books (the Horde vs. Forbearer battle for power, Garreth and Lucia's story, the Wroths' history and stories of their Brides, etc.), it's never repeated in the same way twice as other authors are in the habit of. But reading 'A Hunger' first (or at least early on) really helps to put the Lore timeline into perspective. This also helps readers to really appreciate how much stronger this series is now. And I for one am grateful that the cheesy horror-erotica covers aren't used in the latest novels!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"My favorite romance authors are Diana Gabaldon, Stephanie Meyer (so far), and Jane Austen. I've now added Kresley Cole to that list, although she obviously takes the story further ;-) She doesn't use slang or fashion that dates the characters, unless it is a historical romance. Her historical romance accuracy has been brought up in comments, but I didn't find any errors distracting. The heroes sound like real men, whereas some authors write the hero in such a way that I can't tell the difference between him and the heroine. Her heroes don't seem to cross the line into being misogynists either. Her heroines are relatable, usually strong, and never painfully oblivious or dumb. Some of her books are better than others, but compared to other authors in this genre they are all worthy of 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Just started reading the Immortals After Dark series. So far so good. Can't wait to read the next book."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I really loved this book. The characters were great and clearly meant for each other, if not at the beginning. A real good read, I am definitely recommending it."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I'm writing this review much later than the other reviews. I started reading Kresley Cole two years ago and have read everything she's written. I picked up a different one out of order and quickly ordered the rest. There are very few books I will read repeatedly and this entire series is like that for me.She brings the supernatural/paranormal element to light in a new world. If such things truly existed, this is the world I envision them. It's reality extended. The humanity of the characters brings the series into the romantic category and then the super feats they can do are just bonus.Most surprising about the book? How funny it is! The whole series will make you laugh out loud and I can't say enough good things. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The author writes well and grabs your attention from the beginning of the book.There is no \\"lag\\" or boring parts in this book. I was enthralled from beginning to end and liked the personalchanges and developments the main characters made through out the book. All and all a great read and escape."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I know I am behind in the Immortals After Dark Series. It seems everyone has read this series but me. I questioned people if I should read this and they were surprised I hadn't read it already. They did recommend in starting with this book -- which is suppose to be the second book -- since it fits the timeline better. So I signed up for the reading challenge and started reading about the world created by Kresley Cole.I am having a little trouble writing this review though. I loved the characters of this book. Lachlain was amazing in his beastly and wild way. He knew what he wanted and he took it -- literally. While I didn't like some of the things he did to achieve his end goal of claiming his mate, I felt it brought out his personality and true nature. Emma was a timid and weak half vampire that was hurt when a fly died. I couldn't believe we were going to have to read about such a weak character paired with an amazing lead like Lachlain. When she finally started coming out of her shell though, it became amazing.I think the main problem I have with this book is the complicated world. There are many species and terms that I haven't been able to figure out yet. I still don't understand the big battle that is suppose to happen every few hundred years and the full ramifications that come with it. I did find to be curious about some of the secondary characters though. I looked around a little on the authors website and found that most of the secondary characters will have their own book.While I am not a huge fan as most, I think this series is one that you grow to love as the author brings us a new book. Hopefully I can share in the excitement as I read along to the other books in the series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsA Hunger Like No Other is book 2 in the Immortals After Dark series by Kresley Cole. A friend on Goodreads recommended that I actually read this book first and then read the book 1, The Warlord Wants Forever. I am quite anal about reading books in order but I do have a lot of trust in my Goodreads blogging buddies so I did read this one first.Right off let me tell you that A Hunger Like No Other reads as if it was the first book in the series. I was not lost at all nor do I think I missed out at all. I am going to read The Warlord Wants Forever next so I will share in my next review if I am still really positive that that I was okay to read this book first.So let me get what I didn't like off my chest first and then allow me to sing the praises of A Hunger Like No Other.One of the things that I do not like (and one of the reasons I avoid Paranormal or UF books) is that authors seem to think they have to create worlds and that are freakishly spelled and hard to pronounce. I hate trying to sound out words the entire time I am reading. Well I have to admit there was a touch of that in A Hunger Like No Other. Lykae and a few other character names did annoy me but I just learned to look passed them (even though I refer to Lykae as Lycra now). I guess there is just no such thing as a bad ass vampire named, Pete eh?The one other thing that kept me a bit frustrated was the lack of description about what the characters look like. I get that Lachlain turns into a werewolf (uhm kinda) but I don't get what he looks like. It is made clear that he doesn't look anything like what you and I traditionally think a werewolf looks like but I'll be damned if I have any clue of what he does look like. I am almost tempted to see if I can dig up some fan art.Here are some descriptions as it was explained in the story about what he looks like when he turns wolfy:Yes to fangs. No to fur and there are frequent mentions of paws and claws. His eyes turn blue. His body gets bigger, while the shape of his face changes to lupine. (he turns purple???) Then when Emma asks if he gets a snout he replies, \\"No. Not like you are thinking.\\" (So what does that mean?) And that my friends is a description of a his werewolf self. (did that even sound wolfish?)&lt;&lt;On blog I inserted a picture of the Disney fairies>>>As for the Valkyrie, (that is what is Emma is partially) I also don't have a clue what they look like other than they have pointed ears and that they are female. I have a pretty good idea of what Emma looks like but as for her full fledge Valkyrie aunts, I'm lost. I was thinking that they are short fairy creatures similar to what Disney created for Sleeping Beauty's guardians but later in the book Emma does say how beautiful all her aunts are so then it had me re-think. Anyone have any clue here what they look like?Now for the good stuff. The story was really good and it kept my eyes glued to the pages. It was a joy to read how weak and timid Emma was at the beginning and then how she grew into a bad-ass warrior woman. She made me proud.I also liked how the author kept the readers in check. I admit to getting increasingly frustrated with Emma not giving into Lachlain's desires until Kresley Cole reminded me (via Emma's POV) just how devious he had been with her. Then I wanted to high five Emma.There was a lot of future stories to build on from A Hunger Like No Other but the readers are not left on cliffhangers. I really liked that. I am always willing to invest into a series while it is still being written if the author leaves nice breadcrumbs to return but not have me cursing waiting for the next book to arrive. Kresley Cole got me on this first book and I am eager to continue.There are lots of steamy scenes but it does take until almost the end of the story for them to do \\"it\\". The build up and teasing is really amped up. So much so that I think this rating would the first time I granted a heat rating of four when the actual act itself was so late into the book.Teasers: self amputation, electric love, grabbing the headboard spindle so hard they disintegrate into dust, an odd way to make a father proud"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed the beginning of this book and the quirky relationship the two main characters Emmaline & Lachlain have. I think the author could have gone without all of the different species - it a bit hard to follow and they're mentioned without explanations which throws you off. Other than that the heated romance is worth picking the book up to read. Definitely a tow curly ladies!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Im not sure how this book has such a good rating. Other ratings online are more im tune with the quality of this book. While I did finish this book I found myself often bored and sometimes confused.

But now he has scented her, his mate, the one woman for him alone. I love the way he Loves Emma,(his Emmaline) With all of his revenge and hate for Vampire's, he could have done her great harm, but he did not. I like the way, the story was written, I went out and got the next book(No Rest for the Wicked)."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Leader of the werewolf clan, Lachlain MacRieve, has been kept a prisoner in the catacombs below Paris by the vampires.

He'd been searching so long for her and now he was so close.Emmaline Troy, part vampire and part fae, was in Paris to find out more about her parents. She knew who her mother was, but her father was nameless. She'd been sheltered all her life and wasn't prepared to meet Lachlain, who was handsome, yes, but seriously dangerous. He had tendencies of explosive anger and in the blink of an eye, could rip a room to pieces.On a romantic level, this was a heavenly read. I found some parts the book hard to believe, but that didn't extinguish my interest level. Another thing is I think if the reference (From the Book of Lore) had been place in front of the book, I'd have understood more at the beginning. But again, this didn't slow my reading down one bit.

All I can say is that Ms. Cole needs to keep on typing!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This author is in the group of my all time favorite authors. I love her stories, but this one is what started it all in my love for her characters. She has a way of drawing you into the story and getting you hooked and begging for the next one. I had came across it for so many days that the cover haunted me and made me curious. I could not put it down as much as i tried. Even once finished I have gone back and re-read the story, even though I had memorized it the first time. It is a wonderful story to start off on (though there is one that is before this one) and all the rest to date are as wonderful. I suggest it for any who like the supernatural world and like romance, but I do not advise it for people under the age of 16, that is my opinion."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I bought this book an a whim wanting to read something a little different than what I normally read and now I'm sad to say...I'm an addict. I absolutely love Lachlain as a character, and it's hard not to sympathize with him for what he went through. I've read books 1-3 so far (waiting for the others to be delivered) and I would have to say I rate my favorite as book 1 for sure, followed by 3 and then 2. For some reason, I find the interactions with the Lykae men much more enthralling, I think this is due to their volatile, extremely intense and devoted connection they have with their mates. Thank you Kresley Cole, keep em coming!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This book was a fun, fast read.

Boy was I wrong, Kresley Cole's Immortals After Dark series is addicting! A Hunger Like No Other is an amazingly good story and the humor was priceless !"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Ms Cole has created a unique paranormal world here and although it took me a bit to get into all her legends and lore I thoroughly enjoyed this sexy, witty and thrilling romance.Emmaline our heroine is half Vampire, half Valkyrie. She has been raised by her aunts in New Orleans but as the story begins she's in Paris searching for information about the father she never knew. Lachlain is a Lycan or werewolf who has been imprisoned and tortured by the evil Demestriu for the last 150 years. When he scents Emma somewhere on the streets above him he knows immediately that she is his mate and nothing will stop him from reaching her even if it means loosing a limb in order to escape.The initial meeting of our couple is quite erotic. Lachlain, almost crazy from the years of torture kidnaps Emma and then is somewhat shocked to realize that the mate he's waited so long for is in fact a Vampire and therefore his Clans natural enemy. Remarkably it is Emma who is able to soothe the tortured beast within him. Lachlain then forces Emma to travel to Scotland with him. The world has changed a lot in 150 years and of course he can't drive, never mind all the other technology. These scenes are hilarious as Lach attempts to catch up with the times by reading magazines and watching TV. Yet as the two get to know each other and the passion starts to build they were also very sensual. Emma is shy but clever and slightly goofy. Lachlain as her hopeful mate is patient, loving and grumpy with a great Scottish accent. Emmaline's character evolves throughout the story as she drinks blood from \`the source' regains her strength and discovers some new powers. Lachlain is continually at his wits end. Trying to please her but making a mess of things as he regularly lies about releasing her and is a little too alpha male.The ending was exciting, full of twists and very funny. With a cast of great secondary characters, you just never knew who was going to turn up next; lycans, witches, valkyries, shape shifters, demons, fey and wraiths... oh my. A glossary of lore has been included which helped me with Kresly Cole's incredible paranormal world and I look foreword to the next instalment in this unique series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I didn't like this series as much as the black dagger brotherhood series but every book is still well worth your time."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I couldn't read fast enough...the author does such a wonderful job with her characters...they are interesting and sexy!

Her entire IAD series is incredible but I must admit that this is my favorite of the series - Emma was a truly believable heroine. She grew from Emma the Timid to one of the best heroines I have had the pleasure of reading! Lachlain is just incredible - there is truly no other word to describe him! And, of course, Nucking Futs Nix - Omigod!!!You have to read this book :)"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Emmaline Troy is half vampire, half valkyrie: something that should not exist. Sheltered by her valkyrie aunts her entire life, Emma decides to step out of her comfort zone and leave home, looking for answers about her life halfway around the globe in Paris. Lachlain MacRieve, king of the Lykae (werewolf) clan, has been trapped literally in a living hell for a century and a half in the catacombs under Paris by his hated enemies, the vampires. When he scents his mate - for whom he has been waiting for nearly twelve centuries - nothing will stop him from getting to her and claiming her as his. Forever.I have several thoughts on this book. First, let me start with the cover image: it seems to be a little misleading, implying that he is the vampire about to bite her neck. Now that I have read the book, I realize that it is probably trying to be a portrayal of a pivotal scene in the book, but it was a slight shock to realize that the female was the bloodsucker in this novel. Now, on to my thoughts on the book itself.I like the author's unique take on the paranormal world - she names it the Lore - and each species' take on the idea of mates. Vampires have Brides, Lykae have mates, and even the Valkyrie believe in the idea of a one true love. I was not pleased with how the male MC dealt with claiming the female MC, but I understood it as fitted the character and his own history and prejudices - even if it did bother me while I read it. I'll be reading the next book in the series,No Rest for the Wicked (The Immortals After Dark, Book 2), and will see if the series is worth reading through. I hope it is.So, fans of romance involving vampires, werewolves, and creatures of myth: this book is for you."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This book is delicious! This is an addicting tale with all the supernatural creatures of the world.A great battle is in the midst between all the clans of the Lore. Vampires, Lykae (werewolves), witches, ghouls, and Valkyries, are all out to win over the other at all cost. However, Lachlain, the Lykae King escapes from being imprisoned and tortured by the vampires and begins the search of his one true love, the real battle begins when he finds her, Emma, half vampire and half Valkyrie.This is an exhilarating story on the challenges of when love is forbidden and what extremes have to be conquered to get to that happy ending."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Lachlain is the Lykae King, but for over a century he's been imprisoned and tortured by the Horde. Thoughts of vengeance has kept the slimmest grip on sanity for him, but only one thing will truly save him: finding his one true mate. When he scents her walking far above his underground prison he finally finds the strength and will to do the impossible and escape. Unfortunately, he finds that his mate is a vampire--and it was vampires he's been fighting and who had imprisoned him. He is also barely holding on to sanity, but he needs to make sure she is the one without scaring her away...Emmaline Troy is not a typical vampire. She's only half-vampire and she's been raised by Valkyries who are also enemies of vampires. All her life she's been timid and quiet, unable to even hurt a fly. She's in Paris to see if she can find out who her Vampire father was, but has been totally unsuccessful. Suddenly she's confronted by a crazy, animalistic Lycae who seems to have never seen cars or technology before--and one who hates vampires. He's gorgeous, however, but that doesn't quite inspire trust, particularly when he kidnaps her...Lachlain and Emma are somewhat star-crossed lovers, as neither of their clans like the other. Lykae also have one mate and they mate for life. Vampires have their Brides, but Valkeries do not have these special mates and Emma isn't at all sure about Lachlain, even after he's sure she's the one--and has to try to cope with her being a vampire (or half-vampire).I enjoyed the two main characters, although when Lachlain first goes after Emma there are overtones of forcing and molesting that bothered me a bit. I'm also not a fan of accents in dialog (Lachlain uses a lot of \\"dinna\\"s and \\"doona\\"s -- and I do love a Scots accent, I've had Scots boyfriend and have lived in Scotland, but these seemed so forced). I also don't really care for the nutty Nix or the crazy Valkyries. I should probably try to stay away from Cole's books with Scottish characters and with Nix in them, but this is sadly the second one I've read (people keep recommending them). I did enjoy the read, though. It was good to see Emma grow (although Lachlain being happy about her hitting him and dislocating his jaw is kinda sick). Lachlain, too is a decent character, able to get over his past and his prejudices in order to gain love."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Loved this book.

The chracaters were interesting and well described. The plot though flimsy at times was well established. I understood where she was going with it even though she strayed a little. I found the italizced phrases confusing at times because most of the time it was used for the characters for thought process but sometimes it was used for speaking out loud. There were words that the author used that were not properly defined. You were kind of left guessing on what it was or could be. Other then that it was a prety good book It was hot in places where it needed to be and serious when it should have been. I look forward to reading about some characters that were introduced in this book.Though I did find the 10 or so non main or supporting characters introduced that did not further the plot a waste. They could have been cut out and in their places could have been more character development for the 2 main characters and the 3-5 main supporting characters.This was a realy good start to the Immortals After Dark series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is the first book that I have read by this author. I loved it and can't wait to read the next book in the series. If you like reading books about handsome, preternatural men who meet their match in a woman, you might enjoy reading Karen Marie Moning, Sherrilyn Kenyon and Christine Feehan too. Here's an excerpt in my own words: Emma just got off the phone with her relatives after telling them that she wasn't coming home. After she hung up the phone and turned around, there stood Lachlain without even acting like he wasn't listening to her phone call. She asks him if he eavesdropped, he answers \\"Aye\\" and she nervously asks him if he learned anything new. He replies \\"Your accent's odd and you speak too quickly...But I did hear that you think me 'wildly handsome'\\". She glances away in embarrasment. He asks why she didn't tell her family what he is but she doesn't want them to worry. He asks \\"And knowing you are with a Lykae would worry them?\\" She answers \\"Of course it would. They've told me about you. About what you are.\\" He asks \\"And what am I?\\" For the first time since he'd taken her, she purposely met his gaze. \\"Deep down, you're a monster.\\" Want to know more? You gotta read the book!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This was a great story; a cover to cover read in one night. All of the characters are well developed but not to the point where they lose the thread of the story. Even though the idea of falling irrevocably in love with someone BEFORE you even know who they are is a bit creepy I still fell for the Hero, sexy, sexy SEXY even if more than a bit Tormented and Tortured. I cheered when the heroine popped Mr. Sexy in the jaw for \\"all the times she couldn't\\". This girl gives as good as she gets and her growth into a confidant woman is one of the best plot lines. I'm going to be sure to read the next installment...and the next."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Even though I am a vampire aficionado, even I am beginning to get tired of the many, many vampire romance novels out there. But I picked this one up anyway, because it sounded a little different - and it was! Kresley Cole does a good job differentiating her world and characters from the other paranormal romance settings out there. Her characters are interesting and unique and you soon begin to care. I look forward to seeing other books in this series!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Let me start off by saying that this is the first paranormal and the first paranormal romance book I have read, so my review is going to be shaded by that. You can think of this as a guy's first impression of the PNR world. Also, the reason I am reading this book is because a dear friend recommended it to me to start researching the world of paranormal creatures. With that out of the way, let's get to the review.A Hunger Like No Other has two characters I disliked a lot right from the start. Lachlain is the epitome of an alpha male, who thinks he is a gift to the world and women in particular. He is a Lykae (werewolf) leader who has been imprisoned in hellish conditions for 150 years by vampires, and escapes from there when he scents his true mate. Also, he is over 1,200 years old, just keep this in mind. I actually liked how the author described the pain and anguish that Lachlain had to face while being held there. What I did not understand was why he did not attempt to get out sooner, if he was in such pain that the only thing keeping him sane was thought of revenge. I think revenge is a huge motivator, which should have given him the incentive to break out. But ... moving on.Emmaline or Emma, who is the other main character in the book, is a vampire-valkyrie mix. This was something unique for me, and it was interesting to see how this mix gave her qualities from both. Emma is quite young when it comes to immortals, being only 70 years old, and is actually just starting to gain her feet in the world. Her Valkyrie aunts have coddled and protected her, and kept her away from the big bad world. This has left her timid, submissive and weak. She seems to be someone who cannot take care of herself, and she admits this herself, as she longs for the protection of her coven, her daily routine, and being given everything by her aunts without ever having to work for anything.The attitudes of both Emma and Lachlain shocked me. Lachlain manhandles Emma and nearly rapes her in public, then threatens her with \`dire' consequences and kidnaps her. This kind of torture does not end there, and there are numerous other situations where he comes really close to assaulting her and raping her. Emma, on the other hand, does not fight this one bit. She actually takes the \\"bad man\\" to her hotel room without putting up even a semblance if a fight, the reason being that she is really afraid of pain. Really?I do have to give Lachlain some benefit of the doubt. He was imprisoned by the vampires, and when he finds out that his one true mate is actually a vampire, I can imagine his reaction to the cruelty of fate. He also may not know how women are treated in the modern world. But, that is where this ends. The way he treats Emma like a sex-toy and after his realization that he actually likes her, as a possession, I found it to be quite disgusting. His attitude towards Emma changes when he realizes that she is actually part-Valkyrie, and he seems to feel a lot of remorse for what he has done to her, but he still continues to lie to her, and treat her as something he is entitled to, with no regard to Emma's feelings.But, enough about the characters. The story line could have been so interesting, but the book moves at such a slow pace that I wanted to quit reading a number of times. The only thing that stopped me was the friend who promised that the book gets much better towards the end. For about 80% of the book, we have to wade through the back and forth between Emma and Lachlain, as they go from captor and captive to actually liking each other. Can someone say \\"best ever example of Stockholm Syndrome\\"? Or maybe Emma is being practical, thinking that Lachlain is the best bet to protect her from the Vampires who seem to be interested in capturing her as well. I think the part where Lachlain actually saves her from being abducted by the vampires is the turning point of the book, where it starts getting somewhat interesting.Everything in the book feels hurried along, except for the part where Lachlain is treating Emma like thrash. One minute Emma is trying to escape from Lachlain, when BHAM! He mauls her, they have incredible sex where Emma climaxes innumerable times, and they fall deeply and madly in love. Is that what love is really about? Or is it the fact that Emma actually gets attuned to the fact of being Lachlain's mate? Or maybe it is Lachlain's blood which she drinks. I am thoroughly confused. After this point, Emma will do anything for Lachlain, including, going after his enemies all by herself.I have no clue why the book could not have had more action throughout the story. When the action does come, in the form of Vampires attacking our duo, it all seems to happen so quickly, that you could miss it if you skip a few pages in the book. It all happens in about 5% of the book. Here again, I have no clue what gets into Emma that changes her from being timid and powerless, to someone who can kill Lachlain's enemies. The book does not seem to have bad guys as such. They are referred to at numerous times, but they are not developed at all. I was left wanting to know more about the Vampire king, what and how he is as a character, why and how he had imprisoned Lachlain, what his relationship with Emma is, how the politics of the Vampire horde affects the world and who all the actors in this horde are. In fact, I was amazed that both the bad guys in the book go down without so much as a whimper, within a few pages. One minute they're there, next minute they are dead, even though before this, they have been alive for centuries. Few as in, maybe 5 pages are devoted to how the bad guys are finally taken down!In the end, I have to wonder. Do women really find such behaviour suitable, or even hot? Are they looking for men to degrade them, treat them like thrash, and to use them how they see fit? If not, why is it they find it ok if that happens to characters in a novel? How can they find a man who does this tolerable, no matter how hot he is or how well endowed? Is it that, wild, out-of-the-world sex is so important that they are willing to overlook the rest of the relationship?So, what redeemed this book from the one and two-star slush pile? For one, in the end I did believe that Lachlain could change for the better and that Emma could grow a spine to become a bit more powerful. Also, this is very early in the series and I think the author may be still developing the characters, especially Emma as I think she will play an extremely important role as the series progresses, what with her now being associated with three of the Lore's creatures. And finally, I actually liked how the book ended, with everyone ending up somewhat happy, or atleast pacified.Tell me ladies, do you like your male leads to be like Lachlain? Also, can someone recommend better books if I want to research the paranormal creatures in fiction today, besides sparkly vampires?"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"After reading all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to read this book and I was very disappointed. It is good but not great. For one thing the cover is misleading. He is not the vampire, she is. It started out great but seemed to loose the intensity as you got further into the book. Anyway, I have since read two other books in the series and they all seem to have the same formula and I found the heroines (and most of the female characters) barely likeable. Like I said, it was good but I do not see why everyone is so crazy about this book or the series."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"This is one of the best paranormal romances I've read in a while, actually, at the moment, I can't even think of a better one. I don't read these books looking for an incredibly sophisticated plot or well developed characters, I will settle for ok and good respectively, when it comes to those parameters, but it's gotta be hot. This book delivered, I'm satisfied, good job.The only reason I wouldn't give her 5 stars is that there is a drag at the end. I have noticed that ending these books without bringing on lame cuteness or being incredibly obvious is difficult, it's almost as if they can just chop off that last chapter, so I'm saving my 5 stars for the paranormal romance with a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"For those of you, who like a passionate story about love, you've probably just found what will be one of your favorite reads. The beginning is scary and forceful, but as the story progresses it ends up a very engaging tale of loyalty, compassion and true affection. The main heroine (Emaline) goes through a transformation that is seamless and natural. Very well written. With each page, you relate more and more to the major characters and the supporting ones are just as three dimensional and real. A very steamy and intelligent story"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"The story was so riveting, i was completely absorbed with the characters. Excellent read I only wish I started the series a lot sooner!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Lachlain MacRieve, King of the Lykae, has spent a thousand years searching for his one and only mate. He crosses numerous countries in hopes of eventually finding her until one day he's captured by the Vampire Horde. For the last 150 years, he's been held prisoner and tortured by Vampire King, Demestriu. Until one day he scents his mate and escapes the catacombs he's been imprisoned in, which happens to be below the streets of Paris.After many years of being protected and sheltered in a Valkyrie Coven compound, Emmaline Troy, half Valkyrie/half Vampire, has been living in Paris to uncover the truth about her deceased parents, most notably her father. After her mother passed away after child birth, Emma has been in the dark in regards to her Vampire side. To date, she's never even seen a full-blooded vampire.One day while strolling through the streets of Paris, Emma is chased by Lachlain and claims her as his mate. Thinking the only way he can protect and keep her safe, Lachlain then forces Emma to escort him back to his Scottish castle, Kinevane. Scared out of her wits, Emma agrees thinking she'll just bring the brut back to his home and make her way back home to Louisiana. Unbeknownst to her, Lachlain has made no plans of letting Emma go and will do anything to seduce and keep her by his side. Even if that means lying to her.Now what really got me excited about this book, aside from the fact that it's part of a highly popular series, is the hero with a tormented soul. I'll gladly admit that I'm a sucker for slightly damaged male book characters. There's just something about a man overcoming his own personal demons. It speaks highly of their courage and tenacity. As for our hero, Lachlain, I was expecting a little more tormented soul angst from him. I mean the man was locked away underneath the earth and left to basically burn in hell. You would think that he'd be a bit more mental after escaping but it turns out the dude was just really horny. There were moments he'd let the beast out but I was looking for a little more meat in his mental anguish. I was thinking of something in the same lines as Zsadist from Lover Awakened. I mean that guy was really messed up and everyone around him knew it.As for our heroine, Emma, I quite liked her. At the beginning she's a bit oblivious to some of her fellow Lore species but that's mainly due to her upbringing from her adoptive family. She had a few humorous moments and I liked that even though she was virginal she knew just how to tease and drive Lachlain's labido into overdrive. Coming from a Valkryie Coven I was expecting her to be a little more formidable but nicknamed Emma the Timid, she was a bit lacking in the kick-a** department. She does grow throughout the story, so I was grateful Cole didn't give us a damsel in distress throughout the book. One characteristic about the Valkryie's that I found jokey was their love for shopping and how they could be easily swayed by gifts. I mean seriously, what girl doesn't love shopping or getting new baubles? Sounds like my kind of gang but for the most part everyone else in the coven is pretty darn scary.As for the romance there were a few moments in the story where I just didn't find romantic. Lachlain's heated lust for Emma was a bit petrifying and I was put off a bit. I usually get chills when men make their claim but with Lachlain it was just a bit too primal and possesive, border lining crazy bafoon. But once he eased up a bit, you discover that he's just a big and warm hearted guy that has been waiting a VERY long time for his mate. It's those moments you see him longing for his mystery woman that really clench your heart and make you forgive his absurd actions."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Lachlain, an immortal tortured for fifteen decades by the fires of the catacomb underneath Paris, scents the mate he's been waiting for over thousand years giving him the strength to free himself from the chains the vampires tied him into the fire with. But before he surfaces she's already gone, but her scent lingers and he will find her.Emma the Timid, raised by her Valkyrie aunts in the bayou near New Orleans is half-vampire from her father's side, half-Valkyrie from her mother's side. In Paris she tries desperately to find information on her mother and father, especially her father who she knows nothing about, not even his identity. When suddenly a tall dark dangerous man captures her, growls and wants her - in a way she's never witnessed before. She's not called Emma the Timid without a reason, dead afraid of pain and death she doesn't but up a whole lot of fight as it turns out Lachlain is a werewolf, bossy as hell enemy of both Valkyries and Vampires, kidnaps her and forces her to go to Scotland with him.Lachlain is so much fun to read, he's primal, rough, bossy and gets exactly what he wants except for Emma who wants absolutely nothing to do with him. He's waited for her for thousand year and she says, No. Never once he entertains the idea of letting her go, even though she's a vampire hence everything he hates and despises, no she's going to be his for the rest of his life wither she wants to or not. Which is sexy as hell! Sorry, that just had to come out. ;)Emma finally gathers courage she's been missing the seventy years she's been around, seeing her courage rise as Lachlain bullies her makes the character grow on you, even being timid she grows a lot during the novel and becomes more and more likable... and a match for Lachlain.I haven't read a book lately as sexy, steamy and delicious as this even though there isn't more than one or two actual sex scenes in the book - but there is a lot of teasing, almost and frustration, a yummy yummy book!Cole's story is wonderful, it has depth where it needs it, laughter to keep it light, danger creeping up closer and closer to Emma for threat, teasing until the reader is rooting for the couple to get it on and a plot with enough character drama to feed the story of Emmaline and Lachlain and the wickedly fun Valkyrie aunts! I'm addicted to the Immortals After Dark series! And to Lachlain. ;)I like the second cover much better than the first, even my husband asked if she's a hooker as he saw me reading the first cover version (where she is dressed like a hooker in the red leather top). So props for coming up with a better cover!

I purchased it because of the high ratings, but it was a lot more than I expected. The heroine is witty and relatable and the hero is right out of my dreams.

It was a wonderful adventure and I couldn't wait to get to the next book to see what was going to happen. The characters were well developed, interesting, and remarkable characters. I hated to get to the end of the series and the only bad thing is that it seems like the author lost her steam and didn't know where to go with it in the last book. I suppose that was why there hasn't been another book. I feel kinda like I'm hanging to see what happens. Really loved the series and it was worth it to read the other books."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I want to slap myself silly for not reading this novel earlier in the past. I recommend this author to any one looking for a new series for a paranormal romance. This is author that knows how to write a heroine. Although the main heroine is stereotypically the vestal virgin during the course of the novel her awareness of her confidence as a woman, her blossoming petals of her sexuality, turns her into a femme fatale Xena warrior modern heroine. And did I forget to mention the mouth watering, handsome, dominant, caveman, Scottish Highlander Lachlain? What I loved about this novel was the authors ability to incorporate romance, sex, action, action scenes, blood, gore, torture, high maintenance women, and did I mention comedy all in one novel. I strongly urge all new readers of paranormal romance to read this book by this author it was fantastic!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"I LOVED this book! I loved that both characters didn't fall for each other right away. Yes they were intrigued by each other but it wasn't love at first sight.Great read! Hot, had some cute one-liners, I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Cole's IAD series is probably the best, or one of the best, paranormal romance series currently being published. She generally manages to deftly balance: action; intrigue; dialogue; otherworld building; character and love relationship development; likable independent-minded female leads; and dangerous but protective, sexy alpha-males; and most importantly--hot, sensual (but tastefully written) sex. I read this first novel in the series last summer after years of avoiding romance novels due to tedious formulaic plots, predictable and flat characters and generally weak writing. The HBO series _True Blood_ sparked a renewed interest in the romance genre so I read the Charlaine Harris \\"Sookie Stackhouse\\" books during the channel's off-season, but those novels have weakened as the series has progressed. Happily though, discontent with those books led me to Cole's work.This first full length novel of the \\"Immortals After Dark\\" series is preceded by a novella, _What a Warlord Wants_, published in the anthology _Playing Easy to Get_, which is worth reading. In _A Hunger Like No Other_, the intensity of the passion the alpha male werewolf Lachlain feels for his fated mate, the initially timid half-vampire, half-Valkyrie Emma, is hot, hot, hot. What woman doesn't want to be desired like that? I read the book twice during one weekend, something I never did with the Harris books. Only troubling aspect of this first novel is the slightly forced feel of Lachlain's Scottish accent (Cole has a trilogy, a historical romance series set in Scotland which is a recommended read, but suffers from the accent issues too). Similar in pacing to J.R. Ward's \\"Black Dagger Brotherhood\\" books, Cole's novels--happily for this reader--avoid endless scenes told from the creepy-evil-bad-guys-perspective, instead devoting that time to the development of the central characters' feelings for each other, which make the romance satisfying and believable, rather than scripted and formulaic. Like in Ward's BDB series, each IAD book resolves the love story of one couple, allowing the reader to enjoy that HEA ending, and still eager to read the next couple's story.An overarching build-up to a mythic war between immortals links the books, as does the appearance of related characters in each books. We are teased into wanting to see the next story which tells of another couple falling in love, and it's a pleasure to meet up again with those who've we've already seen fall in love in previous books, as they return to be secondary couples in subsequent books. Increasingly, the couples actions are playing a role in the evolving political mess. For that reason, it's best to read the books in order. Kresley Cole's web site has the books listed in the correct order.If a reader hates cliff-hangers determined to lure her into buying the next book in the series, like I do, she'll enjoy the satisfaction Cole delivers in each individual book's resolution, while still hooking her into wanting to read the next of the series. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)","review":"Call this Twilight for Grownups ;) I've been a vampire fan for as long as I can remember, and read everything from Anne Rice to Charlaine Harris. While in between waiting for another installment of Sookie Stackhouse, I happened upon this IAD series, which already had rave reviews. Several books later, I still can't get enough of this engrossing world that Kresley Cole has created! Don't judge this book by its category. Yes, it is paranormal romance, but it is also so much more. I love the character development, the dynamic universe, the intertwining story lines, and how everything just seamlessly comes together, book after book. Kresley Cole, you've created something magical here!This is the first book in the series, which honestly does start out a little awkward. I was a little weirded out at first, but I am so glad I continued on, through the bumpy beginnings. After getting through the first few chapters, you really start to get a feel for what is going on, and what this world is all about; everything just blossoms from there. After finishing this first book, I immediately downloaded the rest. Thank goodness for instant delivery to my Kindle app ;)Ms. Cole, please keep the IAD books coming!"},{"Title":"The Lost Thoughts of Soldiers","review":"Short, intense, incandescent, brooding, mysterious and brilliant. Falconer had given us a heavy meditation on the true value of life and mtyh, the enduring power of love and the equations that govern destiny. The story of Frederick W. Benteen, survior (peerhaps by proxy) of the Battle of Little Bighorn and his struggle to honour, in his own mind and to that of a public craving myth, the memory of those who died - both of the 7th Cavalry and the Indians whom they pursued and slaughtered is slow, at time lugubrious, but frequently leavened with a rough humour which contrasts with Falconer's flightly, elliptical and highly poetic story-telling - yet still it is perfectly rounded and timeless to read - ending where, and on the note which, it shouldBut this is more than story telling. Like the \\"Service of Clouds\\" this is a book you let wash over you, you let enchant you, you let transport you to the crepuscular dimness of the final corners of a obtuse and oblique man's life. This slim book is and is of a world unto itself.Falconer is a wonderful, wonderful writer. \\"The Service of Clouds\\" is the best book I have read in the last ten years, and \\"The Lost Thoughts of Soldiers\\" is a worthy and powerful work which, even in the mighty shadow of her previous book, did not disappoint me. In fact, it filled me up."},{"Title":"The Lost Thoughts of Soldiers","review":"More than twenty years after the end of the Civil War, Custer is a hero while Captain Frederick Benteen - the man who infamously saved the remnants of the Seventh Cavalry at Little Bighorn - has never been forgiven for presumably disobeying orders and thereby surviving. Now Benteen receives a letter from an ambitious youth offering to restore his reputation by telling the \\"true story\\" of what happened. As Benteen ponders the possibility one morning at home, he's drawn back into the past and an exploration of his life and self ... \\"He moves indirectly\\" are the first words of this novel. They physically describe the central character, Benteen, but they're also an apt announcement of Falconer's narrative choice. She follows the pattern of memory, moving in and out of her character's past in short fragments, exploring connections that might not seem initially obvious but which are, in the end, the only stuff of which our mental lives and identities are actually composed. This is one of those rare novels in which the author's poetic choices are entirely appropriate to the type of story she wants to tell. Indeed, this is a work of immense precision. The language is nothing less than exquisite; the novel is a collection of beautiful miniatures that keep you engrossed despite the absence of immediately discernable plot. I suspect, however, that this beautiful novel is destined to be ignored by Civil War scholars or dismissed with slight bemusement. But they'll miss out on something wonderful by holding it to a goal it doesn't set out to achieve: despite its reasonable adherence to historical facts (creative departures from which Falconer happily acknowledges), this isn't an attempt at biography or historical \\"truth\\" in any factual sense, whatever that might mean in these postmodern times. Falconer is more interested in exploring larger issues of memory, celebrity and identity, and uses the Civil War as a ready context. The point is entirely transportable to any mythologized conflict, or indeed to any sphere in which public myth eclipses and ultimately effaces the private lives and memories of actual human beings: \\"This is history too, he thinks, the weight of gathered thoughts, the cumulus of idle moments.\\" My only reservation is on one aspect of style. Many of the short sections surprise, at their end, with an unexpected moment of violence, overt sexuality or scatological humour. The technique is wonderfully effective when used sparingly. However, by my count it's used more than 30 times in 140 pages - that tends to dilute its force."},{"Title":"The Lost Thoughts of Soldiers","review":"It's a strange thing to call a book of this type and subject matter mesmerising, but that is it's effect - at least it was for me.Falconer's writing is lush, poetical, graceful (add superlative here) and practically perfect for this collection of the seemingly random thoughts of an aged ex-soldier. Yet it remains real, coarse language and all.This book does not focus on the battles of war, but rather on the personalities, relationships and thoughts of these ordinary soldiers at rest (and play), rendering them human and real through the remembering of Benteen.Beautiful, funny and very endearing."},{"Title":"The Lost Thoughts of Soldiers","review":"What a glorious concept for a novel. Captain Frederick Benteen, despite his Civil War record and his service after June 25, 1876, is remembered in history as the man who failed to obey General George Armstrong Custer's last order. This distinction has made him a focal point of the continuing debate of what really happened at the Battle of the Little Big Horn and keeps Benteen, a man who made no secret of the fact he detested his commanding officer, a major player in the controversy. Would Custer and his immediate command have survived if Benteen had answered the order to \\"Be quick. Bring packs.\\"? Did Benteen, by ignoring his commander's plea and essentially taking command of the men under Major Marcus Reno, save the rest of the Seventh Cavalry from meeting the same fate as Custer? Because of his central role in discussions of the battle, any new book concerning Benteen will be of interest to a great many historians and casual readers. Unfortunately, The Lost Thoughts of Soldiers will yield no insight. Granted, it is marketed as a novel, not a biography, but when that marketing plays upon the central character being a person from history, an expectation is generated that this work can only disappoint. Fans of \\"literary fiction\\" with its zealous embracing of all bodily fluids will count this book as beautifully written. Many readers will find it offensive and vulgar, bordering on adolescent. But readers hoping to find a glimpse of the fascinating personality Frederick Benteen must have been will be ill-served by this work of fiction."},{"Title":"Seeing the Word: Refocusing New Testament Study (Studies in Theological Interpretation)","review":"This is a limited and technical group of people who might be interested in the topic: the state and future of NT Studies. Being part of the academia, it is those who engage themselves in research,publication and debate about NT Studies, or those like this reviewer who hang around with them, are taught by them, and read their output and views.Bockmuehl is a member of this group, and so writes with passion and knowledge about the topic. He begins by an assessment of the state of the matter, and he assesses that it is turning at this beginning of a new century away from its historical-critical leanings. With this opening, he asserts some new directions that might be fruitful for the discipline. First he proposes that the NT text was meant with an implied reader in mind, one who is engaged in its ecclesial usage, not just an academic/scholarly topic. It further sees NT study as returning to its historical-grammatical foundations, rather than microscopic, critical investiagation.Truly insightful was his quotation from Hoskyns: \\"You look down your critical microscope at the NT text with a view to describing the religious life of the first-century Christians, and you find that God is looking back at you through the microscope and declaring you to be a sinner.\\"In recalled, collective memory that flows from the apostolic eyewitnesses and their students, he sees the NT text as good, reliable history to be trusted. Primarily does he see this as centered on \\"Jesus the Jew as Messiah and Lord God of Israel,... dead, descendant of David.\\"With all this, he wants the discipline to focus on the implied readership and reading of \\"that incarnate Jewish God-child at the heart\\". He is truly on to something when he solicits \\"a quantum leap beyond the tired cliches of the 'unity and diversity' problme as it was handled in the past.\\"Well done, right on, and if implemented by those engaged in this discipline, will provide fruit for the faithful catholic church."},{"Title":"A Vision Shared","review":"I bought this remarkable book over thirty years ago and I've loved looking through it ever since.

Over the years the trickle of photo books devoted to the FSA and the Depression means that many of those included here have been repeated often but never to this size.Eleven photographers, who were more or less full time with Stryker, got together in the seventies (with the spouses representing Ben Shahn and Dorothea Lange) to choose the photos they wanted in the book.

NYC, in April 1938. Predictably the word propaganda is in evidence but also someone wrote '...what can be done for these American citizens'.There are only two other books that I think come close to 'A Vision Shared' in presenting FSA photos with the quality they deserve:Long Time Coming: A Photographic Portrait of America, 1935-1943with 400+ andFSA: The American Visionwith 470 photos.

The back pages have a short section on what the photographers thought of the FSA project from the perspective of the Seventies, a list of all the Library of Congress photo numbers and finally a spread with comments from people who attended an exhibition of FSA photos at Grand Central Palace, NYC, in April 1938. Predictably the word propaganda is in evidence but also \`...what can be done for these American citizens'.The only other book that I think comes close to A Vision Shared isLong Time Coming: A Photographic Portrait of America, 1935-1943with 396 beautifully printed photos. It is the only title with the largest number of images from the FSA and OWI files. Both books are five star plus.***SEE SOME INSIDE PAGES by clicking 'customer images' under the cover."},{"Title":"A Vision Shared","review":"This is an old-fashioned picture book, the binding and outer covers are of a fragile fabric type that easily wear and pick up dirt, but looked fashionable in the seventies and sixties. Its quite large, definitely of the \\"Art Book\\" size, or what's now called coffeetable type. Since then, paper quality and printing quality have improved, and my copy appears to be an early edition (Cover does not match the Illustration shown) Nonetheless, this is a beautiful book of the black and white genre, the photographs are large, well organized, with good titles and there are articles about the photographers to give a good perspective on the images. For those with an interest in/of the social upheavals of the depression era and the almost 19th century look of many of the images, you will not be disappointed in the content.The problem is that the supply of this edition printed in the 1970's is now very low so buyers can't be too choosy. I would guess 99% of the available books will at least have badly worn outer covers. If the insides are good, this book is probably of enough value to take it to a bookbinder for some heavy maintenance work."},{"Title":"Keynes' General Theory of Interest: A Reconsideration (Routledge Foundations of the Market Economy)","review":"Fiona MacLachlan(FM)has written an excellent summary and defense of Keynes's theory of liquidity preference contained in the General Theory(1936;GT).She clearly understands that it is the uncertainty(ambiguity) of the future course of events facing an individual investor that results in his decision to hold more(or less)liquid reserves in his portfolio (that earns little or no return) and not the risk of the future course of events.FM demonstrates that all of Keynes's critics inevitably return to a conceptualization that emphasizes risk(a known probability distribution with a particular and specific mean-variance(standard deviation))either explicitly or implicitly.FM argues convincingly that Tobin's classic exposition of\\"Liquidity Preference as Behavior toward Risk\\"is off the mark as far as being a representation of the generality of Keynes's theory of liquidity preference.It in fact is a special case of a much more general theory.Her book is very well written and deserves to be on the bookshelf of anypotential reader who has an interest in finding out what it was that Keynes was arguing in the GT.There are three areas where FM could have improved the technical exposition of Keynes's theory.She unfortunately(see pp.108-109) overlooks the clues in the Keynes-Townshend exchanges of 1937-1938 on the weight of the evidence variable,w,specified by Keynes mathematically in chapter 26 of the A Treatise on Probability(1921)as a measure of the completeness of the evidence upon which a decision maker will attempt to calculate probabilities that will be more or less reliable depending on the value of w.If w =1 and probability preferences are linear, so that there are no nonadditive probabilities(subadditive and/or superadditive),the theory of liquidity preference then simplifies to the analysis of Tobin and others.As w drops farther and farther from 1,the demand for liquidity will become larger and larger as the liquidity schedule shifts to the right,while the shift will reverse itself as w approaches 1.When w=1,the liquidity preference schedule will be a stable downward sloping function of the rate of interest alone.This refutes the claims of Kahn and Shackle who claimed that Keynes made a major error when he specified a clear functional relationship between the demand for money and the rate of interest that had no connection with thrift or productivity.This demonstrates that Kahn and Shackle had absolutely no understanding of the logical,epistemological,philosophical,mathematical or economic foundations of Keynes's theory of liquidity preference during their lifetimes.An alternative foundation for the theory of liquidity preference can also be based on the ambiguity analysis of Ellsberg and his rho variable,which measures the degree of confidence a decision maker has in his data,information,and knowledge.If rho =1,then you obtain results a la Tobin.If rho is less than 1,then you obtain all the results obtained when w&lt;1.This means that Keynes's w and Ellsberg's rho are one to one onto and isomorphic to each other.w can be automatically substituted into Ellsberg's decision theoretic model to obtain results that are identical when you reverse course and substitute rho into Keynes's decision criteria, c,his conventional coefficient of weight and risk.As w or rho approach 0,as happened in post WWI Germany,the demand for liquidity approaches infinity.Secondly, she overlooks the fact that the uncertainty of the GT is an inverse function of w.Finally,she overlooks the fact that Keynes specifically stated ,in additional analysis on p.240 of the GT in chapter 17,a chapter which FM correctly emphasizes,that one must take both risk AND UNCERTAINTY/IGNORANCE into account by discounting marginal efficiency of capital return projections ,not only for time preference(chapter 11 of the GT)but including discounts for risk,uncertainty,and ignorance."},{"Title":"Keynes' General Theory of Interest: A Reconsideration (Routledge Foundations of the Market Economy)","review":"This is a book about Keynes' theory of interest. Keynes made a remarkable contribution to economics by arguing that interest can be explained by the uncertainty of the future. Very broadly, Maclachlan argues that liquidity is desired because it provides one with a wide range of options in an uncertain world. The author also identifies two motives as being responsible for the preference for liquidity: the precautionary and the speculative motive. The precautionary motive enables one to cope with unforseen and suddent emergencies, while the speculative motive provides one with the means to \\"grasp\\" profitable opportunties when they arise or are discovered. The possession of wealth with little liquidity makes it difficult for individuals to exploit either motive successfully. From this it follows that a premium must be paid to those willing to surrender liquidity. Maclachlan discusses several reasons for this at great length. For example, individuals have a strong desire to be more rather than less certain about the purchasing power of their assets; there are transactions (and search) costs involved in exchange; and so on.Maclachlan next tackles several objections and criticisms that have been made against Keynes' liquidity preference theory of interest. Most common is probably the bootstraps argument which says that it is circular to use the existing interest rate as a standard by which to measure the degree of preference for liquidity which in turn determines the interest rate. Maclachlan separates general from particular liquidity preference and concludes that a general preference for liquidity avoids the infamous \\"bootstrap argument.\\"The most important chapter, however, is the one on \\"intertemporal coordination.\\" There she argues that savings and investment do not in any way coordinate interest rates because of the existence of easy credit policies. For example, it would seem that in an economy in which banks are able to create credit, the distinction between savings and investment becomes seriously distorted. In fact, one who decides to save all of his income will have no appreciable affect on the supply for lonable funds because that supply would be the same if he had chosen to spend all of it. He either deposits all of his income at which point the bank loans it all out (minus reserves), or he spends it all at some department store, at which point that department store deposits it and then their bank loans it all out (minus reserves). One's decision to save will not at all be different from one's decision to spend.Nearly all economists rely on the market for loanable funds --- in fact, I do not see how the several popular business cycle theories (in particular the Austrian Business Cycle theory) could work without this model. But we must recognize the limitations of this model. Austrians concerned with market processes should immediately note the impossibility of a perfectly equilibrated market in loanable funds. Additionally, the existence of bank credit makes the distinction between savings and investment meaningless which, as a consequence, casts considerable doubt on the usefulness of the market for lonable funds model.Now economists will respond to this argument by suggesting that firms do not typically hold \\"balances of bank liabilities at the same rate\\" as households do. Firms usually, as Fiona Maclachlan explains, enter \\"directly into the bond market\\" rather than deposit all of their money in a bank account. In this situation, then perhaps the argument could be made that they are \\"introducing a new supply of lonable funds\\". However, Machlachlan, using the liquidity preference theory of interest argues that:\\"a great deal of the activity in the bond market has nothing to do with new saving and new investment. The marginal bond seller may not be a firm trying to raise new funds but rather a wealth-holder who wants to sell bonds so that he can invest in something else. Similarly, the marginal buyer may not be someone who has done any new saving but rather a wealth-holder who is cashing in another investment to buy the bond. The price of bonds is determined on the margin but this marginal trade does not appear in the lonable funds diagram\\" (page 144).What I take away from this argument is that speculation will in all circumstances act to distort the real forces of savings and investment. Moreover, these speculative acts play a far greater role in determining the interest rate than do acts of saving and investment, whether it be conducted on a micro- or \\"aggregate level\\". This also gets back to Maclachlan's earlier chapter in stocks and flows. The debate on stocks vs. flows shows that exchange of existing assets plays a greater role than the production of new assets. So, new savings and borrowing is unimportant when compared to the activity that occurs between existing asset holders (the effects of the latter often overwhelm the effects of the former).Maclachlan also explicitly attacks Hayek's Ricardo effect, a concept which plays a very important role in his Business Cycle theory. Basically, Maclachlan argues that while increases in consumer demand will lead typically to a fall in investment, decreases in consumer demand will NOT lead to an increase in investment."},{"Title":"Keynes' General Theory of Interest: A Reconsideration (Routledge Foundations of the Market Economy)","review":"Author's presentation is lucid and scholarly.

What have I liked about this series? Lots. The characters and events are plausible, and not just cookie cutouts from previous tellings of the tale. The books do not only entertain, they are full of wisdom. Readers learn much about the unexpected twists and turns brought up by political necesseties. The role of religion in both empowering people and leading to their destruction is explored. Leadership, and its tendency to fall upon the hands of the ambitious yet morally corrupt is another fascinating theme.I did have a few reservations about this last book, however. The first two-thirds of it is thrilling, and worthy of its predecessors. But the last third or so seems to lose focus. It is almost as though Cornwell was struggling with several different ways to end the story, became frustrated, and decided to throw most of what he had come up with into the ending. The battle scenes are described with gory detail, which proved effective in the previous books. Yet this time, they lose their shock value, and become more tedious than anything else.Arthur is very much in the background throughout. Indeed, Derfel comes through as the major and most interesting character. Perhaps this is approriate. It is almost as though Cornwell is trying to see Arthur off into the mists of legend before the book is done. The characters who know and love him, too, tend to speak of him as though he is already becoming a memory.Despite the minor disappointment in the ending, this still stands as a great work in an outstanding series. I will re-read all the books, and I'm sure, learn even more from the wisdom which Cornwell imparts to them. Arthur and his times seem in some ways so far off, and in other ways so contemporary. That's the magic of Cornwell's trilogy. &quot;Once and future...&quot; indeed!"},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Cornwell had me hooked by the second book (Enemy of God), so I could not resist purchasing Excalibur.

It is a story of human endurance.It also gives a unique and telling picture of the Britain losing it's Celtic and Roman identity. A new age is being born as the old one dies.I was recently asked why the Arthur stories are important. Back in those keeps and today, those stories set a standard for behavior and an inspiration for better things during the thousand year darkness of the Middle Ages. Who know how those stories made people aspire to something better?As far as I'm concerned - they still do that. Human nature isn't any different now. We can still learn from these stories - and if not , they are at least rip-roaring entertainment."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"This was a very good trilogy, but the finale, this book, was by far the best.The Winter King, book 1, andEnemy of God, book 2, were both well written, entertaining and interesting (I gave both 4 stars as they were good but not great), but this book finishes off the trilogy with war, carnage, destruction and misery; it had its good things too, but we are talking about dark ages England and what else would you expect of Arthur. This was definitely a 5 star read.Again, as with the first 2 books, this is a different tale of Arthur. There is no sword in a stone, no grail quest, and little magic; other than superstition and luck, there is a reference to a curse that, in the book, seems real enough. But, for the most part, this is real world soldiers and warlords facing enemeies, deception, battle and chaos as the world is perched on the verge of Armageddon; at least that is how the book tells it.Our storyteller is again Lord Derfel Cadarn, Derfel \\"the Mighty\\". Son of a Saxon (and that Saxon, you will find, adds an interesting twist to the story), but raised by Merlin (a druid with what is described as much power, but which even Merlin admits is mostly smoke and mirrors) Derfel (a Welsh name pronounced \\"Dervel\\") is one of the mighty men of Arthur's fighting force. One of Arthur's round table; well, sort of, the oath sworn men are called the men of the round table oath though no round table existed. There is no Camelot, though that title is also addressed.What you have here, just as was in the first 2 novels, is a tale of the Britons fighting to save themsleves from fanatical religions, attacking Saxons and backstabbing traitors. The tale finishes well, cleaning up all loose ends nicely. I read in one review that the book was a let down becuase it \\"fizzled\\" at the end. I would disagree. The book does end quite abruptly; I was reading and realized I had only a handful of pages left and wondered how it was going to end so quickly, but it does end without leaving the reader hanging. I believe the ending was perfect; a necessary abrupt cliff where everything just falls, but you will know all you need to know by the time you reach the back cover.I have read many of Cornwell's books and would call myself a huge fan of Cornwell's work. I prefer and recommend highly his current and continuing work, collectively known as the Saxon Chronicles (The Last Kingdom,The Pale Horseman,Lords of the North, andSword Song), but this trilogy was very good and Cornwell provides his ubiquitous details of battle, strategy and tactics, and weaponry of the times in his usual highly accurate and descriptive manner. Don't take that as a dig on this trilogy. This was a wonderful trilogy, I just enjoy the other a little more but that may simply be because I am a student of the Northmen who populate the Saxon tales.Back to this story; why does this book rate 5 over the 4 I gave to the first 2 books? Well, for starters, the entire tale comes to a head here and suspense and mystery is all laid out, a prize for having completing the trilogy. Also, the characters become more real in this tale as they have aged and lived full lives. They become more honest with themselves and their comrades, lovers, spouses and enemies. Finally, the tale brings to an end, without destroying myths, the tale of the Arthur that we all know without destroying the possibilities of the myths.You really should read books 1 and 2 before coming to this novel and I highly recommend you enjoy each; but I encourage you that you will come to an excellent end with this final installment.Arthur lives in glory in these tales as does Derfel and it is Derfel that we truly get to know in these books and through him we learn Arthur's tale. Derfel is a wonderful character and I am sad to now leave him behind. This trilogy was very enjoyable and stands up to Cornwell's high standard of writing and historical knowledge.Enjoy!!!For more dark age England, other than the Saxon Chronicles mentioned above, I also recommend Cornwell's Grail Quest Trilogy which takes place during the 100 years war (those books are,The Archer's Tale,Vagabond, andHeretic)."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"A solid finale to the Warlords trilogy. I appreciated Cornwell's series for the simple fact that he avoids mysticism and fantasy. Instead, Cornwell looks at the King Arthur legend more from an historical standpoint than a mystical one. He takes the premise that Arthur very well could have been a real person, one who was trying to unite the Britons against the invading Saxons within a very realistic 6th century setting. Of equal interest, especially in these days of the Bush administration, is the clash between the overbearing Christians and the diminishing pagans and Druids. Of particular focus within this volume is the \\"final\\" battle between Arthur's army and the combined Saxon forces of Aelle's and Cerdic's armies. As always, Cornwell puts the reader right in the middle of the action, so that we hear, see, and smell the battle going on around us.

This book, and the others, are some the finest examples of historical fiction I have read. Keep in mind that I find most fiction dull due to poor writers and bland characterizations. Too often an author is lazy, just giving the characters odd names to differentiate them. Not so here. Moreover, I disliked the Arthurian legends because I knew that bards in the age of chivalry added so much nonhistorical aspects to the legend as to make them unreadable. Here, Cornwell sets the Arthurian legends in the proper historical time frame, with the appropriate weaponry and style. He makes the novels a conflict between Christianity and the older religions, with heavy references to how much they lost with the decline of Rome. I highly recommend this and the other books of this series."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"I've read a lot of Arthurian retellings and have to count Bernard Cornwell's \\"Warlord\\" trilogy as one of the absolute best. It truly has it all.The story adheres far more to the \\"historical\\" Arthur of Gildus, Nennius, Geoffrey of Monmouth and William of Malmesbury than the \\"romantic\\" Arthur of Mallory and Chretien des Troyes. The Welsh and Irish influences are also strongly felt. In Mr. Cornwell's \\"historical\\" treatment, Arthur is not a king, but a Warlord. Uther was Arthur's father, but Arthur did not share in Uther's legacy. Merlin is a well-developed character, but is a wealthy lord and full Druid. A cauldron, another powerful Celtic symbol, replaces the Holy Grail. Finally, the sword was on the stone, not in the stone.But, the fact that the story can be told a multitude of ways, from a multitude of viewpoints, with a cast of both new and common characters points out the strength of the Arthurian legend and the Arthurian public's hunger for more. Each retelling worth its salt (and this one is!!) provides it's own unique take on one of the best-loved legends of the English-speaking world.Even though Mr. Cornwell paints Arthur as a strong and (mostly) virtuous character, he still has flaws. His willingness to forgive his enemies sometimes defies logic. His modestly sometimes rings hollow. But, all in all, he is the heroic figure we all have come to know and love. The same cannot be said of Mr. Cornwell's Lancelot. Suffice it to say that this is by far the least flattering portrait of the \\"world's greatest knight\\" that I have ever read. Some of the other ancillary characters get a fuller treatment here than in many other versions of the tale and with some interesting transitions. Guinivere, at least in my book, undergoes several personality transplants during the course of the trilogy, and some are for the better. Nimue/Vivien is far more developed in this series and her transition also runs the full gamut. Many of the other nobles and warriors are also well-painted characters and add a great deal to the overall enjoyment of the story.But, the true measure of an Arthurian novel lies in the strength and credibility of the narrator. Derfel is definitely one of the strongest voices I have heard in Arthurian literature. He is now an aged monk, but in his younger years was a friend and confidant of Arthur who often fought by Arthur's side. He is a sworn enemy of Lancelot, an angle that adds many new slants to the story. But, most importantly, Derfel is telling the story in the past tense; he alludes to future events, tells us enough to let us know where it all leads, and then fills in the blanks. In some respects, Derfel fills the role of Bedivere (which is all I'll say now so as not to spoil the story for those who haven't read the books yet).The writing is powerful, the story is spellbinding, and it achieves that delicate balance of retelling the familiar yet introducing a healthy dose of the new.

His magnificent take on one of the world greatest legends makes one's heart soar.As in the first two books, the aging Derfel, Arthur's most loyal soldier, tells of the final days of Arthur's epic struggle to keep the Saxon hordes at bay, his reluctant cause to keep an evil king from taking the throne, and his attempt to bring justice to all of Britain.Since Derfel was there, only he tells it as it really happened even as the legend is fast becoming myth in his own lifetime.This isn't just a simple tale of good versus evil. It's a battle between the old gods and the new.In its own way, Cornwell's version pays homage to the brave unknown warriors who fought and died in long ago forgotten battles against the darkness."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"This book completes the three book series, the Warlord Chronicles, by Bernard Cornwell. The stories are narrated by Derfel, a Christian monk, recalling the Arthurian legend, in which he was a participant.If this is your introduction to this series, you would be well advised to begin with 'The Winter King.'Among other things, this is a story of the conflict between a fledgling Christianity in Britain, and the old religion, whose priests were the Druids. It is also the author's version of the legend of King Arthur.Bernard Cornwell has studied his subject, like Jack White, Mary Stewart and John Steinbeck. It amazes me how these people's fertile imaginations have ended with such different stories, given the same basic, if sparse, research facts.It was a real pleasure to read Cornwell's novels in this series, and I'm sorry to see the end. Of course, he's written a couple of dozen other books, including the entire series of Sharpe's adventures, so all is not lost.Joseph Pierre,Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity"},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Bernard Cornwell saved his best for last. Excalibur is one of the best Arthurian tales I've read. His attention to detail and explicit descriptions of battle scenes and everyday life give the reader a good feel for the times. It is easy to become attached to the narrator and I was saddened by the fact that the tale had to end. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Tim Pigott-Smith does a wonderful job with the audiobook version of The Warlord Chronicles. The combination of an excellent story with Pigott-Smith's delivery is awesome. It reminded me of a time in elementary school when the library had a professional storyteller come and tell us old Native American stories.Even if you don't normally get audiobooks, I think the Warlord Chronciles definitely deserve to be heard."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"I came to Amazon prepared to write a glowing review, deeming this book as perhaps the best book I've ever read. Imagine my surprise when I saw the previous two posts had the exact same words in them!Cornwell is a phenomenal writer. He takes the Arthurian legend in fantastic different ways. His depiction of the brutal warfare was breathtaking. I couldn't put this book down.

A must, and if you like the Britain of the knights of the round table: Excelent."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Cornwell has done something no one else has ever tried to do: make the Arthurian legend into something real. There is nothing fanciful or fairey-tale about this version of King Arthur, but that's all to the good. The way Cornwell writes it, you'd swear by the time you're done reading that this must have happened. The characters are so well-drawn and plausible, the plots and motivation are so true to life and the way real human beings behaved in the fifth century that I would rate this version of Arthur well above anything Tennyson or the other famous bards have ever done.This Arthur succeeds as historical fiction, heroic tragedy, action suspense thriller, character study, and morality play. It's in the same league as &quot;Watership Down&quot; and &quot;All the King's Men&quot; as an epic tale and a historical novel. The inclusion of religion into the series is done as well as Adams did it in &quot;Watership&quot; and the vivid characterizations and beauty of the prose are equal to what Penn Warren did in &quot;Kings&quot;.Don't buy this book as a paperback. You'll just end up buying the hardcover as well so you can read it over and over and put it on the mantle along with your other favorites as well as the other two books in the series, &quot;The Winter King&quot; and &quot;Enemy of God&quot;."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Bernard Cornwell books on Arthur was realistically depicted! I could actually believe there was a person either king or ruler, by the name of Arthur living in the early middle ages. Mr. Cornwell must have done a tremendous research to get the settings, landscrape and history correct! On the first instance I read the paperback edition of the Winter King, I knew it was a gem!! I myself believe Arthur was a man of invisible virtues, who believe all the good in man and stride for the ideal principles. Read Rudyard Kipling's IF poem! Mr. Cornwell acheived this in depicting such an Arthur!!! Excellent work! I must say that I disagree with the other's comments on Excalibur. I think the concluding part was a fitting ending to the story and not at all &quot;rush&quot;. Arthur whereabout was left a mystery as such it shoud be!~~~ However, I still like to know what happen to Derfel.

Beautifully written without being sentimental, and because of its sense of reality, the most powerful rendition of the tales."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"I'm happy to join the armies of those who have discovered Cornwell'sArthurian reconstructions and love them! Great read! great storyteller! Given the fact that authentic Arthurian sources are very scarce, his imaginative reconstruction of the events of this breaking point in British and Western history rings very true. The clash between the old Britons and the invading Saxons, the collision between pagan Druidism and rising Chrstianity is authentic. After contemorary Bosnia, Rwanda etc, those floods of refugees fleeing war and its ravages are chillingly real. As a Bible student,I better understand how the Hittites, Hivites, Canaanaites, the worshippers of Baal(Bel?) must have responded when Joshua's Israelites arrived in Palestine. Cornwell has given us a fascinating view of the minds of those destined to lose their land to the new invaders. The human drama through which he reimagines history is also dramatically right.Cornwell is a major writer.See pg 160 of Excalibur for a Shakespearean type formulation of good writing-to satisfy both balcony and pit.His success-genuine and authentic-proves he has found the secret of good writing that will last. I now add this trilogy to the few clasics I want to keep and reread and think about. thank you, Bernard Cornwell.

It almost seems as if Cornwell was rushed to publish it. Still, it was a great read that I enjoyed and didn't want to put down until I was done. It's a must if you've read The Winter King and Enemy of God."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"This was a magnificent conclusion to what is easily the best telling of the Arthurian legend that I have come across. Cornwell's portrayal of Ancient Britain is as compelling as it is realistic, and his characters are superbly developed, as we have come to expect from this wonderful author.While the tale is one of the more realistic versions available, it doesn't sacrifice a single shred of romanticism. It is a wonderful novel, filled to bursting with gripping political and religious intrigue as well as the battle scenes, which are some of Cornwell's best. Nor does the ending disappoint. It is wonderfully sad and poignant. You really do have to read this book."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"This book closes the extremely memorable Warlord Chronicles with a bang and doesnt disappoint from the first page.The battle on the Baddyn hill is beyond words and must be read to fully see its beauty. Lords die, legendary warriors are battling everywhere, and even one special woman joins the mix.I really loved Cornwells unique twists on the classic tales like the sword in the sea and Sir Gawain and the headless knight. Plus, Derfels battle with Liofa the Champion was breath taking. Liofas words to start the battle must have been scary as hell to hear!The Warlord Chronicles are one of the best trilogies i have ever read and are easily the greatest Arthur novels ever written. Pick these books up if you want an unforgettable, and very mature, tale of the great Arthur and his knights."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Bernard Cornwell's \\"Excalibur,\\" the third and final novel in his \\"Warlord Chronicles\\" trilogy, brings an excellent series to a tremendously satisfying close.Fans of Cornwell's fiction will have all the usual buttons pushed -- unsurpassed battle scenes, fierce melancholy as good friends are lost, savage joy as evil foes are vanquished, vivid depictions of hardscrabble daily life in the Dark Ages, astounding scenes of magic and wizardry, and above all, the unbreakable bonds of true friends and true loves. For Cornwell, there's even quite a bit of humor -- Merlin is a wonderfully cynical old coot, and Cornwell depicts the trammels of seasickness as well as anyone.Still narrated by Derfel, in the present-day a one-handed old man reluctantly wearing the chains of Christianity, \\"Excalibur\\" remains first and last the tale of Arthur. In Cornwell's telling, Arthur was never actually anointed \\"King of the Britons,\\" but he was their king in all but title. A savage warrior who dreamed of peace, a mighty swordsman who wanted nothing more than a simple home and hall, Cornwell's Arthur is a man worthy of his legends.He is also a man with a lot on his plate. Merlin seeks to bring the Gods back to Britain and to drive the Christian God away -- possibly even willing to throw Arthur's son away as a sacrifice. (You will never read tales of Sir Gawain the same way again, by the way.) Nimue, Derfel's former love, is impatient with Merlin's efforts and is eager to topple Merlin from his post as the mightiest Druid in Britain . . . by any means necessary. Lancelot remains a traitorous foe. Mordred rules, but hates Arthur -- as do Arthur's twin sons. Guinevere is back in all her seductive glory. And the Saxons are marching.\\"Excalibur\\" is also Derfel's tale, and through Derfel's eyes we see the joy and sorrow that comes from being Arthur's right arm. We finally learn the reason why Derfel has lost his hand, and we see in Derfel the exemplar of a true family man. Derfel may not be in the Arthurian legends, but he should have been!The key to any tale of King Arthur is to tell of his mysterious departure to Avalon, perhaps to return one day. Cornwell's version is spell-binding, filling the reader with a wracking hope that, some day, England's mightiest hero will return to us and bring us back, if not Camelot, the epitome of nobility and grace. Wow! A must for the library!"},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"The finale of Cornwell's excellent historical fiction (as opposed to fantasy) Arthurian series.Cornwell did some of his best writing, and especially some of his best characterization, in these books. Derfel is a romantic, an affectionate and idealistic man, who's also perfectly capable of hacking enemies into small pieces. Female characters, not always a Cornwell strength, are excellent here, especially Guinevere and Nimue.The framing device here works especially well as things actually happen in the &quot;present&quot; timeline--careless readers may even miss the impending attack.The &quot;past&quot; timeline has quite a bit of exciting action, though it does drag at times, probably inevitably for a narrative that covers many years. As in previous volumes, battles are an obvious strength, and the portrayal of Dark Ages Britain is fresh and interesting. As a former student of the period, I found little that struck me as incorrect here, though obviously much of the material on religious belief and mentalities is pure speculation. The only disappointment was an anticlimax regarding the loss of Derfel's hand--not how he loses it, but the description is lacking.Thematically, Cornwell is saying something here about magic and religion; something especially appropriate to the too-often-ethereal Arthurian genre. I highly recommend these books."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"I love this triogy it is much more beilvable than any arthur movie that I have seen.

I wish it didn't, however, it is the most rewarding series on historical fiction I have ever read. If you were smart, you bought all three so there was no wait time between them. I had to start with Winter King to see if it was good, and after the first chapter, I ordered the other two."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"The Warlord Chronicles are, simply, three of the best books I have ever read, of any genre. In my experience, the vast majority of series show a marked decrease in quality from the first book to the last (and until Sharpe's Trafalgar, the Sharpe series seemed to be following the same lamentable pattern). The Warlord Chronicles, however, crackle with tension, excitement, and an appropriate sprinkling of humor and romance from beginning to end. The battle scenes are, of course, fantastic (this is Cornwell, after all, and one could hardly expect less). What really makes this series stand out, however, are the incredibly vivid characters Cornwell develops. Both heroes and villains are portrayed in exceptional detail; each one is an original individual, and this is no mean feat given the sheer number of retellings the Arthurian saga has undergone. Cornwell has deliberately gone back to the earliest historical records, and his tale includes many fascinating characters who were axed from later, romanticised versions. Also, there are enough surprise twists and turns that the reader is kept on his toes and never quite allowed to get comfortable and complacent. Turn your back for a moment, and a central character may have been killed off while you were napping. Cornwell has also outdone himself in providing the appropriate historical context, so as to give the reader the sense that he himself is living in Dark Ages Britain. From the details of weaponry and battle tactics to social customs, and above all the dramatic clash between the traditional Druidic religion and the rapidly expanding Christian faith, Cornwall convincingly recreates an entire society. This outstanding series is a major contribution to modern story-telling."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Good solid read from the master of historical novels, puts a new twist on Authurs journey through early Wales and England"},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Bernard Cornwell is a master story teller.

This story unfolded much the way the Saxon Tales did and gave us glimpses into these lost worlds. I think both of these series would make great movies"},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"The story is interesting and very well told by the author, it is an easy reading, I certainly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"I highly recommend this book to all anglophiles, and to anyone interested in how the english-speaking people came to be."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Cornwell's interpretation of the Arthurian mythos is compelling and superbly written. He breathes new life into the legends by presenting the well-known characters as realistic figures, neither saints nor demons. Few of his villains are without some kind of redeeming feature, and none of his heroes are without flaw. Arthur, a bastard by birth, is generous and kind but ruthless and vain; Gorfyddyd, a tyrannical ruler bent on overlordship of all Britain, is a loving and doting father and Merlin, the inveterate trickster, is never without some surprise up his sleeve but is ultimately human and filled with doubt in the gods and in himself.Many of the integral parts of the mythos (the Grail quest, Merlin's magical prowess, the love affair between Lancelot and Guinevere) are retold in an utterly plausible manner.Cornwell's Britain is not a utopian Camelot but a patchwork quilt of loosely affiliated kingdoms warring with one another and fighting off Saxon marauders who themselves are divided into different warlords' followings. His description of religious conflict is one of two faiths, Christianity and Celtic paganism, at times vying for supremacy, at times seeking to co-exist, and always plagued by internacine rivalries and differences of doctrine and ideology.We view all these people and conflicts through the eyes of Derfel, a Saxon-born slave who fights his way to the top of Post-Roman British society, allowing us to see the legend from a unique and rarely-explored perspective. The result is a spellbinding journey through war and peace, faith and folly, in a three volume work that, but for its recent publication, would no doubt be regarded as a great classic of Western literature.This last volume left me wanting more. What do you say, Mr. Cornwell? Once more unto the breach?"},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"The tale of Arthur has been told many times since the middle ages, each telling bringing something new to the story, but hands down, The Warlord Chronicles is the absolute best version of the modern era. Gone are the romantic elements that have permeated the story since the middle ages and replaced with an absolute reality and profound humanity that is not present in any other Arthurian novel.Bernard Cornwell is one hell of a writer and is best known for his successful Richard Sharpe series, historical novels of the Napoleonic Wars, so you know you're in good hands as you read this book. Cornwell takes his liberties with the tale, yes, but he knows just how far he can go with the characters and events to keep things always interesting. Even if you've read many other Arthurian novels, I guarantee it, this one will surprise you.Excalibur is the final book in the Warlord Chronicles trilogy, and I'm tempted to say the best one, but you MUST read the first two in order to fully appreciate this tale. Here one learns of the final fate of all the characters, the idealistic Arthur, his faithful man-at-arms Derfel, the treacherous Guinevere, the slimy Lancelot and of course Merlin who is single minded in his ploy to bring the Old Gods back to Britain. The Warlord Chronicles are destined to become classics of modern literature and the standard by which all other Arthurian novels will be judged. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"I must admit, the only reason I did not give the two previous books in this trilogy five stars is because the final book in the series was SO good I had to reserve it the best rating possible. It is very rare that I feel strong emotion when reading a book, or for me to become emotionally attached to the characters, but in this case, both occurred. Excalibur builds upon the solid foundations of the last two books, developing characters and plot to even further. The author still manages to surprise you, even if you know your Arthurian trivia. Most importantly, the conclusion was spectacular. Some might find it frustrating, but now I couldn't imagine it ending any other way. I won't give any more away.... Mr. Cornwell, if you are reading this, I beleive this could be a very successful film/series of films. The old Excalibur set the mould for the Arthur of the Romances, but this takes &quot;The King&quot; in entirely an new direction. This could become (unfortunately with much simplification) the definitive Dark-Age Arthur film. Anyway read the first two novels, then read this one... I practically didn't sleep until I finished it. Wonderful... I HIGHLY RECCOMEND!"},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Bernard Cornwell did not disappoint with his final entry in the Warlord Trilogy. Just like the first two, the reader is treated to prosaic language that revels in its poetic beauty, mingled with the blunt, pragmatic realism of the soldier who is narrating the story.As the book opens, we find ourselves back in war-torn Dumnonia, which Arthur has just unified after Lancelot's rebellion. Merlin is preparing to summon the pagan gods of Britain in an endeavor that could split the country in two. And Arthur and Derfel prepare for the inevitable spring invasion of the Saxons. It is in this book that the climactic Battle of Mount Badon is brilliantly realized, the battle between the Britons and Saxons for which the real Arthur (if he ever existed) was certainly responsible for.Those familiar with the previous two books in the series, \\"The Winter King\\" and \\"Enemy of God\\" know that Cornwell has taken a bold step with his take on the legend of King Arthur by giving the tale a new, more realistic approach. But unlike its predecessors, this book tends include real magic, whereas in the previous two novels, genuine magic was substituted for clever tricks that preyed on a superstitious people. Merlin was therefore portrayed more as a sardonic trickster than as the genuine and powerful wizard he is more commonly shown to be in other variations of the legend.Many have complained that the book tended to confuse them due to the large amount of characters, most of whom have difficult-to-pronounce Welsh names (Culhwch, Caddwg, and Hygwydd come to mind). In Cornwell's defense, the Welsh names are very realistic and they reflect the fact that this Arthur story is set in post-Roman Britain, rather than the Anglo-Saxon England of the 11th century. And as overwhelming as the names can be at first, Cornwell excels at developing many different personalities so that before you know it, the unusual names are as familiar to you as those of old friends.Though it is Arthur's tale, we get to know the narrator Derfel much more intimately, which is another element that I found appealing. Derfel, currently an old Christian monk writing Arthur's tale in secrecy, was once one of Arthur's greatest warriors and closest friends, and he is a man who excels at war, but to whom we grow very attached due to his humility, courage, pragmatism, and his undying love and devotion to his woman, Ceinwyn.If this book has any failing, it would have to be Cornwell's tendency to repeat himself constantly about important events or characters. Unfortunately, we must constantly hear about the black face of Sagramor (Arthur's Numidian commander), the fact that Derfel is a Saxon who can speak both the British and Saxon tongues, and how Merlin is very powerful and virile despite his old age.It's very difficult to end a great trilogy well, but Cornwell has definitely succeeded and brought his story of Arthur to a close."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"I just finished the last book in Bernard Cornwell's Warlord trilogy and was very impressed with his unique perspective on the Arthurian legend. While most books in this genre follow the traditional &quot;Round Table&quot; formula, Bernard Cornwell has blazed a new path and even pokes fun at the standard retelling by emphasizing that history was &quot;written&quot; by people who could afford to pay bards to compose it.The narrator of this book, like its prequels, is Derfel Cadarn, a warrior in Arthur's service, who is oath-sworn to uphold Mordred's throne, but who finds that his duties often conflict with his sense of right and justice. Cornwell's novel eschews romantic notions of the Dark Ages and instead gives details about daily life that are far from pleasant, e.g., the constant &quot;de-lousing&quot; process. However, far from being a Tolstoy-esque recanting of minute details, this novel outpaces its predecessors with a whirlwind of battle scenes and a breathtaking account of shifting loyalties, ruthless leaders and timeless passions.To anyone serious about the Arthurian legend, this is a must-read!"},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"The book Excalibur by Bernard Cornwell is an amazing story. Excalibur is a book that describes the epic that is the war of a noble kingdom. Unlike most of the other books that talk about Excalibur and the adventures of King Arthur this book revolves around one of Arthur's Knights of the Round Table, Derfel. Derfel was a lord of war and law. He controlled one of the armies that were under the rule of Arthur. The setting of this story is in the island of Great Briton. King Arthur and his allies control of half of the island. The other half of the island is controlled by the barbaric Saxons that invaded over 100 years ago. I wouldn't recommend this book to people that don't like war and gore. Though to every one else I strongly recommend this book. This book talks about gods and war. The war is described in amazingly thrilling detail that will absolutely exhilarate your very senses. I would give this book a rating of 110 out of 100."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Per my review of WINTER KING, this is a different take on Arthur, focusing on the legend and the times. And those times were when Briton was desperately fighting itself and trying to hold back the Saxon invasions. The ruins of Roman occupation still remain.In this part of the trilogy Arthur's plans to unite Britain begin to unravel. Merlin is betrayed and former allies of Arthur turn on him or won't assist him as Mordred gathers power.Follows the Arthurian legend in some places but in others it is very different. For instance, Galahad and Lancelot are half-brothers; Galahad is brave but Lancelot is a coward who had good PR people, to speak, who made him into a hero. Arthur has children from a previous marriage. Mordred is club-footed. Merlin doesn't get trapped in a tree. I could go on but don't want to give out real spoilers.Appreciators of an author who can blend History with legends will greatly appreciate this trilogy.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"i cried when this novel ended, for the characters had been with me for three weeks. i read the trilogy straight through and the ending of the tale was like the ending of a friendship. derfel steals the show, his ever trustworthy nature, always making the right decision, and his ability to love above all else makes the characters drawn to him. druids, christians, battles, promises kept, promises broken, and peace in small measures. the women are the solice and problems both large and small."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Excalibur is the best telling of the Arthurian legend since Mallory. Cornwell makes Arthur his own, and in finishing this third book of Cornwell's Arthurian trilogy, I wished for a fourth.Cornwell tells his tale through Lord Derfel Cadarn, a monk and Arthur's retired warlord. Cadarn's version mocks the flighty tales of magic and pagentry passed down in ballads and (implicitly) in other authors' tellings. Cadarn was there. He was saved from death as a child by Merlin. He fought alongside Arthur at his greatest battles. He was there at Guinevere's downfall, and helped Guinevere on her course of reuniting with Arthur.And you believe him. Every word. Much of this belief is due to Cornwell's excellent crafting of the time and place. The tensions between Christians, pagans, druids, and just plain folk create a powerful cross-grain in this trilogy. Layers of Roman and druid and pagan architecture straddle the landscape.But it is not just historical veracity that lends Derfel his charm. Derfel is one of the warmest, most competent characters to emerge from my fiction reading in a long time. You just like him. You love being in his confidence. You accept his judgments. And you certainly live his fears and defeats and victories.What a read. Start at the beginning with The Winter King and read straight through."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Cornwell's account of Arthur in this three book series is a breath of fresh air. I've read all the classics (Once and Future King, Le Morte D'arthur, Idylls of the King), and quite a few other Arthurian books as well. I like that Cornwell doesn't take these others, add a few differing details, and give them a new title. Cornwell gives a very personal and human perspective on Arthur and the events and people that shaped his life. I also love the way he completely changes the stories surrounding the main characters(Guinevere, Lancelot, Merlin). I highly recommend this book, as well as the other two in the series(Winter King, Enemy of God)."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"I have read every Bernard Cornwell book and for me this is the greatest.

Book two changed my opinion and drew me into book three. With this last installment, Cornwell has completely redeemed himself in my eyes. Characters I had found dull and poorly developed in book one are now characters I miss since I've finished the series.While I still found occassional glimpses of Cornwall's overly- flowery scenic descriptions and while the stroke by stroke battle descriptions were still quite long - I stayed enthralled. This book is by FAR not the traditional story of Arthur - the characters are there along with new ones, but the tale of Lancelot really threw me for a loop. I liked the twist! I also liked the inclusion of Arthur's children - nice to know that the family line was not as doomed as in other renditions. It is also a tale that is VERY military based. The descriptions of the battles are detailed, detailed, detailed. A student of military strategy would find particular interest in this book over any of the other Arthurian tales I've read. Looking for romance - there is a bit- but not the love triangles and romantic liasons that so many authors dwell upon when writing about Arthur. Come to think of it, I don't recall ever seeing the word Camelot in these books. I would encourage Cornwell to continue the saga - what was Derfel's life like at the monestary, what happened to Arthur's son, what did Nemue do next? There are still so many unanswered questions!Overall - a fast read, interesting story line, enough twists to be very fascinating despite what you think you know about the Arthurian legend."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"I enjoyed the books, even though they were pretty dark, but I had a problem with the female characters. They were all repulsive, disloyal, sly, conniving, or stupid. All except for Ceinwyn, Derfel's woman. I think Cornwell is a little hard on the women in his series. Definitely more into battle scenes than love scenes, too. And I'm not saying read Mary Stewart. I think Jack Whyte got the mix about right with his Camulod Chronicles."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Warlord Chronicles, a tale of Arthur1. The Winter King (***)2. Enemy of God (***)3. Excalibur (**)\\"Arthur was probably no king, he may not have lived at all, but despite all the efforts of historians to deny his every existence, he is still, to millions of folk about the world, what a copyist called him in the fourteenth century, Arturus Rex Quondam, Rexque Futurus: Arthur, our Once and Future King.\\" --Bernard Cornwell, Historical Note in EXCALIBURCornwell's EXCALIBUR marks the crowning jewel of a fulsomely callous portrayal of women in 5th-century Britain, at least any woman of note (with the lone exception of Ceinwyn). Maybe it's unfair and provincial of me to view ruthlessness and calculated ambition potentially admirable in men but singularly unbecoming in women. Regardless, Guinevere's promiscuous ambition for power, glory and fame while Nimue's cold, religious fanaticism to sacrifice women and children for her pagan religion both distinguished Cornwell's final Arthurian installment EXCALIBUR. Although some may see EXCALIBUR as Guinevere's road to redemption, I can't say I really saw it that way. Admittedly, EXCALIBUR belongs to Guinevere, but I couldn't get over Guinevere betraying Arthur with Lancelot and then ready to betray him again with the druid twins back in ENEMY OF GOD, and all for power and glory. The humble first-person narration in a flashback makes for an inviting reading experience though the portentously gloomy tones tends to drown some of the enthusiasm. Cornwell's settings, historical backdrop and prose are all solid.EXCALIBUR highlights the monumental battle in Arthur's lifetime which repels the Saxon conquest of Britain for an entire generation: the battle at Mynydd Baddon, or simply, Mount Badon. Of the three books in this Arthurian rendition, magic plays the biggest role here, and I can't say it was for the better. In the first part, The Fires of Mai Dun, Merlin and Nimue attempt to bring the old gods back. I found myself most engaged in the second part Mynydd Baddon in which we're treated to the warlord in Arthur at his best: battling against insurmountable odds. The final two parts, Nimue's Curse and The Last Enchantment concludes with Nimue's pagan fanaticism.As opposed to the madness of Christianity in ENEMY OF GOD, EXCALIBUR now turns its attentions to painting the pagan religion of 5th-century Britain in a very gruesome light via Nimue's fanatically insane group of followers. Again, you have to admire Cornwell's decided aversion to black-and-white storytelling. Where ENEMY OF GOD describes a mad and violent Christian movement, EXCALIBUR now concludes with a fanatically cruel pagan depiction with child sacrifices. Past friends and lovers now become cruel enemies (Nimue), allies plot and scheme (King of Gwent Meurig, Mordred), traitors repent and expiate (Guinevere), while apparent enemies exhibit valor and heart (Derfel's Saxon father, King Aelle). Readers will find merit in evil and cruelty in apparent good. All of it adds to Cornwell's well-researched and captivating tale of Arthur.By the end of ENEMY OF GOD, I thought Guinevere's betrayal would teach Arthur something of ruthlessness and cold retribution. Unfortunately, Arthur's downfall rested on his most noble quality: his persistence to forgive and believe in the goodness of people and the sanctity of oaths. In the end, he wanted gratitude, but both the Christians and the pagans hate him by EXCALIBUR and he finally relinquishes his power in EXCALIBUR.I actually liked all three books, but the first-person, melancholy tones in the flashback absorbed some of my enjoyment. I thought EXCALIBUR was the weakest out of three actually."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"This is the only book of the trilogy that I've read.

I thouroughly enjoyed all three books in The Warlord Chronicles, and I would recommend Excalibur to anyone who enjoyed Winter King and Enemy of God."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Cornwell's Arthurian trilogy set around 500 AD concludes with \\"Excalibur.\\" It should be noted this bears no relation to the movie \\"Excalibur\\" that relates the more traditional, Christian version of the Arthur story.At the end of Book 2, Enemy of God, Arthur survived not only a Christian rebellion led by the cowardly Lancelot, but also betrayal by the love of his life, Guinevere. Now declaring himself the Emperor of Britain, Arthur is taking a firm control of ancient Britain with plans to unite the various kingdoms of the island to wipe out the invading Saxon horde.Meanwhile, Merlin the Druid wizard is collecting the Thirteen Treasures of Britain--relics of magical powers--in order to stage a ritual that will bring the old Gods back to the island and wipe out not only the Saxons, but the Christians as well. In order for this to work, Merlin needs Excalibur and something much more precious that Arthur possesses. This creates a rift not only between Arthur and Merlin but our narrator Derfel and the crazed witch Nimue, who is Merlin's priestess and Derfel's former childhood friend and lover.Not long after this ritual goes terribly wrong, Derfel is sent to rescue the imprisoned Guinevere from the invading Saxons. She, Derfel, and his band of warriors end up on an old mountain fort called Mount Baddon, from which they fight a desperate siege against the Saxons. During this we see that Guinvere still loves Arthur--and the feeling is more than mutual--and she's not such a conniving, evil [witch] after all.But even with the defeat of the Saxons there are dark times ahead as the enemies of Arthur and Derfel continue to plot and scheme. As Merlin says, it all ends in tears, which anyone who knows anything about the Arthurian story already knows.The conclusion of the trilogy wraps everything up nicely. The story doesn't sag as much under political intrigue as the two previous entries with the fiery ritual to lead things off, followed by the big battle at Mount Baddon, and then the smaller final battle to end the story. The real achievement is that by the end I really cared about all those who had survived since the beginning like Arthur, Derfel, Galahad, and even Guinevere, who really gets to shine in the Mount Baddon segment. At the start of the series there were so many characters, but by the time the end comes the less important ones have been winnowed out and we're left with only the important characters, whom we've either come to love or hate as the story has progressed. Because of that, when the end finally comes, it's bittersweet, which it always is at the end of a great series.All the good things about the series from the other books are also present like the more realistic battles, the depth of the political intrigue, and the clash between religions that still resonates today. Because of all that, there's really nothing I'd speak against with this book. While the writing isn't Tolstoy, no one expects it to be and so for a rollicking historical read, I'd highly recommend this and the two that precede it.That is all."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Here is the end of King Arthur. If you haven't read either of the first two booksThe Winter KingandEnemy of Godthen you should do so before reading this one. The trilogy works well as separate books but you should read them in order if you want to understand what is happening. This book is a rather depressing one. The high point arrives in the middle with the Battle of Badon Hill and the rest of the book is the fall from that state of grace. Derfel must watch as everything that they achieve slowly decays and collapses without the guiding hand of Arthur around. The ending seems somewhat sudden, which is how Cornwell likes to end his books but this time you really want to see what happens afterwards."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Just finished it Cornwell's Warlord Trilogy. I thought it was absolutely phenomenal. I have an issue with how quickly he ended it though, it seems very out of keeping. Everything else in Derfel's life is described extensively, and by having the story be from Derfel's POV and ending it with the last battle at Camlann, he leaves out so much story which could easily have fitted into an epilogue. Were I his editor I would at least have advised to spend some time on tying that up properly. Too many questions unanswered. What happens to Guinevere, Galahad, Gwydre and the others on the boat for instance? Does Derfel ever meet them again? Where does he go to live with Ceinwyn and how many more years are they given? I understand that he wants to keep Arthur's final fate unknown, even though we can deduce from his never coming back that he did die, but the final chapter just doesn't seem right in how fast Cornwell goes about tying things up. Also the Silver Mist and him never returning, while typical of the traditional Arthurian ending of Arthur going to Avalon to sleep forever, seems like a rather out of place \\"magical\\" ending to this starkly realistic series where everything has a logical explanation.Other than that niggle about the unsatisfying ending, nothing but praise. Well almost. I thought the characterization was great, particulary for the secondary characters. He does a great job of building a big cast of characters in a way few authors can. Especially the group of Arthur's companions such as Sagramor, Culhwch, Galahad, Tristan. Derfel is the star of the show in this series rather than Arthur, whose portrayal I am ambivalent about. The same applies to Merlin, who has been portrayed better elsewhere ( Stewart). Merlin to me was too powerless as well as too vulgar. I understand he went for the Dark Merlin/Mad Merlin take but I don't think it fully worked, he is too diminished for my taste. Nimue was interesting, as was Guinevere. So many good enemies as well, Lancelot, the Saxons, Amhar and Loholt, Mordred, Nimue, the vicious twins Dinas and Lavaine that killed his daughter, so many weak men set off against strong ones, the story of Tristan and Iseult, the character of Gawain gets a completely different treatment,a great sense of melancholy for a lost reign. Wonderful how Cornwell gives us the story through the eyes of a man writing at the end of his life, excellent device. Actually a great romance between Derfel and Ceinwyn as well, touching.His portrayal of magic in the story seems to shift at the end of the third book from how it has been portrayed up until that late point in the story however, and I found that quaint. After two and a half book of pretty much no magic and alternate explanations for everything that could be construed as magical, he does seem to want to make it plain at the end that there is some real magic being done ( Nimue's curse, the use of shadowbodies to torture Ceinwyn).Lancelot: He's a total tool, bereft of good qualities, unlike Galahad who is his opposite and who Derfel calls his best friend.The Saxons: not villains in the sense that they are just like the Britons, trying to gain land so continious flow of Saxons coming to the British shores can be accomodated. And enemy yes, but it depends on the POV. Nimue, the druid twins, Lancelot etc are more clearly defined as villains.Strange how Nimue turned out. From Merlin's best friend in youth to ally in maturity to cruel enemy at the end. Mordred was a truly terrible human being, rotten even as a boy.Merlin's portrayal leaves too much to be desired here. As does Arthur's, who is lead around the nose too much by Guinevere in the first two books, something which is corrected in book 3. He is very human, but for me just a bit much and too flawed. Some of his decisions were just poor and as Derfel said, poor for all to see but Arthur.Loved the companions. The bachelor Galahad, Christian knight of great prowess, coarse Culhwch, built like a bull, Derfel himsel with his marvellous life story, Sagramor the black demon. Tristan was a great character as was the brutal Lord Owain in book 1, I was sad to see him killed. Same for Aelle, Derfel's father.In the end, a superb portrayal of Arthurian legends. The only Arthurian series that rivals it is the vastly different Merlin Trilogy by Mary Stewart. I've still yet to read Sword at Sunset though, which has no Merlin as I understand it. He puts a different hat on almost every character, and on many known events. He has great storytelling flair and displays great characterization abilities. He shows us battles, passion, romance and makes the Arthur story new to those had become tired of it.9/10"},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Just like the 2 previous books of this trilogy it was hard to put down.

In the previous volumes, magic was portrayed with a light hand--a mist that appears when needed or a line of heads on lances that keeps enemies at bay--that could be due as much to luck or human psychology as to magical abilities. In this third volume, however, the gloves are off, and Nimue and Merlin are revealed in fuller power.The theme of the disappearance of magic coincident with the ascendency of Christianity is not new. It has been explored in other books and movies (see Dragonslayer, 1981, with Patrick MacNicol, Caitlin Clarke, and Ralph Richardson; set in the same era as this book). However, Cornwell does his usual masterful job in juggling this theme along with the Arthurian legend, character interactions, and brilliant combat depictions.

In this book, the story of the legendary Arthur is brought back to life. Once you get started reading this book it is almost impossible to put it down.The book is told from one of Arthur's warlords Defrel.

Defrel who was once a Saxon boy was brought up and raised by Merlin, and learned the ways of Britain and its cultures. The Saxons are at war with all of Britain fighting for their land. The Saxons have been waiting for over five years to advance on Britain and now after five long years they attack. Though it seems they are outnumbered and do not have enough spearmen to hold up, they come together and fight the battle of a lifetime.If you are interested in a novel that keeps you at the edge of your seat and always keeps you wondering, then the book Excalibur is right for you.-Kevin Sossaman"},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Excalibur is the final book of a trilogy that retells the Arthurian Legend. Following the tradition of book one, The Winter King, and book two, Enemy of God, the story teller, Derfel, picks up the tale where it left off at the end of book two. Derfel is a Saxson slave who grew up in Merlin's compound and joined Arthur's warriors as a young man, worked his way up through the ranks to become a Lord, and became Arthur's friend and trusted companion. His loyalty to Arthur stretched through his whole life, and he may be the last living person who can tell the tale the way it really happened.Now, late in his life, Derfel is living as a monk, and retelling the tale to Queen Igraine. Unlike the songs of the bards, who have earned their livlihood by embellishing these ancient tales with glory and beauty, Derfel tells it like it happened. When all is said and done, this proves to be even more fascinating than the bards retelling. Filled with pagan magic, cunning kings, brave warriors, and strong and beautiful women, this gripping tale will keep you turning pages to the very end!

As in the previous books, Cornwell takes some Arthurian legends from different eras and mixes them together, adding his own touch of historical realism. The portrayal of Saxon-Celtic conflict as well as Christian-Pagan conflict is very well done. The best of the series, this is an excellent book, though one that will disappoint some by painting a vision of Arthur that clashes with their own. As always, Cornwell's storytelling is top-notch."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"&quot;Excalibur&quot; is the third and final installment in Cornwell's Arthur trilogy. All three books are excellent. Cornwell has taken the mythical Arthur and put him in what is perhaps his true historical setting -- 5th century Britain. In so doing, he brings Arthur, Guinevere and the rest of the characters from the Arthurian legend to life as real people caught up in the events of the time. He does a masterful job of bringing these people to life against a background of war, intrigue, and the crude manners of the period, while adding in a touch of the old magic of the druids and keeping close to the familiar events depicted in the myths.If you are ready to read this book, though, then you should know all this. You should have already read the first two books. If you liked them, this one will not let you down. These books will bring Arthur and his companions alive again in the imagination of anyone who reads them."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"This book picks up where the last two left off. The author does a good job of relating to the previous books so reading them is not absolutely necessary. I also like at the end of the books how the author relates to other books and their authors who have written the histories of the period.I prefer audio books and this one being old was only available on cassettes."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Excalibur is the last of the Warlord Chronicles, Bernard Cornwell's trilogy on Arthur the warlord who, according to the author at least, was never king. This is the volume where the Saxon (and Angle) invaders get crushed at Mont Badon. Two-thirds of the book is devoted to the build-up of this climatic event. It is also the only battle that is a historic event, since it is attested by several of the written sources, starting with Gildas who makes clear that it was a great victory for the Britons. It also seems to have postponed the Anglo-Saxon drive towards the West for about a generation, although there is no secure dating for the battle itself and historians have been furiously debating this and everything else about Arthur and his times.The qualities that were apparent in the two previous volumes are also displayed in this one. A rather original plot for a very well-known story - the medieval mythical Arthur was about as well-known as Roland and Charlemagne across Europe. The comparison that comes to mind, although it should perhaps not be pushed too far is with the Illiad for the Ancient Greeks. I already mentioned some of the main twists: Lancelot painted as a villain, Merlin as a selfish, grumpy and rather unsympathetic old man, Arthur as a very competent but reluctant and idealistic warrior, Galahad the Christian, Lancelot's half-brother but loyal to Arthur, Derfel, the narrator and one of Arthur's warlords, and who happens to be the bastard son of a King. There are many other original twists, such as that of King Mark of Cornwall and Tristan, his heir, and Iseult, his young wide who happens to be the daughter of one of the Irish piratical Kings who had settled along the Welsh coasts. This, by the way, is historically correct. Throughout the 3rd to the 5th centuries, war bands of Irish pirates attacked all along the western coast of Britain and founded several kingdoms. Those in Wales, which are mentioned in this book, were ultimately eliminated, but the Dal Riata who settled on the western part of what was to become Scotland and took over the whole country in the end.As also already mentioned in my previous reviews, one of the greatest qualities of this book is to make the characters credible, whether the \\"goodies\\" or the \\"baddies\\". This is partly because the former are not flawless heroes whereas the latter are not dark arch-villains. It is also, and perhaps mostly, because the characters evolve over time, with some tending to move from one category to the other. Guinevere, for instance, becomes more sympathetic than in the previous volume, as opposed to Nimue who loses it completely and becomes quite atrocious. Above all, what makes this book a delight to read (and re-read) is that the characters appear to be human, with all their qualities and defects.Finally, there is the historical context, which Cornwell has carefully researched. As the author acknowledges, no one can identify the location of Camlan, Arthur's last battle in which he was allegedly so grievously wounded. It is has been located on Salisbury Plain, in Wales, on Hadrian's Wall and in East Anglia (near Walton Castle). Cornwell has chosen another location, in South Devon, which fits better with his story but in reality we simply do not know. Another point we know little about is what gave the Britons - and Arthur in particular - a military edge over the Anglo-Saxons. We know the latter had no cavalry whereas the Britons did at least have light skirmishing cavalry equipped with javelins. We also know that among the units of the Roman Army in Britain there was at least one (and probably initially several) units of heavily armoured Sarmatian cavalry equipped with lances. So Bernard Cornwell's choice, to make Arthur's horsemen into heavy armoured cavalry of the cataphract type is both possible and plausible.A fantastic read which would be worth seven stars (just like the two previous volumes) if this was possible."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"I waited until reading the entire series before writing a review, and I just finished Excalibur.A well written series with vivid characters and settings. This is not your standard Arthurian fanatsy novel filled with knights and witches. It is a book about men and how they deal with what life has to offer them, and yes their is magic but it is not what we are used to but magic made by Druids in attempts to control their world. You really get invested in the characters, especially Derfel who is the focus of the series as Merlin was in Mary Stewarts Trilogy. It is graphic in violence and the harsh judgments men had to make during that time period.In short I loved the entire series and recommend it to everyone who is interested in historical fiction and Arthurian lore, the books will be a fine addition to your collection."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"The final book of Bernard Cornwell's Warlord Chronicles is all about confrontation and final showdowns, whether it be in battle, against matters of faith, or between the wants of certain people. Readers familiar with the Arthurian saga know of Arthur's inevitable end, but Cornwell has created and developed a number of interesting subplots and characters that the reader has been following since the beginning of the trilogy, which are all resolved.Guenevere's infidelity with Lancelot has been revealed, though she professed it to be due to her prayers and offerings to the goddess Isis with the hopes of making Arthur king; she is now imprisoned. Lancelot has been revealed as the coward and traitor that he is and has defected to the Saxons. Meanwhile the Christians are becoming stronger and more dominating. Merlin has a plan though; to bring back the old gods and save Britain, however, it will require extreme sacrifices, which Arthur may not be willing to grant. Mordred has been overthrown for his evil ways, and is imprisoned, while Arthur rules, but the Saxons have plans to free the rightful heir and it will all come down to one last battle at Camlan.Readers who have come this far will not be disappointed with this great finale to the trilogy, which ends not with a resolution of Derfel as a monk in his monastery, but with the last page of Arthur and his sad end, with the hope that he will one day return to Britain.Originally written on March 17, 2012 Alex C.

I remember tears flowing when Cerdic (young Merlin's servant)died, and over the love affair that resulted in the birth of Merlin. I have re-read those books many times, and loved them every time. Now, I find another trilogy, different in approach and characterization perhaps, but equally magnificent in ability to pull the reader deep into the lives of these 5th century folk,such that you care so very deeply about them. I cared so much about Derfel (narrator and warband leader) and his family and friends(maybe a few enemies too), that I cried several times (deaths of Dian and Aelle and of course, at the expected ending). Minor quibbles such as repetition of some phrases or actions (like spitting and picking out lice), unpronounceable names, and repeated explanations of who is who did not diminish my enjoyment of these books. I suggest reading them in order,ending with Excalibur. I will no doubt re-read them soon, and many times thereafter."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"It's a tricky thing to end a series. To give a story a definitive finale that fulfills the expectations of the reader that have been built up since the first line of the first book. Questions have to be answered and satisfaction has to be meted out or the whole of the series can crumble under the weight of its own ending. With Bernard Cornwell's Excalibur, we come to the end of Arthur's tale and while it is a well written book and just as good as the first two installments, there are many questions left unanswered in the end and that choice might upset some readers. I actually found the way the book ended to be perfectly in line with the tone that's been developed from the first book onward and while there are some things I had hoped to see happen and some closure for certain characters gained, the story beats and the execution are top notch and as such I can view the series as a whole as a success and count it among one of the better written sagas I've ever finished."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Arthurian tales are forever telling us they offer a fresh approach. However, they all essentially retell the 12th century romances with some slight twist.Cornwell, who is the master of medieval British fiction, really mixes it up. Instead of the golden king of the English, we get the warlord of the Britons. Oh, sure, the good stuff is all still there- but there are no miraculously apparated stone castles or 13 th century anachronisms other than the names (Lancelot is not who you might think he should be, though!)Worth reading just to remind yourself how much of the Arthurian legend was out of sync with his supposed time period. The gread story and amazing characters are just frosting on the cake!Cornwell at his finest is pretty darned fine!"},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"This is the last book in the King Arther trilogy by Bernard Cornwell and is excellent. The whole trilogy is absolutely wonderful. Book received in great shape and timing as well. I highly recommend this trilogy."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"This is my review for all 3 of the series.1. The Winter King2. Enemy of God3. ExcaliburI have loved the Arthurian legend since I was a child. Starting with wrongly costumed anachronistic and terrible Hollywood spectacles when I knew no better to better productions and literature. I had not read any Bernard Cornwell until this series appeared, so this series was not what I had expected or was looking for. This was not legend. This was not mythical. This was not magical. This was cold hard reality in the 5th century.If you don't know as I didn't at the time, Bernard Cornwell writes military historical fiction. He does this primarily by making the main character a grunt on the battlefield. This initially turned me off as was making the main character nobody from the legend and spending a good deal of the first book focusing on his growing up almost totally out of sight of any characters you were hoping to read about.Bear with it. The reward is worth it. The attention to fact and detail serves to put you in the middle of the Arthurian legend and watch it unfold all around you as it might have been if it were real. No magic. No sword in a stone. No grail. But those things aren't totally missing. Merlin is feared as a powerful druid and wizard and should be. While magic may not be real, there have always been feared wizards/viziers/magicians throughout history. Watching this Merlin pull it off is amazing. The other frightening thing about this Merlin is that he is a true believer. No sword in a stone. However, there was another historical practice involving sword and stone. No grail but there were other vessels believed to hold power.What is also wonderful about this telling is that you can picture how this story could have been turned by bards into the fanciful and magical version of the story we know. The principals are here, Arthur, Merlin, Guinevere, Lancelot, Morgan and Nimue. Finally, Nimue as a major character.Don't let the military history thing put you off. It's good to get something believable in that area when there are a few battles to get through and having them without nonsense heroics and yet not tedious is welcome. But this story is a story first and it is character and story driven not only by ambition but love and tragedy and it is gripping. There is a point in the second book where one of the side stories reaches it's culmination and you are getting the re-telling of Tristan and Isolde. At it's conclusion I flung the book across the room and it was nearly a week before I could pick it up again. Rarely, has an author been able to create such emotion. The closest thing I can compare it to that others might know would be a scene towards the end of the HBO series, Game of Thrones.One other important thing about the author. He is well aware of the unacceptable customs, practices and attitudes of the time periods he writes. Rather than sugar coat them or turn a blind eye, he tends to give the main character experiences that cause them to turn away from such things naturally.I was prompted to write this review after watching and reviewing the disappointing Starz series Camelot which simply did it nearly all wrong. If you're in the mood for an Arthur story, forget that one and read this one.I learned one valuable thing. Arthur was a Briton and what that means is that the Arthurian legend survived solely because it was a legend told by his Saxon enemies who were the ultimate victors."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Note: This is pretty much identical to my review of the first 2 books, since this is more about the trilogy as a whole than the individual book. SPOILER FREE*****I was originally given the first book (The Winter King) as a gift when I was about 13 years old (about 9 years ago). I read it and loved it, but I had no idea it was part of a trilogy until I was in college. I was totally thrilled because not only did it mean I would get to start the first book over again, but that there were THREE books to carry this awesome Arthurian imagining by Mr. Cornwell.That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and the trilogy as a whole. Derfel Cadarn is one of the best characters in recent memory. I get a little tired of your all-too-common Mary Sues in fiction. Derfel is certainly nothing like this- while he truly grows and becomes a formidable warrior who remains honest and loyal, he never seems perfect and is always a humble knight and a delight to \\"listen\\" to. I can't begin to give justice to the characters that Mr. Cornwell has created in Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, Nimue, Merlin, and many more. Totally unique, but also completely justified in their own way that is still true to the legend and the possible history.But enough about the characters.... I initially got into this series because of the action and creativity, and there was PLENTY. I love the detailed battles, the gripping plot changes,etc. To put it simply: I love the action in this series, and there is never a dull moment. If you can forgive yourself for making up the name pronunciations for, I dunno, MOST of the places and people, then that is the only hurdle my friend, and a minuscule and historically accurate one at that.Please, do yourself a favor, and immerse your mind in the memorable world that Mr. Cornwell has masterfully built."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"I have to start by telling you I love Arthurian inspired novels. I've read and collected many over the years, from T.H.White's \\"The Once and Future King\\", Mary Stewart's trilogy, Stephen Lawhead's five book \\"Pendragon Cycle\\", along with books by Sharon Newman, Richard Monaco, A.A. Attanasio, Marion Zimmer Bradley, etc, etc, etc. Ever since I read the \\"The Sword in the Stone\\" in primary school, I have been spellbound by the story, and enjoy seeing each writer's perspective in their interpretation of the tale.Bernard Cornwell's interpretation of the Arthurian legend, \\"The Warlord Chronicles\\" begun with \\"The Winter King\\" and followed by \\"Enemy of God\\" and \\"Excalibur\\" is, in my opinion, the best so far. The Chronicles take the form of a reflection written by Derfal, one of Arthur's warriors, in old age retired to a monastery. Derfal delights in working behind his abbot's back (he was an old enemy), but he has the protection of his Queen, desperate for a good story. During his time with Arthur, Derfal rose through the ranks to become a brave and loyal commander and a trusted confidant. His position allowed him unique insight into the character of Arthur and all the other figures prominent in the legend. His personal journey leads to love and eventual marriage to a high borne woman, the joy and despair of fatherhood, finding his true ancestry and conversion from paganism to the fledgling Christianity.Most people are familiar in some way with the bones of the Arthurian legend, so I'm not going to tell you anything about the plot. Without deviating too far from the accepted story, in this retelling, Cornwell gives the legend substance. What makes it stand apart is the way he fleshes out the characters so they take on a reality other writers can only dream of (Nimue is particularly good). Cornwell's writing flows so effortlessly, and you quickly become engrossed by the people, the places and the strategy. You can smell the fires, taste the food and wine, feel the harsh winter cold, hear the terrified screams of women and children and see the battles unfold before you. I never thought I would enjoy reading battle scenes, but these (and there are many) are so well written, I didn't skip a word. The motivations of characters, explained by the often cruel and harsh lives they endured, become real. Life was just one huge struggle, no matter where and to whom you were born.\\"The Warlord Chronicles\\", which should be read in sequence, is a must for all fans of the Arthurian legend, but anyone who enjoys a well-written story of high adventure will find much to appreciate here."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Cornwell is, by far, is the best story teller. Excalibur is a wonderful ending to an epic that gives readers the chance to experience a believable tale of war, politics, romance, and tragedy. Cornwell's writing is challenging and intelligent, while his command of the English language is used subtly to paint a strong image of the aesthetic and personal personal descriptions of characters and scenes.This is a wonderful book and I would recommend reading the trilogy over and over."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"I read the whole Warlord Chronicles while I was visiting Cornwall, UK on a medical elective. This is the region where the story takes place, but it's called Kernow in the book. However, many places here still use the names that are mentioned in the book. It was truly satisfying to have read something in a novel, and then visit a town that was mentioned in the books and go, 'Hey whadya know! That really did happen'. You could see that Bernard Cornwell really did put much effort into researching his books, although it has to be said that a lot of Arthurian folklore is just that, folklore. There are lots of things that we can't be sure about, and this is where the author has done a fine job weaving myth and fact together. 'Excalibur' proved to be a worthy and sensible end to the trilogy. The Warlord Chronicles on the whole was a darn good read and definately recommended."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"It was the best book I have ever read, except (of course!)the previous two (The Winter King and Enemy of God). The book capture my all attention and imagination! Once I started, it was very difficult to stop and put it down. That's a trilogy about old Great Britain history, but most important about friendship and human relationships. Derfel is the most loving character and his loyalty to Arthur is amazing."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"King Arthur stories always start well, and end badly. This final volume of Cornwell's magnificent Arthur series ends the tale as well as it can be, with a battle solidly based in the real world, with stakes as high as the stars. But before the end, there is the final battle with the Saxons, the amazing Battle of Mount Badon, the thing Arthur was most famous for before the French poets got ahold of him. The very best piece of this novel is the redemption of his great love, and the brief period of peace they get to enjoy before the darkness of Mordred falls upon them. The final tale of Nimue, of Derfel and Ceinwyn, the truly deserved fate of Lancelot, all of it rings wonderfully true. Read this, soak in it, enjoy it before it's gone. Because it is the Arthur we've all wanted. The Arthur that makes sense. The Arthur we deserve."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Bernard Cornwell's outlook on Arthur may be surprising but is actually not of his own invention. Mary Steward started depicting Arthur as a Roman-born boy, but still made him a king. Bernard Cornwell- true to history, only makes him a warlord. In this way he does take away the fairy-tale like existence of a king of Brittain, but the history lovers cannot but applaud this. B.C. is not a romantic novels writer, hence probably his success with the male readers, but can be awfully realistic within a frame of romance, which one can only admire. B.C. does not give superstition and spiritual ways a big chance in his Warlord books, (Merlin is mostly a 'quack' etc.) but then he never does. Different but admirable, truer to history than any other Merlin and Arthur book."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Let me start by saying that I read the entire Trilogy and that a 3-star rating in my mind is \\"average\\" not \\"bad\\".While I really enjoyed Cornwell's version of the Arthur Legend and think he is an excellent historical fiction author, this book dragged for me. It was the repetitiveness of the battles and dialogue that kept this from getting a higher rating. Every shield wall was the same, same description, same qualities of the men in the wall. It felt almost copy and pasted at times. And the constant reminder that \\"fate is inexorable\\", which is somewhat redundant anyway as \\"fate\\" implies inexorability, was quite tedious. It is also mentioned all throughout the Saxon book seriesI didn't mind the violence, I thought that it was probably pretty accurate to the time period, no reason to sugar coat things.In the first 2 in the series I read the hardback which had a map printed in the front and back covers, I found those very helpful for keeping track of the action. I read the paperback of the this book which didn't have the map."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"The Warlord Chronicles is Bernard Cornwell's interpretation of the story of King Arthur. The trilogy is comprised of The Winter King, Enemy of God, and Excalibur and is told from the perspective of Derfel Cardan, a man that Britain's greatest druid Merlin plucked as a child from a death pit to become Arthur's most trusted warrior.Cornwell's is not the romanticized version of Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur or T.H. White's The Once and Future King. The historical Arthur is thought to have lived around the year 500, just after the Romans had abandoned Britain and the beginning of the Dark Ages. Cornwell stays true to that time. There are no knights in shining armour, but warlords in old Roman armour. There is no magic, only superstition and coincidence. There are no stone castles, but forts made of wood and earth. Decay is in the air. The Roman cities crumble, and knowledge of their construction and repair fades.The story begins with Uther Pendragon, King of Dumnonia and the High King of Britain, nearing death. His grandson, Mordred, is his heir; however, Mordred is only a baby. Arthur, a bastard of Uther, takes an oath of loyalty to Mordred and is chosen as Mordred's guardian. Until Mordred is old enough to rule Dumnonia himself, Arthur is effectively the king.Arthur dreams to unite the various kingdoms of Britain and push out the invading land-hungry Saxons. This is the story of Arthur. Over and over again, just when you think that Arthur's dream is to become a reality, the dream is shattered due to his own weaknesses, his sense of justice, the machinations of kings and those closest to him, the conflict between Christians and pagans, or most often his oath of loyalty to Mordred. Certainly, for a moment there is Camelot, but even then dark clouds are on the horizon.I highly recommend these books. As usual, Cornwell excels at describing the battles and the single combats. His take on characters is refreshing. For example, Lancelot is considered the greatest warrior in the land, not because of any actual accomplishments, but because of his ability to control his image, manipulate others, and pay the bards to sing his high praises; in truth, he is a coward. I've read many versions of the Arthur story. While it is difficult to rate one version against another as they are often so different, this is one of the best."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"In some of Cornwell's series, he never quite ends things, leaving open the possibility of more books.He doesn't take that route here; \\"Excalibur\\" gets to the end of the Arthurian legend, including Cornwell's version of how it really went down.A fine book, tinged with melancholy as you know where it's headed and wonder how many of the your beloved characters must die on the way.And it's sad because most of what Arthur has fought against his whole life, remains strong. Religious divisiveness remains as Christian kings refuse to support pagan Britons in their mutual struggle against the Saxons, and as Merlin and Nimue engage on a disturbing ploy to summon back the Britons' gods, including a creepy ritual involving the Treasures of Britain Merlin has so laboriously gathered. Arthur remarries, to a greedy and shallow teenager. Mordred undergoes an unexpected change - good at first but ultimately making him a more evil enemy.This book has some magic in it. Cornwell in the earlier books avoids it, showing Druids showing their power more in the sway they have over others, the fear they inspire, and their prophecies of the future. They are made sympathetic to us because, hey, it's always fun to have a powerful, wisecracking wizard like Merlin on the good guys' side.Here, Cornwell lets them have some magic. It adds drama to the book's climax and burnishes the end of the Arthurian saga without turning this into some hokey fantasy novel.There are the expected fine battle moments, notably Cornwell's reimagining of the battle of Myddyd Baddon, or Mount Badon, about which little is known historically, even its site. Cornwell puts it near present-day Bath. Here, one more time, the Britons, led by Derfel, are sure they face their doom when surrounded on a hilltop by the entire Saxon army - and where an unexpected hero arises.Who is the son of a king - and who is the bastard son of a king - figures prominently in this book, the latter categoryincluding Arthur, Derfel and Galahad. Derfel meets his father, Aelle, the Saxon warlord Derfel and Arthur have spent their whole adult lives fighting.What happens to Guinevere after the exposure of her infidelity with Lancelot (and others) in the second book takes a surprising turn.And we learn more about Derfel. What happens to his family, and how he loses his hand. Cornwell sets up a nice feint on that one; it's not what you expect but equally dramatic. And how Derfel comes, in his old age, to be a monk serving the hated Sansum, but secretly, and in collusion with a young queen, writing the chronicles of Arthur, the legend he knew and loved."},{"Title":"Excalibur (The Arthur Books #3)","review":"Excalibur is a wonderful conclustion to Conrwell's Arthurian trilogy. His shield wall descriptions hit new heights. Nearly all the pieces carefully built up in the earlier books come neatly together. My only complaint is that the ending was a bit flat. A few details go unexplained and the tale just ends. A couple of pages closing some loops would have been more rewarding."},{"Title":"THE FAR-OUT WORLDS OF A.E.

The first wasAway and Beyond, which only had two good stories and the rest was chaff.

Now the third collection, Far Out Worlds, holds two excellent stories, some pretty good ones and also a handful of duds, IMHO.Replicators - 3/5 - Marine-cum-farmer kills monster and thereby makes an enemy who vows to kill him before leaving earth, but the government had a different idea. 22 pagesFirst Martian - 4/5 - An Andean engineer is brought to Mars to withstand the pressure and temperature extremes but the likely emigration of more South Americans will put other, now disgruntled workers, out of work. 15 pagesThe Purpose - 2/5 - An investigative reporter stumbles upon a bizarre clinic, is murdered for her snooping, her body kidnapped and reincarnated with her organs in storage by the same clinic, whose intentions are obviously malevolent. 41 pagesThe Earth Killers - 3/5 - Major American cities are nuked as a test pilot witnesses one of the bombs descend from space. His testimony is refuted and is sent to prison, only to later escape in search of the truth. 29 pagesThe Cataaaaa - 4/5 - One man's high school buddy comes back to town with the circus and his freakshow with the star attraction... a cat; that also happens to want to speak with the man. 14 pagesAutomaton - 3/5 - In the midst of a human and robot/clone war is the plight of an enslaved human pilot for the robots, who has been shot down by the humans. How will the humans entice the robotic-minded human back to their side and at the same time disgust the robots. 12 pagesItself! - 3/5 - An autonomous submarine sentry initiates an underwater sea battles with an alien boat bent on earth's destruction. 3 pagesProcess - 5/5 - A sentient forest challenges arboreal neighbors and a spaceship that has landed among its' woodlands, which soon departs after being warned away with micro-mined uranium ore. 6 pagesNot the First - 2/5 - The \`new, stupendous atomic drive' isn't jibbing well with space beyond light speed and the crew are parsecs from earth, no way home with no electricity and no hope. 15 pagesFulfillment - 5/5 - A hermetic computer from future earth time travels back to modern day where it meets another supercomputer and begins to go through the means to assume it or defeat it. 24 pagesShip of Darkness - 2/5 - Man time travels to three million AD and experiences a black obelisk oh humans traveling nude through space who are off to spiritual war with another obelisk.

An Integrated Approach to German Language and Culture (2nd Edition)","review":"Everything from grammar and vocabulary to culture is well explained in this book, it is full of images and exercises which help students understand the language and start thinking in German. I had the honor of being taught by two of the authors, who happen to be brilliant professors, and since they have experience teaching German, they understand the difficulties students face when studying the language, which I think has been taken into consideration in this book.

It has enabled me to discuss things more intelligently with my doctor. Also I want to warn you there is lot of pseudo-science out there.

It is a nice quiet read for slow evenings or sitting on your porch. It is not great literature , but doesn't pretend to be.If you are not familair with series you might be happier staring with earlier books to familiarize yourself with the charecters.The chintz n'china series is not rolicking excitemtn, nor as much fantasy with demons and elves as the authors moon sister series.This book is more female romance mystery type novels. It is about witch and therefore might be viewed as normal fantasy reading. But the fantasy and magic plays second fiddle to a more classic murder mystery type of novel.so if you like murder mystery's, with strong female heroines and a little magic thrown in on the side go for it. If expecting a scary horror film, a demon war, lots of elves and unicorms look eleswhere."},{"Title":"Murder Under A Mystic Moon","review":"After loving the first two entries in the series, I found this one lacking. First, where was the 'chitz and china'...? Emerald, whose, um, excuse the expression 'redneck' side seems to be increasingly emerging... needs to return to the shop! I found this tome a bit rambling, seemingly not as well conceptualized as former entries and therefore not as well executed or as compelling. It also begins to seem we're seeing way too much of the boyfriend, who's pretty predictable and isn't a terribly interesting or well-developed character... I was also disheartened that the writer brought in one new and one returning character only to see them dropped without any real significance to the plot... One 'donated' a crystal ball that also hardly figured in the plot and the other was an old boyfriend who appeared briefly, and then was never heard of again... What was that about? Here's hoping future chintz and china mysteries are more akin to the first two than to this one...

I want to keep knowing what happens next."},{"Title":"Murder Under A Mystic Moon","review":"I wouldn't say that this is the best installment yet, but it was pretty entertaining...but probably not for the reasons you think.After finishing my reading of this novel I realized something about the Chintz 'n China mysteries....they're not really about the mystery, they're about the characters. To be honest, the characters are the only reason I enjoyed this book. I didn't really care about the Klakatat monster or even the murder \\"mystery\\" (which falls flat on its face, by the way).Now, I have to complain about the sex scenes again. They were just a bit too graphic and they seemed out of place in a novel like this. I don't know about the other readers, but I really don't care about Emerald's sex life. Now, don't get me wrong; I'm not uptight about this stuff. I've read novels (Michael Cunningham's come to mind) which can be very graphic in that department, but at least those kinds of scenes belonged there and went right along with character development. In the Chintz 'n China novels, they're just an annoying distraction.All in all, don't expect a good (or even decent) mystery, but read it for the characters.

Taken individually, any one of these unbelievable outcomes would spoil a good mystery, but when all occur in the same novel within the final two chapters, the result is a Regrettable Read.Murder Under A Mystic Moon was my first read by Yalenorn, (a quick read) and I was so disappointed by the sugary ending that it spoiled the mild enjoyment I felt for this cozy story and put me off future novels in the Chintz N' China mystery series. I was initially attracted to the novel because of the plot outline: Emerald, an amateur psychic with two kids, helps a friend locate a missing biker buddy that police believe is a victim of cougar attack, but Emerald \\"knows there's something else wandering the forest--something that resembles the Klakatat monster of legend....\\" A mystery novel with a Psychic, a Mysterious Forest, a Monster, and Bikers--how could this story go wrong?Well, I'll tell you how. Pack in a whole lot of Emerald eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner (plus extended descriptions of her caffeine addiction and various espresso drinks), following Emerald about her daily life on tangents to Yoga class, and polish off the story with the aforementioned ending, and you end up with a mildly enjoyable \\"mindless\\" mystery that offers no challenge to readers whatsoever with its wildly unfocused plot.The basic plot is straightforward enough: Emerald's psychic talents are requested by her biker friend Jimbo to locate his missing friend. However, too many tangent side-plots interrupt the main thread of the story: Emerald's longtime feud with her nemesis--who happens to be a local TV reporter, her mothering of her children, and her blossoming relationship with her boyfriend Joe. These sub-plots, which could have enhanced the story, instead slog the pacing due to unfailingly ideal outcomes. There is no hint of true suspense that Emerald's relationship may suffer a few snags, her children might get in real trouble or fail to understand life lessons she is trying to teach them, or that her rivals will succeed in smearing her good name or causing true harm to her life. Conflicts are created and resolved in predictable sequence, and this lack of tension makes for a lackluster mystery. I found myself skating over excessive lines of description detailing Emerald's happy reaction to unsurprising conflict resolutions in order to get back to main story.The mystical descriptions of the novel with enjoyable and interesting, but its protagonist Emerald, while likeable, is somewhat of a goody-two-shoes. The story is peppered with annoying antagonists: Cathy Sutton--bleached-blonde local TV reporter with an attitude whose petty spite targets Emerald multiple occasions, George Pleasant (who is anything but) Cathy's intern cousin and amateur psychic with a gargantuan ego who slanders Emerald on TV and verbally maligns her in almost every scene, Roy--her cheating, slime-ball ex-husband that ignores his two kids and is verbally abusive to Emerald via telephone calls, and Anthony--her cheating ex-boyfriend who dumped Emerald for a starlet and makes a reappearance to get her back. Contrast these repulsive characters with an unrealistically perfect, faultlessly devoted Fireman boyfriend who worships Emerald and her kids, and Emerald's apparent refusal to stand up to any of these irritating personalities except in her mind, and you end up with Mary Jane Mom--the girl next door who can do no wrong.If you enjoy mindless, predictable mysterious with Scooby-Doo endings and kitschy atmosphere, give this novel a try. If, like me, you prefer SOME element of realism to your tale, skip this series like a bad cold."},{"Title":"Murder Under A Mystic Moon","review":"I have enjoyed this series as I have all the books Ms Galenorn has written.

The coroner rules he was killed by a cougar but Emerald and Murray sense it was a human who murdered him even though there are many elementals in the area who could have been responsible for the deed. When another biker is killed in the same place, Gordon, another psychic, is arrested but Emerald's worst enemy asks for her help in proving her cousin's innocence. Since Emerald believe George not guilty, she sets out to prove that the police arrested the wrong man and she won' let the Klakatat monster or the elementals stop her.MURDER UNDER a Mystic MOON is a refreshingly innovative paranormal mystery that will appeal to a wide range of mystery aficionados. The heroine is very frightened of what she sees and knows in the etheral world but she still uses her psychic powers to go the extra mile to see that justice prevails even if it means putting her own life in danger.

Set in the fictional village of Bracebridge, Massachusetts, this first in what one hopes will be a long series of historical mysteries is steeped in rich period detail and lively characterizations. Through adept dialogue and insightful interior monologues, Ms. Miles makes the past resonate for modern readers; remarkably, she manages to do so while never stepping outside the constraints of what was known and believed in 1763. This thoughtful research, coupled with fine writing and a page-turning plot, is sure to kindle mystery readers' interest in &quot;A Wicked Way to Burn.&quot;In contrast to the Victorian mysteries by Anne Perry, Ms. Miles' prose is concise, offers flashes of wry humor, and thankfully avoids the former's tendency toward climbing on a soapbox. While Ms. Miles occasionally tweaks the village parson for his self-righteous hypocrisy, the only ax this author has to grind is for chopping wood to heat up Charlotte Willett's tea kettle. With an entertaining plot, intelligent and engaging characters like Mrs. Willett and her scientifically-inclined neighbor Richard Longfellow, and a fresh perspective on life in the Colonies, there's every reason to look forward to the pleasure of a return visit to Bracebridge.Karen Lyon"},{"Title":"A Wicked Way to Burn","review":"It is a fine line which Margaret Miles successfully treads, crossing a lively and well-paced mystery with a text that is historically accurate. The command of her scholarship is evident in the everyday details she provides about life in 18th century Massachusetts, yet her character development is modern, which is a major reason that the story is so riveting. This is a complicated murder mystery with none of the modern conveniences available in either weapons or forensics. Yet, again, due to the author's bone-deep scholarship, the whole premise is compelling and believable. A wonderful read, can't wait to get the next one in the series!"},{"Title":"A Wicked Way to Burn","review":"As I am fond of the historical fiction genre and also enjoy mysteries, I was intrigued by the premise of this book. The events take place in 1763 in the small village of Bracebridge, located in the colony of Massachussetts. Charlotte Willett is a young widow who resides within the confines of the village. Her keen intelligence and her penchant for getting to the bottom of things make her a natural sleuth. When a traveling merchant appears to have been a victim of spontaneous combustion, disappearing without a trace, her curiosity is peaked, and she is determined to get to the bottom of the matter.Of course, as this is colonial America, the actions and rights of women are circumscribed by the mores and custom of the times. So, Charlotte has to rely on some of her male friends for assistance in overcoming some of the restrictions governing her actions. In this, she has a willing accomplice in her neighbor and friend, Richard Longfellow, a gentleman landowner and an amateur scientist.The characters in the book are well-fleshed, and Charlotte Willett is an especially engaging one. Although the book was a Mystery Guild Signature Selection, however, I did not find the mystery itself to be all that interesting. The strength of the book lies more in the historical fiction aspect, as the author captures the flavor of early colonial America, making it a somewhat interesting read for those who are fans of the genre."},{"Title":"A Wicked Way to Burn","review":"I loved this book! I think that is has everything in that goes on to make a great mystery. There is a complex plot, lots of suspects and a surprise ending. The main character is Charlotte Willet, a young widow living in a small New England town in 1763. She finds herself in the middle of a perfect riddle and manages to come out of it with grace.The supporting characters include her neighbor Rich Longfellow, an aspiring scientist with a Holmes quality to him; his sister Diana, a Boston, pampered lady who is smarter than people think and Lem, a young boy who works for Charlotte and wants to go to Harvard one day. The whole cast is wonderful and they add color to the overall story.The mystery: a man who just flashed some gold in a local tavern seems to burst into flames and disappear! This is spotted by a local who begins to weave a strange story. This whole novel had a old-time flavor to it and is one of the best modern mysteries that I have read. Oh, by the way, the history is accurate and really places the story in time and place. I highly recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"A Wicked Way to Burn","review":"Ms. Miles has done a superb job of capturing the atmosphere of early America - furthermore, the images of New England fall ring wonderfully true. Those images of leaves turning, cool nights and harvest end offered some small relief to this reader suffering through a blazing hot Kansas August.Charlotte Willett, the main character, is intelligent and self confident, without undermining the realistic treatment of her place as a widow in colonial society. I was much impressed by this balance as achieved by the author.The developing political pressures between the colonies and England are present, and offer hope for additional volumes set in increasingly turbulent times. All in all, well researched, convincingly written and with well paced plot turns. I am seeking out the additional volumes immediately."},{"Title":"A Wicked Way to Burn","review":"The book has been summarized already.

The plot premise was great, but I felt that Margaret Miles added so many \\"unexpected\\" twists, turns, and subplots that I had trouble keeping everything and everyone straight. Her characters were very one-dimensional, and they stayed that way throughout the story. Also, I could not sympathize with ANY of the characters, even the widow whose life was threatened several times. The climax of the story was extremely disappointing; Miles rushed through it, and it was over before I knew it. The denouement tied up most of the loose ends, but it was boring and too drawn-out. I think she tried to create a bit of an 'are-the-two-main-characters-going-to-eventually-get-together' subplot, but it really didn't work well. Finally, some of the conclusions drawn by the characters surrounding the mystery were so far-reaching, I had a hard time believing it.

Verbal Icon is a collection of some dozen essays penned during the decade of the 1940s. Most of these essays are rarely read today except by specialists in poetic theory, but two essays have lingered in numerous anthologies as being the very heart and soul of the New Criticism: \\"The Intentional Fallacy\\" and its sister essay \\"The Affective Fallacy.\\" The overarching purpose of both was to codify what to them were self-evident axioms, the majority of which dealt with their refusal to admit the validity of a \\"designing intellect\\" that requires the reader/critic to ascertain the author's stated or implied intention as part of the interpretive process. Wimsatt and Beardsley had a rather simple touchstone for determining the meaning (or what they termed the \\"organic unity\\") of a text. If an author, usually a poet, succeeded in making it clear to the reader that the poem had one and only one clear meaning, then this \\"clear\\" meaning inhered only within the poem itself as if it were a buried jewel waiting to be dug up by the reader/excavator. All other secondary meanings were not judged worthy of being hailed as primary and were to be discarded. It followed then that if the reader failed to identify this organic unity, it was not his fault; rather the fault lay in the poet who quite frankly was overly inept in constructing this unity by failing to integrate a host of factors ranging from figurative language to denotation/connotation to the physical structure of the work itself. Related to their axioms of a poem's autotelic qualities was their distinction between the ideological struggle that poet Archibald MacLeish saw as the difference between a poem's meaning and \\"be-ing.\\" As far as Wimsatt and Beardsley were concerned the \\"truth\\" of an axiom of science was not the same \\"truth\\" of a poem. The former was incontestable and provable while the latter had relevance only in the fuzzily designed universe of human aesthetic experience. They asserted that since a poem was no more than artfully assembled words on paper it followed that any attempt to judge those words must be limited to those same words. The autonomous structure of a poem had no room to include either authorial intention (the Intentional Fallacy) or the emotive response of the reader (the Affective Fallacy). They averred that if either fallacy were to intrude in any judgment of the meaning of the poem, then the result must inevitably degrade into a morass of relativity from which no universally accepted unity could emerge.The counter movement against the formalistic theories of New Critics like Wimsatt and Beardsley did not begin with the deconstructive tenets of Jacques Derrida in 1967. Structuralism as an alternate theory began to emerge at about the same time as Verbal Icon was hitting the book stores. Critics of formalism were aghast at the penchant of New Critics to isolate a text from any connection to the outside world. Their telling rejoinder was that if a text were truly to be examined only using the words on the page, then how would its adherents like Wimsatt and Beardsley justify their willingness to include symbolism as a needed adjunct if the act of symbol-hunting required the reader to search for external markers of that symbol? Further, they argued that if the organic unity also required the erudite reader to similarly peek within the Oxford English Dictionary to locate synonyms, antonyms, and temporally limited archaisms, then the very concept of an autotelic self-sustaining text was a fiction. Within just a few years, the widespread existence of New Criticism as a tool for poetic explication began to fade, to be replaced by the post-structuralist credo that the concept of Eternal Truths was the same fiction that caused formalism to be discarded. A final irony in the passing of formalism is that the close reading required by New Critics is still being used by all post-structuralists even as they denigrate thinkers like Wimsatt and Beardsley."},{"Title":"The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry","review":"One of the greatest and most important works of literary theory ever written.

I have often hailed the \\"Lost Classics\\" series published by Crippen & Landru for their genuinely terrific work in bringing back out of print material, but this time they've gone to the well once too often. People love Julian Symons, but i have never known why. They think of him as the Graham Greene of detective fiction, but I expect that he was sort of a clubby, fraternal guy otherwise how could he have won all those awards like the Diamond Dagger? He's hardly a good writer, he just imitated whatever was in the air in \\"mainstream\\" fiction and copied it in detective writing.Most trying of all are these tiny little stories that remind me of the stories they used to anthologize for subteens called \\"Minute Murders.\\" Quarles always traps the guilty party by using the most ridiculous of \\"evidence\\"--an art critic, for example, who doesn't know that Picasso was from Spain. Or how about the fellow whose American aunt uses \\"lift\\" for elevator and \\"pavement\\" for sidewalk. Guilty! In all of these cases there are 100 plausible reasons for the \\"mistake\\" in question, and yet they are each presented as the smoking gun in Quarles' brilliant arsenal of little grey cells. You won't believe your eyes. Yes, Ellery Queen did the same sort of thing--it didn't work for Ellery Queen either. And wait till you read Symons' dying message stories, they will make you appreciate Queen's all the more. In one story, a dying bibliophile arranges five books on his desk as he slips into death. Quarles deduces that these books spell the name of the killer. It's beyond inane, it must have been some sort of parlor game for old Symons.The more I read, eventually I passed the point where the formula was bothering me, and I began to enjoy the subtle, minute variations in the tales. And yet still, it's a pretty negligible return. I do notice that the editor, John Cooper, while printing 41 brief cases here, left out many of the tales because some depend on data we couldn't possibly know about nowadays, such as what London telephone operators used to say in the 1950s. IMHO he should have printed them all, for the excluded stories couldn't possibly be more banal than the ones Cooper gives us, and at least we could then have the pleasure of the completist.Hello, Crippen & Landru! 1) for goodness sake get a proof reader! On the back jacket it says, \\"The book is edited John Cooper.\\" What? Did the word \\"by\\" vanish from the sentence? And 2) please hurry with the book you have promised giving us the short fiction of Mignon G. Eberhart! Now there's one to anticipate."},{"Title":"The Detections of Francis Quarles (Lost Classics)","review":"I'm not much for gory, long-winded mystery stories. As a lover of Ellery Queen and Issac Asimov short stories (puzzles, play-fair-with reader plots), this collection by Julian Symons is a real gem.

He went to war, learned history, and then he was 'kidnapped' into a world that his father couldn't have ever dreamed up, in his worst pictures of hell, and heavier than even his footsteps.A religious sect, 'Styphon' who had discovered the secret of gunpowder, which they call 'fireseed', is trying to control the world (as they know it), by control of the people who pray to their god . . . and prayer is mandatory! to this world, Calvin Morrison is a kingmaker, and Calvin - now known as 'Lord Kalvan' is the king he makes. Through battles, and historical (near) references, he begins to guide his world, which had stagnated, into the future. Helped by the Paratime Police Force, he begins winning battles . . . and through the first book, written by H. Bean Piper, and the next two, both written by John F. Carr, he hasn't lost one yet . . . except maybe by marrying a queen . . ."},{"Title":"Kalvan Kingmaker","review":"In Kalvan Kingmaker, John F. Carr continues his homage to H. Beam Piper's Paratime hero Lord Kalvan, a.k.a. Pennsylvania state trooper Calvin Morrison. Building on the action from the authorizedLord Kalvan of Otherwhensequel--Great Kings' Warco-authored with Roland Green--Carr's Kingmaker begins after Kalvan has defeated the armies of the Great Kingdom of Hos-Harphax, which had been backed by the theocratic Styphon's House. Now Kalvan's Great Kingdom of Hos-Hostigos faces the full might of the Holy Host of Styphon, led by the fanatical and ruthless Archpriest Roxthar, as well as hordes of barbarian nomads driven from the Sea of Grass by Styphon's Grand Master Soton and the Order of Zarthani Knights.Meanwhile, the events of Kalvan's Fourth Level Aryan-Transpacific Sector timeline become increasingly embroiled in political turmoil among the First Level Paratimers responsible for Kalvan's accidental transposition to this alternate world. Paratime Police Chief Verkan Vall--undercover \\"out-time\\" as a key military advisor to Kalvan--has begun to suspect that a vast criminal organization of First Level Paratimers--the \\"Wizard Traders\\" of Piper's short novelTime Crime--has begun to exploit timelines in the Styphon's House Subsectors adjoining Kalvan's own timeline.Carr, editor of four anthologies of Piper's work (Paratime,Federation, Empire, andThe Worlds of H. Beam Piper) and described by long-time collaborator Jerry Pournelle as \\"a recognized authority on the life and works of H. Beam Piper,\\" uses his extensive familiarity with Piper's Paratime setting to craft a compelling story that begins to move beyond Kalvan's ongoing struggle with Styphon's House to a brewing crisis at the very heart of First Level Paratime civilization. The story continues in Carr'sSiege of Tarr-Hostigos."},{"Title":"Kalvan Kingmaker","review":"John Carr's Kalvan Kingmaker is a poor overly complicated and dark follow on to Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen and the Great Kings War. Lost the original vibe and positive outlook of the Original Piper, and follow on by Roland Green and John Carr. Could not get into the book, perhaps if this was the first i read, i would not be so critical. Carr's writing is good, just seems to have lost his way from Pipers original concept."},{"Title":"Kalvan Kingmaker","review":"The author has stayed fairly true to the Piper tone, but the characters have lost some of the subtle depth that Piper was able to inject. Kalvin has become far more all-knowing than Piper would have allowed and the villains more black than white. Nonetheless, it was nice to revisit the worlds of Paratime!"},{"Title":"Kalvan Kingmaker","review":"being a fan of h beam piper i was delighted when the sequel ( the great king's war,kalvan 2) came out. not being in the loop i did not know of the other sequels until recently .i enjoyed kalvan 3 except for 2 problems i.e. the over expansion of characters and the lack of a paperback version.i guess the 21st cent. version is kindle.i'll save my money and perchase kalvan 4 soon, reluctently.9"},{"Title":"Requiem for a Lightning Bolt","review":"Scorza concludes his pentalogy initiated with \\"Redoble por Rancas\\" with this superb novel. Book after book of that series, the drama of insurrections in Peruvian indigenous communities unfolds in the Central Andes. In a cycle of optimism and tragedy every insurrection against the despotic domination is mercilessly crushed. Ominous, huge like the Andes the shadow of a powerful mining corporation remains as the backdrop for most of the novel until the end when it engulfs in blood and death the main characters. Scorza paints the struggle of the Peruvian peasants with a master's brush. Incredibly exquisite subordinate tales intertwined with the central thread of the story to give it a deeper meaning: the story of Maca Albornoz and her forbidden love for his brother, prophecies announced in a weaving (parallel to The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury), the honest lawyer Genaro Ledesma sent to study by the communities, etc. Yet, the novel also relates the constant lack of vision of leftist politicians who fail to evolve out of their dogmas to learn from social movements as they unfold with originality and audacity. To reinforce how involved the author was in the struggle for social justice in his own country he includes himself into the story. \\"La Tumba del Rel&aacute;mpago\\" is not only a denunciation of the abuses committed by transnational corporations and their caporals, i. e. corrupt local officers, but also of the shortsightedness and selfishness of some seemingly progressive militants. Then the universality of Scorza's tale becomes more relevant if one compares those Andean communities with Chiapas. Just change the geography but the exploitation and the ever-present bully remain the same."},{"Title":"Clamp School Detectives, Book 1","review":"This is a manga for those looking for a break from those with heavy subject matter or ones with complicated emotions. This is a manga for those young at heart, for anyone with a fun-loving spirit and a non-cynical attitude.I read this manga intially because my brother purchased it and had me read it. It took me a while to read because I lost it. At first I didn't think it was anything special, but once I'd finished it the first volume, I fell in love with the fun stories. The plots are far-fetched and the idea of finding three 9-11yrs who are this smart and rational, is highly unlikely but that is why this manga is fun! The characters are cardboard cut-outs (in the best sense, however), and no real character development what-soever, if you are looking for that, look elsewhere.The manga follows Nokoru Imonoyama, Suoh Takamura, and Akira Ijuyuin, the three members of the Clamp Elementary School Board. They begin solving crimes and mysteries to help Damsels in Distress. And this manga follows their \\"mini\\" cases. I hope that in the 2nd volume(which I will be reading shortly), they will be developed a little more character-wise. :D That the mysteries they solve will be harder as well! :)It's a light, fun, and fluffy read, and if you are looking for something to help you escape reality, because this manga has zero bearing on reality, then it is most likely something you will enjoy!God Bless ~Amy"},{"Title":"Clamp School Detectives, Book 1","review":"I love this series, it's very cute and different. I've read the entire series, and even though there are only 3 books there is still a lot of story. (especially in the third book where you find out how the eldest boys met) I also love how this book overlaps with &quot;man of many faces&quot;, which is all about akira-san. I recommend it, its even cuter and funnier than this series. (not that all clamp's works aren't great, lol) I've been told it also overlaps with 'Duklyon High School Defenders&quot; (these series are all based in the Clamp school universe), but i dont own that series!This book is really cheery, one that can easily lighten your mood!"},{"Title":"Clamp School Detectives, Book 1","review":"I thought this book was excellent because the pictures are great and there is nothing bad about the book.

It is about three young boys who put up a detective agency. They are also the class board.They are the smartest boys in Clamp School. They solve mysteries and help damsels in distress. I recommend this book. ^^"},{"Title":"Clamp School Detectives, Book 1","review":"I'm sure all of you have at least HEARD of the infamous Chipmunks, even if you have never watched the show. Well, they have come to the world of manga in the form of three elementary school boys at the prestigious CLAMP Academy.Nokoru Imonoyama equates to Alvin. They are both ladykillers, lazy, creative(in order to get out of doing something or doing something more extragantly than it needs to be), and both lead their trio. They are the most popular, although the others have their groupies as well.Suoh Takamura is Simon's counterpart. Calm, cool, and collected, both have to suffer through their leader's outrageous schemes and attempt to talk sense. They are smart, kinda bookish, really. And they are the tallest in the group. They even have the same favorite color--blue. Suoh's hair is blue, and Simon always wears that blue shirt.Akira Iyijun (I can't spell his name) is Theodore, just without the baby fat and fur. An excellent cook, Akira can almost always be found cooking something; Theodore can always be found eating, even when he is the one cooking. They are shorter and younger than their brothers/friends.It's just kinda creepy how many similarities are evident between these two series. That doesn't mean C S Detectives is bad--as a matter of fact, it is very good.I just had to point out this little tidbit of information."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"Hey, I love the Mode series books, if you haven't read this book yet you might not want to read further-- I'm going to mention things you might not want to know. First off, congrats to Darian and Colene, but also, I give my regards (trying to not spoil here). Although I like these books, I'm kinda wishing Anthony would get them to Darian's world already, but between that they sure do have hectic tavelings!

I was sorry to see no further additions to the series since I work in a library and certainly would have snatched the next one up and devoured it. I certainly hope that once Mr. Anthony sees that we are starving for the next book in this series he won't make us wait too much longer. I want to find out who the mind monster is and if coleen ever straightens her suicidal nature out or winds up finding someone else to love. Does she ever get enough joy to marry Darius in his own mode or does something else prevent them from coming together."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"Chaos Mode is the third book(and hopefully not the last) in the mode series. The series is full of colorful charicters that you can't help but feel sorry for. From the beggining when you are in the bathroom with Colene you feel your heart go out to her. And she isn't the only one that has real depth in this story. The girl that got burned with cigarret butts is another. I loved how she ended up in a world where you remember your futer and not your past so she ended up happy in the end. Anyway this is a story with characters that reach out and grab you. I hope he doesn't stop writing them now."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"I have never read a Piers Anthony book that didn't impress me. Mostly, I have read books in the Xanth series, and I found this particular book to be a great departure from that particular style.This book was not really that funny, but more series, with amusing situations and a more in-depth storyline than Xanth books.Although it wasn't like Xanth, I was pleasantly surprised to see this different style written by Piers."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"I especially enjoyed the careful detail and fluent story-line in both the book and the series. I strongly suggest that the reader reads the series in order so as not to distort the plot in any way. The theme stays more or less the same throughout: Five people travel through different worlds each for their own reason. Everything else, however, is subject to change, including the people and the path taken (since both are connected somehow). Because of this I am surprised that the story seemed to flow so smoothly. In any case, I enjoyed the variety. It distressed me greatly when I found that the story ended so abruptly. I sincerly hope that the fourth book will be soon in comming."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"I've read a lot of reviews on here, i've noticed mostly good ones, but a few weren't... Although i believe everyone has a right to an opinion, i think that the people writing these reviews were EXTREMELY conservative... Conservatives, are people who admire radical centuries, long after they're dead, maybe they should learn to appreciate our century and these books more... &lt;G&gt;Anyway, the series is wonderful, with rich, and highly detailed characters. i would say colene was my favorite, she has so many qualities, but she can not see them, tis a shame...Hope Piers writes another book in the series soon! &lt;G&gt;"},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"For those who have read this book and have nothing better to do than complain about its repetitiveness I say, Get a Life! Piers reminds the reader of Colene's mental state so that we don't lose perspective of her perspective. Mr.Anthony has given, by far, the best representation of a suicidal teenager girl I have ever seen from a person who hasn't experienced it first hand. I should know. I've been close. Although I DO have a problem with the excessive amount of nudity in this book, I don't let that get in the way of the excellence of the story. Elizabeth Pearson- age 16"},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"As usual, Piers Anthony comes through with another great book. I have really enjoyed the Mode series and can't wait for a next one. I sure hope there is a next one!!! I didn't think I could find another series that I liked as much as the XANTH series but I have. Chaos Mode as book 3 just keeps my interest going."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"I am person who finds it difficult to read books. It takes me months to read a book, even though I am glued to the story-line. The &quot;Mode Series Books&quot; have been the most amazing books I have ever read. I love the research that Piers does to bring his books alive. I really felt sorry in a way for Coline but I was happy to see her find a love, and excitement in her life. I also loved Marsey Doats and Seqiro who were true friends for Coline. Can't wait for the next book in the series, hurry up Piers Anthony."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"This is a very good book as all the books in this series are. However, if the only thing you've seen of Piers Anthony is his Xanth series that is so popular, then you may want to screen this for the kids. All of these books deal with adult issues. You can judge whether someone is mature enough to read it, but all the books in this series follow a girl who is suicidal, the older man she loves and who loves her and their various companions. They deal with issues like suicide, rape, sex, etc... They do it in good way that is relevant and fits into the story. The story is about a girl Coleen, who was raped at a party once. Her father is an adulterer and her mother is a drunk. She puts on a good act and is a very popular girl on the outside, but cuts her self and frequently contemplates suicide, though she's very smart. One day on the way home from school, she comes across a man passed out in a ditch. Her suicidal nature leads her to take him home. After learning a little of each others language, he says that he's from another world/mode and that he wants to take her to be his wife there. She doesn't believe him and he disappears. She believes him and realizes she's made a mistake and he realizes he shouldn't have left. The method he takes is random though and the only way to reliably get back to Coleen is by invoking a virtual mode. The rest of the story is about how Coleen and Darren are trying to find each other and get back to his mode. They continuously encounter problems and solve them with the help of their friends from the other anchor modes. The whole time Coleen is trying to deal with her issues so that she can be with Darren in a health relationship. So there are many different things going on in this series and I have just gone over the general gist so that I don't give anything away. Everything is done in a tasteful manner, but as I said it contains very adult subject matter. Enjoy."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"I have enjoyed his books for a while, and I couldn't wait till the next book came out! Too bad it ended after only four volumes. A fun, light read if you enjoy witty fantasy/sci-fi."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"Anthony spends too much time in this book setting up scenery and action and although the characters interact, I don't get the sense that they care too much either way. Colene's science teacher introduction was good, but I can't understand why AFTER she was [forced to make love] she got a crush and started flirting with the teacher. And it was INCREDIBLY convenient that the one thing she remembers in biology has to do with Burgess. An ok read, but didn't make me jump out of my seat."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"You need to read the first two books if you want to understand the third book. If you don't read the first two books you will be lost, and won't even understand the story's plot. You could read it through for about five chapters, and you will start understanding what is going on. It would be better if you read the first two books because it would make more sense to you. This book is about a thrilling science fictional story of people living in the parallel worlds. In the third book three old friends unite. Their names are: Colene, a young girl from earth who is dealing with terrible suicidal depressions, Darius, from a planet who also won Colene's love, and Seqiro a telepathic horse. Some parts of this book drags on. But it's worth reading through because the action parts are so unbelievable it will blow away your mind! The author, Piers Anthony, writes every chapter with such suspense that it tempts you to read the next chapter. Once you start reading this book you can't put it down till you finish it."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"I thought that this whole series was one of Mr. Anthony's best. His ability to write about the character of Colene illistrates his versitility as an author and his ability to create characters that people can identify with. I grabbed all 3 of these books as they came out, and I was sorry to hear, from Mr. Anthony himself (in one of his newsletters), that there will not be any more books in this series. (Blame it on the publishers, I guess) For what it's worth, the 3 books that made it to the shelves are more than worth the read. A must for the true Anthony fan."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"I first read this series when I was 14. And although I'm not much older now I can look back to when I was reading it and tell you that that was one of the hardest times of my life, albeit I'm still very young and probably have a lot worse ahead of me. Frankly I was extremely tired all the time, loaded down with homework, and in schools peer pressure is an absolute nightmare. Frankly I was feeling much of what Colene was. So, when I read this book I thought &quot;I can relate to this,&quot; well I did for a little while anyway. The point is that Colene waited a while before killing herself and in doing so she found wonderful happiness and wonderful friends. Needles to say, that was very very uplifting and these books helped me get through a hard time. To any people who havne't read it you need to!!! It's absolutely wonderful and even now I will still take out the series and read it over again if I start really downing on myself. I give this book five stars and if you read this book you will understand what I've been babbling about for the past 20 some odd lines."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"Chaos Mode is as good as Virtual and Fractal Mode. New reality, new character-anchor and full of humanity and reality.I don't want to spoil the novel for new readers, but briefly, in this novel we learned more about Colene reasons to be the way she is. We see her fears and dreams, her love to live and die, and more importantly, how all the characters are the family that Colene always wants but her parents couldn't give her.The end of Chaos is a cliffhanger!!! So I am looking forward to read DoOon Mode to know how is going to end this series!!!So, if you have started reading the Mode series, what are you waiting for?

In no time, however, this creature (Burgess), becomes part of their party and helps them survive his reality and move on to their ultimate goal, to get to Darius' reality, where Colene can be his mistress and have the blissful life she's always craved. However, they once again encounter that pesky mind predator, causing them to be sidetracked many times during their course through the virtual mode on their way to paradise. Follow Darius, Colene, Seqiro, Nona, and Burgess through the different realities, in their never ending adventure. Experience the fear, worry, joy, and anxiety they have while traversing those realities. But beware, for the heartbreaking separation at the end is enough to bring tears to the most unemotional reader.

This book and series is recommended only for juveniles. It did not hold my interest. The characters' misadventures weren't all that interesting nor compelling. Anthony does bring to closure some of the personal issues that each character has developed in the first two novels. It seems obvious at the ending that there will be another book in the series to settle the events started in the DoOon Mode in Virtual Mode. Since we haven't seen the next installment as yet, one can guess that either the series didn't do all that well and is not a high priority for Anthony to continue or that he frankly has no place to go with the storyline.

I have heard a rumour that he won't be writing anymore Mode novels, but Mr. Anthony, if you happen to read this, please think of continuing writing.

I love the Xanth series and I enjoyed the first two books in this series. However, this book is not as good in my mind as the first two. The author spends quite a bit of time repeating what happened in the first two books. It is a series, it would be expected that people would have read them in order and know what was going on. Perhaps there was a long time between the 2nd and 3rd? I didn't check on this so am not sure. There were some very good parts and I did enjoy the interactions between the characters but it did get annoying to keep seeing Colene referred to as a &quot;vessel of dolor&quot;. At least use different words once in a while. And it seemed like Colene's parents gave in to her relationship with Darius very easily. I know they were afraid of losing her again and Seqiro helped mentally, but she is only 14 and he is much older. All in all, it was good but seemed rushed. I would still recommend the series and am eagerly waiting to see what happens in DoOon Mode."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"This book really seems to be targeted towards 14-year-old children, if not specifically boys. I know &quot;Colene&quot; a girl, is the main character, but having her run around in various states of undress, always trying to seduce her love interest, etc. can best be appreciated only by pubescent boys. I rapidly grew tired of hearing over and over again the qualities of the characters and how Colene was a 'vessel of dower'. I wonder if Piers Anthony really thought this had to be drummed into the reader's head lest they forget or if the author was simply trying to fill in space. After I had finished about two thirds of the book I looked at the cover and noticed for the first time that this was part 3! I wondered how this story line could have been repeated two previous times, ouch! I must also admit that I often wondered how this book could have been published in the first place, as it is so juvenile. Oh well, I did enjoy the last part of the book when the 'hive' went to seqiro's mode but it is not worth the whole book to get to. Is there really a market for this stuff? I have a strong feeling that the author is playing out many of his own pubescent unresolved conflicts and unfulfilled fantasies within the pages of this book.

Apparently, he got a lot of letters of complaint from parents stating that the relationship between Colene and Darius was innapropriate and too graphic.

In any case, if you're interested I can scan and post the letter somewhere. Just thought you all might like to know."},{"Title":"CHAOS MODE.","review":"This series has been so good.

I read it because I had seen the old black and white film version, which I have to admit is more interesting than the book in terms of plot since it takes a few liberties with the text to move the story along. However, the book is definitely worth reading.The book begins by describing Peter's early life in France in the 1840s, the glorious world of his childhood. The first half of the book reads like a regional history or travel tract about the town where he lived, and all the activities of his childhood, especially his friendship with Mary, a friendship which becomes remarkable later. Due to family tragedies, Peter and Mary's friendship comes to an end when they both have to leave their little town. When they meet years later, Peter is an architect and Mary has become the Duchess of Towers. This change in their status does not affect the friendship. As soon as they recognize each other, they embark on a long friendship in their minds.The glamour of the novel is this friendship and how they create it. Peter ends up in prison for killing his uncle, who has acted the villain toward him. Mary, because of her position, must travel about a great deal, yet she and Peter are always together in their dreams. It is difficult to explain the situation if the reader does not read the book, but in their dreams, they are able to meet and recreate their past childhood world in France, revisiting their old haunts and even to see themselves as children. Part of this amazing power they possess may be the result of sharing mutual great-great-grandparents as they discover. More specifically, they are pioneers in the life of the mind. When they learn they are related, they are able to go back and recreate in their minds the scenes of their mutual ancestors, first in the eighteenth century, and then soon farther back to medieval times, even back to glimpses of the caveman world. This extraordinary journey of theirs is what makes the book fascinating.\\"Peter Ibbetson\\" is largely forgotten today, and Du Maurier overshadowed by his daughter, Daphne, famous for the novel \\"Rebecca\\", yet I think Du Maurier more fascinating because of his interest in exploring the human mind. He is better known for \\"Trilby\\" with its villain Svengali, a novel that explores hypnotism. But \\"Peter Ibbetson\\" is the novel that really was greatly ahead of its time. Long before Einstein, or \\"The Secret\\", Abraham-Hicks and the Law of Attraction, Du Maurier was asking questions in the novel about the concept of time, quantum physics, cellular memory, and evolution. The reader is urged to forge through the overly descriptive first half of the book to the interesting philosophies of the last. The book can hardly be called a novel, there is little plot to it, but it is a book far ahead of its time, and one that would be of interest to many open-minded and spiritual people today.- Tyler R.

Lucky you if you haven't read them yet.You can't use any old map as a companion for the Hillerman series, because most maps use criteria that don't fit sparsely populated areas or Navajo culture. Typical maps of the entire reservation portray it as mostly empty space.The legendary AAA map that Leaphorn uses in the mysteries is excellent, but more detail than you need if you just want to follow along with the books. It also doesn't include fictitious features like \\"Short Mountain\\". (The \\"Guide to Indian Country\\" is free for AAA members. Not all offices carry it; I got mine from the Phoenix office.)Another reviewer complained that this isn't a real map because it concentrates on places in the Hillerman series. But if you're just reading the series, that's exactly what you want: a specialized companion to the books."},{"Title":"Tony Hillerman's Indian Country Map & Guide","review":"This isn't really a map; it's an artistic drawing of the area, concentrating on places in the Hillerman series. If you're a huge fan, you may want to make it into a wall poster; but for a real map of the area, get what Leaphorn himself uses - the AAA map of Indian Country. It's free, far more detailed, and far more accurate. At $... this would be a nice addition; but at this price I felt ripped off.

I didn't get it and I think my overly high expectations have kept me from enjoying this map as much as I might have. The map has some problems. I don't care for the oblique view. Some of the border art is not that well done and it's distracting. I wish they hadn't put the compass points diagram in the middle of the map. The map does have pretty much all the real places mentioned in Hillerman's books (I'm going to give up looking for Short Mountain). Now that I have this map I'm going to have to go back and reread all the books and find all the places that weren't in my Rand McNally atlas.

Famous for her children's books, most notably Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, Kate Douglas Wiggin addresses serious social issues in this story.Waitstill Baxter, a young woman caring for a younger sister and an ogre like father, is a model of all the virtues. Her father, a mean spirited, hot-tempered man, had buried three wives, all of whom were described as glad to die to get out of his household. Despite these unpromising circumstances, Waitstill and her sister Patience grow into beautiful, innocent, and virtuous young women who are capable housekeepers and models of early twentieth century womanhood. Though they and another primary character, Ivory Boynton, face trials and tribulations, the story has a happy ending in which the virtuous triumph, and the wicked suffer. Patience Baxter, the younger sister, is the most interesting character, since she is allowed to have a little bit of human weakness in the form of wishing for nice things and rebelling against the father's strictures. Waitstill is so good that no one could really identify with her--unless other readers are also completely virtuous at every moment.Touches of humor make this is good read. The dialogue is often funny, such as the discussion of \\"entomology\\" [etymology] describing the history of various words in an absolutely ridiculous manner. The courtship efforts of the character Cephas are also a source of fun.It is also interesting to this reader that Wiggin introduces serious social issues through the vehicle of a novel. This story touches on the status of women, poverty, the dark side of patriarchy, suicide, adultery, serial marriages, illegitimate birth, child abuse, domestic violence, and mental illness. In the early twentieth century many female authors were writing stories that brought alive the social ills of the day, particularly the status of orphans, and placing these topics in the context of readable and popular stories. Gene Stratton Porter, Kate Douglas Wiggin, Jean Webster, Eleanor Porter, Lucy Maud Montgomery and others wrote popular novels depicting the experiences of children dealing with congregate care in orphanages, poverty, child abuse, orphaned status, and the experiences of women struggling to be accepted and acknowledged as full human beings--capable of \\"womanly virtues\\" while also being persons of learning and intelligence."},{"Title":"Grace the Table: Stories and Recipes from My Southern Revival","review":"This was well written!

Sharing personal and family intimacies along with familiar and foreign dishes, Smalls introduces us to his world and lovingly guides us to and through all it offered him. From South Carolina to Germany, readers follow Smalls as he follows his singing passion and steadily amasses dishes and culinary techniques to tempt and satisfy even the ficklest of taste buds.Serving as an autobiography and a cookbook, GRACE THE TABLE is just as educational as it is entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed how Smalls began by centering the chapters on featured dishes and who he saw preparing them. He has written some quite enjoyable stories based on those people, delving into their lives and their role in his life. Each chapter could stand alone as a short story, a story stocked with mouthwatering descriptions that will make you want to run down to the kitchen and whip up the dish just to see what all the fuss is about. I did try out a few of the recipes. Mmmm mmmm! There are some crazy dishes in here, like a few of the low country recipes in chapter 5 where Aunt Daisy stirs up some surprises with fish heads and rabbits. Yet, however unusual the dish, the recipes are clear and easy to follow.Reading this book was difficult at times because the passionate way Smalls describes food just kidnaps your senses and transplants you to where he is, be it Sparkle City or Paris. Aside from being a successful chef and an excellent opera singer, Smalls also proves to be a fantastic storyteller. His writing style is easy, flowing in a manner that politely demands your attention while convincing you that what he has to say is worth listening to. And it is. There are recipes here for everything from the \\"basics\\" like macaroni and cheese and cinnamon toast to the extravagant like spaghetti e Pomodoro with garlic, basil, and olive oil and spicy lamb loaf with currants. And there are stories which are just as delicious to go with each recipe. One of the things I love about Smalls is that he says recipes are just a basic outline; it's up to the cook to add the panache! This nontraditional cookbook is an added bonus for any reader and any chef.

Well,as a collection of stories about Mr. Small's family and friends it's charming but as a cookbook it's weak on substance and none of my South Carolinian relatives (all great cooks) were impressed by the book either.If you want a serious cookbook discussing classic black food try the original Ebony Cookbook or Spoonbread or Strawberry Wine instead."},{"Title":"Violence and Gender Reexamined (Law and Public Policy: Psychology and the Social Sciences)","review":"While Richard Felson (2002) argues that mysoginy has no relaitonship to domestic violence, his argument is internally inconsistent in terms of both statistics and substance. First, the numerical data he presents often contradict his conclusions. For example, Felson states that &quot;women are just as likely as men to be the victims of violence from their partners, at least in Western Countries.&quot; This statement directly contradicts his own research findings (p. 37) and Bureau of Justice Statistics (Craven, 1997) which which he provides that show that 20.7% of women are victimized by intimates compared to only 2.8% of males (Felson, 2002, p. 49; see also page 111 for another example).On a substantive level, Felson frequently conflates the trivial with the traumatic. For example, Felson argues that women's greater use of complaining and anger in relationships &quot;casts doubt on the idea that men's violence against their wives reflects a greater desire to control them&quot; (Felson, 2002, p. 104). Felson thus compares complaining with a &quot;tooth loosening assault intended to punish, humiliate, and terrorize&quot; (Dobash, Dobash, Wilson, &amp; Daly, 1992, p. 75). Note also that the radical feminist theory of domestic violence which Felson purports to critique never states that men have &quot;a greater desire to control&quot; their wives than do their wives but rather contends that battering is a technique by which men control women. Felson thus fails to address the central feminist proposition that battering results in increased power and control for men.These errors in fact and logic re-occur throughout Felson's work and completely undermine his argument which is unfortunate because this is a topic which deserves careful, well-documented, and thoughtful consideration."},{"Title":"A Killing Spring: A Joanne Kilbourn Mystery","review":"Gail Bowen's lead character Joanne Kilbourne is thoroughly entertaining..Not only do you want to know \\"who done it\\" but you also want to know more about this engaging lead character, Joanne Kilbourne.

Instead, Echo Heron presents us with very personal stories of what it means to be a nurse - as told to her by 39 different nurses across America. Open, heartfelt and often brutally honest, these stories take the reader on a journey into the lives and experiences of the people involved in all aspects of the nursing profession (there even is a story about a vet-nurse caring for dolphins). Some stories brought tears to my eyes, some made me laugh, and some made me think \\"surely not - that can't be true!\\". In their honesty, some stories in this book may startle some readers, or even offend, and it is easy to see why Heron had struggled to find nurses to recount their very personal experiences - when confidentiality and battling on without complaint is so ingrained in the nursing profession. Most of all, the book reminds us that nurses are human, with their own \\"baggage\\" of feelings, emotions and different pasts. What affects one person may be felt completely differently by another.Personally, I loved this book and the journey it took me on. Some of the stories were fascinating (and a bit scary) - and I realised how sheltered my life is here in rural, small-town Western Australia! I could relate to a lot of the emotions described by the nurses interviewed when caring for the dying, or dealing with sad and difficult situations. Because of the narrators' honesty, any reader who is working in the nursing profession will find something to take away from these stories and relate to - and anyone who likes medical drama may also find that sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. One quote in particular stood out to me :\\"What it boils down to is that compassion is one of the most effective healing tools a nurse can use - it is the essence of a nurse.\\" That just sums it up perfectly, I think."},{"Title":"Tending Lives: Nurses on the Medical Front","review":"I listened to this on tape, and found myself finding excuses to go somewhere in the car. This collection on vignettes from nurses around the country is captivating. Aside from the sadness, fear, frustration, and joy, you will laugh a lot. A theme that keeps coming up throughout the tape focuses on cutbacks made in the medical profession. Just when you are lost in a story, the &quot;reality slap&quot; of how the system has been altered reaches out and gets you. Although I appreciate this now, I think only a nurse functioning within the constraints placed on them in some situations can truly appreciate it. Nurses are some of the real heroes out there."},{"Title":"Tending Lives: Nurses on the Medical Front","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be an enlightening approach to transitioning into being a nurse in the ICU. I found in the first chapter that this nurse began to describe seeing a patient of her's to being very similar to her son. Okay, that may be a natural response. But, when she began to talk to the patient's mother about her feelings and then substitute the patient's name with her son's name on accident, I thought that it was tacky and unprofessional. I believe it is important for a nurse to be in the situation with a patient and not to bring up personal issues of her own.Also, she later states that nurses with a four year degree are merely full of theory and that two or three year degree RN's are better. I don't agree that such a statement could be made rationally if she wishes to encompass more than a few situations in the least. Therefore, I am led to question the author's confidence in herself and the background of her degree. I am sorry that I spent money on this seemingly apropriate book."},{"Title":"Tending Lives: Nurses on the Medical Front","review":"I read exactly three chapters and gave up in disgust.

The author wants the reader to experience \\"the soul of nurses as they go on about their business of caring.\\" A goal she brilliantly achieves.

While doing research for her book, Ms. Heron contacted about four hundred nurses from all fifty states, one hundred permitted an interview, and less than half of these allowed their stories to be published. Many nurses were apprehensive about reprisals. One nurse insisted on being interviewed in disguise,while riding in a taxi. Echo Heron writes, \\"when a person becomes a nurse they sign on for life...there is a ...spirit, a depth of soul... unique to the nurse.\\" She describes nurses as \\"nitty-gritty hands-on people... Those who choose this profession are...as front-line as front-line gets.\\" This book is just the prescription for \\"the millions of nurses worldwide who dedicate themselves to the art of healing,\\" in spite of the tumultuous transitions in healthcare today.

While I can say I have gained so much from each one of Ms. Heron'sbooks, I have to say that Tending Lives is my favorite. Why, you ask? WishI knew for sure, but what I can say is that I really loved the format of this book.That is, individual stories submitted by real nurses about real events thatoccurred during the course of their respective careers.The stories in this book are moving.

As Echo Heron writes, \\"when a person becomes a nurse they sign on for life...there is a...spirit, a depth of soul... unique to the nurse.\\" She describes nurses as \\"nitty-gritty hands-on people... Those who choose this profession are...as front-line as front-line gets.\\" This book is for \\"the millions of nurses worldwide who dedicate themselves to the art of healing,\\" in spite of the turmoil and transitions in healthcare today. This book is recommended for anyone considering nursing, definitely prescribed for those who are already working \\"on the front line,\\" and for those who had been there at one time. Because of the vivid detail, this book might be too intense for the faint-at-heart or those unfamiliar with the nursing profession. It was my pleasure to relive pieces of my own nursing career as I shared this well-written book. This roller coaster ride was well worth the trip. I am inspired to continue writing my own stories and compiling stories for my own book about nurses, and anyone who was ever \\"touched\\" by one. I can't wait to read Echo Heron's next creation!"},{"Title":"Tending Lives: Nurses on the Medical Front","review":"I have read most of Echo's books, (I haven't read Paradox or Mercy yet) but this one is my favorite so far. It is nice to know that I am not alone and nurses throughout the nation experience the same feelings and experiences that I have on a daily basis. I'm glad that someone has provided a forum for us to tell our side for once. It lets the public know that we, the nurses are NOT the enemy. I have been a critical care nurse like Echo for thirteen years. When I read her stories, I find that she and I have alot in common. She is by far, my idol. we need more nurses like her in the practice."},{"Title":"Tending Lives: Nurses on the Medical Front","review":"I love reading Echo's non-fictional stories the best and this one is great. I feel as if I'm in the story with similar situations in nursing. And I learn so much from the many situations. Echo and her writings have been an inspiration to me to keep fighting for patients &quot;lack of rights&quot; concerning personal care/staff. How I wish I had seen her ad to talk with her, what an honor that would have been. Thank you Echo."},{"Title":"Tending Lives: Nurses on the Medical Front","review":"As a R.N. with 30 years experience, I look forward to Echo Heron's books because they depict the profession of nursing truthfully and with humor. I was not at all disappointed with this current release. Ms. Heron has put together a book of interviews with nurses that is fast-paced, gives such an interesting history of the profession, and aptly depicts nursing as the part of medicine that still focuses on advocacy and compassion. I am proud to be a nurse, and even more proud that there are people like Echo Heron who continue to speak out in favor of good patient care and bringing caring back to the practice of medicine. This is a book that is a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone in the medical field, while &quot;lay&quot; people will also find it totallly absorbing and impossible to put down."},{"Title":"Tending Lives: Nurses on the Medical Front","review":"As a Registered Nurse, I was very excited to see the arrival of Echo's latest new book. Echo was the first to give the most &quot;honest&quot; look at our profession, much to the dismay of some who feel that &quot;good girls should not talk back&quot;. In this new book she gives voice to some of the 2.2 million nurses in our country who are, as a whole, concerned about the progess of health care away from the patient, and centered on the dollar. True, these stories may scare some about to enter the hospital, but being well-informed is your best weapon to fight against those risks. Hospitals ARE scary places these days, as they replace skilled nurses with lesser trained (and lesser paid) non-professionals, and the remaining nurses are &quot;burning out&quot; trying to give the best care that they can. Books like Echo's are important to correct that &quot;handmaiden&quot; image of nursing. Anyone who is enthralled by &quot;ER&quot; and other medical dramas will be drawn right into these tales. Nurses have far more to tell than other care providers about the real stories behind the drama, since by the amount of time spent at the bedside, and the intimate work that they do, they are much closer to the heart of humanity-with all its joy, pain, humor and tears."},{"Title":"Tending Lives: Nurses on the Medical Front","review":"I first read this book when I was in RN school. I thought to myself, &quot;What am I getting into?&quot; But I loved the book, and I couldn't put it down! I loaned it to a friend and have since bought two more copies. Now that I have been an RN for a year, I see more of what the nurses in Echo Heron's book go through every day. And, even though I am worried about what the future holds for my profession as the nursing shortage looms above us, I have never been more proud of the title that I have. I love my job, and all that it means. I am very proud to be a nurse, and am also very proud to share my profession with someone like Echo Heron, who is not afraid to tell anyone what she thinks, and she is usually right on the money. Keep writing Echo, and we will keep reading."},{"Title":"Tending Lives: Nurses on the Medical Front","review":"Echo Heron is a Registered Nurse who writes medical stories on the side. Some novels are of her own experiences, others are fictional thrillers with lots of nursing thrown in, and many open your eyes as to what the RN's see and feel on a daily basis.This one is a collection of true nursing stories from nurses all over the USA. Some of the nurses were there for the victims of the Oklahoma bombing and tell their stories. Of course, all the names are changed and few details left out. But this book was one of the most fascinating to read.A word of warning though. I could not read this one straight through. I had to stop sometimes due to emotional overload. The book holds no punches back and you will be walking in the shoes of the nurses who tell the stories. I cried from despair and then laughed from wild humor in the very next story. You never know how they will end. But, of course, neither did the nurses as the events unfolded to them in reality."},{"Title":"Tending Lives: Nurses on the Medical Front","review":"Wow! This is a fantastic book for anyone who enjoys reading medical fiction or lay medical fact, or enjoys watching E.R. and other medical shows.In this book, 40 nurses tell you, in their words, what nursing means to them, in the context of first-person narratives of events in their daily job experience.These stories are, in turn, moving, funny, and shocking -- and always fascinating. You will &quot;be there&quot; as nurses care for the dying with relatives in denial, or on the psych ward, and the burn ward. You will see how precious, and occasionally cheap, life is considered in Labor and Delivery, and go along as nurses provide home care for those in poverty and former Hollywood stars. You will see the Oklahoma City bombing from a nurse's perspective, and spend a long day on a Hollywood set as a set nurse. You will even travel with a nurse to a clinic in a small village in Papua New Guinea.In this book, there are several stories focusing on the decision of how to care for the dying -- especially those whose prognosis is probable but not certain. As we look at each instance of care-giving, we see how some in the medical profession have -- and do -- discriminate on the basis of race and income. We see how, for every patient, hospitals and insurance companies skimp on care to increase profits.Each patient comes in, not with mere symptoms, but with a personality, dreams, fears, background, and family. Through the intimate act of nursing, each patient touches the nurse's life, and the nurse touches each patient's life. Ms. Heron says, &quot;What nurses witness and get involved with on a daily basis -- death, birth, extreme despair, suffering, life-altering trauma, extreme joy, rage, disease -- are phenomena most 'normal' people experience only a few times during an entire lifetime.&quot;This book will entertain you, move you, and shock you. And you will leave with a better understanding of what it means to be a nurse."},{"Title":"Tending Lives: Nurses on the Medical Front","review":"With incisive insight, and broad oversight, Echo Heron captures the heart of health care. She treats the true stories of nurses, who spend carreers caring, and transforms them into jewels of knowledge about nurses who work at the heart of health care. This book is a clarion call from the depths of suffering of patients *and* nurses in the United States today. We must heed the voice of the knowledge and expertise nurses have built while sharing the best of themselves at the sides of suffering human beings. It is time to transform this knowledge into action to establish health care as a human right in the United States, once and for all."},{"Title":"Tending Lives: Nurses on the Medical Front","review":"I'm not a medical person, but I found this book to be a most incredible look at the world of medicine. The stories are told by nurses who are right there, on the front line....better than any ER episode I''ve ever seen. I laughed, I cried, I shuddered my way through this absolutely wonderful book. It was a roller coaster ride of emotions and amazement. Although the stories are from different nurses all over the country, the reader can still&quot;hear&quot; Heron's voice in the writing...that trademark of dry humor and the ability to cut to the heart of the spirit and the soul. All I can say is WHEN IS THE SEQUEL????? Loved it!!!"},{"Title":"The Workbasket & Home Arts Magazine April 1984","review":"I've been looking for this crochet book for years and was so excited to find it!

From crazy storms to inexplicable power outages and more, Hawkins paints a vivid, if sometimes complex, world to life.An incredible read, I loved this book. It has a special place among all the other amazing adventures I've collected over the years. Highly recommended if you want something less than ordinary and more than fantastic to read. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Sirius: The Maker's Herald","review":"This first book in a Trilogy Underway*..Is well worth a read. It traces a man's life through dark times when hopelessness was his mantra, meeting his first spiritual teacher and the opening of his mind and heart toward the light.A rough journey that many can relate and resonate to. The author is an amazingly creative writer, musician and world traveler, who pours out a shadow side in this journey that spans decades. It takes place in the UK..a solid book drawn from experience and woven into a fictionalized format. Reminded me of Lucifer's Hammer and that of course tags off of Dante.A book ultimatly of hope and magic."},{"Title":"In This Valley","review":"The questions posed to the reader in the first few chapters are all answered by the end of the book with many fascinating and some heartbreaking twists and turns in between. The intertwined stories of these well developed characters address both fact and fiction concerning Christian and Jew in the Zionist movement of the WW II era. Once I started this book I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Castaway","review":"Max weaves a tale of survival that will keep a youngster as well as any age glued to the book until completed.His detail to each degree in technics and tacits of survival will astound a person, but Max is well trained in his field.

Young Sheldon is Max as a youngster reliving this tale thru his experiences in life. A job well done. Max we need more books from you --continue the saga of Sheldon."},{"Title":"The Canadair Sabre","review":"If you are interested in the F-86 Sabre, this is a book you MUST have in your library (372 pages and hundreds of pictures, many in colour). Larry Milberry has researched all 1815 Sabres produced by the Canadair Company of Montreal. He has also collected stories from hundreds of former RCAF pilots and ground-crew who flew or worked on the Canadian Sabre. The book has a definite historical tilt but is at its best when it shows the personal perspective of the people who lived with it, and sometimes slept in it, from day to day. As with any book dealing with the military, some of the stories are tragic but most show the human side of operating the premier air defence fighter in Europe from 1951 to its replacement by the F-104 in 1963. Appendixes are provided which cover technical advances, 3-views, all known crashes where the Sabre was written off and a listing of all 1815 aircraft by RCAF serial, Canadair number, Squadron number, operator (Colombia, South Africa, Germany, Britain, Yugoslavia, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Hunduras and Pakistan), and, where known, disposition. The Canadair Mark 6 Sabre was the best Sabre variant ever and this is definitely THE book on the Canadian Sabre."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"This is quite possibly the most astonishing novel ever written. From the very first line of the very first page the reader is drawn into, and entangled within, the extraordinary lives of the three passengers marooned aboard the giant alien spaceship RAMA. The reader begins to feel almost as though they KNOW the characters, know what they're feeling and how they will react. But the uniqueness of their situation aboard Rama prevents them from becoming predictable. The descriptions of the mysteries uncovered both within and beyond Rama leave one literally gasping for breath in astonishment. This is a book that you will want, almost need, all of your friends to share."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I enjoyed the first two Rama books. I was frustrated by the lack of completion on some of the characters of Rama II and after reading some of the reviews here, I almost didn't purchase Garden.It was very different from the first 2. We learn a significant amount about the mission and technology of the creators. This book in particular makes you think about the significance of our actions and how they can play out over time. Also a lot of Karma is explored.It gets a bit boaring near the middle with what seems like overly indepth character introductions but they turn out to be appropriate and important.Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I was interested to note that a lot other of reviewers had a problem with the sex in this book. Geez, it would have been really dull without it. Originaly, Rama was the awesome subject (RWR), then it became the setting for a soap opera. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the odd human drama, I actually watch and enjoy Melrose Place, but at least it doesn't get all PREACHY like this book does! And another thing, Clarke and Lee were obviously feeling a little down on humanity when they wrote this. Two stars instead of one because the original was soooooo good."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Bah, some people say this book is rubbish, they obviously didn't read the same book I did.The story of humanity's 3rd encounter with the RAMA spacecraft is an incredible tale of our race's inability to see beyond our selfish desires and accept that we may not be center of the universe. The story that unfolds is sometimes painfully believable, and makes ashamed of my own species because it follows the all too realistic patterns of human behavior.My only complaint is that the story only ever follows one character, never switching back to other major characters, for the most part this works fine, but there is a long stretch near the end where we leave the main character and follow another major character at a point in the story when I really really wanted to know what was going on back with our main character. Nonetheless the story was brilliantly (if maddeningly) written and I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Almost 20 years and 1,000 pages ago we were introduced to the fascinating Nicole des Jardin. The final scene of this book will we leave the reader in awe, just because we know Nicole so well. The book is very harsh in the last 30 pages, reading about the downfall of New Eden. It makes the reader salivate for a sequel. This book was absolutely incredible, except for the first 50 pages (Nicole's Journal). The style that the authors gave Nicole was painful to read, but things improved. Any fan of the Rama 2 will definetely want to check this one out!!!"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"This is a brilliantly written book. All of the main carachters have personalities, they are not just storybook names. They are individuals. Each has their own personal problems, pet peeves and ways of expressing things. If you have read the other[first two], this tops them all. The mystery of not knowing the ultimate destination of the colonist's craft and the fact the the &quot;New Eden&quot; is falling into it's own moral hole, makes me anxious to find out what happens in&quot;RAMA REVEALED"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I do not usually write a review, and this is not a review. The story is quite different from what you might expect, so few people liked it.I enjoyed the previous Rama novels. If you did you may enjoy this book.The last part of the book is a great example of the Human Animal. When we speak of the most dangerous beast, or the most poisonous, look into a mirror!Your main characters evolve continuously into, mostly, a paradym of the best HUMANAS in our history because of there fabulous trip. Also, since they were a slice of the inteligent elite to go to Rama in the first. Ignorant and suspicious individuals who want power are not proper canadates for a space mission.Many intelectul debates on a multitude of topics arise from this story."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"When I first read R with Rama I got shocked , a giagiantic space craft of those magnitudes is simply fantastic. With Rama II the mistery once started in the original novel kept going. Some puzzles were solved wile others kept in mistery. So I couldn't wait to read GR. When I started it it was a cool experience , very good sci-fi. But then started the soap opera scenes. What the hell is that of Nicole having sex with Michael when Richard was his husband? It doesn't matter how necesarily it was , it just isn't right !. Then the human familly arrives to the Node. What a fantastic description of an alien Space Station , but what an awfull mistery. Aliens doing pan-cakes to the humans when they order them? Give me a break!. Then we have The Eagle. At first it looks like an amazing creature , but then it turns to be a damn biot who knows the language of the human visitors. I think that the aliens that built that Eagle could have done a better work , creating a more impressiv! ! e creature or I don't know !. Then we have the description of the technical cares taking place on the new Raman vessel , they are really cool. And then we have the horrible moment of revelation: The new ship it's going to be an used to carry 2000 humans on it , and some presence it's going to be monitoring their activities wile the ship it's hedding to it's unknown destination. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ?!?!. With that single argument all the mistery from R with Rama and Rama II simply vanished in the air.Then we have a 15 years old girl who marries an old 76 years old man , they got themselves locked in one room and have sex (And I can imagine that it wasn't to esciting for the 15 years old) How can a girl that age do that with a man old enough to be her grand dad ?. Then we have another journey 'till they get up in an awfull new Rama with localities with names as stupid as &quot;Lake Shakespare&quot;. We have an argument promoting masturbation and then we are introduced to a who! ! le new line of flat and lacking of grace characters. Also w! e have what seems to be a bunch of dirty-diapers still not growed up problem makers drugs and sexualy obsessed adolescents who not only are doing sex all the time but also doing sex with people of their same gender , there is a very clear dialoge that states that. O.K to much sex was acceptable but homosexuality in a science fiction novel (is this sci-fi?) it's enough. Then we have a troubled 2000 people society that kills all of the avians and Richard for trying to prevent a war. I got so bored that I didn't finish the damn book. UnfortunatelI I feel compromised to read the next book I just hope it's better that this space based soap opera. Only because I have read other of Clarke's works I know he isn't a bad writer because this book is nothing but a pure failure."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I hate to say this, but a lot of you people have bad taste. I read this book last weekend and I must say that it was probably one of the better two in the series. I thought it was suspensful, provoking, and just a good book. I also think that drawing parelells to life today (the Aids like disease, the dictatorship, and the war) simply shows that human nature is about the same, time isn't neccesarilly going to improve it."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"After reading the first Rama I wouldn't have bought the sequel:I go this used. The reason for the large space ship and the aliens involvedis at least in part explained here as a cataloging of space going species.In some ways the novel reminds me of \\"The City and the Stars\\" in a strange way. The aging of the characters and the development of the plot makes this a better science fiction novel about travel between stars than theother was a first contact novel."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I agree with those that panned this book, and I also have to agree that I thought I was getting a book written by the esteemed Arthur C Clark. Either Sir Clark has lost it, or it was written by someone else. The book has a lot of promise but squanders it, and resolves nothing. Also, the plot (especially regarding the extreme stupidity of the colonists) is not believable."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"The only good thing about this book is the sense of wonder you get through thinking, 'how can Clarke have let this happen?' and how Gentry Lee, possibly the most inept writer working in fiction today is allowed to be released from 3rd grade Eng. Lit classes long enough to write this monstrosity.300 years is an astonishingly long time for nothing at all to happen. Nicole Des Jardins, sheesh, I half expected her to develop the powers of flight, and heat ray vision by the end of the book.This book is really quite dreadful. Read it as an example of how Clarke's unwillingness to write more than a few scrawled words on the back of a napkin and then pass it over to someone else has transmuted this once 'master' into a name publishers feel will sell fourth rate tripe."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I have just reread the whole series, book one is a very good book but each book after is geometrically worse. Book two is bad, book three is horrible, I'm at a loss to describe book four. I recommend shoving needles under your finger nails which is less painful then this series. Read and keep book one, burn the rest."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Rama II and Rama III are awful. I'm embarrassed to see Mr. Clarke's name associated with these so-called sequels. They reflect nothing of the science fiction wonder and imagination seen in Rendezvous with Rama and most of his other stories. Rama II & III are completely polluted with political, sociological & religious nonsense and modern emotionalism. Not worth reading. Certainly not worth adding to a fine collection of Clarke books."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"With only one or two exceptions, everybody seems to agree that this follow-up series is the biggest waste of time of our lives!Like another reviewer wrote: What I wouldn't do to get the time back!If the setting were entirely different (ie. NOT a sci-fi novel, let alone a sequel to the original Rama by Clarke) then some of the characters and situations MIGHT be interesting.Certainly not, however, when we're expecting sci-fi on the same level as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Rendezvous with Rama."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"It's not that I thought this book was awful, it's just that it didn't have much in it that I found very good. The original Rendezvous with Rama is a classic, filled with an environment that makes you wonder about the alien intelligence and crave for more.These sequels, on the contrary, are set in the same &quot;universe&quot; but center around some Jerry Springer-esque quarrels amongst all the various humans. The notion that this has anything to do with Rama or aliens is secondary (or even tertiary) to the plot. In this installment, there are fleeting bits of the original wonder as the characters visit the &quot;Node&quot; and again when Richard visits the mysterious other dome towards the end. Sadly, this doesn't constitute very much of the overall book itself.There are also some references that hit the reader with all the subtlety of an anvil to the head: the AIDS-like RV41 virus, Nicole's impending martyrdom and the constant (and fleeting) references to her heroes Joan of Arc and Eleanor of Aquitaine, and the groaner where someone confuses Richard with Jesus. Social and religious commentary are the main themes of this book (as they were in Rama II). Science fiction is merely (and IMHO unfortunately) a backdrop."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"In this sequel to Rama II the authors offer tremendous insight into the true nature of humankind. It is an exploration into values as well as a socio-political strife which has been at the core of human history. The book is essential reading for the &quot;Rama&quot;fan and provocative for the any intelligent being who ponders their existence in the universe."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Like many others who've reviewed this un-masterpiece, I expected big things from the sequels to Clarke's classic novel. Realizing that the three sequels were ghostwritten by someone named \\"Gentry Lee\\" only diminished my excitement slightly-- that is, until I read the first few pages of \\"Rama II\\". Still, I kept with it, hoping that things would pick up after Gentry got all the boring exposition out of the way. Didn't happen.Now, after reading \\"Garden of Rama\\", I realize that I would rather have my fingernails plucked off with a rusty tweezers than suffer through the last installment.Gentry Lee's writing style is the downfall of these books. It's hard to believe that Clarke would have allowed this hack to massacre one of his finest storylines, but it happened. Lee seems concerned more with creating cardboard cut-out, stereotypical characters, and tossing them into a cheap story to see how much sex he can make them all have. The two main characters, Richard and Nicole, seem to have sex several times a page. I can't figure out whether the spacecraft Rama is an alien experiment to observe humans or just to observe their sexual habits. Additionally, Lee goes waaaay overboard to try to make his non-European characters seem \\"authentic\\", e.g. the boring, endless Japanese cultural studies that prop up the character of Kenji Watanabe, who dies before he does anything important anyway; and of course, the accounts of Nicole's ridiculous \\"spirit journeys\\" with her tribal people, which I've learned to skim right over whenever they occur.In all, terrible-- although if you want a manual for how NOT to write, \\"The Garden of Rama\\" works for that. I'm giving it two stars, though, because the parts that aren't straight soap opera, the ones that concentrate more on the aliens themselves and their technology, are at least interesting. Not enough to save this poor novel, though."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Okay...so this one IS a little too &quot;soap-opera.&quot; However, despite the fact that parallels to AIDS, environmentalism, and racism are rather non-subtle, I think Clarke and Lee make a very valid point: the history of the human race gives us no indication that we will ever fully be &quot;humane&quot; (a misnomer if there ever was one). When the human settlers of Rama become &quot;more human than human&quot; by engaging in those aforementioned atrocities (racism, AIDS-ophobia, destroying the environment in the name of short-term wants), I will admit to feeling frustrated--Hey, what about the happy future, utopia, etc.etc.?!?! Unfortunately, we cannot escape our genes. A thought provoking and entertaining read!"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I love this series. I look forward to Morgan Freedman's production company bringing this to film. I find the Rama books even more entertaining than the Odyssey books. Thank you Arthur C. Clark for bringing us such wonderful fiction. I recommend the Rama books to anyone who enjoys sci-fi, anyone who has never read sci-fi, anyone.. Well written, clever plot that takes you across the universe. The first book (Rendesvous with Rama) is just a taste of what lies ahead for you. Enjoy! :)~Qabyss"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Arthur C. Clarke essentially leased out his good name to Gentry Lee for the Rama books that followed &quot;Rendevouz with Rama.&quot; Instead of Clarke's spare, elegant prose, Lee's Rama novels are bad pulp fiction in a need of a good edit and a good idea. &quot;Garden of Rama&quot; is the worst of the trio. There are multitudinous descriptions of weird creatures and physical spaces and a complicated plot but no real content. The dialogue between characters is sophomoric. I thought I bought a novel by the author of &quot;Childhood's End&quot; and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; but it turned out to be bait-and-switch. Clarke's involvement with this book was undoubtedly relegated to cashing the publisher's checks."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I have to say that I found the whole Rama series to be a bit disappointing. I expected a series with the quality of Clarke's &quot;Odyssey&quot; Novels, but they just didn't live up to expectation. There was too many sub-plots and mysteries left un-resolved, events that were over emphasized but never clarified. And to be honest, I found many aspects of the book to be totally unrealistic. Overall this series was quiet a let down. If your going to buy this book, buy if used!"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I read the first two books and liked them especially the first. This book is a waste of the series. Genuine mystery gets replaced by mundane explanations and deliberate omissions. All the characters seem to get stupider and one dimensional. Rama gets stupider and its motivations go from unfathomable to arbitrary and shallow. There are sloppy inconsistencies with the first two books. Overall, this book is not worth the read even if or especially if you liked the first two books. The Rama in this book does not exist in the same universe as the first two. On top of all this there is some vaguely nauseating sexual themes involving incest, polyandry, the extremely old and the extremely young."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"How is Arthur C. Clarke capable of writing crap like this?!?!?!? Too much sex, too much violence, too much junk. Please, anyone who is reading this, let me spare you from this awful book. Rama II gets to the node than is sent back for a colony of 2000 people. The colony dies, all the avians on board are killed, except 2 Richard Wakfield rescues and takes to New York. Also, Katie becomes a drug addict and Nicole goes to jail. This is NOT Sci-Fi. This is politics. This is sex. This is intense violence. This is terrible"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Who told Arthur Clarke that Gentry Lee could write?

Clarke and Gentry Lee, you will thoroughly enjoy this novel which they co-wrote. It features a good story, eady read (try Game of Thrones), and full of surprises. It also answers the questions in parts 1 and 2 of the series. I wish some one would make a movie or two from this interesting series."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"No s&eacute;culo XXIII, a Terra j&aacute; teve dois encontros com uma nave espacial misteriosa de al&eacute;m nosso sistema solar - a prova incontest&aacute;vel de uma tecnologia alien&iacute;gena que ultrapassa a nossa de todas as formas, em Encontro com Rama e O Enigma de Rama.Agora, trs astronautas humanos esto presos a bordo da labir&iacute;ntica nave ramaiana, onde durante 13 anos, tero de utilizar todas as suas habilidades f&iacute;sicas e mentais para sobreviver.Os corajosos viajantes se deparam com um grande desafio: em encontro com a base ramaiana - e com os arquitetos invis&iacute;veis de sua terra gal&aacute;tica.Para isso, eles tiveram que abandonar suas fam&iacute;lias, amigos e casas, para viver uma nova vida.Mas as respostas que os esperam em Rama vo necessitar um sacrif&iacute;cio ainda maior - se a humanidade est&aacute; realmente pronta para entender a verdade.A medida que os anos passam a bordo de Rama e as fam&iacute;lias se desenvolvem no meio ambiente ramaiano, o leitor comea a amar os personagens, como velhos amigos - sentir suas dores e alegrias.Mais mist&eacute;rios sobre Rama so revelados, e outros novos, criados.Combinando o melhor das aventuras espaciais (os viajantes espaciais encontram novas formas de vida dentro da nave) e dramas humanos (crianas nascem e crescem neste ambiente hostil), esse terceiro livro da s&eacute;rie Rama faz muitas perguntas, e nos d&aacute; respostas em n&uacute;mero equivalente, quanto &agrave; verdadeira natureza do ser humano.O livro &eacute; essencial para o f da s&eacute;rie e provocativo para qualquer ser inteligente e que se preocupa com seu papel na existncia do universo.Lembrando sempre que, a colaborao de Gentry Lee &eacute; que d&aacute; esse toque humano &agrave; est&oacute;ria."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I want to give it a 7 but I must be fair. It is a decentbook. I love Clarke and I really love the Rama concept,but I think he is slipping a little bit in his later years.He trys to be too fair to all religions. His view of thefuture is a little bit too politically correct for me. The main character, Nicole Des Jardins, is one of the most unbelievable characters I have ever read in a book. Clarke tries way too hard to make her into this superhuman woman that can handle all things at once and wrap everyones life into a comfortable blanket. Nevertheless if you are willing to skip a few of the more boring parts of it, it is worthwhile. There are some great descriptions of the Raman Spacestation called the Node and the life in the vessel is handled very well I think. Over all it is a good book if you are a Clarke fan and a Raman fan."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Instead of Arthur C. Clarke's brilliance, we are offered up into the hands of an engineer who obviously wishes he were a female. The intra-personal relationships that Clarke avoided for obvious reasons are visited over and over again in this waste of paper. When Lee started the soap opera style in Rama II, it was somewhat exciting and acceptable, because we were going back to Rama, and that was seen as a good thing. However, he goes overboard with the emotional drama in the Garden of Rama and anybody who has ever read anything by Clarke at all can see just how disconnected he became with the series. Honestly - religion, science and procreation mingle with the never-ending emotions of a woman as written by a man. Lee even has the hubris to write poetry that is supposed to have stemmed from the soul of a woman. What is this all about? This is the third time I have read this book, and even though I know where it all ends, I still find it to be pointless and meandering. Had Clarke put his talents to this on his own, we would be hit with the wonder and awe that Rendezvous first instilled in us. Garden of Rama is a bad joke and doesn't get any better."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I read the whole Rama series because I liked Rendezvous With Rama and am a Arthur C. Clarke fan. However, all books following the first book are written by Gentry Lee, not Arthur C Clarke. The text supposedly was checked by Sir Clarke. I know this from an online interview transcript I read.The book focuses excessively on the emotions of the heroine Nicole. Her characterization seems to have little relation to any serious cosmological or theological issues or Science Fiction science. It becomes a drama, not a sci fi book.I say, skip this book. Its a waste of time."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Ever so gently this series is starting to drift. GET BACK ON FOCUS!!! Much of the writing was about mundane people doing mundane things, petty conflicts, a lot of wondering and wandering and not much continuity. Once again, as he has done in the past over and over, Clarke comes up with a superlative idea but his literary talents - or lack thereof - are not up to the task. Only rarely does he succeed with character development and this is not an uncommon occurrence among scifi writers.I found myself staring into space several times and even peeking ahead. The best parts were all the creatures in the Garden. It is an axiom that the really memorable science fiction stories do not center on the unworldly aspect but on unforgettable people - Contact, Stranger in a Strange Land, Dune. This series could have been really remarkable but it has been dithered away. What a waste of time and energy."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"What a let-down!!!This is an unbelivably poor, hashed-together, novel with a few points of interest (hence 2 stars, instead of 1) but mostly pathetic and unbelivable. The first section of the book, containing extracts of &quot;journal entries&quot; from Nicole's journal (it's obvious now that Nicole is going to be the main character from here on out) which serve to send forward the plot about 13 years (and entangle the characters in some cloyingly obvious sexual &quot;misunderstandings&quot;). The remainder of the book is a description of the &quot;colony&quot; from Earth chosen to inhabit Rama, and the disastrous choices made by nearly everyone -- from the politicians on Earth, to most of the colonists.To paraphrase B.B. King, &quot;The Thrill of Rama is Gone&quot;. I'll give &quot;Rama Revealed&quot; a chance, just because so many loose ends are left hanging.A real disappointment."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"This continues the continuation. It gives details of the ship, keeping its purpose a mystery and developing the personalities in depressingly predictable ways.It is not bad, but it simply fails to meet the mark of Clarke's solo works, which means either that his powers are failing or the co-author is doing the work.If you are a purist and serious sci-fi fan, don't bother with this. But if you are looking for a pretty good read that continues a story without surprises, this is OK. But it is only OK.I was profoundly disappointed with this, as with all of Clarke's sequels (with the exception of 2010 Space Od.) It is simply an insipid logical extension and you feel contantly that the author(s) are groping to extend it in an interesting way. I wish they didn't write this. If you are after real quality, don't get it."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"It was like a bad car wreck, I could not look away. The main characters, Richard Wakefield and Nicole des Jardins, were impossible to enjoy. There was nothing that they could not do!I would recommend something else."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"If Rama II disappointed, avoid this one. The entire plot line is silly (as Nicole and Co. go back and forth between star systems, mostly asleep but aging) and at the end the reader is no where -- third-rate 'cliff-hanger' to get you to buy the next book. It will take another 400 pages in Rama Revealed to get to the so-called revelation. Fans of ACC will not recognize any of his ideas in this volume which basically assumes humans have learned nothing over the years: just plain ignorant, easily manipulated by political leaders, guided by superstition, and usually kill anything in sight. Most of the lead actors are mere caricatures, no personalities or redeeming features and you'll probably despise the heroine, Nicole, who is portrayed as perfect. You're more likely to be entertained by an old B-film from American International than this sludge."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"As people who might have read some of my reviews probably noticed - I have this really bad case against sequels - they always seem to have too many facts of the first book restricting them, and too much to live up to. This sequel is no different. I could give Rama 2 some credit for trying to fix some problems that were in the original book, and it did try to be different, as bad as the result was. This junk is even worse!We are finally destined to meet the makers of Rama, and a bunch of other aliens besides, and are exposed to some REALLY advanced technology. Wow!Then we head back to earth to pick up 200 other human 'specimen'. At first all goes well under Nicole's leadership, but since the human society is so diverse crime evolves, and the criminals take over the habitat, and Nicole's family is put in jeopardy. The last scene in this book is her escape from jail the morning beore her execution.Why read this book? We do learn a little more about Rama, about the aliens we already know, and about the ones we don't know, and get quite a big helping of the blah blah I resented so much in Rama 2 (again - this is an unfimiliar theme in other AC Clarke books - so I guess it has something to do with Gentry Lee joining in?) This book was a waste of my time and money, and I think it is a waste of yours too."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"In this, the 2nd sequel to the fine SF novel, \\"Rendevous with Rama,\\" our herione, Nicole (from \\"Rama II\\") flys around the Milky Way having babies, then she leaves her oldest (14 yo) daughter to marry an old geezer at some triangle-shaped parking lot near another star because it would reduce inbreeding, then this eagle-headed biot dude wants to send the rest of them back to our Solar System so Nicole goes to sleep for 19 years (I about fell asleep, too) in order to find another 2000 losers from Earth to join this pathetic venture. (Remember, things are pretty sorry on Earth by then, after the great Chaos/depression, so it won't take much.) Oh yeah, her younger daughter learns how to masturbate while they enter orbit around Mars. If it sounds stupid, it is. I fought to preserve my memory of the beauty of the original story. But hey, its your time to waste."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"'cos Gentry Lee is really a too bad writer"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"&quot;Good in Places&quot;. Indeed. (**Warning - a few slight spoilers ahead**). The opening few chapters even recaptured for me some of the mind-bogglingly grandiose wonder of the original Rama, The interaction with the Eagle and the eel-like aliens made for inspired and compulsive reading. The decision of how to divide the extended family and the tearful goodbyes made for a dramatic and genuinely poignant moment. Once Nicole transmits her message however and the action switches to the Earth-side preparations for rendezvous, the book nose-dives into mediocrity. Putting aside ones disbelief that such vast expense would be devoted to sending such a dysfunctional band of ex-felons to Mars as representatives of homo sapiens, the less-than-subtle and often irritatingly obvious allegory of human prejudices will surely make most readers groan in disbelief. Come on Sir Arthur (or was Gentry Lee the chief culprit?). You can do a lot better than resorting to two-dimensional soap-opera style goodies and baddies in space! As soon as characters are introduced, it is obvious whether they will fall into the hero or villain pot. Life just ain't that black and white guys! Why couldn't Benjy, Richard, the Redneck farmer or the annoyingly saintly Nicole have at least dropped some litter or something? Surely Katie, the boring Scotsman and the Jap entrepreneur must have had some decent features? Rama III does redeem itself somewhat in the later stages, where exploration of the mysterious far end of the spacecraft produces some enthralling revelations. All too soon however, the authors invoke the feelbad factor once again to remind us what a bunch of rotters humans are. The pious sanctification of Nicole was a particularly irritating sub-plot and really strains the readers' credulity. Would this tough cookie heroine honestly choose martyrdom rather than continuing her struggle against an oppressive system? Ho hum. All things considered however, the Garden of Rama was a satisfactory read and, mug that I am, I have just acquired a copy of Rama Revealed. So watch this space in a couple of weeks for my views on the concluding episode. Fingers crossed that the saga finishes on a high eh?"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"OOOPS, I read the third book first. It caught my interest though, enough to get me to buy the 4th book anyway. I find his work to be imaginative and his writing style to be intense, yet the over description of certain scenery and surroundings detract from the story. All things considered this is a fair work to read on an airplane some time. Oh, and who else wants to know why he chose to call those things &quot;Melons&quot;?"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I can not agree with the negative reviews. I actually found Rama (the first book) the weakest (and shortest) of them all. The one that caused my emotions to come out most was the last book. Gentry Lee writes very well, I could not put the books down. I read all 4 books of this series in one go and seen in context they really are one big story, so it is hard to judge them separately. As a whole they tell one fantastic story with a stunning and tragic (open) end."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"This story was fantastic. There were a few boring parts, like the second chapter in &quot;Rendevous on Mars&quot;. The story starts off with Nicole de Jardin's point-of-view. During this time, she gives birth to five children: Simone, Katie, Benjy, Patrick and Ellie. The only humans are Nicole and the children and Richard Wakefield (Simone, Katie and Ellie's father) and Micheal O'Toole (Benjy and Patrick's father). As Rama speeds towards the constellation Sirrus, they encounter many hardships, including mental-breakdown and Octospiders. As a thirteen year old child, I was astounded. Arthur is an awesome writer. I'm going to read &quot;Rama Revealed&quot; next. I suggest you read the series and try the computer game."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Firstly, I don't think that human beings few hundred years from now will be socially more advanced than 20th century humans, so in fact I find the plot in all ugliness of dirty fight for power in complete disregard for long term consequences, where bad guys (Nakamura &amp;other convicts) dominate the rset of the colonists, quite believable. I also find it easy to beleive that in similar event goverments wouldn't reveal the real reason for sending few thousands of human s in space as aliens requested, and also that lack of &quot;volunteers&quot; would be compensated with convicts who were promised a pardon for their offenses. Only thing I truly disliked in the book is mentioning such a cruel&amp;barbaric procedure as episiotomy as almost necessary part of childbirth."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I think it is just plain silly to see so many comments about the so-called 'smut factor' in this book. Are you people kidding? There must be a lot of prudish sci-fi fans out there... Some of the scenes depicted in this book are indeed sexual, but they are far from pornographic. Read a Brian Lumley novel and you'll see what smut is all about! In all, I think this is a brilliant book. The collaboration between Mr. Clarke and Mr. Gentry is masterful! And if you think this book is good, wait until you read Rama Revealed! It's even BETTER!"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"While still plagued with the Clarke/Lee incompatibility syndrome, it turns out that this book makes up for the general mediocrity of its predecessor, &quot;Rama II&quot;. The first 200 or so pages of this book are among the best science fiction I have ever read. Unfortunately, as some other reviewers have pointed out, the last half of the book has an over-density of smut (thank you so much, Gentry Lee) and ridiculousness.I would recommend it. If you suffered through Rama II, you shall find this third installment in the Rama books to be somewhat more rewarding.Plus, the cover's cool! The scene depicted on the cover actually occurs in the book, precisely. That's a nice change...so many books in this genre have cover art without any real application to the text."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Tedious, boring, endless. This book goes over and over the same agonizing territory, and it can do that easily because it is impossibly long.Nicole, the heroine, is an impossible jerk. She gets an acute attack of hot pants while on board a 12(?) year space ship voyage. As far as I can figure out, that is ALL the book is about. It is torture. If you hate somebody give them this book."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Anyone who rates the Rama series badly has absolutly no imagination or curiosity. I'm an avid sci-fi reader and the Rama series is one of my favorites. If you want mystery and action along with great characters and and story telling than look no further."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Wow. I'll not repeat what so many have said here, but simply agree. Horrible.I wish this book were alive so I could cause it pain. Yes, that horrible."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"In the summer of \`99, I walked into a book store with the intention of raking up as many books as I could carry, and being an aficionado of Clarke's works, among others, I picked out the third pillar of the Rama quadrology.But after reading it, firstly, I feel as if I haven't missed out on much by reading the third chapter in the series to begin with. And secondly, I've marked the final chapter (Rama Revealed) for a rainy day, when there's nothing better around.I wouldn't be so harsh in giving it a 2-star rating, were it not coming from the likes of none other than ACC (maybe 3-stars, were it some other, less-celebrated author).It's acceptable upto halfway through the book. But the second half, where the whole New Eden concept is drawn up is very mundane. The entire plot (as someone has aptly remarked below) looks *exactly* like 20th century Earth. Same problems, same ecosystem, same attitudes, same sociology, same stimuli, even the technology does not at all look like what one might think would be 300 years from now! Not that I was expecting a utopia of some kind, but at least not 'Hey! This is us.' The references in the plot to humankind's past history consistently only refer to the 20th/21st century occurences. The one or two places where an attempt has been made to describe something 'futuristic' has become degenerated to that which is easily pin-pointed to something in our present time.The character of Dr. Nicole des Jardin is too super-womanized and is only a hair short of being apocalyptic -- Olympic athlete, cosmonaut, lover to the King of England, judge, state governor, clairvoyant and the list goes on.I had higher expectations than this, since I am forever mesmerized by the mystique and charisma of ACC's Space Odyssey series and many of his other works."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I decided to re-read the first three books about \\"Rama\\" and found the quality dropping with each book. Is this third book written by the same author as the first two?I really wanted to see the exploration of Rama in this sequel, but Clarke (Genery Lee?) gets so much into politics and character interaction/conflicts that there is less and less science fiction as the story progresses. It seems like a different author has taken over who just likes conversations, social commentary and personality conflicts.The first third of the book is in diary form. What a horrible literary vehicle to use for such a large chunk of the story! I felt like I couldn't make it through this dull section. I had a hard time following how much time (sometimes years) elapsed between entries. There was zero story line or plot when written this way. Even when the story returned to a narrative, I only made it halfway through the book and decided it was so horrible, I just quit reading. Why torture myself?There is a shallowness to this story. It feels like little thought went into it beyond the story outline to fully flesh it out. It moves through the years so quickly in such a matter-of-fact manner that you feel there is no depth to this world. I don't like the characters and the mysterious Rama base is never explored. There is none of the wonder, suspense or surprise of the first two Rama novels."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"It's hard to overstate just how bad this book is. Thin plot? Check. Dimensionless, predictable and stereotypical characters? Check. Outlandish and hard to believe behavior? Check. What makes this even worse than your typical bad book is that Arthur C. Clarke's name is on the cover. Obviously Gentry Lee did most of the writing and story development (or lack thereof). One has to hope he's a better engineer than writer."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Gentry really messed up a good franchise. Throws in a lot of mystical feminine feelings and fantasies.Way too much time wasted discussing the protagonist's and her children's relationships. I really don't need a description of an episiotomy and bad sex in a SciFi story and certainly not polluting Clarke's name. I wound up skipping whole pages at a time hoping to get to some resolution to Clarke's original vision but the last pages just left you hanging with no desire to read yet another sequel. vapid and pointless.I actually thought Gentry Lee was a woman from the writing style and gender of the protagonist but when I looked the author up to see what other books he/she wrote I found it was actually an old dude writing as a woman. That is just flat out creepy. I do not recommend any books by this author."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I truly do not understand the negative reviews for \\"The Garden of Rama.\\" This is my favorite of the Rama series, by far. This novel has the right blend of science fiction, wonder, adventure, and human heart and soul. The idea of three humans stranded inside Rama appeals to my sense of adventure and the human drive to persevere. I highly recommend this sequel."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"As years pass on board Rama and a family develops amidst the alien landscape, you begin to know and love the characters, to feel their pain, and know their joy, so real are they portrayed with such depth. And yet more mysteries about Rama are revealed while others created. Alien creatures and climactic events. Beyond comparison."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"It's not more Hard SF! It's only a big soap opera in space...I gave a 2 because I'm a Clarke fan and haven't got the nerves to give him a 1. I have lost them after the read."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Want to get ripped off? Buy this book.The original book in this series was very good-close to a classic. One of the few criticisms one could make of it was it was so transparently commercially manipulative was clear more books were on the way and this was as much--if not more--a money making exercise as an artistic one. But the book was good and this trilogy thing has apparently become a (bad) habit in the sci-fi world, so you give people a little leeway.Or I did till the second book, Rama II came out.If you read the first book then read Rama II, one thing is brutally clear-the books were written by different people. Clearly this book should have read \\"By Gentry Lee, based on the ideas of Arthur C. Clark.The 2nd book was awful-the worst sort of 4th rate pulp sci-fi fiction. Sex and sensationalism replaced sci-fi as the driving force of the book. It advanced the readers understanding of the Raman'-their form, ideas, intentions, etc.--not one whit.So why did I venture into this book? I thought that Clarke might just possibly have been sufficiently chagrined by the harsh criticism Rama II got to try to get back on track and provide a sequel worthy of the first book.Unbelievebly, this book is even worse than Rama II. Much, much worse.I won't even bother with a plot or character analysis. I really don't want anyone to even remotely think that there's anything here worth reading.It's sad to see a giant of the genre sell out but I can think of no other explanation for these recent abominations.Save your money. This book is worse than trash."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Just a couple of examples of how utterly worthless the science is in the Rama sequels:The octospiders, we learn, are an underwater race. Fine. But Gentry Lee has them communicating by bands of colored light around their heads, because--get this--sound doesn't travel well under water, but light does. Uh huh. That's what he said. Apparently, he never heard of whales and dolphins.So, the octospiders have no words for anything. Yet, later, Lee makes up octospider words for their system of measuring time (the smallest unit being about 20 seconds, as I recall). Yep. They have no speech, but they have names for things.That's just for starters. As I forced myself to finish reading this dreck, I began to wonder if it was a hoax, a challenge to the readers to find as many inconsistencies as possible. It just made me feel angry and insulted."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"An okay read. So far neither of the Rama sequels have come close to the first book, \\"Rendevous with Rama\\". It is in interesting series at least and I am anxious to see where it is all heading in \\"Rama Revealed\\"."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"In my opinion, Rendezvous with Rama and Rama II are very good novels. This sequel though is dreadfully boring. I really wanted to read it and like it. I bought copies of Rama II, The Garden of Rama, and Rama Revealed at the same time planning to read them all. I have tried maybe five or six times to read this novel and I fail every time. The first half of this novel is 'Nicole's Journal' and I think it was a really bad style choice. There is nothing compelling about the journal. It reads like a diary, but that isn't up to the caliber of a novel with a novel having many characters, plot and subplots, story. Being trapped in the alien spaceship really isn't that exciting anyways. It should have been much better.What I ended up doing is skimming this novel and its sequel, Rama Revealed. That way I found out what happened to the characters and was able to 'fast forward' through the dreary garbage. But I shouldn't have to do that."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"What a major dissappointment ! The first half of the book is true A. C. Clarke in excellent form, atmospheric, gripping &amp; with the imagination firing like the master he is. And then what happens? We get a an honest to goodness, old fashioned soap! I could live with a cliffhanger ending if I cared what happens next."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I think that Gentry Lee has impeeded Clarke. I heard that he wrote most of the Rama books (Clarke made up the story line), which is why sometimes they're so boring and why there's less actual science fiction. There were of course some good parts in GOR, but when I read it the third time I didn't finish it. The problem with this is that GOR is quite necessary to completely understand Rama Revealed, the next book, which I have labelled as one of my two all-time favorites."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"The first book was fantastic, I really loved it. In the second book there was too much &quot;character&quot; stuff and too little &quot;tech&quot; stuff. Clarke cannot write good characters anyway, not Lee either. This book is crap compared to the first one. No tech stuff at all, only a lot of really boring moral stuff about the decline of human society and stuff. The only interesting part is when Richard is admitted to the avian/myrmicat/sessile lair."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I can't believe this book got such bad reviews. People say say they can't believe things would be a lot like they are now 300 years from now. While I do think that it's unrealistic to say we won't have a great deal of technological abvancments I think the authors are making a point about human nature. If you've read Rama Reaveled then what I think the whole series is tring to tell us is that although we may be an intelligent race If we continue to fight omust ourselves and keep hating people because of race or sex or because of a deases we will never advance to our highest potential."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Well thankfully, I didn't have to read the last and final part of the Rama series. I had \\"Rendezvous\\" ages ago and thought I would take a chance on the 3rd volume in the story. My mistake. I was able to read the reviews of the final \\"chapter\\". I realize that reading it would just prolong the situation of The Garden, i.e. mostly dead boring."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.And for all intents, since i am going to go for the sequel- I must be insane.Or not, since I don't really expect it to be better- just some closure.Garden was better than the the soap opera that was Rama 2 (hence 2 stars), but still a total let down from Rendezvous.It really bugs me that the people chosen to populate Rama by the government included convicts. I would really think in reality people would be willing to cut off their right arms to be part of something like this and would chosen from the best and the brightest. (And if the analogy is the New World- well, a look at the punishments of colonial times would tell you that the death penalty was a popular punishment for any number of crimes including theft. The colonists took it into accounct that their members incuded criminals.)"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Allow me to be a little retrospective . The first book was a gem. Not often are there books which concentrate purely on the technological side and get away with little or no character development . The second was pleasing only towards the end although I found the need to explain life stories of characters profoundly irritating and often irrelevant . Who cares if Francesca is a slut ? I was hoping for a redemption of sorts in this third book but nope , didn't find it . If this book were set in an urban 20th century environment , it would be a mid-day soap opera with sex and drugs thrown in . As a science fiction novel , it somehow manages to discard most science . Maybe it was Lee's influence , maybe I just lost patience with the black and white characters . This book could have done with better characterisation , less politics , less pointless sex , less Shakespearen quotes and finally , a helluva lot more science fiction . Ultimately I was disappointed since I started reading this series with much enthusiasm and ended up flicking chapters just to see who would cark it next."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Thank you Mr Clarke. It is not your best, but I'll take your second best over most of the other stuff out there. Based on the reviews posted here I was sure that I would be disappointed (if you read carefully, many reviews are by people who DIDN'T EVEN READ THE WHOLE BOOK, OR EVEN THE BOOK AT ALL!!!???). I absolutely loved this book and it makes me appreciate the whole series much better. Scenes from the 1st two books that you thought meant little suddenly take on new meaning and urgency. If you were a fan of the 1st two books you will want to know where the Rama vehicle is heading and what happens next. Several of the neighbor species get better developed and they add to your overall sense of space exploration/adventure. War may be brewing with the Octospiders!! Granted, a chunk of the book written by Gentry Lee dealing with the colonists was skimmable at best, but the remaining 75% written by Clarke is amazing and kept me reading at a brisk pace. He saves some of his best stuff for last when he ends by thoroughly describing the biology of the aliens. Cant wait for the last book, \\"Rama Revealed\\".I recommend this book to anyone who likes space exploration/adventure books with a healthy dose of aliens and mystery thrown in. If you are not expecting a top 10 best sci-fi book of all time, you will not be disappointed. I am so happy that I am not one of the people who didn't at least give it a chance and instead gave a bad review and couldn't understand the brilliant thinking of a sci-fi master."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I read this book several years ago and am now getting ready to read it's precursors. I must admit I'm a bit biased being a fan of Arthur C. Clarke, but only because I enjoy his thought provoking works.To date Garden of Rama is my favorite book from Arthur C. Clarke. It is imaginitive and alien as it should be. I was disappointed to see others didn't feel the same. I found it quite enjoyable to read the tale about how these few humans would have the desire to explore and learn, no matter the consequences. Then the heart of the book about the birth of the universe and it's outcome and research provide the thought provoking stimulus I expect from Clarke. A wonderful book in typical Clarke fashion."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"For those of us who do not analyze a book down to the ink on the page and who simply enjoy the book for what it is, this book is good, no great, no a masterpiece of science fiction. If you loved the first two, then your sure to love this one. ...a continuation of the first two...simple pure science fiction...like eating a 12 pound chocolate truffle, an indulgence for those who love the craft!"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I thought this, the fourth and final book of the series, was one of the best, and perhaps THE best. All the way from beginning to end the humans are forced to deal with their humanity, and the ending shows such a deep level of emotion and feeling so rarely seen in modern science fiction. Clarke does a wonderful job of tying together science, religion, and many other facets of human comprehension to bring to a finale this, the end of the Rama series. If you haven't read the series yet, GO READ IT!! Then read this book. You will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I guess I am the exception to the rule, as I absolutely loved all 4 of the Rama books. I was so caught up in what had happened and would happen with Nicole and her family that I could hardly wait 'til the next book in the series was published! To let you know how much I was affected by the series: at the end of Rama Revealed, I was moved to tears at the death of Nicole and the realization that this was IT. But, I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed in what was and was not reavealed."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"The downhill slide of Arthur C. Clarke's brilliant \`Rendezvous with Rama' continues with this third installment in the series written largely by Gentry Lee. There are so many problems with this novel that I don't know where to begin. The series starts just where \`Rama II\` left off with Nicole des Jardins and her companions trapped in the Rama spacecraft as it heads off into the unknown. The fundamental problem with this book is, in my view, that about 80% of it has nothing to do with advancing the story. There are definitely some good ideas, but roughly 4/5ths of this book is boilerplate, pure and simple. The overlying themes easily hold your attention: Who built Rama? Why? Where are Nicole and her comrades going? What will be their fate? There is so much irrelevant material wasted on character development of minor players, politics, sex, and family relationships that don't advance the story. Don't get me wrong, these are all fine topics for novels in their own right, but hard sci-fi novels should spend 80% of the story on these types of threads.This book is divided up into 5 sections of about 10-12 chapters each. The tone and style of each section is very different, almost as if each was written by a different writer. The first section is written in journal format, as Nicole describes the intrepid adventurers life aboard Rama as it heads into the unknown. There is some interesting discussion and speculation about Rama, but large parts of this section are taken up describing how to make a stable civilization with only two men and one woman and how they have to breed to make genetically viable children. The second section is set several years later as Rama has arrived at its destination and there are now several children frolicking about. We learn a bit about the Ramas (enough to whet our appetite), but most of the discussion is about family relationships again. The third section is totally pointless. It is entirely about (new) character development for people who play insignificant roles for the rest of the book. You can completely skip the third section without any loss of continuity. I won't reveal much about the fourth and fifth section only to say that it is more of a political and familial story, very little sci-fi. That being said, the aliens encountered in the last 100 pages or so are definitely interesting.There are definitely some good ideas in the book, but they are deeply buried amongst a mountain of chaff. If you liked \`Rendezvous with Rama' you will almost certainly be disappointed with this book. Not a total waste of time, and I'm a glutton for punishment so I'll probably read \`Rama Revealed'. Additionally, I get the sense that Gentry Lee was trying to make some profound statement about human nature in this story (about intellect over tribalism). Much of the best sci-fi of course explores timeless themes of human interest and offer some unique insights into human society. If this was in fact the case, I didn't find his moralizing particularly compelling. Bottom line - without the link to RWR, this book would not be worth reading. There is too little of merit in this 500+ page novel to justify spending the time to read it when you can easily find hundreds of more interesting works."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"In this second sequel to Rendezvous with Rama Gentry Lee takes us to a hint of the origins of the Rama spacecraft. Unfortunately, the answers are not very satisfying. The \\"Rama Node\\" is said to be huge, but the characters never get a sense of it. And the existence of dozens of other Rama type vessels and an even larger space station diminishes the awe of the original Rama craft.I read this, but I wouldn't ever again."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"The first book--just by Arthur C. Clarke--was awesome. The second--with Lee--was decent. I just hope that Clarke didn't actually write this because otherwise he needs to give up writing.The only thing that kept me from being depressed that I had wasted my time with this book was the description of the ant creatures--that was decently creative.I didn't think the &quot;sex manuals&quot; another reviewer wrote about were annoying but they definitely were not interesting. The politics were like a lecture on how people today should act with no flavor to them whatsoever."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"it is not a hard-core scifi but still it is magnicifien"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"If I want a season ending cliff hangger, I'll watch prime time soaps. This book starts in one direction(good)in a RAMA tradition. It then turns into a morality play unworthy of the author, and then stops, as if it were a weekly serial. I love a good series, but each book should stand on its' own. This one just wants you to buy the next installment."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"Ok.... I admit that I have enjoyed reading the RAMA books, but not in the same way I enjoy reading other books written by Arthur C. Clarke, a man I consider to be one of the greatest writers ever. These books, except for the first one, are just action adventures/soap operas. There is nothing deep or anything that will make you think in these books. Reading this series is like watching Pro-Wrestling: you know it is ridiculous, but it keeps you entertained, so you keep watching/reading. For anyone who is not really into Sci-Fi, and is not looking for original ideas, but is looking for a bunch of pointless sex, this is a great book. I am really bothered that Clarke sunk to the level of writing a series with pathetic cliffhangers at the end to sucker a reader into buying another book in the series. He should leave that up to Diane Carey and Peter David who think that writing Star Trek novels is the same thing as writing Sci-Fi."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"There are so many flaws with this book it is difficult to know where to begin. First of all, it isn't a very good sci-fi book. It would make a better sermon, which is really what it is trying to be anyway. Second of all, it is difficult to get past all the dis-jointed story lines and obvious continuity flaws. I mean, if the folks who went into RAMA II had all this great medical equipment, then how come the folks in GARDEN, which takes place some 70 years LATER have such crappy medical equipment? Beyond the preaching, the confusing story lines and simple plot errors, this book reads like a studebaker: clunky and slow."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"This book (and the others in this series - especialy the first one) was excellent. If you enjoy semi-hard SF books that are, literally, stellar in scope and span many lives and stories you will enjoy the series. If anyone knows of books or series similar to these please send me mail at dcaldon@iforward.com."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I think I spent the whole day one labor day reading this book.

So what? there are so many haters here for no apparent reason. I don't think they read the books, just decided to join the hate bandwagon. These three books are an excellent epic of a family caught in incredible events."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"After reading the reviews on this book, I have to admit to being a little disappointed in the reviewers. Especially the reviewer from Mexico, whos gripes appear to be moralistic rather than based on the story at hand. Rendezvous with Rama was a great book, but it seems to me that everyone was expecting the following books to be exactly the same. I am glad to announce that the books are not like it. They are distinct and quite a pleasure to read once you stop expecting it to be just like the original."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"After being entranced by the first two entries in this series, I was severely disappointed by the third. Except for the very beginning of the book, the traditional sci-fi aspects fly right out the window. Instead, you're left with a socio-economic lesson and subtle-as-a-jackhammer comparisons to our current society. This was a snore and a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I think this book is above all others. I read a rewiev here that said that Nicole de Jardin was a very extraordinary character. Well, how about Richard Wakefield? He figured out how to program the computer in the Humans nest, and he builds robots as it was nothing. He gotta be very intelligent to make such things... I dont know. Anyway, Garden of RAMA is a very great, fascinating and astonishing and awesome book, real but unreal.... always the mystery: who invented RAMA? and where do the octos and &quot;birds&quot; from? And all other strange things happening... Clarke rules.I give it the highest rate"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"I would have given this book a 10 if not for the smut in some parts of it.

However, life in New Eden (technology & amenities) evolved way too fast to be believable, and yes, the colonists were entirely too stupid."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"This tremendous series continues with the third book in the Rama series. At the end of Rama II three astronauts we left trapped in a huge cylindrical spacecraft heading off towards one of our closest stars.The first fifth of the novel is presented in the form of Nicole des Jardine's diary and is probably the highlight. It tells of their 12 year journey to &quot;The Node&quot; - a giant space station built by the creators of Rama. There are no warp-drive shortcuts here, Clarke and Lee brilliantly tell the story of how the astronauts start a family, not knowing how long their journey will last and their efforts (often painful) to create genetic diversity amongst their offspring.As the returned and refitted Rama craft returns to pick up more human specimens, the book takes a breather for about 100 pages, delving you into the lives of many new characters through deep and often uninteresting characterisation. The completed colony accelerates off into space again, but 'New Eden' is not without it's problems as the des Jardine descendents and cross sections of global society struggle to integrate.With an excellent plot, but pondering middle section &quot;The Garden of Rama&quot; succeeds overall, but you're left wondering about the sudden change in the colony with Nakamura takes power. We're back to full form in the last 100 pages with Wakefield investigating the other species on the ship while other events unfold in the human habitat. This is where the story picks up again but is rushed. The conclusion is pretty moving and makes you instantly want to pick up the final book &quot;Rama Revealed.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"One of the best known series in all of science fiction, the Rama story is a truly captivating tale that keeps you glued to the pages. Though slow at times, this is a story that no sci-fi fan should miss. It is a story that examines so many aspects of humanity: love, the bonds within family, greed, jealousy, tyranny, determination, moral dilemmas, the environmental and social problems that currently plague our planet, and the hopes and dreams of the future of mankind and how we might react in the face of the unknown wonders that await us as we venture from our cradle here on Earth and into the vastness of space. It is a story that will make you think about your own life and ponder the path that you have chosen over the years. It will make you think both while you are reading and for a long time after you finish.If you're interested in other thoughts about Rama as a whole, see the beginning of my &quot;Rama II&quot; review.*****&quot;The Garden of Rama&quot;Part II of the grand Raman adventure picks up where the cliffhanger at the end of Part I left off. This book is much more accessible from the beginning than &quot;Rama II&quot;, but those who did not like the first book will probably like the beginning of this one even less. It is written in four sections, however, and don't be put off if you find the first one too slow or emotional. The story really picks up a lot starting in the second section.Personally, I thought that the format of telling the story through Nicole's journal in section one was very effective. What the family goes through in New York is incredible and anyone who has ever shared a deep love with a partner or spouse, or has been through trying times in a family cannot help but be moved by some of the things that take place. This book made me think about many aspects of my life and especially about the importance of the bond I share with my wife.Apart from the emotional and moral explorations, there are plenty of mysteries tossed out there for the reader to ponder, especially where the Octospiders are concerned. The events at the Node were intriguing and sometimes mysterious, and the factory where Rama is reconfigured reminded me of the factory on Magrathea where the Earth was constructed in Douglas Adams's &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;.The middle section's character development reminded me a lot of the beginning of &quot;Rama II&quot; and the slowness of it drags the book down a bit. This part is so purely Lee that it is as if he slipped out of the Rama concept for a moment and ran off in some entirely different direction. Actually, this part is very important for the story, but that doesn't make it more interesting at the time.What takes place once everyone is aboard is a truly sad, yet very accurate commentary on the human species. It is unfortunate that humans cannot get along with others of their own kind, are so overrun with greed and hate, and frolic through life with such disregard for other beings. I believe that the majority of people are good at heart, but there is always the minority that wages war, commits atrocities supposedly justified by skin color or ethnic background, or submits entire populations to virtual imprisonment merely to satisfy their megalomaniacal thirst for power. This is to say nothing of the shortsighted environmental crimes against the Earth or the extermination of other species that we are committing on a daily basis.So what we have onboard Rama is a microcosm of human society encompassing all the best and all the worst that our world has to offer. This is not a story that sweeps reality under the rug and paints a rosy picture of mankind's future in space where virtually all problems have been solved. This is a story that exposes the hard facts and explores real social problems. There is even a parallel for AIDS in the RV-41 virus. And as you might expect the humans destroy their own habitat and then begin to destroy the habitats of those around them as well. Sometimes it seems that mankind's never-ending search for new frontiers is really a never-ending search for new environments to destroy. It's too bad that in reality there isn't anyone that can come in, call timeout, and put everyone to sleep. The humans in Rama thought that the Avians and the Octospiders were their enemies, but the true enemy comes from within. It is sad but true.Like &quot;Rama II&quot;, this book is not to be taken alone. It is simply the middle section of a much larger story and you must read all three parts to really appreciate what Clarke and Lee have done. The ending will drive you straight into &quot;Rama Revealed&quot;; I closed &quot;Garden&quot; and immediately opened &quot;Revealed&quot;. The Rama story gets better and better as you go along. Again, I highly recommend reading the &quot;Rama II&quot; / &quot;Garden of Rama&quot; / &quot;Rama Revealed&quot; series. It will really get you thinking both while you're reading and for a long time after you finish. A truly amazing tale."},{"Title":"The Garden of Rama","review":"This particular run in the series is what many people would refer to as \\"soft sci-fi.\\" That is to say it is a story that focuses less on the science and more on the human element that must interact with said science. Clarke often has a hard sci-fi bent, but it is not unusual for him to focus on the human aspect (for example, see the various Tales from the White Hart in which the stories are more about narrative than the science being narrated). Perhaps some of the soft influence was from Gentry Lee. Regardless, this story is not what one would originally expect after reading Rendezvous and Rama II. The scattered details about the happenings on Earth over the course of Rama I and II come to fruition to create the main story arc. The focus drops off of Rama and its technology very quickly.This third story does have a way with villianizing society, governments, and people in general. This is a story about how unrestrained and abusive humankind might be even in paradise. A scientific-minded person living in a corporate nation might identify with the themes embedded in Garden of Rama. While nothing is completely villianized, those readers that have a more optimistic view of people and society might do well to skip this one."},{"Title":"My Lady's Prisoner","review":"I was very surprised by this book. Since Harlequin Historical slashed the length of their books, their stories really suffer. It's hard to develop strong characters and exciting plotlines with the really mini-book length. Shame on Harlequin since they are charging big book prices, too!However, I must say Cree gave a very gentle, old fashion style romantic suspense. Lady Julia Carrington's husband worked as a spy for the Brits. When he was killed three years before, she was told it had nothing to do with his work, but was a simple robbery. She never truly accepted the verdict, because they only thing they took was a special ring she had given him. Therefore, she is upset when a former comrade of her husband's sends word the ring has finally turned up on the hand of Nicholas Chandler, Viscount Thayne. She is so disturbed she arranges to play cards with him trying to win information. Only, she finds him in a lousy mood, so she falls to play B - kidnaps him. Her abduction is foiled when men paid to act as Highwaymen tried to steal the ring. Julia pulls a pistol and Thayne jumps before her to save her from being shot.She takes him home and nurses him, but soon wishes Thayne gone because she feels an attraction to him. To cover for her tending Thayne, she is sent to London, but there she is determined to press the issue of the ring. Someone is resolute in getting the ring back. Julia is pushed in the path of carriages; Thayne is knocked out when trying to find out information about the ring. Thayne is asking questions about Julia's husband's murder and someone wants it stopped.Julia's neighbour Lord George is determined to put the cat in the pigeons by starting enough gossip about Thayne and Julia to force an engagement. But is this merely wanting to win a wager or was he somehow involved with Carrington's murder? Could it be his older brother behind the man's death? As the riddle of who wants the ring and why gets deeper and deeper, you are pulled along wondering how the &quot;mysterious Mary&quot; from Thayne's past got hold of a ring belonging to a dead man and gave it to Thayne as a gift before her own death.Enough riddles to keep you off balance and wondering. Thayne is delightful Alpha male, Julia's is charming - so is Wellington the Cat and Betty the Goat.This writer so great promise and I will be looking for more books from her."},{"Title":"My Lady's Prisoner","review":"This book was a complete bore. No chemistry at all between the two main characters. The story dragged on the entire way. The romance was as rated G as a Disney cartoon and even more. There was no passion at all."},{"Title":"A Gift of Daisies","review":"I'm a fan of Mary Balogh as anyone who has read my reviews will know. She's a real treasure although she has once or twice disappointed me. I try to be as honest as I can with my reviews and take note of what other reviewers say before I purchase expensive out-of-print books. Therefore, this was the most recent of my MB purchases as I felt it probably wasn't worth tracking down based on what others have said here. I was wrong and I think the other reviewers have been unfair to this book and I don't think they have considered the historical context thus missing the point. I think this is one of the author's most interesting books and, if I may be so bold, shows clearly her Welsh background!For a start, the Victorian reformers like William and Catherine Booth (founders of the Salvation Army) and Sidney and Beatrice Webb (and the Fabians) were working in that time period spanning the rise of Methodism and the origins of the modern British welfare state in the early 20th century. And it is also true to say that they, and many, many others, were reacting to the excesses of the Regency period and, indeed, the whole of the 18th century. Some define the 18th century as that period from the Restoration in 1660 to the coronation of Victoria in 1838. By the time Victoria came to the throne, there was a widespread reaction to the mindset of the Regency and reform started in earnest. There was the end to slavery, the repeal of the Corn Laws, the extension of the franchise with the Reform Act of 1832, the Married Woman's Property Act, Gladstone's work with prostitutes, etc, etc. People like John Wesley and William Wilberforce led the way.Sorry about the history lesson but I think the characters of David Gower and Lady Rachel Palmer epitomise this sea-change that was taking place at the end of the Regency. David Gower is wholly admirable in his desire to work with the poor and Rachel is very much characteristic of the lady reformers that came in the Victorian era. They embody the urge felt to reform a jaded and unjust society, led (of course) from the upper echelons of society (like Beatrice Webb in particular). These were the people who had influence, impact, education, friends in Parliament and the ability to bring about change. Rachel's unfocused but very convincing need for a cause, and her faltering but true steps to find one, are indicative of all of this.This book is not Regency Lite. Read carefully, it is introspective and analytical. It portrays some of the real issues of the day and the beginnings of reform in Britain so very much inspired by the church, especially the Methodists. I liked the hero and heroine and their spiritual journey is wholly credible to me. They do not take life lightly and yet both recognise the value of a deeply physical and spiritual love for each other in a life of service both to God and to others. They are most certainly not silly, superficial, condescending or overly pious as WRM-UK has said.I am sorry some reviewers did not like this book but I value it highly and think it is truly one of the author's most memorable. Certainly worth the money spent!"},{"Title":"A Gift of Daisies","review":"This book has a poor vicar for the hero.I loved this bookfor its undercurrent of faith&amp;spirituality,without it being hea-vy handed.David Gower is a complete anathema to the best knownliterary vicar,Jane Austen's Mr.Collins.He actually lives hisfaith,and will not faulter,or let himself be tempted from hisvalues.Ms.Balogh has said that she caught a lot of fire from herfans for this book,but I myself loved it."},{"Title":"A Gift of Daisies","review":"Even with so many books in print, Mary Balogh still comes up with a new twist to the delicious formula we all know and love. In this case, we have beautiful Lady Rachel Palmer, sought after by all the men. She has never known love until she meets the one man who resists her charms. The man is Reverand David Gower. Here is the reversal; often it is the woman who is a governess or some other gently born lady of little means, who is pursued by the wealthy high born lord. This is a classic story of love at first sight (even if he doesn't know it yet). The characters of Rachel Palmer and David Gower are two imperfect people who help each other to grow and change. If you like your romance with a heroine who knows what--or rather who--she wants and pursues him, then this book is for you. A fun read!"},{"Title":"A Gift of Daisies","review":"...I am a very great fan of Mary Balogh. So much so that I am tracking down her out-of-print backlist and buying second-hand copies at large multiples of their cover prices. Therefore I would not usually write negative reviews of one of her books. This time I have to.On other occasions, a Balogh book has hooked me right from the first page. I'm sucked in and can barely put the book down. A Gift Of Daisies felt nothing like a Balogh book. Reading the first few pages, I actually had to look again at the back cover to check that it was actually Rachel who was the heroine, not her much nicer and more interesting friend Celia...I can't recommend A Gift Of Daisies in any way, and will probably hide it at the very back of my Balogh collection so I'll never be tempted to read it again."},{"Title":"A Gift of Daisies","review":"I really feel Balogh missed an opportunity to come up with a classic angst-ridden love story, which she writes so well. Instead, I felt this story was bland with wishy-washy characters that did nothing to capture my sympathy. I just felt that everyone was 'playing' at being 'good' - in the end, I didn't care what anyone did. Give it a miss would be my advice."},{"Title":"A Gift of Daisies","review":"Pleasant, but not as involving as Balogh's others. Lady Rachel Palmer is the toast of London society, until she is introduced to the Reverend David Gower. He's the new minister of her country parish, and a friend of her childhood sweetheart. She immediately falls in love with him, and decides that her life in London is artificial and unfulfilling. She has her work cut out for her, however, to convince David that she would rather be a minister's wife, than married to some powerful, wealthy aristocrat. The story is as much about her spiritual awakening as it is a romance. The romance, frankly, is rather tepid, and not all that interesting. People who enjoy Christian romances will probably like this one."},{"Title":"Spirit Seizures -","review":"I love this collection of stories. Melissa Pritchard's use of precise, descriptive language opens up a visual world for the reader placing her or him in the center of each story; a witness to the unraveling of lives.

We can see ourselves in them and the comparison elicits feelings of loss, sadness, and yet we're left feeling hopeful too."},{"Title":"A Gift of Stories: Discovering How to Deal With Mental Illness","review":"A collection of personal stories by diagnosed people from all walks of life who speak very freely about their experiences.

I keep it in my kitchen bookshelf and refer to it often."},{"Title":"Top 100 Herbal Remedies","review":"I have to say when I first bought this book I thought it was worth it. For me it was not worth it. I did not keep it. Some of the stuff that it had were too deep. I had the feeling it was one of those books that you read but another book has to be in used."},{"Title":"The Causes of the Civil War","review":"some drivel, some repetitive and others stunning with fresh insight. Impossible to characterize as biased because of the variety of sources. What is called the &quot;American Civil War&quot; is a complex event which is difficult to untangle from all that preceded or followed it. The self-rightousness, aggrandizing commercial motives of the North were often masked as moral crusades and the theme emerged time and time again as I read. I would have to add this as a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone who is serious about scholarship of the period."},{"Title":"The Causes of the Civil War","review":"This book is concise, and gives the causes of the Civil War. Stampp is a very well respected and well informed. Stampp gives the reader a quick yet through breakdown of the causes of the Civil War. I used this book as a source in writing a paper on the Causes of the Civil War (undergrad) and it was very helpful. This is useful for those interested in American History."},{"Title":"The Causes of the Civil War","review":"This book is a seminal work for any student of the Civil War. It gives the opinions of those that actually lived through it, opinions from before, during, and after the war. These opinions are conflicting of course. For me it was not the type of book you can just sit down and read but rather a book to browse from time to time. An absolutely fascinating book."},{"Title":"The Causes of the Civil War","review":"I'm sort of surprised at the first two reviews. The first gentleman refers to the book as \\"drivel,\\" even though Stampp used mostly primary sources. The second reviewer falls victim to the Neo-Confederate idea that slavery had nothing to do with the American Civil War--while clumsily avoiding the incredible mountain of primary sources that prove slavery WAS an issue. Stampp's book is a cornerstone of Civil War Historiography, and any serious student of the American Civil War would do well to read this excellent book. Don't be put off by the fact that The Causes of the Civil War was originally a textbook--it is both readable, and a quick read."},{"Title":"The Causes of the Civil War","review":"I rather enjoyed this resource about the Civil war and the era preceding and following. I found the use of articles, journal entries, letters, speeches and historic documents from multiple centuries rather valuable. To see how the perception of the Civil War has changed over the past 150 years is fascinating and watching the trend of history revisionism, conservatism, and liberalism that directly affects how we address history and teach history. I believe this book should be a staple in a Univeristy classroom that educates about this era. I say let the students see multiple sources and let them make their own conclusions on who is \\"guilty, innocent, and caught in the middle\\". Too often we are given one perspective on a very diverse and complicated event and we are supposed to accept a simple reason for it. There is much more to the politics and secession issues within the Confederacy and the Union. This book allows a student to see how both the North and South have their faults in this conflict."},{"Title":"The Causes of the Civil War","review":"Sure, just another book that on one hand tells us that only a small minority of Quaker 'fanatics' were abolitionists, and that the war was over expansion and not slavery, and then the next minute have us all believe that Union troops faught and died to end slavery when in many of their hometowns there were laws that forbid blacks, Indians, and mulatooes from staying in town after sundown. If you believe that people died for this, then you need to be reading bedtime stories. The war was fought over MONEY, POWER, and caused by disagreement between Constitutional Federalists and Jeffersonians. Even the Supreme Court ruled that secession was allowed under the Constitution (in 1862 I believe), but in their ruling said basically that 'this is our ruling, but to no avail, because the issue is being decided on the battlefields as we speak'."},{"Title":"Andersonville: The Last Depot (Civil War America)","review":"This is a fine research work that will destroy many of the bloated myths about Andersonville prison (most of them spawned by TNT's highly overrated TV movie). But this book is not a very good read. The prose is rather dry and unimaginative and will leave the reading wondering if a better history of Andersonville will ever be written by a more talented author. It will."},{"Title":"Andersonville: The Last Depot (Civil War America)","review":"I ONCE SAW A DOCUMENTARY ON THE HISTORY CHANNEL CALLED HORROR ATANDERSONVILLE PRISON THE TRIAL OF HENRY WIRZ.IT ANGERED ME SO MUCH THAT I CONVINCED MY MOTHER TO BY ME A COPY OF THE BOOK FROM YOUR FINE WEBSITE. IT ALLOWED ME TO SEE HOW MUCH THOSE MEN SUFFERED THEY WERE TREATED LIKE CATTLE.BUT AT LEAST YOU FEED CATTLE . THEY WERE TREATED HORRIBLY .AND PEOPLE IN PRISON HAVE THE NERVE TO COMPLAIN THAT THEY ARE BEING TREATED BADLY THEY OUGHT BE LUCKY THAT THEY ARE NOT TREATED LIKE THE SOLIDERS AT ANDERSONVILLE WERE."},{"Title":"Andersonville: The Last Depot (Civil War America)","review":"In buying the book I dismissed the one negative review by \\"mightyhob\\". My mistake. After reading Andersonville I have to agree with him. Does the author really expect anyone to believe Wirz is a good guy because he once let a prisoner pick up a knife he dropped or a couple of other so-called acts of kindness? Or because clerics and ladies found him \\"courteous and accommodating\\". He even captions one photo as \\"...the judge advocate who railroaded Henry Wirz\\". Hardly objective, especially in the absence of anything to support it. He devotes only 4 pages to the trial, calling witness testimony exaggerated, imaginative or pure invention and referring to Wirz as deprived. I would think that if you're attempting to revise history, you need to make a better argument than the lame one put forth here. Too bad. The details of life in this prison made for some interesting reading at times."},{"Title":"Andersonville: The Last Depot (Civil War America)","review":"I found this book an excellent read. My sole sources about Andersonville prior to it were Mackinlay Kantor's captivating novel &quot;Andersonville&quot;, The 1970 PBS powerful drama &quot;The Andersonville Trial, A Play by Saul Levitt&quot; - directed by George C. Scott, the brief and not really well researched references to it in the PBS special &quot;The Civil War&quot; by Ric Burns and the rather one-sided TNT moltion picture &quot;Andersonville&quot;. Prior to reading this book I had been particularily touched by &quot;The Andersonville Trial&quot;. The acting was very well done (William Shanter, fresh from Star Trek cancellation portrayed the &quot;hero&quot; of the play -- Colonel Chipman&quot;) and the purpose of that play, in my opinion, was to try and make Andersonville appear as a percursor of the Nazi Death camps and Captain Wirz a percursor of the guards and commandants who &quot;only followed orders&quot; in those places. However after I read Mr. Marvel's well researched account of this most infamous prison I am convinced that Captain Wirz was more a victim of circumstance and Colonel Chipman's vengence rather than some cruel monster of a man who had lost his soul to General Winder as portrayed by Mr. Levitt. Indeed, perhaps, I would suggest that maybe Mr. Levitt, if he still lives, should read this work and perhaps, consider a rewrite of his play keeping faitful to facts this time rather than using have baked anecdotes of dubios origin -- or if he isn't, maybe someone ought to try and revise it. In any event, and to conclude, I heartily agree with James McPherson, well known author of &quot;The Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; that this is &quot; . . . the best account of the tragedy of Andersonville that we have or are likely to have.&quot;"},{"Title":"Andersonville: The Last Depot (Civil War America)","review":"In Andersonville: The Last Depot, William Marvel gives the serious student of Civil War history a balanced and highly accurate account of what transpired during those fourteen awful months between Feb. 1864 and Apr. 1865. The events of Capt. Henry Wirz's trial and execution are also covered in detail and for the first time we begin to get a glimpse of who the real man was. While the book is filled with many historical facts about the prison itself, Mr. Marvel does not neglect the human side of Andersonville. Through thorough and meticulous research, Mr. Marvel acquaints the reader with men like Thomas &quot;Chickamauga&quot; Herburt, George &quot;Albert&quot;, Salvador &quot;Thomas&quot; Genzardi as well as many others. How important is this historical work? In July 2002, I traveled to Andersonville spending two days walking the stockade grounds and those of the national cemetery. This book served as my guide."},{"Title":"Andersonville: The Last Depot (Civil War America)","review":"This book was recommended to me by a civil war scholar with the warning that a lot of what was written about Andersonville is not true, but this book tries to be. I found that the book is an effort to be scholarly and to portray this part of history in a truthful light.It is easy to read a book like this from our perspective as 21st century Americans and harshly judge how people acted in the 19th century. By any measure conditions at Andersonville were harsh and primative. However it was a brutal time and a wrenchingly difficult time for all Americans. So it is a more difficult thing to understand what happended without judging it. That is where this book excels. I would recommend it to any serious student of American history."},{"Title":"Andersonville: The Last Depot (Civil War America)","review":"In this piece of revisionist history the author seems determined to exonerate Henry Wirz as largely a victim of circumstances. I do not think that this book is biased in favor of the Confederacy, only biased in favor of disproving the traditional view of Andersonville. To me, the bottom line on Andersonville is that, despite an abundance of trees in the vicinity, the prisoners were provided no shelter nor were permitted to build their own. Perhaps the accounts of Wirz's cruelty were exagerated, but he was in charge of the camp, and, at a minimum, was criminally negligent. As the author states, almost 13,000 men, a third of those interned at Andersonville, died there. This was more than twice the average death rate at other prison camps, North and South. Wirz was responsible for the welfare of these men, and I found the author's excuses for his failure unconvincing.This &quot;comprehensive&quot; account is only 249 pages long, with only four pages devoted to Wirz's trial, the issue of most interest to contemporary readers. Marvel never mentions all of the members of the military tribunal or the substantial body of official correspondence, from Confederate government sources, critical of conditions at and the administration of Andersonville, that was submitted as evidence during the trial.For a far more believable account of Wirz's trial, I suggest you read the article on the Wirz trial written by John H. Stibbs, a member of the military tribunal that tried Wirz. You can find it in &quot;A Perfect Picture of Hell&quot; by Ted Genoways &amp; Hugh H. Genoways. If Stibbs' account is inaccurate, I would like to understand in what way that is the case. By the way, Stibbs is never mentioned in Marvel's book."},{"Title":"Andersonville: The Last Depot (Civil War America)","review":"The last depot depicts the pathetic and political aspects of this prison that I consider more of a battle than Antietam. The suffering was unbelievable. Marvel uses Eugene Forbes as one of as his obscure sources. He uses many more but he makes it clear that Wirz the head of the prison was not the problem but the dissolving Confederacy that was built on shifting sand. Without bias this book shows the horror of being a POW."},{"Title":"Andersonville: The Last Depot (Civil War America)","review":"During the Civil War, Union prisoners were sent to a number of prisons, including Andersonville. The number of prisoners climbed exponentially and over 13,000 prisoners died. From lack of space, hygiene, medical facilities and food rations it was easier to die than survive. This book provides a fairly balanced account of the prison. It does not gloss over the horrid facts, but it is also quick to point out that Union prisons employed many of the same methods and practices that Andersonville employed. The book provided numerous first-hand stories and accounts, which were fascinating. This book was not dry or boring, but rather very well paced. It kept my attention throughout and provided unique historical details. Overall, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Andersonville: The Last Depot (Civil War America)","review":"This is an excellent compact account on life in Andersonville as well as an excellent description on how Andersonville became a prison that became so large it was the 5th largest 'City' in the south at its peak. Marvel explains that Andersonville came about due to the ever closer raids near Richmond including Grant's approach requiring prisons outside of Richmond. As Marvel notes well the increase in a total war effort by Grant increased the federal capture rate and due to the termination of prisoner exchange, the south had the ever burdening increase of prisoners they could not shelter and barely feed. The history told through numerous diaries with the ability to create biographies on the captured with descriptive detail of their life in the prison. Marvel even can tell the reader where the captured served and how whey came to be captured. The over taxing of the prison includes a total lack of shelter, lack of clothing, inadequate health care , horrible sanitation and at times a brutal organized gang of thieves that made the prison something barely less than hell. The fact that so many died from scurvy, malnutrition, intestinal gangrene, gangrene from virtually minor sores due to poor sanitation is heart rendering and reminds one of a concentration camp, albeit not intentionally. Captain Wirtz who commanded the prisoners was undermined, as Marvel explains by a complex command structure with layers that constrain Wirtz's efforts to improver the prison or command the soldiers delegated to provide security. Wirtz becomes as sickly as the prisoners and as Marvel explains, unfairly bares the price of commanding a prison that is minimally supplied with food, structural resources or hospital staff. Amazingly, Wirtz mans his post to the bitter end, even after numerous transfers of prisoners as the war fractures towards its end and he is the only officer of substance left after others with command status died (Winder) or moved to different commands. The grotesqueness of the prison and large death rate among the prisoners require a responsible party, and Wirtz is all there is.I did wish that Marvel provided more detail on Wirtz's trial with his forced upon defense limitations, and I wish he included reasons why the severely ill were not exchanged or at least returned to their lines. It is quite heart rendering to read how many soldiers perished due to food shortages, horrible sanitation, over crowding and lack of shelter. The stoppage of the prisoner exchange along with the south's disregard to exchange black soldiers contributed to Andersonville's plight but it seems more should have been done on both sides for humanitarian reasons. A must read for students of the Civil War since it directs attention to what can happen, and happened, to the plight of captured prisoners once the battles are over."},{"Title":"Andersonville: The Last Depot (Civil War America)","review":"THIS BOOK IS A MUST NOT ONLY FOR CIVIL WAR BUFFS, BUT FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO MIGHT THINK THAT THERE WERE WINNERS AND LOSERS.THE COUNTRY LOST,AND IN PARTICULAR, HUMANITY LOST.THE DETAIL WAS AMAZING,NECESSARILY GRAPHIC,BRUTAL AND PROVIDED A SOMBER MESSAGE.READ THE BOOK TO SEE WHAT THE MESSAGE IS.AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASE"},{"Title":"Andersonville: The Last Depot (Civil War America)","review":"If you can read only one history of Andersonville, this should be the one.

While there are morsels of fishing knowledge to be learned from the book, it is more an autobiography of a man who has devoted his life to something he loves. You will be treated to Rudy Grigar's opinions of almost everything, and whether you agree with them or not, you will come away from the book wishing you could meet Mr. Grigar. Written in a plain style, you quickly develop the feeling that with the author, what you see is what you get. I'm sure he is the kind of person I would enjoy spending the day on the bay with, and I'm glad he took the time to share his life with his readers."},{"Title":"Plugger: Wade Fishing the Gulf Coast","review":"&quot;Plugger&quot; was written by a fisherman for fishermen.

Rudy has retired from guiding so reading &quot;Plugger&quot; is as close as you will ever come to fishing with the legend."},{"Title":"Plugger: Wade Fishing the Gulf Coast","review":"Agree with the other reviews that this is not a &quot;how to&quot; book, it's primarily a biography.

I have been using this book since the first edtion was published. The book was suggested reading by an amish man that was introduced to me at a country auction. I told the gentleman that my doctor's had tried everything over 4 plus years to lower my blood LDL cholesterol levels, lower my blood total cholesterol levels, and to raise my good blood cholesterol levels in the way of diet, exercise, and prescriptions. We are restricted in exercising by injuries received from an automobile accident. My cholesterol levels went from 600 to 210 in just under 3 months per my medical doctor, after using only 800 mcg of a mineral that this book suggested to take for high cholesterol. My medical doctor was shocked at the results of only just under 3 months of using this mineral had lowered my blood LDL cholesterol levels, lowered my blood total cholesterol levels, and raised my good blood cholesterol levels from 0 to within normal levels. We told my medical doctor that I wanted to stopping all prescriptions for cholesterol for 2 weeks before I started the 800 mcg daily doseage of the mineral suggesteed by the book. We found out later the amish gentleman was a self taught medical doctor. He is limited by state law to only doctor within their faith in the amish community.

I like how it is laid out and for each issue (in Part Two of the book) the author separates some supplements you may want to take into groups in order of their importance/effectiveness. There is also a lot of information in the first part of the book.Because this is such a comprehensive book, I don't think the author is able to be a specialist in each of the areas discussed, which can cause a problem. In specific, I was looking at the lupus section and the author recommends taking alfalfa herbs. Alfalfa is a big no-no for lupus patients in all forms (this is addressed in a wonderful book written specifically about lupus called \\"The Lupus Book - 4th Edition by Daniel Wallace). Under \\"recommendations\\", the author does recommend avoid eating alfalfa sprouts, but still recommends it as an herb.
