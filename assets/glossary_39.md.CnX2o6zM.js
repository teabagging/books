Aronnax, Consiel, and Ned Land partake in were vividly portrayed in the book. Also the Nautilus was really amazing, in two ways. First in how powerful the ship was, and second how Verne could have created the idea for such a vessel for the period of time he wrote the book.From the underwater forests of Crespo, to the Manaar Bank, then to Atlantis and the South Pole, the book made it feel as if I was traveling along with them. In addition to the locales, the Nautilus itself was amazing, with it's speed, strength and technology. On top of that, there was also, the walks on the bottom of the ocean which were described with amazing detail.Capitan Nemo was the most complex character I've read about in a long time. Throughout their time on the ship, Aronnax, Consiel, and Land never see much of Nemo, and when they do, he's not a man of many words. He is, however a man of great intelligence, skill, and wealth, who decided to sevre all ties with civilization, for reasons that appear unknown to us.Professor Aronnax began thinking some monsterous narwhal type beast is destroying ships in the ocean at the beginning of the story, so himself, Consiel, and Ned Land set out to discover what it really is, and find themselves amidst something completely different.This book was a treat to read with all it's adverture and exploring. It's story was crisp and fresh. Along with a ending that I feel fit justly. If you haven't already, I suggest you give this book a read"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"When I was a child I loved reading the stories of Julio Verne. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Journey to the Centre of the Earth and Around the World in 80 Days were my favorites. This new translation based on the original French texts is amazing, it moves quickly and I discovered things that I had never read in other English versions. You get more of Verne's politics here than in earlier translations including such memeorable phrases as: \\"The world needs no new continents, it needs new people.\\"The characters are well developed and you can indentify with all of them and how they view their effective captivity aboard the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is a wonderful character and Verne gives the reader just enough information about him to keep you enthralled but not enough to remove the mystery. The intro relates that Nemo was supposed to be a Polish aristocrat, getting back at the world for the the atrocities the Russians had commited against his family. But when Hetzel his publisher balked at the idea because of the new Franco Russian alliance Verne decided to remove any trace of nationality.What else can be said? The English is not archaic!! This restored and annotated version, is a VAST improvement over previous English editions. The translation is very well done, and the annotations explain what has been changed and what previous translations accomplished.

After a while floating in the sea, M. Aronnax and Conseil found a submarine. M. Aronnax had no energy left in him to climb on and neither did Conseil. Just then, someone grabbed M.

It was an amazing trip through the globe I have taken in several day. But the book has an ending that's leaving too many questions unanswered, which I would rather it have given me much more explainations. And the book seems to be too plain, old, because it was written such a long time ago, and the author had no intention of making the lines exciting in a way we accept today, and which is also a result of too many unrelated stories been piled together without a common base, basically, the book has pretty much no plot. That's a reason you might consider not buying the book.But I liked the book a lot, I can not understand how can the author write one story after another that just get more and more surprising, and the way he brings out each story.

But, of all his novels, the most wondrous, the most well known, the most popular and the best is 20,000 Leagues under the Sea.The book's plot is pretty well known to the literature world: Captain Nemo has built an underwater ship called the Nautilus. Three people land on the ship and are taken aboard: French Professor M. Aronnax, a famous French scientist, Conseil, his servant and Ned Land, a Canadian Harpooner. Some of the highlights of their incredible adventure include getting trapped under ice in the South Pole, battling giant squid, exploring lost shipwrecks as well as the lost city of Atlantis and encountering the undersea forests of Crespo.What is most amazing is that Verne's predicted how subs would work years later. Also, the U.S.S Nautilus went under the South Pole almost a century after Verne's Nautilus. The book is however not problem proof. It takes a while to develop. The Nautilus is originally mistaken for a sea monster. So a few are spent looking for this \\"Sea Monster\\". But this is forgivable. For can you name one great book that doesn't spend time developing its plot?"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, (The Windermere series)","review":"This book is a great joy to read. It's a wonderful exercise in imagination and visualizing everything inside my head. So many things in popular culture today have been influenced by what's in this book. Before I ever read this book, I was was primarily familiar with it because of the part with the giant squid. So imagine my surprise to find out that that part of the book was just a few pages long! But that's perfectly OK, because the rest of the book has plenty of things going for it. Jules Verne had a very good imagination. His depiction of the submarine turned out to be quite accurate with regards to what actually was turned into reality during the 20th century.

A Nest of Corsairs: The Fighting Karamanlis of the Barbary Coast takes the reader into the Karamanli family's reign of Tripoli with special emphasis on the British Consulate's position and influence on the royal court. The power and direction of the Sultanate in Constantinople had much impact on how the Tripoli court was run, but the Karamanli family did things their own way (bowing to the Sultan only when funds and armies were needed). One of the most captivating moments in the story is when one brother assassinates another during a meeting with their mother in her hareem. Few detective novels or murder mysteries engross the reader like this book, partly because it is written from obviously deep-set interest in Tripoli's history and after what would seem to have been exhaustive research. Hats off to Seton, the Dearden family strikes again! (I also recommend reading some from Seton's uncle, Harold Dearden). Seton's second wife, Ann Dearden, wrote about her knowledge of Jordan in a book titled Jordan (oddly enough) from her experiences and studies in that country through her many years living there. A Nest of Corsairs heads the Dearden family published list through its descriptions of everyday life in the court and on the streets of Tripoli back when ships were made of wood and men were made of steel. Well done Seton!"},{"Title":"Complete Fairy Tales","review":"I loved it!! I think it's great the way it's written.

As the head photographer at Universal Studios during this important time in American history, Ray Jones was instrumental in creating and defining this &quot;Glamour Era&quot; of Hollywood. The book goes into some detail about how Jones created his special look, but the true joy here is thumbing through the numerous examples of Jones' exceptional talent. The photos span the three decades of Jones' carrer in Hollywood (from the 30's to the 50's) and the featured stars read like a Who's Who of Hollywood. Also featured are Jones' six Acadamy Award-winning photos (the award has since been discontinued) including a memorable one of John Wayne.

He was not (in this book)like the nice sweet person portrayed in Lord of raven's peak. This story is from Cleve and his future wife chessa's perspectives. But what is it with Coulter and giving these slaves royal or special lineage. In raven's peak Laren had royal lineage and was betrayed by her sisters. Now in this story cleve also has interesting heratige. She was running on empty when this was written. I liked the first 2, but it should have been just the 2. This book was not neccesery, and is not fun to read like the previous novels."},{"Title":"Lord of Falcon Ridge (Bookclub Ed)","review":"If you're reading romance novels, one has to adknowledge you're not reading epic literature.I loved the whole Viking trilogy.Catherine Coulter writes engaging characters with fleshed out supporting cast, and I always feel like they're a step above the rest.The romance between Cleve and Chessa is sweet, and it feels like it develops genuinely. It's not the throwing chairs at each other they cant stand each other, and somehow they end up in bed together and married sort of romance. Cleve struggles with his betrayal by Sarla and with his duty of transporting Chessa to her betrothed. His inner struggle feels genuine, because it's not overdone. He doesnt accuse Chessa of being a liar because she is a woman, he just holds himself adistance, struggling to seperate what he sees from what he wants to turn it into. Chessa only sees him as the honest, upright sort, and most importantly, beautiful. She's intelligent and the most important part of understanding Cleve and Chessa's romance is delving into everything that isnt said. The characters from the previous two viking novels are still fleshed out and Laren still tells her stories.This is my favorite of the Viking trilogy. Catherine Coulter shouldnt be the first author that you turn to if you're just looking for bawdry sex scenes or romance that borders on escapism. Her characters have depth and substance, and there's always a bit of a mystery to keep you guessing.Next to The Nightingale Legacy, this is up there on my list of favorites."},{"Title":"Lord of Falcon Ridge (Bookclub Ed)","review":"I like it.

I also like the way most romance novel women are stubborn and fiery etc etc. It amuses me. However, each time I finish a romance novel I am disgusted with the ending. I cannot believe that any woman would fall in love with a man that had raped her or what not. I cannot and do not like the concept that the man must &quot;tame&quot; the heroine by the end. They can be amusing to read, but always disappoint.The Lord of Falcon Ridge is the very first romance novel I have read in which I could swallow the ending (yay! it wasn't ruined!) I liked the way Cleve (Viking lord) wasn't out to dominate Chessa (Irish princess). I mean, they had their struggles, but Chessa was never treated badly by Cleve. This is what I like- Chessa is not seduced by him despite her resolution to hate the guy, she choses him and that's that.The Viking setting is cool with adequate amounts of scheming and fighting, but for those of you who read romances for the sex, stick with Elizabeth Lowell (yuck)! For those of you who read romances for the action, I would reccommend this book. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Lord of Falcon Ridge (Bookclub Ed)","review":"I have read several Catherine Coulter books and I am afraid to say they keep getting worse ! I really enjoyed her writing at first; kept looking for all of her stories. But after reading so many, I find the major difference between each of her characters, especially the men, is their names. There are a few unique traits perhaps with each of them, however, they are so closely related they have become easily predictable. Most of the men have been in the same situation, say the exact same things, treat the women identically in every story, to which the women respond identically in each...etc. This one in particular was the very worst, at some points, I actually laughed at the silliness of the characters. I really couldn't believe how ridiculous some of the dialogue was.I thought I would finish the novel despite my disappointment but I just can't. I could go on but there's really no point. Ms. Coulter is a fine writer, I just wish she would write a different story...maybe put some real effort into it."},{"Title":"Lord of Falcon Ridge (Bookclub Ed)","review":"I enjoyed having all the characters from the first two books included in this one, however, there seemed to be three separate stories with many slow areas. Typos were numerous as well as contradictions, such as; pg. 153 &quot;It was so unexpected, the concubine screamed&quot; - pg. 162 &quot;Weren't the two young girls last night quite lovely? They're mute, born that way . . .&quot; Lastly, this novel was very believable until Lord Varrick with his magic stick entered. At that point it was as if Ms. Coulter ran out of things to write about and didn't know how to get out of the story. I have read and enjoyed many Catherine Coulter novels prior to this and will continue to do so."},{"Title":"Lord of Falcon Ridge (Bookclub Ed)","review":"I am still trying to figure out this book. I actually wondered if the writer was a bit senile. Chessa, the heroine, reacts oddly to many situations, more like a confused child. The overall book gave me a confused, eerie feeling, and the plot could barely hold water. I can't compare this to her other books, since this one put me off the author permanently, but this book was so terrible I had to review it and find out if anyone else was thinking, \\"What?\\""},{"Title":"Lord of Falcon Ridge (Bookclub Ed)","review":"I finished the tri even though the 1st book was terrible and the 2nd was very good and now the third seemed to be thrown in to complete the set. It was an ok read, but I came away not really caring about how it ended. The characters and the setting never really worked well together and the the back and forth story between certain characters became a bore. Glad I am done with the set. I do not think Ms. Coulters books are ones that I will go in search for in the future."},{"Title":"Lord of Falcon Ridge (Bookclub Ed)","review":"There are 4 books to the viking series. And I purposely saved this to read last because I thought I would like this one the LEAST. Was I ever wrong!!! It turns out to be the second best right behind Season of the Sun.I laugh like crazy during the parts when Chessa wanted Cleve to look good in front of the guys so she made up that Cleve made love to her 5 times during the night and that his size was beyond anything she's seen. This become the envy of the boys because they didn't think it was possible.I thought this story was cute. The heroine really liked Cleve and admired his ability and wanted him regardless of what other said. There were no abuse here between the herione and hero which is refreshing.The one thing I didn't like about the story is that they never explained how Chessa had certain power and ability and were able to see things that Cleve's father were able to see."},{"Title":"Lord of Falcon Ridge (Bookclub Ed)","review":"This is definitely the worst of the Viking Trilogy! Coulter is one of the more prolific writers and also one of the most inconsistent. The best of the series was the first (Hawkfell), followed by the second (Raven's Peak). Ms Coulter should have stopped there.While Chessa was a spunky, likeable heroine, I have no clue what made her so mad so quickly about Cleve. I found him dull, dull, dull! His daughter was quite cute, but for the life of me, I couldn't see what Chessa saw in him.And the whole Loch Ness monster thing and the magic stick Cleve's father had - well it was just plain silly.I'm the sort who will read and re-read over and over books that I like. This will not be one of them."},{"Title":"Lord of Falcon Ridge (Bookclub Ed)","review":"Bravo Ms.Coulter. I must admit that at first I didn't want to read this book because of low ratings other readers had given and besides low ratings-----I didn't seem to accept a scarred hero) I gave it a try though and I found that I was a fool to dislike disfigured heros) This book is much better than I thought. The hero is Cleve of Malverne from 'Lord of Raven Peak' (2nd book in trilogy) he is now friend of Lord Merrik and a Viking warrior. The heroine is Princess Chessa (she is Eze, daughter of the wizard Hormuze from 'Lord of Hawkfell Island') Cleve has a scar on a side of his face but it does not reduce the beauty of his face in Chessa's eyes. Their adventure is exciting. The secondary characters do their job well. I highly recommend all the books in Viking Trilogy. They are all entertaining read."},{"Title":"Diving and Snorkeling Monterey Peninsula and Northern California (Lonely Planet Diving & Snorkeling Great Barrier Reef)","review":"I regularly dive the monterey area and I was looking for more information about the area, and the north coast.

For a tourist to the area wanting to get in a bit of diving, a great resource to supplement a local guide. For us locals, a nice addition to word-of-mouth, an end to playing &quot;guess the species,&quot; and a great resource when arguing about where to dive next time ."},{"Title":"Diving and Snorkeling Monterey Peninsula and Northern California (Lonely Planet Diving & Snorkeling Great Barrier Reef)","review":"I bought this book and the Diving and Snorkeling Guide to the Cayman Islands sight unseen. Ususaly Lonely Planet has great books but not this time. This is a dive guide, not a snorkeling guide. Putting Snorkeling into the title is a blatent attempt to sell more books.

Translated for an English readership by Bhikshuni Jendy Shih, and ably edited by Bhikshuni Thubten Chodron, Choosing Simplicity offers students of Buddhism guidelines for the conduct of daily life with a more mindful orientation. Residents within a Buddhist religious community will become clear about boundaries, motivations, and how their actions may be interpreted by others. Choosing Simplicity is an impressive and valued addition to any Buddhist studies reference collection or reading list."},{"Title":"Choosing Simplicity: A Commentary On The Bhikshuni Pratimoksha","review":"This book is a series of talks given at \\"Life as a Western Buddhist Nun\\" conference in Bodhgaya 1996. p. 15: \\"This volume explains the purpose of monastic ordination & the relationship of an individual nun to the monastic community of monks & of nuns, to lay Buddhists, & to society in general.\\" p. 16: \\"With increased inter-religious dialog, people realize that knowledge of others' traditions enriches their own spiritual practice\\" & p. 312: \\"Study, reflection, & mindfulness of the precepts are helpful for monastics & laypeople alike.\\" More specifically, p. 16: \\"Knowing the precepts can make us more mindful of our behavior.\\" This book is entertaining due to its many stories of the origins of the precepts as well as the author's convincing presentations on their whys & wherefores. Per p. 17: \\"Although the social environment has changed since the Buddha's time, basic human nature has not\\" & p. 305: \\"The Buddha's advice is not rigid dogma, but has various meanings & methods of implementation according to the person & the circumstances.\\" Ven. Wu Yin provides numerous examples relating directly to the precepts, reminiscent of Knowledge Management's dictum that knowledge = information in context. Indeed, she categorizes & summarizes the precepts, converting the data into information that can be readily assimilated. Further, she identifies precepts whose wording may be confusing--p. 292: \\"In this precept & the precept prohibiting Bhikshunis from eating garlic, the linguistic formulation of the precept does not express its meaning directly\\" & those that have been adapted to social contexts (pp. 172-9: living alone; swimming, sleeveless shirts, robe colors, etc.). The historical context pp. 190, 284, & 291 demonstrates that precepts respond to the law of the land. While only one difference between Theravada & Mahayana is given (p. 294: \\"learner in prajika\\" is Mahayana Only), the book is not meant to be all inclusive. She does demonstrate how advanced the Buddha's thinking was (e.g. pp. 308-10: disputes/conflict resolution-even including arbitration). While there are precepts that differ for men & women (e.g. p. 144: Bhikshus can be ordained 7 times, but Bhikshunis only once), the Buddha advanced gender equality overall, saying p. 312 of the 1st Bhikshuni upon her death: \\"This Bhikshuni has fulfilled the meaning of being a great human being.\\" As Ven. Wu Yin ably points out, \\"Being a great human being is not related to gender; it depends on caring about the well-being of all our fellow sentient beings.\\""},{"Title":"Architectural Acoustics","review":"Since first encountering Egan's text a little more than 20 years ago, I've continued to return to it for solid information.

Unable to find a publisher interested in Soldados, he published it himself. I have used the book in my university classes on the literature of the war; it is a powerful and important collection. Trujillo's novel, Dogs from Illusion, is another book that should be read in classes on the war. Soldados stands as a precursor to Lea Ybarra's forthcoming oral history of Chicano veterans (Too Many Heroes, University of Texas Press). Orale, Charley, y mil gracias carnal."},{"Title":"Soldados: Chicanos in Viet Nam","review":"The narrative on this book was excellent. Trujillo gives a interesting view of how the Latino/Chicano community conducted themselves during times of savedry. Its bluntness of battle against an enemy that was covert and deadly. This book makes you visualize the rawness of pure inhumanity. Trujillo, in this book, brings to light the fine line between sanity and insanity."},{"Title":"Soldados: Chicanos in Viet Nam","review":"This book is very much a modern day &quot;Los De Abajo.&quot; Los De Abajo was the first book written about the Mexican Revolution, using the language of those who fought in the battles. In Soldados, Charley Trujillo also captures the language and feel of the Chicano soldier who survived Vietnam. From truck drivers to infantrymen, these voices tell stories that only Vietnam veterans can tell. Trujillo made a valiant attempt to let the sounds of the voices flow in their natural state, and he edited little, so the words sound as if they come from one who stands on a street corner, talking to whomever will listen.

An awesome book for students to read for a school report project.Very easy reading because Charley Trujillo tells it like it was using words from his own lips, experience and heart.This book HANDS DOWN should be made into a movie to draw in the Mexican community in order for the younger Chicano population to gain respect for ours and THEIR people who have put their lives on the line fighting together as one race through incredible fear and teamwork!"},{"Title":"Soldados: Chicanos in Viet Nam","review":"I grew up in Corcoran.

I came across 'Beyond This Place' by chance, it was a very old edition (40'). Reading this book was a refreshing experience. It has all the ingredients of an up to date bestseller: crooked law system, innocent man in prison, a one man fight against the establishment, unfulfilled love etc. I couldn't leave the book off until finished. I wish it would be reprinted as well as dramatized for Television.

Indeed it was quite a captivating novel. A tad bit 'weak' at the outset, but as the story moved along, the plot thickened - and it evolved into a real page-turner.A young man learns the story behind his father whom he was told had died long ago. Through his own investigations, the son finds that his father was wrongly convicted of a brutal murder 16 years earlier due to a miscarriage of justice, and was sentenced to life in prison. The son learns the father is still in prison and has already served 15 years of his life sentence. After learning the facts, the son strives to clear his father's name. He eventually exposes a cover up by the police and the political system, which sought to frame his father for the horrible crime. I won't spoil the ending for you, but suffice it to say it was relatively a satisfying one.I must admit there were some occurrences in the novel which seemed a bit dubious, however, nothing overtly outlandish took place that drew attention away from the story line. I would've liked a bit more characterization of some of the secondary characters - you don't learn too much about the way their minds work. You're also left wondering about the fate of some of the characters. For example, the boy's mother - who received almost ALL the focus at the outset, seemed to 'disappear' near the ending of the book.However, I must say, overall it was well written in my opinion.

I have read several of Cronin's other books and knew of the quality of his writing. I would rank this book, although relatively unheralded, right up there with the best of Cronin's writing. It is essentially a mystery novel, with many plot twists, and it is hard to put down. It also contains some great descriptions of city life in England during the 1930's and some very interesting and well drawn characters. It also reminds us of some important lessons along the way, including love, fortitude, forgiveness, the importance of freedom of speech and the rights to all of a fair trial.

Tuchman is not only a fine historian, but the kind of writer who makes history read like a political thriller. And the period before the US entry into WWI was certainly a thriller. With Europe hanging in the balance, the Germans offered Mexico an alliance. If they'd attack the US in the event of war, Germany would help her with the reconquista of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona--the dream that has never died. The Germans in their arrogance never suspected that the British had broken their codes--and amazingly didn't suspect it in WWII either! The political, military and diplomatic maneuvering between Germany, Britain, the US, Mexico and, yes, Japan made for a fascinating period. Tuchman gives the key details.

The author is Barbara Tuchman so these book is about the Zimerman telegram but it is also much more and, as usual, the prose is superb and Tuchman's insights are dead on."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"Zimmermann telegram explores circumstances that led to America's entry into Great War in Europe.Firstly,authoress draws attention to two things. When hostilities started British ship Teleconia cut Imperial Germany's undersea cables.As a result Germans had to use wireless station in Nauen near Berlin for communicating with her overseas commands. So probabilities of intercepting Germany's confidential communications increased substantially.Further British Admiralty was extraordinarily lucky in laying their hands upon German navy's code book, thanks to Russian generosity. Code book was extracted from bosom of a dead signal man from the ship Magdeburg which sank.It helped British naval intelligence to quickly break into German navy's signal traffic.Circumstances which prompted German foreign minister Arthur Zimmermann seeking Mexican alliance against United States are familiar to all of us and need not be recalled here. However what was interesting were details surrounding German intrigue in Mexico. What appeared galling was Japan too was brought into the plot.Kaiser skulduggery looked amazing.German monarch while invoking threat posed by Japan[Yellow Peril] wooed latter whom he hoped to detach from the constellation of powers arrayed against Germany.What defies belief Japanese navy storming its way thousands of miles across Pacific Ocean to land troops along the Mexican coast!!! Japanese threat was grossly exaggerated.Authoress has described the workings of Room no.40 ,the nerve centre of British naval intelligence war.Here there are two things that need to be remembered. How London used intelligence without compromising its source.Then how it convinced Americans the message intercepted was genuine and not a plant designed to push latter into a war against Germany.What I find difficult to digest was Madame Tuchman's claim United States remained neutral to war in Europe.President Wilson's actions do not bear this out. He allowed British ships to dock at American ports while denying similar facility to Germans. President granted loans to Britain for buying war materials.Many neutral ships carried military equipment for allies.Wilson was uneven,partial,selective in the application of neutral laws , an opinion recorded by historian Charles C. Tansill in his book \`Backdoor to War which I share. President's actions served to fan the flames of conflict. It resembled pouring oil into the fire. I am also amazed by German boldness in abusing American hospitality by using State Department cable for exchanging hostile messagesThe above difference in opinion does not detract the value of this book. Prose is simply magnificent which grip readers' attention.This was Tuchman's first book. First published in the late 1950's and still in print which attests to its popularity.Highly recommended for history buffs."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"I like books like these because they take a single subject and explore it thoroughly while also putting the events into a larger context. Although in a shorter form, Tuchman delivers again."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"While the Zimmerman Telegram is one of the most important documents in history, and is perhaps the greatest result of code breaking in history, it is nonetheless frequently overlooked. Most people have at least heard \\"Remember the Lusitania\\" which had essentially nothing to do with the U.S. entering WWI. Few, however, are familiar with this short telegram that is truly a hinge on which history turned.One cannot blame Barbara Tuchman for this, however, as this work brings alive the intrigue of the time like no other. Reading like a spy novel, and yet all the more chilling because it's true, Tuchman navigates the reader through the murky waters of WWI intrigue. We learn how, in a misguided effort to distract the U.S. from Europe, Germany sought to foment trouble on the U.S./Mexican border. We learn how the British scrambled to inform the Americans of this, without comprimising their sources. And we learn how a tortured President Wilson was forced to take the steps towards war.\\"The Zimmerman Telegram\\" is history as it should be written; loaded with primary sources, and with the breathless pace that events really unfolded. While better known for \\"The Guns of August\\", it is this work that makes me rank Barabara Tuchman as one of the best historians of the 20th Century.Jake Mohlman"},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"This is one of my favorite Barbara Tuchman works.

In essence the Telegram was an attempt to make Mexico a German ally in the event of the US entering World War I on the Allied side, with the bait being the possibility of Mexico reclaiming the states of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. When British Intelligence intercepted and decoded the Telegram they made certain that the US government and public heard about it quickly in the hopes of bringing the US into the war.The book is more than just the story of the Telegram itself. It includes a run through of the various German espionage efforts in the US before and during World War I and a good description of the unease felt by the US at the mysterious German machinations, including possibly collusion with Japan and an attempt to take control of the Panama Canal.Like all of Tuchman's works, The Zimmermann Telegram is scholarly without being dull, and a real delight."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"The story that Barbara Tuchman tells in The Zimmermann Telegram is one of international diplomacy in the period just before World War One. Tuchman centers her story on the apex of a single article of communication (the telegram) and expands from there. The story begins in the North Sea just before the British declaration of war on Germany. The British cable ship Telconia dredges the sea searching for five cables at the bottom connecting Germany's communication with the of the European and North American continents. All five cables are cut. Furthermore, Britain coaxed Eastern Telegraph, the American owner of the only other cable to North America (running from North Africa to Brazil), to pull the cables that would allow German communication with the world. Germany was now bound to wireless communication for the duration of the war. This is significant because it allowed the British to secretly intercept all German communications, and begin to decode them in the British Naval Intelligence office referred to as &quot;Room 40&quot;. Inside Room 40, Britain learned to crack the German code. This is how the British, and consequently the Americans, were able to learn about the Zimmermann Telegram. The Telegram put the British in a precarious position. They desperately needed the United States to become a belligerent and enter the war against Germany if Britain hoped to win the war. At the same time if the British gave the Americans the Telegram and it was released, the Germans might deduce the existence of Room 40 and discover that their code had been unraveled, thereby compromising all British ability to &quot;listen in&quot; on the Germans for the rest of the war. Additionally, the Telegram was no guarantee that the United States would declare war against Germany or that the Americans would even believe the authenticity of the Telegram. It is the analysis of U.S., German, and British players and the revelation of how The Zimmermann Telegram was eventually delivered to the U.S. Government (without compromising Room 40, and at the same time successfully brought the U.S. into war against Germany) that Tuchman wrote about. Tuchman's style was objective in construction by use of factual evidence from many sources. She wrote the book fairly, comparing both the British and German sides. She illustrated that there were supporters on both sides in the United States. Through all of the descriptions she portrayed Woodrow Wilson as neutral until the end, and discussed the external forces on Wilson that tried to persuade him in all directions. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and former President Theodore Roosevelt supported the side of Britain and war; Robert LaFollette and other isolationist senators on the side of non-intervention. Tuchman centered all events on the final outcome-would the Americans be persuaded to believe the authenticity of the Zimmermann Telegram? Would they declare war on Germany because of it? Tuchman was persuasive in her argument that it was ultimately the Zimmermann Telegram that caused Wilson to ask Congress for belligerency. Her sources were mostly first-hand accounts taken from the journals and diaries of major participants in the events that surrounded the Zimmermann Telegram. Important to her research were notes supplied by British Admiral Hall's (Director of British Naval Intelligence) private secretary, as well as personal papers of Joseph Grew (U.S. Ambassador) and those papers of Ambassador Walter Hines Page. Further research by Tuchman was accredited to help from the Foreign Office Archives Office in London and the historical manuscripts of both President Wilson and Secretary of State Lansing. Because The Zimmermann Telegram was well researched and convincing in its points, Tuchman revealed to the reader a deeper level of understanding surrounding the events that led up to the American declaration of war against Germany. Tuchman shrugged off the commonly held elementary notions that it was the sinking of the Lusitania, or the declaration of German unrestricted submarine warfare that caused the U.S. to declare its belligerency. She argued that while these events were certainly considerations in the decision for war, they were not enough to cause the U.S. to break its policy of neutrality. She was successful in persuading the reader that it was the secret German proposal of a pact with Mexico and Japan that became the proverbial straw. Tuchman's thesis that the Zimmermann Telegram was the single most important reason that America declared war against Germany was a believable one. It clearly showed evidence for the German government's theory that a secret pact with Mexico and Japan would be her only chance of defeating The United States in a war. Tuchman pointed out that Germany made only two significant blunders that forced America into the war declaration. First, Germany's mistaken ignorance that German intelligence was so superior to that of the Allies that the Allies could have never cracked the German code. Secondly, Zimmermann's puzzling admission of the authenticity of the telegram when much of the American public and Congress believed it to be a British hoax (Britain could not reveal the authenticity without compromising Room 40). In conclusion, Tuchman gave an exciting dimension of suspense to the events surrounding America's entry into World War One by revealing first person accounts and minor personalities that played a role in the events leading to this crux. She made the valid argument that it was the Zimmermann Telegram that ultimately brought Wilson and the American Congress (and people) to this decision after a long period of neutrality toward Germany."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"Ms. Tuchman wrote &quot;The Guns of August&quot; which I believe is the best book ever written about WWI. Unfortunately, she also wrote the book, &quot;The Proud Tower&quot; about the times just before WWI. The Proud Tower was a bore. As such, I wasn't sure what to think before I bought this one. I was hopeful that it might be good and, I was right. The Zimmerman Telegraph is a very good book which, if you like history and mystery, you should enjoy. The Zimmerman Telegraph was especially interesting to me because, while I was in school, I had a professor who taught his belief that the Zimmerman Telegraph was a fraud. It was not. The Zimmerman telegaph was very real and with it the British may have changed the tides of history. .But first, what is the Zimmerman telegraph? Mr. Zimmerman was a German ambassador during WWI. As the war progressed, both sides looked for allies which would tip the scales in the war in Europe. Mr. Zimmerman, and his cohorts, were instructed to induce Mexico into fighting on the German side, if American declared for the allies.Because General Pershing, who was to lead the Amercian troops in Europe, had invaded Mexico during this time (to attack a bandit revolutionary Pancho Villa); Because America had taken about 1/3 of Mexico eighty years earlier; And because America's army was one of the smallest in the world - Mexico's entry into the war seem possible to German leaders 5000 miles away.Mr. Zimmerman, in secret code, wired back and forth to Germany to learn what he should do, and what he should offer. Worse, at times, the Germanys borrowed American supplies, while negotiating about declaring war on America. The British learned about these messages and wanted to share them with the Americans. But how could they do it, without arrising their suspicions and those of later American professors?The truth is an exciting mystery story filled with real people whom we love and hate, because Ms. Tuchman makes them so real. She has a talent, when applied, which makes the past - present. I could picture these events as they happened, understand the people, and even sympathize with the ones I didn't like before I read this book.The other thing Ms. Tuchman does so well is to explain motivations. In Europe, for example, there was disputed land between Germany and France. This land was take in 1870. In 1914, the shame of this action still was present throughout France. Indeed, in many units, it was a battlecry. Surely some Mexicans felt the same about California? Ms. Tuchman shows us why some people felt that a Germany-Mexican alliance was a good thing. And a thing which the Mexicans would want.There is much more that this book discusses. But, as referenced above, this book is mainly about how the British broke the German codes and how they &quot;leaked&quot; this information to the Americans. War is never fought for one reason. But the main reason America fought in WWI may have been this telegram - and the Germany-Mexican alliance it proposed. A masterful job by Ms. Tuchman."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"This book is history at its very best. Tuchman has brought to life an amazing story of espionage and deceit that reads like an Ian Fleming novel. Her fluid writing style keeps you turning the pages. Although the outcome is known, the reader still finds themselves asking what will happen.The book covers Germany's pre-war intrigues in Mexico, and then once the war starts, follows the agents sent to America to keep us out of the war. She discusses how German spies plotted to take over munitions factories and stop the flow of war goods to the Allies...and how they nearly succeeded. The story also discusses how Wilson was tormented by the decision to bring America into the war, and how he really did wish peace for the world. Yet, when confronted with the Zimmerman Telegram, which offered Mexico the reacquisition of Texas, Arizona and New Mexico, Wilson was left with no choice but war.It is incredible at how a blunder by one German official was able to bring the world's most powerful nation into the fold against them. Yet that stays with the theme of WW I, and the Zimmerman Telegram may have been the biggest blunder of the war. Thanks to Barbara Tuchman, we know how it all came to pass."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"The story of the Zimmermann Telegram is a gem of history that literally is a ripping good yarn.The nutshell: In the middle of WWI, German foreign minister Zimmermann -- worried about how to keep America occupied on our side of the Atlantic and out of the Allied camp -- sent a telegram instructing his Mexican envoy to propose an alliance between Mexico, Japan and Germany. The payoff for our southern neighbor: the restoration of Texas, Arizona and New Mexico to the country of Mexico.This very fine book is many facets tightly woven in 200 pages: British code breakers. German diplomatic efforts. President Wilson's unshakable will for neutrality. Mexican and Japanese intrigue. Submarine warfare. Mexican revolution and America's chase for Pancho Villa.The story has drama (the fight to persuade Wilson that US interests lay with the Allies and not in being a neutral broker of peace), excitement (British code breaking efforts and the intrigue to get the telegram published / into American hands), and near comedy (German bungling with codes, diplomatic missions and high strategy)written by the masterful Barbara Tuchman.The author takes all these elements -- which are almost Shakespearean in their complexity and interplay -- and crafts a terrifically exciting history. A very fine read."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"History wasn't supposed to be this readable in 1958, but when Barbara Tuchman published \\"The Zimmermann Telegram\\" it was not only an advancement of scholarship about the roots of World War I but a terrific example of how real life could work better than fiction when in the right hands.The book covers what is still often wrongly described as a minor episode. As Tuchman explains, this served as the World War I equivalent of Pearl Harbor, an overture by Imperial Germany intercepted by England inviting Mexico to join the Axis and attack the United States as a means of keeping U.S. troops from refreshing the Allied cause in Europe. When a copy of the telegram was delivered to President Woodrow Wilson, it shook him from his studied neutrality and brought about the American entry into the war, essentially turning a European struggle into a global one.I once worked with a guy at a newspaper who told me Tuchman couldn't be trusted because she was anti-German. Frankly, it's hard to write a fair history of either World War that doesn't come down hard on Germany in some way, though Tuchman pulls no punches. According to her book, not only did Zimmermann (the German foreign minister whose appointment was ironically welcomed by Washington because he was seen as a liberal) offer Mexico three of its former territories, New Mexico, Texas, and Arizona, in exchange for a sudden attack on the United States, he didn't even wait for the United States to declare war on Germany first in response to the unrestricted submarine offensive Germany planned to launch. Then, when the press got hold of the telegram, Zimmermann didn't deny it was his because he still held out hope the Mexicans might launch an offensive across the Rio Grande.Well, of course, I can hear that guy back in my old office saying, we were giving England and France the supplies with which to fight Germany. Why shouldn't Germany do what it could to stop that? However in keeping with the nation that coined the term \\"realpolitik,\\" it amounted to a fatal miscalculation, marked by the German hubris of sending its fatal telegram on a special line the U.S. let them use for the purpose of helping negotiate a European peace. Like the Japanese ambassadors a war later, the Germans kept up the pretence of peace talks while planning their sucker punch, though the Japanese stopped short of actually using the diplomacy itself to sow the seed for U.S. destruction.Tuchman's thesis in short puts a different construct on the popular historic view of World War I as a war we didn't need to get involved in. Yet she isn't a conservative, instead taking all parties to task in a critical, engaging way many historians to come would emulate with far less success. About Wilson, she writes: \\"He held political office and would not acknowledge that politics is the art of the possible. He obeyed the injunction that a man's reach should exceed his grasp; it was his tragedy that he reached too high.\\"Tuchman on the other hand reaches just high enough, giving you all the period detail and flavor of the time in a lean 200-page package that will likely leave you curious to read her later masterpiece on World War I's origins, \\"The Guns Of August.\\""},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"From the techniques involved in decoding and deciphering German diplomatic messages (in layman's terms) to the sacrifices and lives spent acquiring the knowledge of Room 40 (i.e. code books) to the tenacious efforts of Germany to spark U.S involvement in Mexico as well as against the Japanese(!), Tuchman provides a thorough account on the Zimmermann Telegram and its crucial role in pulling a reluctant American nation into the First World War. As a History grad student, I never knew about Germany's aims regarding Japan (&quot;the Yellow Peril&quot;) during this period until I read this book. In addition, Tuchman's excellent and often witty writing style makes Zimmermann Telegram (and her many other works) gripping and entertaining, as well as informative."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"In forceful, confident prose Ms. Tuchman describes an incident in U.S. history which, if not forgotten, is probably not sufficiently appreciated for its current relevance. President Wilson labored hard to avoid U.S. entry into the Great War; his aim, even on the eve of U.S. involvement, was to win the peace by making himself available to both sides as the honest broker. His efforts to remain neutral had its critics, notably Theodore Roosevelt, but by and large his position mirrored that of the public at large. One critical factor that helped move Wilson from neutrality to belligerence was the uncovering, by British intelligence, of the Zimmerman telegram. That telegram revealed Germany's attempts to forge an alliance with Mexico and thus distract the U.S. from the European theatre. In return, and upon a \\"certain\\" German victory, Mexico was promised the restoration of its former holdings -- Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California. While the telegram was a factor in Wilson's volte face, it was by far the most important factor in the creation of a popular, pre-war sentiment in the U.S. electorate.Why relevant? Wilson's decision to enter the war was delayed until that point in time when empirical data compelled him to abandon neutrality. In contrast, President Bush invaded Iraq on the presumption, based on intelligence, that WMD would be uncovered. Was Wilson right? Perhaps not. He may well have waited too long. Was Bush wrong? Perhaps not, given the behavior of Saddam Hussein with respect to inspections prior to the war. The Zimmerman telegram is not a \\"morality tale,\\" but it constitutes a fascinating case study on the interplay between data and decision-making at the highest levels of government."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"I've first learned of the Zimmermann Telegram from \\"The Code Book\\" by Simon Singh (highly recommended itself), and looked for more information on the story; Barbara Tuchman's \\"The Zimmerman Telegram\\" filled in the details splendidly. The buildup is suspenseful, the characters are colorfully drawn, and the settings are well detailed. Tuchman skillfully puts the reader in the minds of those involved, allowing you to understand their mindset and identify with their emotions. This is indeed much closer to a mystery novel than to a regular history book, and it is a better read for it.There are a few small things I felt that marred full enjoyment. These are minor issues indeed, but worth noting. The first is that while most of the book reads as a Novel, as I've mentioned above, in a few occasions it feels as though you can feel Tuchman's voice herself giving her personal opinion (as an historian) on characters in the story. This is not a problem in and of itself, but it doesn't fit with the general mood of the book, so it seems out of place. Another point is that a few important issues were not sufficiently detailed (at least in my view): For instance, the agreement between the US and Germany about the surfacing of submarines is only hinted at, but it itself is never mentioned, which seems important, because the book skips between the conditions that existed before and after the agreement, and this can cause confusion at times. Or, as another example, one of the biggest questions (again, to me) that is hardly touched is why Zimmerman confirmed he sent the telegram after it was made public - surely this was the action that made war impossible to avoid.All in all, however, these small issues do not diminish the book in any great manner, and it still remains a superb account of one of the most pivotal, yet little known events of the 20th century. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"History at its outlandish best. Found the book bizarrely funny in a dark, human comedy kind of way. The thread of time tangled in the incompetent hands of bungling politicians and pathogenic war lords -- God must be a satirist to spin such stories."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"A couple of customer reviews opine that this is not Tuchman's best book. I disagree; I think it her best. It is also the most absorbing treatment of the subject for the general reader.I agree with another reader who finds an anti-German prejudice; but I interpret that prejudice, if it can be called that, as really against German militarism, which gave us two world wars. I do not understand it as against all things German.One reader thought that the story shows how nonfiction can be stranger, at least more interesting, than fiction. I agree; yes, the book does show this extremely well."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"\\"The Zimmerman Telegram\\" (1958) is another excellently written history by the author of the Pulitzer Prize winning \\"The Guns Of August\\" (1962). Writing with the same style and skill, Tuchman provides an important look at the crucial events that dragged the United States, kicking and screaming, into the First World War, even against the strong pacifism of the majority of Americans and the anti-war convictions of her president, Woodrow Wilson. \\"The Zimmerman Telegram\\" captures the flavor and atmosphere of a world facing its own worst fears. While many historians attempt to present the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915 as the precipitate cause of U.S. entry, Tuchman correctly shows that only a specific and direct threat against the U.S. \\"forcing the nation to believe that Germany had hostile intentions toward America\\" would have turned the nation from anti- to pro-war. That threat came in the form of a telegram from Arthur Zimmerman, the German Foreign Secretary, sent to the German ambassador in Mexico suggesting a conspiracy to provoke an attack by Mexico on the United States, with the help of Japan. The goal was to involve the U.S. in a local war and prevent them from becoming involved in the European conflict. The \\"bait\\" for Mexico was the recovery of Texas and parts of New Mexico and Arizona taken by the United States in 1848. In her own inimitable style, Tuchman provides a strong understanding of the deep levels of conspiracy that had been going on in American-Mexican relations for years prior to the start of the war in 1914 and which continued even after U.S. entry into the war. She also shows the difficulties involved in revealing knowledge of the threat without jeopardizing cryptographer's ability to continue intercepting and decoding German secret messages. If read together, \\"The Guns of August\\" and \\"The Zimmerman Telegram\\" present a strong foundation for understanding history during the first half of the 20th Century. I highly recommend this short, but compelling work as supplemental reading for any student of United States history."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"I read books on war and how they are started with revulsed fascination. The bait is that there might be a key in each story to keep us out of a new war at some point.

This book casts a whole new light on the early years of World War I, with fighting and geopolitics. The U.S. was remarkably detached from the reality of what was going on, and it was WWI that created the U.S. as a global power.Ms. Tuchman does a brilliant job of making history come alive, loading the book with historical details and keeping it remarkably readable.

In this slim volume, Tuchman covers the events leading up to the telegram that sent America to war. The book covers the fascinating topic of dimplomatic espionage in the years before and durning the first world war. In what sounds like something from a James Bond novel, Tuchman describes Germany's attempts to nudge Mexico and Japan into a war with the United States, as well as heightening America's own insecurities about her territory. It is amazing that even in the 20th century, Americans still felt that a foreign invasion was a very real threat. Tuchman then proceeds to describe in detail how the telegram sent by Zimmerman was delivered to America at exactly the right time to bring us into the war. In short, the book is a great, quick read that illuminates one of the most exciting stories in our history."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"Good book. Have had it for years.

I first read The Zimmerman Telegram in the mid seventies. It seemed highly improbable at the time and I thought it must have been a British plot to involve the US into World War I. Reading it now, I found it a very interesting and compelling work. Much research obviously went into her book, and since the German authors of the Telegram admitted to the plot, it must be true. Ms Tuchman's style of writing made the history come alive and is well worth reading. She does however take a distinctly Anglophile point of view of history and although this makes the book more exciting for the reader, it does distort the historical perspective.We are living in a time when much of US history is being rewritten to include other points of view. The United States is truly a nation of immigrants and the immigrant point of view is now being considered in history where as before it was completely ignored. First, no one can deny that the United States was definitely pro-ally and not neutral, by sending goods and weapons to the allies, without which they could not have continued the war (the US did not insist on being able to send goods and weapons to Germany). Second, there was never any threat of an invasion of the United States by Mexico, despite the pathetic Columbus Raid by Pancho Villa. Mexico was in the middle of a long drawn out Civil War and the United States had supported various Mexican leaders throughout the conflict. The only invasion threat was by the United States into Mexico which it seemed to do at will by Pershing in the North and the US Navy in the South at Vera Cruz. The United States had a very large and modern Navy and had already blockaded much of Mexico. The US did not stop the large British Oil exports from Mexico to Britain but did blockade any exports from Mexico to Germany.Finally, the United States did have a large Irish and German immigrant population who were definitely anti-British. President Wilson took the extra step of threatening these immigrants to not interfere with his brand of neutrality."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"Not up to Barbara Tuchman's usual standard, but still worth reading. I found the section on Mexico very interesting and full of new information, more than the telegram itself. I thought the buildup to the telegram's release went on too long and was hyped, and lost interest in it by that time."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"I have read all of Barbara Tuchman's books and learned so much of world history. She is so thorough and at the same time entertaining. I first read this book by a swimming pool in Manila, Philippines. I came to a part where it read that Pancho Villa rode through Hermosillo, Mexico, shooting out all the shop windows, except one; the local shop of Krakauer, Zork, and Moye, the leading hardware wholesaler in El Paso and the leading supplier of guns and ammunition to both sides in the Mexican Revolution. That is what this book is all about; the little known attempt by Germany to help keep the US out of World War I by keeping America too busy on our southern border to worry about Europe. The ludicrous offer to the Mexican government was the promised return of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Fortunately, the British intercepted the telegram and that was the trick that brought America into the war which won it.I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas and my grandfather, for whom I am named, worked for Krakauer, Zork, and Moye, and I learned later he would disappear into Mexico on his horse for weeks at a time. But it wasn't until I read this book did I know why. Through family photos and records, I confirmed it was my grandfather who sold the guns. The Zimmerman Telegram tells all about this little known episode. It plays a sub-story in my upcoming book, Dos Gringos, about my immigrant father's escapades in Mexico at that time, dodging bullets sold to both sides, unknown to him, by his future father-in-law.All of Tuchman's books are wonderfully informative and well worth all the plaudits she has received.Frederick R.

I do not like The Zimmerman Telegram as much as I like its big brother,The Guns of August. It is a dense treatment of a pivotal incident relating to the Great War, rather than a larger treatment of the conflict itself. This doesn't make it bad, but I was glad that I read The Zimmermann Telegram after having read Guns of August.The Zimmerman telegram was one of the instruments that contributed to bringing the US into the Great War. Tuchman focuses on the events that led up to the fateful telegram and touches on relevant issues such as Mexican politics, code-breaking, and US neutrality.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"World War I has receded into the fog of history for most Americans - recent surveys show that the average American knows as much about The Great War as they do the War of 1812 or the Spanish-American War. In other words, not much.Barbara Tuchman's \\"The Zimmerman Telegram\\" is a perfect remedy to this embarrassment. One of St. Tuchman's earlier works, \\"TZT\\" is short - barely clocking in at over 200 pages, plus footnotes. But the book gains strength from its lean stature - this is not a bloated history filled with peripheries, tangents, or fantasies by the writer.Instead, Tuchman stays focused on the personalities and national interests involved. America was desperate to stay out of World War I, as was President Woodrow Wilson (driving Teddy Roosevelt to distraction as he suffers outside the halls of power). England and France were desperate for America to join the Allies, but if the million-man casualty figures wouldn't make Wilson budge, what could they do? And Germany was desperate to keep America out of the war - its economic might and vast resources would wrap up the affair pretty quickly.And so Germany got clever - too clever by half. The Zimmerman Telegram contained an offer to open up a new front to keep America busy - by having Japan and Mexico form an alliance and attack the soft underbelly of the U.S. This plot, the Germans promised, would yield much of the Southwest back to Mexico, restoring national pride and shifting the global balance of power.And yet, thanks to German arrogance and British code-breakers, the Brits found themselves with the ultimate smoking gun - the Zimmerman Telegram.Tuchman tells this riveting tale with insight, detail, and verve. The pages fly by in this highly readable history, and any reader will have his or her interest in the WWI era raised several notches.This is a must-read for fans of American history."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"you might think it too contrived.

Please call the President's attention to the fact that the ruthless employment of our submarines now offers the prospect of compelling England in a few months to make peace.\\"Zimmermann Telegram So reads the so-called \\"Zimmermann Telegram,\\" in which Germany tried to keep the United States out of the Great War in Europe by fomenting trouble on the already-tense southern border and to the west from Japan. Barbara Tuchman's The Zimmermann Telegram chronicles Germany's entrance into the War and her efforts to keep the U.S. neutral, even as England attempted to persuade the U.S. to join the Allies.Woodrow Wilson worked furiously to negotiate a \\"peace without victory\\" in Europe even while trying to keep southern tensions at bay.Problems south of the border were an immediate concern for Wilson, who was inaugurated just as a coup in 1913 brought most of Mexico under the control of General Victoriano Huerta, \\"a pure-blooded Indian with a flat nose, a bullet head, a sphinx's eyes behind incongruous spectacles, and a brandy bottle never far from his hand\\" and considered \\"everything abhorrent\\" by Wilson.Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II had for years been plotting to manage all of the affairs of Europe, imagining himself alone sufficiently competent to carry the terrible burden. As he was able to influence his \\"cousin Nicky\\" (the Tsar of Russia) to carry out his plans, Wilhelm started looking further, to Venezuela and finally to Mexico-ultimately joining the U.S. in meddling in her affairs. He had an elaborate scheme involving Japan would ultimately lead the U.S. actually to invade (even to annex) Mexico and the rest of Latin America to respond favorably to an offer from Germany to beat back American expansion.Unfortunately for Wilhelm, the Germans were not as smart as he had imagined, nor were the British so clueless. Some excellent intelligence work by a small group known simply as \\"Room 40\\" managed to produce definite evidence of Germany's aggression and to convince President Wilson to lead the U.S. into war against Germany, bringing in money, supplies, and a much needed boost of morale in the Allies' darkest moments.The story is masterfully told: several themes are weaved together to carry the reader effortlessly through the intrigues of international politics at the dawn of the twentieth century. Writing in the text is a pleasure to read, engaging and elegant. Tuchman is best known for her later works including The Guns of August (which influenced President Kennedy greatly during the Cuban Missile Crisis), but even this early work stands out as excellent presentation of history. I managed to acquire a copy of an edition produced by The Folio Society, bound in cloth, complete with a case. The book is typeset nicely and includes photographs of critical characters such as Wilson, Wilhelm, Admiral Sir William Reginald Hall, Huerta, General Venustiano Carranza, and General Pancho Villa.Any student of history is sure to find The Zimmermann Telegram an enlightening work on a critical moment in history and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"I read this book, here in Cear&aacute;-Brazil.I'm an agronomist and I also like to read history's books.And this book is good to read.The subject of this book is the relation, between USA, Mexico, Germany and Japan, in two firsts decades of XX Century.If this is history's book, the historical facts showed in this book are sometimes, comics or similar to absurds.Even so, this is a correct book.The failures of this book are small.To example, Woodrow Wilson went to be against Huerta, by racial prejudices or by economic reazons?"},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"If we remember anything at all from our high school history class about why the United States got into World War I, it might have something to do with unrestricted submarine warfare. But the Zimmermann Telegram, if it was even mentioned, has long disappeared from memory, along with most of the other \\"facts\\" we learned in school. Barbara Tuchman, in this superb little book, makes a strong case for the argument that it was the revealing of the contents of this one message that convinced the American public that war with Germany was necessary.The account reads like a spy thriller, which in fact it is. But there is not one statement which cannot be documented. Tuchman had access to American, British and German records which clearly illustrate the process of decision-making for each of the governments involved. The author has a knack for encapsulating her view of the often unimpressive character of the major players.By 1916 World War I had degenerated into a horrible bloody stalemate from which there was no escape. Each side was desperate for fighting to end, but could accept nothing less than defeat of the enemy. None of the belligerents were prepared to consider Wilson's efforts toward \\"peace without victory.\\" The only solution for the Allies was to bring the United States into the war, and for the Central Powers, to keep her out. Germany was convinced that, through unrestricted submarine warfare, against neutral as well as belligerent shipping, she could force Britain to capitulate in a few months. The Allies were hoping for a German blunder that would finally drag the U.S. into the war, and Britain did have a secret weapon of which the Germans knew nothing; she had broken the German diplomatic code and was reading all German international messages, both cable and radio. How this all played out is the theme of this little volume. It is illuminating, with respect to this important turning point in world history, and to the processes by which nations are governed."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"I approached this as a general reader in search of a good read, not as a historian. It was a good read, and I learned much more about a piece of our history that I last studied nearly 30 years ago. Tuchman writes with urgency and though her work is well documented, her narrative is never bogged down by wavering, stuttering scholarspeak or footnotes that lie like logs and potholes on the way to the next sentence. Some may argue her premise, that the revelation of the Zimmerman telegraph was the one motivator that would compel Wilson to finally send American troops into World War I combat, but Tuchman makes a persuasive case. Her strengths beyond a capable writing style lie in character development of the players on two sides of the Atlantic and an ability to track all of their movements with clarity as they converge on the fateful entrance of the US into the conflict. In reading this, I was reminded that our contemporary Congress is not unique in its image-conscious, bull-headed, snappish judgment. I was especially taken by what is obviously a legacy of the Civil War, the deep-rooted American fear of conflict on its own soil."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"I have read several of Tuchman's books and like her style.

In just 200 pages, Tuchman balances an international cast of major and supporting characters; intrigues, both serious and ludicrous; and lessons in the contemporary state of global politics.

An incredible accomplishment, but no surprise since it's a Barbara Tuchman book."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"Barbara Tuchman is one of the leading historians of the 20th century ; she proves it here once more. In this book she manages to use an anecdote - the telegram - to explain in a thrilling and convincing way the reasons for the US to enter the war. It is a brilliant book thanks to her remarkable style which blends suspense and clarity and yet no compromise with historical truth.Many historians are experts and have a vast knowledge of their subject. Very few like Barbara Tuchman make their knowledge accessible in an enticing way to the \\"man in the street\\"."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"The best historians are also storytellers. So it is with Barbara Tuchman, displaying both capabilities by crafting The Zimmerman Telegram as a mystery while it describes what caused America to abandon neutrality and enter World War I in 1917.Author Tuchman starts off with a tease - the decoding of the intercepted telegram. Then she abandons the thing in the safe of Admiral William Hall while she tells her story of Mexican politics and internecine war, German perfidy and deceit, American naivety and blindness, and the killing of a generation on the battlefields of France.It's an important story - of how Woodrow Wilson (and America) was convinced to abandon his aversion to war (and our desire for isolationism) when the telegram by German Foreign Minister Zimmerman was shown to him and he was convinced of its authenticity.A key player in Tuchman's story is Admiral Hall, and he is mostly silent. His staff intercepted the telegram and decoded it. Hall has to figure out how to put the telegram in view of American leaders without Germany deducing its origin. When author Tuchman interviewed Hall in 1958 just prior to publication, Admiral Hall was still silent on some details of his story.A great read here - a better mystery than those from Stuart Woods or some from Ken Follett."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"This book, by an eminent historian, greatly enlightened me as to the primary events that caused our entry into WW I. I heretofore had thought that the Lusitania sinking and the resumption of untrestricted submarine warfare were PRIME, while the Zimmermann Telegram was realtively minor and/or a British hoax. However, the revelation of the Zimmermann Telegram \\"galvanized\\" U.S. citizens like nothing else could have and the credibility of it was, strangely, even admitted to by Arthur Zimmermann himself. Had always been curious as to just what part the \\"Telegram\\" had played and/or the above-mentioned potential for it being a British hoax?Also, I was appalled at German stupidity and arrogance in thinking their code could NOT be broken. Incredibly, they AGAIN did the same thing in WW II and \\"The Ultra Secret\\" thing. People, even of the vaunted intelligence of the Teuton, are still prone to studpidity. For more of this latter, see Mrs. Tuchman's work: \\"The March of Folly\\". The Japanese too, were not immune, reference \\"Magic\\" intercepts in WW II."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"This is the second book by Barbara Tuchman that I've read and once again, her writing skills are manifest. She has taken a seemingly minor document (maybe not all that minor), showing the conception behind it, its transmission to German agents in Mexico, its decoding by British Naval Intelligence agents, and its release to American government officials, and hence we have this captivating and dramatic story. In Tuchman's view, this document was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, which in this case was America and its leaders (most especially Wilson's) reluctance to enter into the First World War.A cast of scores come to the surface in this book, many of whom I knew little about, from British intelligence figures, German and Mexican agents trying to formulate a plan for alliance, along with Japan, and others from various diplomatic and political spheres of influence from the Allied and Central Powers. As in the Guns of August, I sense her abilities in capturing the drama of the moment and the human elements of the stories. This is a relatively small book, but is choke full of information.For me, the power of her words and description really started pouring forth from the chapter entitled Trap. Her portrayals of various German diplomatic figures like Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg, Ambassador Bernstorff, President Wilson, Walter Hines Page, Balfour and others symbolize her talents in portraying the human elements of the story. The depiction of American naivete on foreign affairs and the dangers posed by the Central Powers came across in this book. For example, how the Americans warmly greeted incoming German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann and how Wilson refused to believe that Germany's declaration of unrestricted U-Boat warfare would deter the Americans efforts to remain neutral; Wilson still wanted to bring the belligerent powers to a settlement, or as Wilson called it, a peace without victory.Once again, a marvelous work by a wonderful historian."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"Historian Barbara Tuchman tells the full story of the Zimmerman Telegram in gripping detail. As many know, this note was sent by the German foreign minister to Mexico at the height of World War I. Germany hoped to spur increased conflict between the USA and Mexico, and thus keep America's industrial might from joining the Allies. But Zimmerman's note was intercepted by British intelligence, which quickly decoded it. Then as the author shows, Britain held on to it and waited to release their discovery at the right moment. That moment came in early 1917 as Germany announced it was resuming unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic. The effect in the USA was electric, and it spurred President Woodrow Wilson, a near-pacifist, to ask Congress to declare war on Germany.Historian Barbara Tuchman (1912-1989) was a talented popular historian with a nicely readable style. This 1958 book is not that long in pages, but it's great for information, tension, and history."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"Barbara Tuchman's style is so refreshing -- she brings a perspective to history that I never thought existed.The story of intrigue during the first world war and the efforts of the Germans to keep the US out of it so that Germany could launch what it thought would be the final death blow to Britain. The telegram referred to in the book was intercepted but because of the intrigue could not be made immediately public to the American Public.Very good story"},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"Excellent book. Easy read. Besides info.on the telegram itself, Tuchman does a superlative job explaining the Mexican-Japanese connection which is often overlooked, but is exceedingly important in understanding the telegram's significance."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"I can't quite put my finger on what it is about Barbara Tuchman's style that turns this account of events leading up to America's involvement in World War I into a fascinating page-turner - or at least to a history buff like myself. It begins shamelessly generic, in what must be book-writing 101, at a point of highest tension in relation to the story (the interception of the telegram itself and the realization of its implication). From that opening salvo, it bounces backwards nearly twenty years to fill in the details, starting with Kaiser Wilhelm's obsession with the threat of Asian encroachment on the bastion of white Europe (The Yellow Peril), as well as his more local concern with encirclement by hostile neighbors.Then, no less scholarly for its dramatic method, the author moves through the intervening years, tracing the thread of personalities and events that in 1917 led the German Foreign Minister, Arthur Zimmerman, to propose an alliance between Germany, Mexico and Japan, one which would hand over the American Southwest to Mexico should the partnership succeed. Ms. Tuchman is able to muster up enough suspense with her narrative that one nearly wants to shout, \`Gosh, will Wilson ever get off the fence?! Is America going to get in on this war or not?'I don't know if Ms. Tuchman pioneered the blueprint for the popular history genre, but she certainly made excellent use of its conventions, and I think it's a shadowy awareness of the author's use of these conventions that make me feel as though I'm enjoying the story despite my better judgment. But the truth is that before I was mid-way through, I was hooked, and I zipped through this short account in about a day-and-a-half, all the while sort of mentally shaking my head, wondering how she did it. In the end, I don't have anything but positive things to say about THE ZIMMERMAN TELEGRAM, regardless of my snobbish tendency to dismiss it as \`popular history'. Perhaps not a life-changing event, but extremely entertaining. Four-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"Readers who are familiar with Barbara Tuchman's writings will need little encouragement to read this book. Winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, she has written seven histories, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences presented her with the gold medal for history. She believed the historian should not only research the topic thoroughly but should present the result as a skilled storyteller. The New York Times praised this book as a true and lucid thriller told with \`a creative writer's sense of drama and a scholar's obeisance to the evidence.'It tells of the events leading to America's entry into World War One, during which time Tuchman's grandfather Henry Morgenthau was Woodrow Wilson's Ambassador to Turkey. Wilson was determined to mediate peace, but the British navy had blockaded German shipping and the German Supreme High Command planned to break the blockade with unrestricted submarine warfare which would almost certainly bring America into the war. Arthur Zimmermann, the German foreign secretary, sent to the German ambassador in Washington a coded telegram with details of the German government's planned strategy. British intelligence intercepted the telegram, was able to decipher it, and it was reported in the American press. On 6 April the United States entered World War I on the Allied side. In Tuchman's hands the episode makes excellent reading."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"AMAZING ACCOUNT OF THE US ENTRY INTO WW1TO THIS DAY UNKNOWN FACTORS HAVING PUSHED WILSON INTO ITBARBARA TUCHMAN WRITING PACKS POWER AND STUNNING AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION AND RESEARCHIN A WORD TUCHMAN WHEN IT ROCKS!"},{"Title":"The Zimmermann Telegram","review":"A good book, and it answered all of the ?'s I have ever had and it even told me more.

I've never been able to understand why this happens as most people seem to make the heaving and ho-ing of forces and stresses within their own heavily rationalized lives far more complicated than, say, the bewildering complexities that lead up to the start of the Second World War. Listen to any Leftist spout the minimalist canon about Viet Nam or Iraq and then listen to them go on for hours about all the reasons--social, psychological, neurochemical, personal historical--why they can't, for instance, quit smoking. It's loads of fun.[Author's note: for funsies go on to any Left-winger you know about how Rome and Carthage went to war years ago over oil. They'll grapple for a while with a word they've never heard before (Carthage) but nod eagerly over the oil explanation. Then, to be extra wicked, explain that it was baby oil they fought over and the evil Carthaginians (they treated women and minorities terribly, that's what made them evil) made it from REAL BABIES. Important: make it clear that the Carthaginians were white and patriarchal so you aren't accused of hate speech! If this is done with a straight face and with serious tone it'll be swallowed in one gulp. I know, I've done it]What the author does here is pull back the curtain a bit on all the machinations and plots surging to and fro in the world prior to WWI. Did you know the Japanese--generally fairly friendly to us--were very interested in establishing a naval base in Mexico? You see we were always their only rivals in the Pacific--that's why the Great White Fleet stopped in by for a visit and a muscle flex. Then there's Kaiser Bill, a guy who idolized our Teddy Roosevelt, plotting away to trip us up and maybe even carve us up. Things like that. After a read of this type one gets a better sense of why the US was so hot-to-trot over an American canal in Panama, why we wanted a base in the Phillipines, and so on. You see, back then, like now, the world was a den of wolves and backstabbers. Between 1900 and 1920 the US could have easily, and without doin' nuthin' much, gone to war with any major or minor power. We nearly went to war with Germany over Venezuela.

That did not happen until 1966-7. At the time it was distrusted by American opinion, as just that, a British fake. However the sinking of the Lusitannia removed any remaining American doubts as to entry in the Great War. Subsequent to the revelation that the Zimmermann Telegram was a fake, (50 years after the fact) followed the item that the Lusitannia was carrying arms and munitions in her hold. The Germans knew this and announced, via ads in New York papers, their intention to sink her, which they did. Undersea exploration has since borne this out.

In a time of Harcourts and Harper Collins, and Antheneums it's almost impossible for the little guy (the little guy in this case being Simply Read Books) to make any kind of a lasting impression on the marketplace. Worse than all of this is the snobbery involved in criticizing small publishers. I admit freely that when I picked up, \\"When You Were Small\\", I looked at it long and hard with an eye towards finding any faults it might have. Not all small publishers are good, after all, and not all of their books readworthy. Simply Read Books is different, though, and \\"When You Were Small\\", is infinitely readworthy. An unassuming title with a charming presence, great use of wry commentary, and some really outstanding pen and ink illustrations. \\"When You Were Small\\", reminds all of us that sometimes the smallest publishers are the ones who find the best new talent around.Every night, we are told, Henry and his dad sit down, \\"and have a chat\\". Henry asks his dad to tell him what he was like when he was small and dad does so. The only thing is, dad seems to be a bit of a literal sort. The first thing he tells Henry is, \\"When you were small you used to have a pet ant and you would take him out for walks on a leash\\". And here we see Henry, no younger than before, but tiny enough to walk an ant as if it were a particularly frisky dog. With each page we learn more about what \\"little\\" Henry's life was like. Sometimes it's straightforward, as when we're told, \\"When you were small we took the toy castle out of the aquarium and you were king of it\\". Other times the book acquires a dry wit, saying things like, \\"... your mother once lost you in the bottom of her purse. When she found you again, you were clinging to an earring she'd lost three years before\\". We hear about how Henry would eat, use a ruler when it came to tobogganing, and take a bath. Near the end of the book Henry's father notes, \\"we wanted to call you Hieronymous but it was too big a name for you and so we shortened it to Henry\\". And when Henry asks if all of this is true (as I am sure he asks every night) his dad simply says, \\"Well ... don't you remember?\\".With a steady hand O'Leary parcels out the information in this book in a familiar form. Each section that discusses Henry's previously tiny state begins with the repeating phrase, \\"When you were small\\". I think it was the understated humor that really won me over to this book, though. There's a wonderful moment when Henry would ride around in his father's breast pocket. \\"Your little head would just stick out and your little hands would grip onto the edge of the cloth. Actually you ripped a lot of my shirts that way\\". It's a small statement, but it makes the reader suddenly wonder if all the dad's stories were true after all. I mean, that's a pretty realistic detail to include. Illustrator Julie Morstad further confuses the issue when she displays front and endpapers that consist of Henry staring at photographs of himself in his \\"small\\" state. Some show him posing alongside an ant. Others display him floating away on a balloon or doing something as mundane as posing for Halloween. What is a child to think?Actually, I should be giving artist Morstad some definite props for this book as well. Using the thinnest of pen lines in a wide variety of colors (subdued, for the most part) the book feels almost like a foreign import. We rarely see such delicate perfectly rendered pictures in our American bookstores and libraries. There's a picture of Henry standing astride a beautifully penned cat. Every hair of that cat is meticulously placed, making it my favorite image in, \\"When You Were Small\\". Morstad could make even Peter Sis look like a thick-penned schlub in comparison.I should mention that the book conveys a great deal of love without artifice or false sentiment. Some of this you might be able to chalk this up to the simplicity of the book's design itself. Publication information is in tiny type at the bottom of a single page. There is no information about either the author nor illustrator nor even a dedication section. The book also hasn't any book jacket, giving it a rather classic feel. All in all, this is one of the lovelier picture book creations I've had the pleasure of reading in a long time. A quiet, intelligent, rather sweet read in a style that everyone can enjoy. Recommended with honors."},{"Title":"When You Were Small","review":"Everything about this book, I love. The words, the message, the illustrations, the gorgeous cover, everything.

I can only hope they write one with a little girl as the main character!"},{"Title":"When You Were Small","review":"This unassuming little book has such clever writing and imaginative scenes that it's close to perfect. A simple two-joke setup propels the ever-spiraling absurd humor: First, that a \\"small\\" child would be really, REALLY tiny, and, second, the pun resulting from the confusion of small and young.\\"Every night young Henry asks a common kid question: \\"Dad...tell me about when I was small.\\" Nearby adults generally smile at this question, because they quite reasonably interpret\\"small\\" as \\"young,\\" and the child questioner is still pretty young (and small). IT becomes one of those awww-laden moments when the adults sneak little isn't-he-cute winks and glances at each other.There will be none of this sentimentality for author Sara O'Leary though. She launches into her mildly absurd humor through the father, who regales his audience (and yours) with reverse-Paul Bunyan tales of Henry, when he was, indeed, very, very small:\\"When you were small we used you as a chess piece, because our chess board was missing one of the knoghts and you were the perfect size.\\"Not THAT's small, so small that the expected story about Henry as a much younger child is quickly dashed. Befitting the intimate story and Henry's diminutive size, the pictures are simple and soft (with cross-hatched lines for texture), illustrating the text with a few small objects and one small Henry. For example, against a shadowed tablecloth covered with a small rubber duckie, tiny bath towel and shirt, we see Henry about to jump into a striped green teapot twice his size!\\"When you were small we used to give you baths in the teapot, and when you were done we could just tip you over and pour you out.\\" There are fourteen such vignettes, with enough variety in scene and length to maintain interest: SOme of them are simple one-liners (\\"When you were small we brushed your hair with a toothbrush\\") and others a bit more involved. ALthough the book is very funny, there's a slightly muted tone stemming form the matter-of-fact way that the dad talks to Henry. The book is so funny thatI can't guarantee it will be a good bedtime read, but there's a slightly muted tone, stemming form the matter-of-fact way the dad answers Henry, that gives the book lulling to sleep potential (especially after repeated readings take away some of the initial surprises!).O'Leary handles the boy's question, \\"is all that true,\\" quite expertly (the Dad adroitly dodges the question with his reply, \\"Well, don't you remember\\". It's just one of the many small details done just right in this small gem of a book.

Villari's work is excellent and to my mind the best available on the subject. It is slightly partial and eager to take Fra Girolomo's side but that is a fair approach given the relentless attacks mounted against him over five centuries, including a vitriolic and wholly ill-informed piece by the London Times in April 1996. The one point I would take from this work is the treatment of the trial - whilst fully accurate and sedulous as always, Villari steers away from any analysis of the inquisitorial proceedure. For this I suggest H.C. Lea's peerless 'History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages' (a masterpiece by any measure and sadly out of print I believe) where the author deals with Fra Girolamo's trial in Vol.III - he also extends his thanks to Villari for the work he has done on the subject.The interested reader may wish also to consult Roberto Ridolfi's very good work but I would leave any copies of the useless book by someone called Rachel Engler or Erlenger firmly on the shelves of the second hand book shop where it deserves to stay."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone: The Hypocrisy of Religious Fundamentalism and Its Threat to Society","review":"RA Gilbert's book claims to be a \\"startling expose\\". It is hardly exciting or novel enough to qualify for such an overexaggerated description. Nor does it particularly live up to its title - it doesn't really say a great deal about hypocrisy as such (though it might be inferred), and by the author's own admission it critiques the behaviour of only one segment (albeit a large one, perhaps) of (Protestant) fundamentalism. It is, however, generally insightful and accurate.The main focus of Gilbert's book is on the attitude demonstrated by many fundamentalist Christians towards other religions and groups, but mostly practitioners of the (notoriously difficult-to-define) \\"New Age\\" and \\"occult\\". He details practices and arguments with which I am well acquainted: I spent most of my Christian life in a milieu where Christians felt it their duty to picket psychic fairs, to publicly oppose any expression of other religions, faiths or spiritual beliefs (usually in the belief that government were morally bound to take their side), and to be among the foremost of those propogating any one of endless myths and sensational fabrications about Satanism and witchcraft. Gilbert competently assails the legends and folklore that make up fundamentalist opposition to \\"demonic forces\\". In this I am with him.He is noticeably sympathetic to New Age practices, and gives short shrift to skeptics who deny such things on a scientific basis. This is perhaps the fatal blow to his critique: He gives alternative health and spirituality a credibility that would make skeptics wince, and this enthusiasm frequently sends him off on a tangent, with criticisms of newspapers and medical doctors (among others) that take him somewhat away from his original \\"expose\\" of fundamentalism. This line of attack detracts from his central thesis and, I fear, is rather detrimental to his overall credibility, at least in the eyes of some.Nevertheless, I wish all fundamentalists would read this and learn from it. Perhaps no other aspect of fundamentalism has annoyed me so much as the gullibility demonstrated in the immediate swallowing of every morsel of gossip that might possibly provide useful ammunition against \\"the enemy\\". Unfortunately for all of us, rebukes like Gilbert's tend to fall on deaf ears."},{"Title":"Studio Affairs: My Life as a Film Director","review":"A cineaste may not treat Vincent Sherman with the same regard usually reserved for Welles, Ford, Fellini, or Godard, but a movie buff remembers and appreciates the underrated Sherman's quiet craftsmanship on many popular Hollywood features.

He brings the same practicality, insight, and honesty to this fascinating autobiography.&quot;Studio Affairs&quot; gives the reader an insider's look at the Hollywood studio system, with its stepping stones and setbacks. Vincent Sherman worked with such luminaries as Jack Warner, Harry Cohn, Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth, Claude Rains, even The Dead End Kids. Sherman wore many hats, and he details his varied dealings with actors and colleagues with remarkable candor. His personal life is as compelling as his professional career.&quot;Studio Affairs&quot; is engrossing reading. On more than one occasion this reviewer intended to spend a few minutes with the book, and was hooked for more than an hour at a time. Vincent Sherman deserves a standing ovation for his work, and for this book. Movie fans should enjoy this book very much indeed."},{"Title":"Studio Affairs: My Life as a Film Director","review":"It seems that too few have read this well-written book. Sherman has been working with all the great actors and actresses of the 40's and 50's. He seems to have been quite a ladies' man! He has a lot of good stories about famous film personalities. It has not been easy to be a company man for a person who knows what he wants. This memoir belongs to the best ones written about those golden years of Hollywood."},{"Title":"Studio Affairs: My Life as a Film Director","review":"I am not a big fan of autobio's, although I do love biographies, because a person just cannot write about their own life in an unbiased fashion. However Mr. Sherman had an interesting career and worked with many of the biggest stars, so his stories of movie-making are interesting.He does have a tendency to claim that he always could tell if a script was poor even if no one else could and in all cases, the movies he made that did not do well, he describes as being ones he never wanted to do. And he sometimes justifies his reasons for doing them in the first place, instead of just taking the occasional lumps for putting out a poor picture. Even the best directors have fallen prey to the clunker once in a while, but it is never his fault, it seems.He also is appalling in the way he keeps saying his wife did not mind that he slept with the actresses he directed. And then later saying he couldn't understand why she was sometimes moody with him. But that he was sure she was never jealous. None of that even makes sense. Again, justifying his choices. He had an affair with Bette Davis and a much longer one with Joan Crawford, even going off on vacation with her instead of taking a planned one with his family, and saying that his wife did not mind. I am sorry, I do not believe that-she may have accepted it, but of course she minded.Overall it is an interesting read, though, due to his varied career and his attention to detail in reporting on it. He was involved in the stage, movie making and television for probably more than 50 years. Worth reading if you are a junkie of old Hollywood especially."},{"Title":"Studio Affairs: My Life as a Film Director","review":"Have to agree with both the other reviewers. This is a great autobiography. He writes in a methodical yet highly interesting and entertaining way. He's the type of guy you'd love as a friend or family member. His stories about directing are really interesting and equally fascinating are the personal stories with many stars (Bette Davis, Joan Crawford etc). I've read this book twice and enjoyed it equally, and look forward to reading again. I'd highly recommend it!!"},{"Title":"Downhome Blues Lyrics: An Anthology from the Post-World War II Era (Music in American Life)","review":"Great Anthology, you will find all what you are looking for in this book. Glad I found it, it's a vault of blues lyrics and info. Recommended!!"},{"Title":"Washington and his comrades in arms : a chronicle of the War of Independence","review":"Although a bit dated, this is an interesting book. It is not as focused on Washington as the title might imply, but the fact is, the most interesting period of his life was the Revolutionary War, and you can hardly separate them. While not as detailed as a more scholarly book, this one pays a great deal of attention to the attitudes of the British commanders, and the politics from the British perspective. I would submit that few Americans know how unpopular this war was in England, and how many people, both in Parliament and the general public, wanted to negotiate a peace.It also lays out several of the situations where serendipity led to the final conclusion:1. Benedict Arnold's handler was only caught because his boatman got scared and put him ashore at the wrong place. The plot at West Point was thus exposed.2. Cornwallis's naval support left New York a few days too late, and was cut off by a French fleet from the West Indies (extra points for double serendipity). Cornwallis's only way out then was across a river, and a storm came just then (triple points).3. France spent $800,000,000 helping the Americans, and enlisted Spain in the effort. Holland then declared war against England, which distracted King George even more.The more you learn about the American Revolution, the more unbelievable it is that an army of shopkeepers, farmers, and trappers could defeat the best trained and equipped army in the world. George Washington was pivotal to this.If you are interested in the American Revolution, this little book will introduce you to quite a few new perspectives."},{"Title":"Washington and his comrades in arms : a chronicle of the War of Independence","review":"This book of &quot;Washington and his Comrades in Arms&quot; shows how he helped shape the U.S. and what accompishments he made for us. He was recruited by the Continental Congress for command of the army. He fought many difficult battles to to determine the outcome of the war. Many opposing forces stood in his way, for example, General Cornwallis and his gigantic battlaion. The knowledge and strength of Washington helped him defeat lots of obstacles and further him and his army to more victories. His strong leadership helped him win one of the most significant battles in history, the battle at Yorktown. Coming back to Philadelphia, many citizens cheered Washington winning all he could. This book is a great way to learn much about the life of Washington in the army."},{"Title":"Magill's history of Europe","review":"I have had to use this book for a paper I had to write about European History.

Told like stories, these articles discuss marketing strategies and campaigns, as well as the people who are responsible for their creation and execution... their attitudes to marketing and satisfying customer needs.Compiled from several years of writing and marketing experience, the articles are grouped and presented in sections, each with an appropriate title and an introduction. With the right dose of humour for which the British are so well-known. Some articles will have you laughing, some marvelling at the big idea and some wondering why the author has not been sued by anyone yet.But what will amaze you the most is the economy of words. Each article is crisp, clear and compact. Without compromising on the ideas and opinions presented. You'll learn a great deal from this book - about what to do and what not to do in marketing. It'll take you from hope to helplessness. Sometimes, even anger. Hence, the apt title."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty (HI 238)","review":"Tess Gerritsen is by far one of the best mystery/suspense authors.

Many times I've purchased a book by a favorite author, only to discover that I already have it from 10-15 years ago.

Hats off to another fantastic book by Ms. Gerritsen."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty (HI 238)","review":"There were so many twists and turns in this book that it was almost annoying. I'd rather see more effort put into the plot and less into the surprises and plot twists."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty (HI 238)","review":"Going back to catch an early novel in a writer's career is always a gamble. What you expect from them now isn't what you'll end up reading (in all likelihood). I saw that Tess Gerritsen had a \\"new\\" novel that showed up at the library. I picked up Presumed Guilty expecting vintage Gerritsen, but I got a bit of a surprise. This is actually a novel that was written back in 1993 and published as a mass market paperback at that time. It's now being re-released in hardback. In effect, you're getting a 20-year-old novel that's lacking the skill and techniques picked up over the last two decades. How much you like Presumed Guilty depends on your expectations on what a Gerritsen novel should be...The story revolves around a love affair gone sour. Miranda Wood, working at a small newspaper located on an island off Maine, had an affair with her boss, Richard Tremain. Tremain wasn't ready for it to end, but Wood found out that she was just one in a long line of many lovers he had over the years. When he calls and says he's coming over to see her, she leaves the house to avoid facing him. But when she returns, she finds him in her bed, stabbed to death. Given Tremain's standing in the community as the owner of the paper, everyone immediately assumes Wood was the killer, and she has no verifiable alibi. Tremain's brother, Chase, comes over to the island to help his brother's widow deal with matters. He'd prefer *not* be there, as he was a bit of an outcast, but Richard *was* family. Chase runs into Wood, and is as convinced as everyone else that she's the killer. But as he spends time watching and talking with her, he starts to have his doubts. And when certain facts make their way to the forefront, it becomes obvious to him that someone else is setting her up to take the fall...Since it's been a while since I've read one of Gerritsen's novels, I wasn't doing a lot of comparison while reading. But this isn't anywhere close to her sweet spot of medical thrillers. It's an early effort from a fledgling writer. The characters aren't as fully developed as you would expect from her, but again, it seems like it's easier to be a bit harsh since you know how good her writing becomes. I look at Presumed Guilty as a decent thriller that is good for a few hours of distraction. So long as you don't come in with high expectations of this being Gerritsen's \\"latest\\" work, it's not bad.Disclosure:Obtained From: LibraryPayment: Borrowed"},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty (HI 238)","review":"This book was evidently written before Ms. Gerritsen started her wonderful RIZZOLI AND ISLES books, which I have very much enjoyed. It's more of a romance than a mystery and isn't really my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty (HI 238)","review":"This was a romance with some mystery thrown in. THere were no real clues for the reader to figure out who done it before hand, yet it was predictable and unbeleiveable. I had to finish it to find out who did it.

The ending was nice, but it wasn't enough to save this book.So... If you read Gerritsen's medical thrillers (Bloodstream, Harvest, etc...) don't expect the same kind of plot, characters or narration in here."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty (HI 238)","review":"I ordered the hardcover edition of this book. The Amazon page did not indicate that this was originally published by another company 15 years before. I thought I was getting a new novel by Tess Gerritsen.I was almost glad to read that it was so old as I could not believe that Tess Gerritsen had really written this drivel. Obviously she was at the start of her writing career when she wrote this. As someone else noted, this is a romance with a slight mystery thrown in. But, the main problem is that is very poorly written, has cardboard cut out characters and frankly, a stupid plot line.The main character is accused of committing a crime. She did not do it, but is universally considered guilty. The woman was not even in the home when the murder took place. There could be no incriminating evidence specifically related to her (blood spatter, cloth used to clean blood from the knife, blood on her clothing, etc) yet she is charged with the crime. So honestly from the first few poorly written pages of the plot, there was not much hope of this turning out to be a sharp, interesting story.A male character is trying to find the identity of a suspect. He has no legal or police authority, he is just a relative of the murdered man. He calls newspapers around the country to find out if a specific person was formerly employed there. All of newsrooms he calls tell him Yes or No without any further questioning of him or why he is asking. He then decides the suspect must have changed her name and calls her Grad School. He asks the Grad School office to search for people who graduated in a specific year with the first name \\"Jill\\". Yep, again they supposedly do this research for him with no questions asked. The whole plot was just too dumb and amateurish to be believable on any level.The money spent for this book was truly wasted. I feel that with the popularity of Rizzoli and Isles novels, either Tess or her agent or publisher thought they could reissue this and earn some extra money as folks like me would buy it thinking it was a newly published work. Shame on me for not checking more carefully...."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty (HI 238)","review":"This was not the best book by Tess Gerritsen I have ever read, but I must confess that I enjoyed it.

The dead man's brother, Chase Tremain, anonymously posts bail without knowing if she was the murderer or not....hoping to keep an eye on her, he has doubts about her guilt when he witnesses some attempts on her life!...that is, unless she's a good actress!!

She ends the affair and he continues to pursue her. When he says he is coming over one evening she leaves the house .... when she returns she finds him stabbed to death in her bed. Of course she is the main suspect.An anonymous individual posts her bail. But life on the small island is intolerable when everyone thinks you murdered the town's most prominent citizen. The estranged brother of the victim comes to town for the funeral and to support his sister-in-law. He finds the story of the murder to be lacking and starts to question things....Where this is headed is obvious from page 10, but Gerritsen drops enough twists and turns to keep you interested. Some of the 'villians' are a little obvious and the shrewish widow is right out of a bad romance novel but the book itself is a quick read. Again, not Hemmingway but worth a few hours."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty (HI 238)","review":"Presumed Guilty is a great book.

The plot was largely unbelievable. It involves a woman who is having an affair with a married man and wants to break it off. She comes home to find him stabbed and dead in her bed. She says she is innocent, but she is \\"presumed guilty\\" hence the title of the book. His brother comes to town and she gets involved with him and he sets about solving the murder.

However, I don't think It was compiled as well as some other works like in the author's lost cities series. David's chapter on Einstein and unified field was good but the rest of the book looked a little thrown together. Even compulations should be well ordered. And, I am not saying this because my copy was bound with some extra duplicate pages either.I appreciate the author's open mindedness on many issues. If this work were someones first read of this author they might be tempted to underestimate the rest of his work.

Mary's illustrations are detailed to perfection, whimsical, playful and utilize children characters in each of the sweet classic rhymes. My only issue with this hardcover volume is that the book is so thick (almost 3/4\\" thick) that the binding didn't hold well on our copy."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"My daughter loves nursery rhymes and we checked out every version we could find at the two local libraries. This one was her favorite (probably because of the pictures) Now I had heard of Mary Engelbreit before but was not a big fan. In this book her pictures are beautiful and kid friendly at the same time and also they are a good mixture of simple and intricate. My daughter (22 months) reads this everyday before nap or bed and several times throughout the day goes and looks through it on her own.I got the CD version (there were no reviews on the CD) and it was just a dollar or two more. Well I hate the CD it is some old lady who reads slow with no intonation at all my mom and I laughed so hard the first time we heard it. BUT my Daughter LIKES it!!! I was so surprised! But we have only listened to it twice....so save two bucks if you want and don't get the CD unless your kid really likes that thing and you can stand listening to it...without falling asleep."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"My daughter absolutely loves it. The illustrations in the book are absolutely adorable, makes me admire them as well, takes me back to my young age. She is 2 and half years old, so makes me read the rhymes and sings along with me.

A great gift idea."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"I love this book, and so does my 3-year-old. Some of the pictures lend a more modern twist to the stories. For example, \\"4 and 20 blackbirds baked in a pie\\" are pictured as birds half in half out of a fruit pie, with the suggestion that they are eating the berries (rather than the original intention which was something more like a blackbird pot pie). Instead of cottage cheese, the curds and whey are illustrated as oatmeal with sugar and cream. However, it is wonderful enjoying mother goose all over again with my daughter, and I've already bought this book for my nieces, too."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"I love this book--I have bought it for all the new babies to arrive in the family, as well as a copy for myself.

She really loves the bright and beautiful illustrations and we are still reading this book almost every night, even though the Christmas season has since passed. That book was our introduction to Mary Engrelbreit. We decided recently to visit the bookstore, and ran across the Mother Goose book. As soon as we opened the book, our daughter decided right away that we should get it. So we did, and we have added this to our selection of books to read daily before bedtime. Since she can't read yet, she will ask for the verses that she wants us to read by looking at the illustrations. Needless to say, this is one of our favorite books, and we can't wait to introduce it to our younger daughter."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"I bought this for me and I share it with my one and three year old sons. We all love it! It just makes you happy to look at the happy illustrations. There is plenty to look at and clues in the pictures as to what is happening in the accompanying texts.My one year old likes to look at books on his own, and is none to gentle with the pages. The pages in this book are holding up well - it is sturdy and well made.I haven't heard the CD yet; actually wasn't aware there was one until I read other reviews."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"The editors did a bad one on this. The book is loaded with mistakes. For example in one rhyme (meant to teach children to count) Mother chicken has 10 chickens and counts them down as 4 yellow, 4 brown and 4 speckled red. That's 12! (See p. 21). There's another mistake in the book, where the rhyme makes no sense. It's missing 2 lines (can't recall which one.) This is just like the movie Elf, where James Caan's character says to an editor who noticed the last pages were missing, \\" you want me to take a $30,000 so some kid can know what happened to a dog. Ship the books.\\" The illustrations are gorgeous though."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"This is the very best Mother Goose book out there.

This is one of my grandson's favorite books. From this Nana, it is also one of mine."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"It's so fun to turn the pages and read each verse with excitement letting memories of my childhood come alive.

Since this is a nice hardcover we keep it up in her closet until we sit together to read it. She will excitedly go to her room and stand in her closet when I ask if she wants to see Humpty Dumpty. The pages are fairly thick (unlike the Disney treasury we recently bought) which is good since I let her turn them. In 2 months time the first page has been torn from the spine. My daughter is a fairly careful page turner. It's rare she stops looking long enough to read a whole story, but Humpty Dumpty, Pat-a-cake, four and twenty blackbirds, three little ghotessess, and old king Cole are a few she'll turn to and ask us to read. I'm tempted to buy another copy for her to keep for her children someday."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"When my granddaughter was younger, we gave her Mother Goose board books by Mary Engelbreit. I chose them because I have always adored Mary's artwork. I wanted to expose our granddaughter to Mary's happy, colorful and pleasingly-detailed pictures. As her parents and I spent time reading Mother Goose rhymes from Mary's books to our small one, her vocabulary increased greatly as she quickly learned the rhymes.As my granddaughter got older, I found Mary had compiled and illustrated many nursery rhymes into one big book, including some of our granddaughter's favorites from Mary's earlier board books. I had to get Mother Goose: One Hundred Best-Loved Favorites. I was not disappointed and neither was my granddaughter. We have already spent many happy hours pouring over this delightful book together.If their motor skills are developed enough to handle paper pages, you should buy this beautifully illustrated book for children you love. If you enjoy Mary's illustrations as I do, you might want to buy one just for yourself."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"I bought this book for my two-year-old and he loves it. The illustrations are great! I only wished I had bough it sooner since my four-year-old loves it as well!"},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"I grew up on these verses (as well as the stories in Mary Englebreit's \\"Nursery Tales\\" book) and wanted my daughter to enjoy them as well. However, I was saddened to find that these timeless classics are hard to come by anymore. My daughter is 18 months old and adores these books. I was worried at first about buying a book with paper pages but she hasn't torn a single page -- she's too busy enjoying the illustrations. There are so many verses that we never make it all the way through the book in one night but circle through the books over and over throughout the week; she never tires of the verses. They're just so much fun to read and the illustrations cannot be beat -- the colors are so vibrant, the images match the verses perfectly and my daughter loves to stare at the pictures as we read. The price for this book makes it an absolute STEAL. I have decided that from now on when I know someone is having a baby, I will purchase these books as a shower gift for them because they're such high quality that they're truly keepsakes. My mom was a kindergarten teacher for nearly 30 years and she laments the loss of these old verses and Nursery tales that teach so much about morals and inspire expanded vocabularies by making words fun. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this book and the Nursery Tales book by Mary Englebreit."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"Book was very colorful for a child.

This is an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"My then-six-month-old received this for Christmas. Now eight months, she loves looking at the pictures. Unfortunately, she has already torn one page of the book. That's why I gave it 4 stars: if it's actually to be used by a young audience, I wish they had printed it on sturdier, board book type paper. (Now, Mommy holds the book while she sits in her high chair.) Of course, the artwork is lovely enough to appeal to an adult audience, too. Several of the basic, familiar nursery rhymes, but some that are pretty obscure -- but fun -- too. Overall, both Mommy and baby enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"Our guy is still pretty little, but he really likes to be read to and he LOVES this book. He will even sit through all 100 rhymes sometimes. The pictures are captivating and the collection of verses is well-chosen. There are many popular and favorite verses and quite a few not-as-famiilar choices (but still as enjoyable). Our son literally goes to the bookshelf and shakes his head until we pull this book off - several times a day. I would recommend and give this book to all my friends. I would strongly suggest you make sure to get the hardcover - for a few dollars more, it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"I can think of no one better to illustrate a volume of Mother Goose poems than Mary Engelbreit.

She will sit still for the whole thing as I read it to her from beginning to end, and then she will still beg for more when we're finished. This is a kid I can barely get to sit still, ever, unless she is buckled in. I don't know if it is the illustrations, the verses, or both that she loves so much, but something about this book enchants her.Since she loved this one so much, we bought the other two books (fairy tales and nursery rhymes) in this series, but neither holds a candle to the Mother Goose one."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"My 4yo daughter has had the book that goes with this CD for a couple of years, and we've loved the illustrations and verse - some of the \\"harsher\\" poems, such as \\"The Old Lady Who lived in a Shoe\\" are modified slightly, so that \\"she kissed them all sweetly\\" instead of \\"whipped them all soundly\\". If you're a purist that may bother you, but I love it. The CD is what it is - a simple reading of the poems by a grandmotherly sounding Lynn Redgrave. Very soothing, very sweet.

I'm glad I finally decided to buy this!"},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"This book is perfect for fans of Mary Engelbreit's artwork - which I am.

The illustrations are bright, colorful and appealing. Mother Goose is beautifully drawn and the poem is first. The black sheep, though, looks like a cat in a sheep suit. I loved the way she drew The Cat and the Fiddle. She chose great poems: the ones I grew up with and some I have never heard before. The pages are thick, the ink shiny and it smells so good.

All the favorites are included."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"We borrowed this book from the library and now we are going to buy it - even though we own 3 other Mother Goose collections!One of the reasons is the selection of poems. Somehow they have found new selections that were not included in our other volumes. Examples include: a poem which asks a mother hen how many chicks she has; one about a four leaf clover; one about a bat; and one about spinning mice and a mischievous cat.Two poems follow:One leaf for fame,One leaf for wealthOne for a faithful lover,And one leaf to bring glorious health,Are all in a four-leaf clover.Little Poll Parrot sat in his garret,Eating toast and tea;A little brown mouse jumped into the houseAnd stole it all away.There are plenty of the classic poems as well so you won't miss out on Jack and Jill, nor the many sheep that M.G. writes about. And yes, it should be noted that this selection of poems has none of the \`meaner' poems; ones that you wouldn't necessarily want read to babies and toddlers.Five Stars. Great selections of poems which is prompting us to buy yet another Mother Goose book. Artwork is pastel and nice and uncluttered: generally one poem per page. [I've never been a fan of Mary Engelbreit's artwork but children are very attracted to her style and it works very nicely here.]"},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"As almost everyone now knows Mary Engelbreit is no longer the little girl who copied illustrations from her mother's collection of storybooks - she has grown up to be a beloved, popular illustrator and, now that you mention it, an industry. Her sprightly, colorful art appears on everything from cups to fabrics. She's a phenomenon who has won our hearts.I highly recommend Engelbreit's hardcover version of this title as well as the audio book, which is not to be missed as read by acclaimed actress Lynn Redgrave. She brings a rich, vibrant voice to her performances of some 100 familiar nursery rhymes. We may think we've heard Little Bo-Beep or Humpty Dumpty a number of times, but we've not heard them as read by Redgrave who injects added humor and a touch suspense to the familiar rhymes.Introduction on the audio book is by Leonard Marcus, historian and critic of children's literature as well as the author of \\"Dear Genius: Margaret Wise Brown,\\" and other titles.This is an audio book that will be prized by both children and adults - don't miss it!Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"I just received my copy of Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose.

I can hardly wait to share it with my six (soon to be seven) grandchilden. Thank you for making it available."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"The book is so beautiful and charming, both my 3 year old daughter and me love it very much. The reason why I gave 3 star is I am a bit disappointed with the accompanying CD, we couldn't seperately review the CD only. Maybe it is just me, the voice isn't pretty. There is such a boring introduction (over 5min) in the begining, while the verses are mostly less than 20 seconds long. So go for the book but not the CD."},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"If you're reading this on Amazon, you probably want to know how this book compares with other large-format Mother Goose nursery rhyme books. Here's my comparison of this book with four others.This book (Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose: One Hundred Best-Loved Verses, ISBN 0060081716) -- Published 2005. PLUSES: If you like Engelbreit's artistic style, this book is for you. A number of illustrations depict black and Asian children. Has some uncommon rhymes (e.g., \\"Three Little Ghostesses\\" and \\"Terrence McDiddler\\"). I found no violent rhymes. MINUSES: Some illustrations do not fit the rhymes well. As one example, Jack Sprat's wife appears to have some \\"lean\\" vegetables and fruits on her side of the table (though certainly a much larger quantity of food than Jack himself). As another example, \\"Three Little Kittens\\" shows the kittens in large mittens on a clothesline, while the rhyme calls on them to be losing and putting on the mittens. Some pages (22, 28, 69, 76, 90, 93, 112, 117) have two rhymes on them, which might be slightly confusing, but on the other hand it might also be fun for kids to guess the relationship between the two rhymes on a page (e.g., \\"Red sky at night\\" and \\"Touch blue\\" both deal with colors). SUMMARY: 4 stars.Favorite Nursery Rhymes from Mother Gooseby Scott Gustafson, ISBN 978-0867130973 -- 45 rhymes. Published 2007. PLUSES: Illustrations (oil paintings) are large, detailed, varied, and fanciful; think a combination of Norman Rockwell, Walt Disney, and Salvador Dali. My favorites include \\"Jack Be Nimble\\" with Jack as a grasshopper, and \\"Simple Simon\\" as a monkey and the pieman as a gorilla. Several illustrations offset the \\"politically incorrect\\" aspects of the corresponding rhymes (e.g., for \\"Peter, Peter, Pumpkin-Eater\\" a squirrel couple serves pie to a boy in front of their pumpkin house). Some illustrations depict black and Asian children. MINUSES: Because only the first 1-4 verses from each rhyme is given, \\"Old Mother Hubbard\\" is missing a lot of verses. With the smallest selection of rhymes of the books reviewed here, it may not have some that your child may like (e.g., \\"Three Little Kittens\\"). SUMMARY: 5 stars.My Very First Mother Gooseby Iona Opie and Rosemary Wells, ISBN 1564026205 -- 68 rhymes. Published 1996. Organized into four chapters (\\"Jack and Jill,\\" \\"Hey Diddle, Diddle,\\" \\"Little Jumping Joan,\\" and \\"The Moon Sees Me\\"), although I couldn't figure out why certain rhymes fell into certain chapters. The large majority of the illustrations feature animals acting like people. PLUSES: Interplay of text and engaging watercolor illustrations is more creative than in any other book reviewed here. For example, \\"There was a crooked man\\" has many small illustrations for the rhyme, while the text of \\"Pop goes the weasel\\" is contained within the large illustration. Font sizes vary considerably, from very large to moderately small, and the large initial letters of many rhymes are painted with something relevant to the rhyme (e.g., train tracks for \\"From Wibbleton to Wobbleton\\"). Extra information -- like tiny illustrations for cake-making under the main \\"Pat-a-cake\\" illustration, and four constellations' names for \\"Star light, star bright\\" -- add to the variety. I found no sexist or violent rhymes. Has some uncommon rhymes (e.g., \\"Mrs. Mason bought a basin\\"). MINUSES: Some illustrations may be confusing; for example, \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" is an actual (from-the-chicken) small egg that gets knocked to the ground, not a \\"living character\\" as in other books. Non-Christians may question the inclusion of two \\"Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John\\" rhymes toward the end. SUMMARY: 5 stars.The Real Mother Gooseby Blanche Fisher Wright, ISBN 0590225170 -- 305 rhymes. First published 1916. Typography and illustrations (almost all of which depict people as opposed to animals acting like people) are either \\"nostalgic\\" (if you like them) or \\"old-fashioned\\" (if you don't). It has the smallest page size (8.5\\"x11\\") of the books reviewed here. PLUSES: Probably the most well-known, \\"classic\\" collection. Includes uncommon rhymes (e.g., \\"Comical Folk\\") and longer rhymes (e.g., \\"This is the House that Jack Built\\") not in the other books. MINUSES: I compared the current (1994 Scholastic/Cartwheel Books) printing with a previous (1991 Checkerboard Press) printing, and the color in the illustrations is less saturated than before. Has some rhymes and illustrations that could be considered \\"politically incorrect\\" (violent, sexist, etc.) such as \\"Little Polly Flinders\\" (in which a mother \\"whipped her little daughter\\") and \\"Peter, Peter, Pumpkin-Eater\\" (picturing a woman stuck inside a pumpkin). Multiple rhymes on each page could be confusing to young readers. SUMMARY: 4 stars.Richard Scarry's Best Mother Goose Ever (Giant Little Golden Book), ISBN 0307155781 -- 50 rhymes. First published 1964. PLUSES: Endearing large illustrations feature animals acting like people. The use of pigs is especially nice (e.g., a clothed pig stealing a gingerbread pig for \\"Tom, Tom, the piper's son\\" and Georgie Porgie as a boy pig \\"snouting\\" a girl pig). Has some uncommon rhymes (e.g., \\"The cat sat asleep by the side of the fire\\"). MINUSES: Has some rhymes and illustrations that could be considered sexist (e.g., \\"When I was a bachelor\\" and \\"I had a little hen\\") or violent (e.g., \\"Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum\\" and \\"Taffy Was a Welshman\\"). There is a certain monotony to the illustrations, and all of them follow their rhymes fairly literally, so I'm not sure they would hold older children's attention well.

Every table cloth is embroidered and every animal has a frilly collar or chain of flowers around its neck. The effect is a kind of preciousness, but also a flatness that might not be to your liking. I know that the style of illustration is popular, but I keep thinking I'm looking at a cheap box of cookies. It is good for kids--there are lots of little details to notice and appreciate and the quality of the reproductions is excellent (the pencil work especially is very textured and subtle)--but be aware that it might not be to your taste if you like the more Victorian look of Blanche Fisher Wright's famous version. This one:The Real Mother Goose Golden Anniversary Edition 1916-1966Further, the poems are occasionally broken up in odd ways. The \\"Queen of Hearts,\\" rhyme, for example, is given entirely new line breaks for one stanza, but not another. An odd and irritating change which makes the poem less musical.So buyer beware.**update**I wrote the above when my daughter was about six months. She's thirteen months now and loves this book to death, so much so that I have to buy a new copy to replace the first which is torn and dirty. I still don't like the illustrations, and the weird line breaks annoy me more than ever. Plus, it's hard not to notice that while the children are across the rainbow of ethnicity, all the adults are white. The rhymes selected are pretty sanitized as well--there are few that address class or have bad kids the way that many of the poems in the Fisher Wright version do.But there's no denying that the detailed illustrations are great for children. My daughter loves pointing out all the cats (there are a lot of cats) and birds and flowers everywhere, and she just loves the poems. Sometimes I see her with the book opening babbling to herself and patting the page to keep a beat.So feel mixed about it. But if my daughter grows up papering her walls with cutsie cat pictures, I'm blaming Engelbreit. :-)"},{"Title":"Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose","review":"I purchased this for my Granddaughters and was very pleased to be giving it to them for a gift.

Instead of focusing on the negative, one author has chosen to highlight a positive quality to help teach children - tolerance.In the book, \\"There's a Skunk in My Bunk: Helping Children Learn Tolerance,\\" by Joseph T. McCann, Psy.D., a boy meets a skunk in his bedroom. The boy, who has heard all sorts of bad things about skunks, is not too pleased to have this visitor in his home. The skunk defends himself and introduces him to some of his friends whom the boy also has a negative opinion of.

As a father and husband, I gleaned much from this book."},{"Title":"The Shaping Of A Christian Family","review":"Elisabeth Elliot's biography of the family she was raised in is a privilege to read. She includes many diary excerpts and personal letters to tell the story of her parents and grandparents, but this is more than just biography. It is the story of God's workings in the lives of a few of His faithful servants and the fruits of their labor. Elliot tells practical stories of child-rearing (such as how her mother taught Elliot's brother as a toddler the meaning of obedience), as well as practical life lessons such as waiting on God's will regarding finding a spouse and whether to be a missionary or not. It is a wonderful story told with humor and genuineness, but even more importantly, it inspires those of us who are parents towards the goal of creating a God-centered home and raising children to live their lives in integrity and moral uprightness. I read this book shortly after my first child was born, and I plan to re-read it at least every five years--there is so much that is helpful and encouraging to glean from it. Anyone who has read Elliot's other books will enjoy this tremendously, as it will help you to know her even better. There are wonderful family photos in the book, too. I highly recommend this book. All Christian parents should read it!"},{"Title":"The Shaping Of A Christian Family","review":"As a pediatrician I witness daily how lost parents are in the area of family and parenting. We are now in the second and third generation of parents who were themselves never parented. Many of them have no vision for their children beyond being healthy, happy and having a college education. For the most part the parents of today are completely unaware that there is anything of importance to be given to their children beyond their materialistic needs. Elisabeth Elliot's book gives such parents a glimpse into the past and shows what a family and parents can be. If nothing else it demonstrates how much has been lost. I encourage parents to read this book together and discuss its contents in relation to their own upbringing in addition to their own parenting. My hope is that they will take a hard look at their duty to their children and develop a well rounded vision for their family."},{"Title":"The Shaping Of A Christian Family","review":"this book was such an inspiration to me as a Christian mom. i have always appreciated Elisabeth Elliot's words and admonitions in her books and tapes. this book is probably my favorite of all of her books. i still have pages of this book turned down so that i can find a favorite passage quickly!"},{"Title":"The Shaping Of A Christian Family","review":"a book I recommend to moms as they begin thinking thru what's important in life for their children.

The computational and algorithmic aspects of the subject are not treated, with emphasis instead placed on existencetheorems for various optimization problems. The author does an effective job of detailing the mathematical formalism needed in optimization theory. After a brief review of background mathematics in the first chapter, the author outlines the objectives of optimization theory in Chapter Two. He also gives some examples of optimization problems, such as utility maximization, expenditure minimization, profit maximization, cost minimization, and portfolio choice. All of these examples are extremely important in industrial, logistical, and financial applications. The author is also careful in this chapter to outline his intentions in later chapters, namely, that of finding the existence of solutions to optimization problems, and also in the characterization of the set of optimal points. The existence question is outlined in Chapter Three using only elementary calculus, and the Weierstrass theorem is proved. Necessary conditions for unconstrained optima are examined in the next chapter, again using only elementary calculus and linear algebra. Lagrange multipliers and how they are used in constrained optimization problems are effectively discussed in Chapter 5. To discuss how optimization problems vary with a set of parameters, in particular if they vary continuously with the set of parameters, the author introduces the concept of a corespondence. This is essentially a map that assigns sets to points. His discussion of upper and lower-semicontinuity is very clear and I think one of the best presentations given at this level. He then proves a maximum theorem, showing that parametrized optimization problems can have continuous solutions under certain conditions. A game-theoretic application follows along with statements, but not proofs, of the Kakutani and Brouwer Fixed Point theorems. The author introduces an order relation on the parameter space and discusses parametric monotonicity in the next chapter. Again a game theory application is given along with a statement (but not a proof) of the Tarski Fixed Point theorem. The last two chapters cover dynamic programming and these are the most interesting chapters of the book. It is here that the author makes the connection with more advanced treatments of optimization theory, via Banach spaces and nonlinear functional analysis. With further reading in real analysis and topology, readers will be well on their way to understanding more advanced treatments of optimization theory that use nonlinear functional analysis and differential topology."},{"Title":"A First Course in Optimization Theory","review":"This book was organized and written with perfection. The explanations are remarkable and the &quot;cookbook&quot; procedures for Lagrange and K-T methods were great. I especially admired the fact that the author actually mentioned how these procedures could fail to yield an optimized value. This is worthwhile in today's university mathematics where one is simply taught to plug numbers into formulae and algorithms to get the desired answer. The book also slants towards optimization problems in economic theory as well as other disciplines. Finally, in an age when textbooks can easily run over $100, it was nice to see this book, filled with a wealth of information, so moderately priced."},{"Title":"A First Course in Optimization Theory","review":"This is an excellent book for anybody interested in non-linear optimization within economics framework. The book is self-contained and includes all the basic theory one needs to know to understand optimization. To my knowledge, this is the only book merging non-linear optimization with game theory and such concepts as supermodularity and parametric monotonicity."},{"Title":"A First Course in Optimization Theory","review":"I'm a applied mathematician with over 40 quarter hours of theoretical math under my belt, and frankly I feel this book would be rough going for anyone who does not have a rigid math theory background. In other words, if you're not a graduate student or a theoretical practioner in the field of optimization, this is NOT the book for you (most likely). But I also have two other problems with this book.First, it is touted to have numerious examples of both theory and applications. Theory, as I mentioned above, it has in abundance. But it is very thin on practical applications.Second, this book has numerious problems at the ends of the chapters WITH NONE OF THEM WORKED OUT! Frankly, I'm not really interested in paying almost $30 for a paperback book that is unfinished.Perhaps I was expecting much more than what I got after reading the glowing reviews above; and in hindsight, I really should have paid more attention to the title as &quot;Theory&quot; is indeed the operative word. My irritation is not in the book itself, as the author states in his forward that he is writing a book aimed the graduate school set; but is aimed at the reviewers above which led me to think that this text was much wider based than it turned out to be."},{"Title":"A First Course in Optimization Theory","review":"A first course in Optimization theory - that is what the book is. The target audience is those who are inetersted in the theory of optimization. Some familiarity with Mathematical Analysis and Matrix Algebra would be helpful; however the first chapter lays the mathematical foundation and a careful reading would enable the reader to tackle the rest of the book.Previous reviews have made a chapter by chapter analysis of the book and hence I will just highlight some of the things I liked about the approach used by the author. Whenever a theorem is stated different examples are given to emphasize the points. For example when stating the Lagrange Theorem and Kuhn-Tucker theorem the author points out when the theorems fail and gives detailed examples to illustrate the ideas. The author often draws from examples in finance to illustrate the practical importance of the theory. The one I liked most was how a cost minimization problem was solved by reducing the solution space to a compact space and then applying the Weierstrass theorem. The author also shows how some of the &quot;cookbook&quot; procedures really work and warns the readers against potential pitfalls in applying such procedures. If you are planning to study optimization theory and are looking for a good entry point into the subject this book is for you."},{"Title":"A First Course in Optimization Theory","review":"glaring mistakes all over the book.i've found at least 3 wrong definition of convexity in the book. some contradicing within a paragraph. wow do some proof reading?along with wrong definition for implicit function theorem in chapter 1 - missing minus sign in front.and look at page where they talk about epigraph and subgraph. and ... you get the point.i can't believe it has such basic definitions wrong.not to mention uncommon notations used for some analysis...not happy with the book.for optimization stick with Stephen Boyd, Bertsekas, or Luenberger.and for applying optimization tech to economics get simon, and blume2 stars might not seem a big deal to you but look at my rating history.i rarely go under 4 stars.stay away from this book. although if the author fixes those deluge of stupid mathematical mistakes this book has a potential to be 5 stars."},{"Title":"A First Course in Optimization Theory","review":"Excellent introduction to optimization techniques with a special emphasis to induce the student to an active and positive attitude towards the rigoruous demonstration of every proposition behind theorems and economic models.This is not a book for beginners, but an excellent one that helps to develop the abilities required to understand modern textbooks and papers on micro and macroeconomics.With an excellent presentation, and interesting end-of-chapter exercises, this book cannot be out of every economist's toolbox."},{"Title":"A First Course in Optimization Theory","review":"I am a student at Penn econ.

I agree that it makes a wonderful reference if this is material one has already learned elsewhere, packing a multitude of topics into a fairly compact space. This is absolutely not, however, suitable for a \\"first course\\" in anything. I have seen several other reviews praising its detail and scope, but to a beginner or intermediate student on the subject, it fails its objective spectacularly. Jargon abound, purely mathematical explanations throughout without plain-English translations vital for a beginner's understanding, and a very nasty habit of leaving plenty of details \\"as an exercise\\" without adequate explanation on how to approach the problems, let alone find a solution.Any professors considering this text for their course should look elsewhere, asking students to purchase two texts with the ideas clearly and plainly laid out is a much better use to the audience this book is directed toward than this.However, I did give it a grace star because it certainly is a nice text to have handy as a reference for higher-level studies, once one is already familiar and fairly comfortable with the ideas contained within."},{"Title":"A First Course in Optimization Theory","review":"If you are studying Economics or Applied Mathematics, especially in Operations and Information Management, this book is an great overview of what you should master in order to engage interesting problems."},{"Title":"A First Course in Optimization Theory","review":"If you're a graduate student in economics, or perhaps computer science, buy this book as soon as possible.

This book succeeds in making these abstract mathematical procedures feel tangible and intuitive, defining them rigorously, explaining their usefulness and providing examples.

The story was pretty good, but not great. I don't think I have read any of Alfred Dugan's other books, so I am not sure if he writes this way in all of his books, but his style of writing was vaguely reminiscent of Anna Comnena's \\"Alexiad\\". However, I could not quite figure out what the title had to do with the story since the main female character was not held for ransom, although her husband was.Anyway, there aren't a lot of historical novels out there that are set in the Byzantine Empire, but this one was wonderfully accurate when compared to a couple of others that I have recently read, Michael Ennis' laughably stupid \\"Byzantium\\" and Cecelia Holland's \\"Belt of Gold\\" which was ok (way better than \\"Byzantium\\") but not as good as this."},{"Title":"The lady for ransom","review":"I do like Alfred Duggan. This one is about a Norman knight Roussel de Balliol serving as a mercenary in Constantinople. I very good book tightly written as ever by Duggan with no superfluous writing but leaving no doubts to the imagination about the conditions being described."},{"Title":"The lady for ransom","review":"This was one of Alfred Duggan's early historical novels and was first published in 1953. It tells the story of Roussel de Bailleul (Balliol being the anglicised form of the place he came from and where his family had its fief in Normandy). Roussel was a historical character and younger son and a knight, who like thousands of others across France, Flanders and Germany, had to either make a living for himself by hiring his sword or enter religious orders and become a monk. Some did both, starting by being mercenaries before retiring to a monastery in their old age, in particular when they had not succeeded in carving out a fief and building a castle for themselves. So Roussel became a mercenary and a captain, leading his own war band and seeking armed service from those that would employ him. Despite being generally presented as a Norman (there are two places in Normandy to bear the name of Bailleul), he may also have been a Frank (or more accurately a Flemish, since there is also another place called Bailleul in the North of France), although this is much less likely.Duggan chose to have Roussel's story told by Roger, his squire, a fictitious character who chose to retire from the world and become a monk after the death of his beloved lord. Roger tells his story to a bunch of young Norman knights in Southern Italy as these are about to embark for the Byzantine Empire. These are part of Bohemond's army and of the Frist Crusade, some 20 years after the events that Roger tells. Apart from telling the glorious deeds of Roussel, their predecessor who, after fighting with Roger of Hauteville in Sicily went to Byzantium and fought for the Emperor against the Turks, the story is also the occasion for these young knights to learn about the fabulous and threatened Byzantine Empire, of which they knew little.At the time of its publication, Duggan's novel was well-researched and he made use of all the available primary sources, whether the Norman ones (and Geoffrey Malaterra in particular) or the Byzantines ones (Attaliates, Nicephoros Bryennios, grandson of the character in the novel who bears the same name, and Anna Komnena, daughter of the emperor Alexis Komnene and wide of the historian and general Nicephoros Bryennios). His concise historical note, where he indicates the choices he has made and the elements of fiction that he has introduced, is in itself quite remarkable. While Roger the (narrator), and the very name of Roussel's wife (Mathilda in the novel) are made up, just like the personalities of Roussel's children, we do know that Roussel's wife paid his ransom after his first capture, and that he had offspring.Some elements included in the novel show the book's age. For instance, the Normans (or, more generally the Franks) at the time did not distinguish between knights and mounted sergeants at the time. They were all \\"milites\\" during the 11th and early 12th century. The social distinction between the two, and the heavy warhorse which are alluded to in the book as being characteristic of the Franks and Normans (the destriers) would only appear around 1150.There are a number of other similar points that can be made. However, to the extent that the story is told by Roger, a half-Norman and half-Greek from Apulia (Southern Italy), what could otherwise appear as glitches can pass to a large extent as gaps in the knowledge of the story-teller or as his misunderstanding of some traits of Byzantine civilisation which were unfamiliar to him. Having the story told by Roger and the events seen through his eyes turns out to be one of the book's main strength, and probably also one of the elements which have allowed this novel to largely withstand the test of time. Some elements, however, cannot quite be explained away, such as having the population of Southern Italy speaking \\"Italian\\". They would in fact have spoken Lombard, or various dialects derived from Latin, or Greek, or (Norman) French for the Normans, but there was no such language as \\"Italian\\" at the time. However, most readers will probably not notice and, among the few that will, most will not mind or care too much (me included) about this and a few other glitches.This book also exhibits another quality. By describing Roussel as a charismatic leader in the way he does and through the eyes of his devoted squire, Duggan manages to make what would have otherwise been a ruthless mercenary captain into a rather sympathetic and almost honourable but flawed and ultimately unsuccessful character. The real Roussel was very probably not as likeable but the way Duggan has presented him makes the reader empathise with him and feel almost sorry for him. No mean feat in itself, and another reason for liking this book, re-reading it and very much enjoying it.Accordingly, this book turned out to still be worth about four stars, despite it age and its glitches."},{"Title":"Face of the American Dream: Barbie Doll 1959-1971","review":"Wonderful and extensive retrospect of fashion, and makeup trends of the 1960's, and how Barbie was able to keep up with these trends.

It also offers the non collector the opportunity to understand what motivates a collector. There are so many reasons to collect, reminders of the past and desires for the future. This book helps to put it all in perspective. If people used this book to guide their collecting, we'd all be much more selective."},{"Title":"Face of the American Dream: Barbie Doll 1959-1971","review":"This book is really a &quot;fluff&quot; version of the Barbie collector books. It doesn't have price guides, it doesn't list all the markings for the correct bodies, etc. However, what it does have is gorgeous up-close photos of mint vintage dolls. Whenever I'm having a doll restored, this is the book I turn to for excellent examples. I color copy the pages and send them to my restorationist. It shows many dolls of the same line so you can see and compare hair colors, make-up, etc. I highly recommend it to any Barbie collector.

We've seen the forensically photographed doll priceguides. What we haven't seen, until now, was a book whose visual language made the dolls and fashions come to life in a way that conjures the imaginary world that Barbie seemed to live in. If you know someone who doesn't &quot;get&quot; Barbie collecting, show them this book. It's so lovingly assembled that even the skeptic is forced to look at the subject through a child's eyes. And yet it's so well researched and informative, the discriminating adult collector can find an answer to virtually any question. Varaste's knowledge about transitional dolls and their differences, for example, was especially helpful. The narrative is so artful and engaging, you don't even realize how much your're learning! The photos are fabulously fun and imaginative; Varaste isn't afraid to see the humor in our hopeless love for Barbie. Visually, he knows what we want and he delivers! Hands down the best book on the subject of Miss B. We can only hope for a sequel!"},{"Title":"Face of the American Dream: Barbie Doll 1959-1971","review":"Varaste's &quot;The Face of the American Dream&quot; is simply fantastic. So many Barbie books simply photograph the fashions and give current prices. Chris takes the subject far deeper than anything I've ever read, both sociologically and in terms of the minute variations within the Barbie doll. It is an absolute feast for the eyes of the collector or non-collector and a treasure trove of information for the collector. It is really awesome! As another reviewer wrote, I would love to see Chris tackle the Mod era in more depth.

Television producer/photographer Christopher Varaste takes us back to the 1960s when Barbie was on the rise embodying the face, figure and styles of that decade.Turning the pages of this delightful and informative album is a nostalgic retro look at the way we were - when frosted lipstick was the rage, of course, Barbie wore it. Her golden hair was seen swinging in a bobbing pony tail or poufed into a Bubble Cut.As women grew more independent so did Barbie. She entered the job market as a career girl (well dressed, of course), zipped around town in a peony pink roadster, became an American Airlines stewardess, and even soared into space.

All of the trememendous societal upheavals of the 60's had an effect in how Barbie evolved. Advertising and make-up in the real world influenced Mattel's designs for Barbie.Always one step ahead of the social climate, Mattel's Barbie remains more than a toy.

Complete with hundreds of photographs (mostly black and white), the book provides an easy-to-read history of Bear teams. While the original book covered seasons through the late 1970s, it was reprinted with a new foreward by Mike Ditka, with color photographs of the 1985 season, and of course, a few more years of season-by-season coverage of the Monsters of the Midway. I learned more about the NFL's history by &quot;reading&quot; this book than I did in 20 years of avidly watching 6 games per week, ESPN, and NFL Films. If you can't imagine a young, struggling George Halas trying to make pro football work in the big city, or you don't remember a time when winning an NFL championship was a 3rd page story, even in the city that won the game 73-0, then this book will enlighten you tremendously."},{"Title":"Bob Miller's Basic Math and Pre-Algebra for the Clueless","review":"I bought this book to help me brush up on the algebra I had in college. The fact that it's for the clueless, I figured I had half a chance to recall what I already thought I knew but needed to brush up on. The writer reminded me of my college professor. The math was easy to him, but he explained it as if it were easy to the reader as well. He seemed to have forgotten I was clueless. The other problem was the writer explained procedures for figuring out a problem but omitt a step until you came across an example where that omitted information would have been helpful. After I got the problem wrong, then the omitted information would be revealed. The writer kept me a step or two behind and therefore confused as I spent most of my time trying to figure out how the correct answer was determined insted of being taught how to arrive at the correct answer.

The author states that it's &quot;written for those who want to get a jump on algebra and for those returning to school, perhaps after a long time&quot;. I fall into the latter category, but the book isn't particularly helpful to me. The presentation seems silly (or annoying, as the reviewer below says) and lacking.The author states, &quot;In order to get maximum benefit from this book, you must practice. Do many exercises until you are very good with each of the skills.&quot; There are no exercises in the book, however, for the student to do. Each concept is explained with several problems and solutions as examples, but there are no separate problems for students to solve on their own.The author states that his &quot;practical dream is to have someone sponsor a math series from prealgebra through calculus so everyone in our country will be able to think well and keep our country number one forever.&quot; If this book is an example of thinking well, our country is in deep trouble.

I don't know if this was meant to be cute or what, but it is just...annoying.Additionally, for a book that is obviously designed for those of us who are clueless about algebra, Mr Miller would often start off explaining new topics by stating something to the effect that he once thought this topic was hard, but now he doesn't nor do his students, so the reader should do super well.

I primarily study Goju Ryu, an Okinawan form of karate that, while somewhat influenced by Chinese kung fu historically, is much closer to Japanese martial arts then it is to any of the Chinese styles. Regardless, while the terminology is a little different, the principles and techniques herein are directly applicable to my art as well kung fu, aikido, jujitsu, and many others.Chin Na is the art of controlling an opponent, a practical and important skill. It is relevant to striking arts as well as grappling arts. Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming covers joint locking, vein/artery sealing, muscle dividing, and bone displacing in a comprehensive and easy to understand manner. His vast experience really shines throughout this outstanding work. He also offers an excellent series of exercises for strengthening the joints to protect them from damage as you integrate these techniques into your training regimen.Applications include finger, wrist, elbow, shoulder, neck, waist, and leg manipulations, along with muscle grabbing and cavity press (pressure point) techniques. He also discusses how to use Chin Na in a real fight, including defense against knives, kicks, and punches. One of the most unique and important aspects of this book is the section on injury treatment which covers joint, ligament, cartilage, muscle, and tendon injuries, artery, capillary, as well as organ ruptures, sealed breath veins/artery in the neck, and even \\"stagnant\\" chi (ki). This section isn't particularly long but it is very insightful. There is also an appendix on Chinese herbs.Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming is a prolific author as well as one of the world's foremost kung fu experts. Highly skilled in Shaolin White Crane (Bai He), Shaolin Long Fist (Changquan), and Taijiquan and other forms, he has spent more than thirty years teaching his art to others. He has published 35 books and 75 videos on the martial arts. Dr. Yang is currently president of Yang's Oriental Arts Association headquartered in Boston, MA.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction"},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructor's Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"This book provides a good reference for Chin-Na, the art of seizing and holding. Most of the techniques that appear in this book appear to come from Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming's White Crane background.Chin-Na can be deceptively difficult to understand and implement, since what makes a technique successful is the solid body mechanics behind it, and that only comes after years of practice. Additionally, I believe that books are not a good primary learning method for martial arts, so to get the most from this book, plan on attending a seminar or finding a good local school.Having said that, Dr. Yang's material is the best reference I've seen on the subject."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructor's Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"This is a good introductory work with a useful organization scheme since it is done by areas of the body.The methods are simplified, but then it would probably be impossible to do a book on truly complex Chin Na techniques. For that you would probably need a video.Nevetheless, I am a big believer in using the simplest, most effective techniques. The way to use a book like this, is to learn the most applicable, versatile techniques, perhaps no more than a couple of dozen or so (unless Chin Na is a specialty of yours). Remember, in the 1400s even a great Jiu-Jitsu master might only know a few moves--but he could apply them to an amazing variety of situations with great speed and effectiveness.Although Chin Na is one of my specialties, I think the same thing applies to the other grappling arts, Chin Na and Aikido."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructor's Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"I hate giving five stars to a book on just one subject, but this one deserves it. It covers the principles of chin-na in great detail first, then goes into about every possable joint technique imaginable. This is mostly stand-up stuff, so it isn't really geared towards MMA, though it could be useful. Rather, this is about controling your opponent in a stand-up situation, and shows techniques applied both offensivley and defensively. In addition, at the end of every technique, an escape or counter is shown. Also covered are training methods for gripping/forearm power, speed in seizing, some footwork, and stretching out the ligaments. But standing submissions aren't the only techniques shown. Most of Dr. Yang's &quot;Leg Chin Na&quot; techniques are takedowns, and a lot of the &quot;Cavity Press&quot; stuff is strikes to pressure points. The author also covers basic first-aid principles of injuries commonly caused by chin-na. The only detraction I have to make was that I wish the chapter on using chin-na in a fight was more extensive. This book was easy to follow, and someone with no experiance with grappling could learn something. I would say it is most useful for someone interested in minimum-damage self defense, like a cop or bouncer, but it's a good reference for any martial artist. A note on the author: Yang, Jwing-Ming is, to me, the best author when it comes to practicle Chinese martial arts. I am a big fan of Dr. Yang's books, but until I read a better one, I will consider this his masterpiece."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructor's Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"A very complete follow up to Dr. Yang's first book, &quot;Shaolin Chin Na: The Seizing Art of Kung Fu&quot;, I consider this manual to be complex enough that it will probably be best understood by peole who have studied a grappling/locking art of some sort for at least a year (Kuk Sool, Jujutsu, Shuai Jiao). Like most of Yang's other books, there is so much information here it borders on being exhaustive...and we all know that is not a bad thing!Yang explains the principles of Chin Na, and builds upon this foundation by offering strengthening exercises for joints which often bear the brunt of punishment in this type of training. His treatment of techniques is thourough. Those with the patience to read this manual and practice the locking and siezing techniques contained within will undoubtedly gain further insight to the workings of their (respective) arts. Yang also offers an important chapter (page 168) on correcting injuries sustained in practice, in addition to six special herbal formulas for martial arts training (bruise remedies, dit Da Jau, etc.) at the end of the volume (page 185)."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructor's Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"Comprehensive review. However, like this author's other books, hard to read. Best used as a reference for someone with martial arts experience, or when practicing with a partner. To really gain competence in this area, it is necessary to have a teacher.

It also contains counters."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructor's Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"I bought this book a couple months ago and I was pretty impressed. Not only does it cover plenty of Chin Na techniques (and even the rarer finger chin na), but also counters for them. Of course these counters are not set and once an understanding of chin na and human anatomy is understood one can employ various different methods for both grappling and countering. Also, he explains alot of the Dim Mak methods and techniques (not in great detail as it is one of the most dangerous aspects of advanced kung fu), but just enough so you know whats out there and how dangerous it is, including the rupturing of the internal organs (or even death) through concentrated chi strikes with fingers. He also shows some cavity grabs.This is not every Chin Na technique imaginable as someone said, In fact the only con of the book is that Ming mostly shows (if not all) White crane Chin Na, which is why there is so much complicated coiling in his pictures and techniques he shows. They are not always very practical and should not even be practiced until one has been taught the funndamentals of SHaolin Chin Na by a qualified instructor. I dont know about the practical applications book (which I saw, and it is alot thicker and has ALOT more than this one), but there are many different more practical styles of Chin Na. Most notable and VERY powerful are the Eagle Claw( which is pretty much all Chin Na) and Tiger Claw. Nevertheless, this is one of the only books like this, and Ming is an amazing kung fu practicioner."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructor's Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"Bob SpearPublisher and Chief ReviewerHeartland ReviewsThe author, Dr. Yang, a physicist with a doctorate from Purdue University, one of the tougher engineering schools in the nation, is also considered one of the top trainers and theoreticians of Chinese martial arts in the world. An author of over thirty books, Inside Kung Fu Magazine voted him as one of the ten people who have made the greatest impact on the martial arts in the past 100 years. He brings all his expertise to his latest book on the Chinese grappling and nerve pressure point martial art of Chin Na. This style is the ancestor of Japanese Jujitsu and Aikido, as well as the Korean art of Hapkido.The author's scientific education comes to the forefront of his technique presentations and explanations. This is a book for true aficionados, those who have delved deeply into the arts and yet have more to learn.

For those not familiar with Chin Na, it is one of the four major fighting categories in Chinese martial arts. The four categories are kicking, striking, wrestling, and seize-controlling. Chin Na can be called the art of seize and control, and it consists of various joint locking techniques, as well as different grabbing, pressing, and striking.Just like joint locks are only a portion of the Hapkido curriculum I teach, Chin Na is only a portion of Chinese arts. With that said, the concepts and techniques can be learned and incorporated into other styles, especially those that are already familiar with locking techniques such as practitioners of Hapkido, Aikido, Jujitsu, and so forth. Therefore, this book can benefit many martial artists, not just those who study Chinese arts. If your style does not include locking type techniques, Chin Na resources, including this book, can assist you in rounding out your program.After a short Foreword and two short Prefaces (original and new one for second edition), there is a general introduction to Chin Na and the basic principles. Next comes a chapter that focuses on fundamental training. A variety of exercises are illustrated and explained that will enable a practitioner to better perform Chin Na techniques.The next few chapters are divided by the type of Chin Na explained in them. They consist of Finger Chin Na; Wrist Chin Na; Elbow Chin Na; Shoulder, Neck and Waist Chin Na, Leg Chin Na; Muscle Grabbing Chin Na; Cavity Press; and then a short chapter on using Chin Na in a fight, and another on the treatment of injuries. The book then concludes with a two-paragraph conclusion and several appendixes.There are numerous techniques in this book (The back cover says over 150), and each one has a description of how to do the technique, with accompanying photographs, the principle behind the technique pointed out, and a description with photos of an escape and counter to the technique. I especially liked that these escapes and counters were included. I felt these added much value to the collection of information, especially as an instructor resource. The pictures are black and white, and sometimes a little difficult to fully discern what is being done. If you are apt at joint locking techniques, you can most likely figure it out. However, if you are a novice, you might have a little trouble with some of them. To remedy this, you could pick up Dr. Yang's DVDs to see the techniques performed. In fact, I'd encourage anyone to complete their Chin Na resource library by including both the books and DVDs Dr. Yang has put out. Using them together make for a much better learning experience.The chapter on using Chin Na in a fight is pretty short. There are two pages of good concepts, and then a small sampling of concepts and techniques illustrated with photographs. Dr. Yang admits this is just a tiny sample, but points out that he included more in his book \\"Comprehensive Applications of Shaolin Chin Na.\\" I have not read that book yet, but it is on my list. Like the applications chapter, the treatment of injuries chapter is also short. You won't be a competent healer from this chapter, but it gives some general information and hopefully peaks your interest to further your study in the healing arts as well as the fighting arts. They go hand in hand.Overall, this is an exceptional manual to help a person learn Chin Na, and I recommend it highly, as I do all of Dr. Yang's cannon of Chin Na resources.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of the Lock On Joint Locking Essentials series."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructor's Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"This is THE best book on Chin Na.

No matter which style you practice, joint locks and submission holds can be easily incorporated, and I would argue could make the difference if you are ever involved in a real conflict. Where these skills are often not taught, it may be up to you to seek them out and this is a great introduction. If you're going to start practicing Chin Na, my only advice, and please heed it: be soft and take it easy. I'm serious, this stuff is the real deal and highly effective. If you use too much force you will cause real and lasting injuries. Also highly recommended are Dr. Yang's complementary Chin Na DVDs, for exampleAdvanced Practical Chin Na In Depth: YMAA Seminar Serieswhere you can see the fluid nature of these moves in action."},{"Title":"Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na: Instructor's Manual for All Martial Styles","review":"I have taken a few self defense classes and this book contains some familiar moves.

However as the author himself points out there is a great depth of additional knowledge in Chin Na which he could not include in that book, and he therefore recommended picking up his other Chin Na books to deepen the reader's understanding of Chin Na. This book does an excellent job doing just that. Regardless of which style of martial you practice the biomechanical principles remain the same and most, if not all, can easily be adapted for your style. My only issue with YMAA publications is that my personal budget is limited and their books are all a bit pricey, but I can definitely say that this book is worth the price."},{"Title":"Oxford Children's History: Earliest Times to the Stuarts","review":"This is the first of two volumes that cover the history of Britain from the Celts to the modern age.

In a way it was bad luck for Orson Welles that the man he wound up attacking in his masterpiece CITIZEN KANE was one of the very few men with the power to avenge himself so thoroughly. For Hearst's tentacles were everywhere. John Evangelist Walsh, a veteran of history's noirish back alleys, has written interesting books before on the treason of Major Andre and the sex life of Emily Dickinson. Hearst apparently saw Welles as a kind of Major Andre and CITIZEN KANE as an attack on everything America holds dear. Incidentally, it was a slanderous, even misogynistic portrait of the talented soubrette Marion Davies, Hearst's girlfriend of many years' standing and practically his \\"other wife.\\"Almost a \\"third wife\\" was Hearst's hatchet woman--the columnist Louella Parsons who had a contract with Hearst's newspapers and a mission to destroy Orson Welles. Quickly RKO lost faith in their erstwhile \\"wonder boy\\" Welles and managed to sabotage his projects THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS and IT'S ALL TRUE, along with several others he had planned, including the thriller SMILER WITH THE KNIFE and a proposed movie version of the Joseph Conrad novella HEART OF DARKNESS. Walsh is the kind of writer who will do just about anything to advance his own thesis, but here he writes crisply and cleanly about the battle between two men who were both, in different ways, quite megalomaniacal. Though the verdict is still out about who was right and who was wrong, CITIZEN KANE still remains one of the towering pinnacles of world cinema; however, the reputation of the slandered Marion Davies has emerged from the Stygian gloom into which KANE had plunged it, and she has rebounded cheerfully into the light of critical regard."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"First of series of children's books perfect for introducing young children to stories and eventually to reading on their own."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"Babar the elephant is born to loving mother and lives happily in the forest with her until she is killed by a wicked hunter. On fleeing from the hunter, he finds himself in a city. When he sees the people there are wearing clothes he wishes that he could do the same, and an empathetic Old Lady buys him a fine suit and takes him home. He lives with her until two of his runaway cousins cross his path. When he returns them to the forest he decides to stay, and the elephants choose him as their king.This unusual story combines the drama of bereavement with comedic humor. Young children will enjoy the way Babar takes on human characteristics as he puts on his suit, and spreads the human influence of civilization to the entire elephant \\"people.\\" Although he is shown grieving for the life he has lost, the evil that brought about his orphanhood is counterbalanced by the Old Lady's kindness, and his story is suffused with expectant hope. His traumatic bereavement remains a part of him, but it does not prevent him from bettering himself, helping others, marrying Celeste, and building a royal family together.While some critics have objected to what they interpret as sexist and colonialist undercurrents [...], I think the Babar series is best understood as an innocent and deliciously lighthearted fantasy, at the heart of which exists a stable, joyful family. It's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"...a child's (or adult's) introduction to the wonderful world of Babar.

Once a sweet waif of an elephant (zut alors, a waif elephant!), you take up with an older *human* woman who wraps your trunk around her silver spoon, desecrating your innocence in the process. No more everyman (er,elephant), no more life in the slow lane, now it's class-conscious, pin-stripped shirts and loose-morals (you *did* marry cousin Celeste). But that's okay, don't worry that my older, more suspicious eyes see you differently. When I sit in the rocker and tell my son of you I remember the good ole carefree days . . . your loveable bungling, the anticipation of adventure, all the places you took me in my mind. By the way, we decorated my son's room in homage to you, my Babar!"},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"From the beautiful illustrations, to the charming characters, everything about Babar reminds you of a time when we took the intelligence of our children seriously. The first thing anyone who grew-up on more modern fare will notice is the delightful and literate prose. The reason children could speak latin by 5th grade 80 years ago, was that they weren't condescended-to; and Babar doesn't either. You won't get the modern \\"barney-speak\\" here, this generation had more confidence in your children, believe me. Although the prose may be too difficult for the average 5 or 6 yr-old to read on their own, they will have no difficulty at all in understanding it perfectly when read to them. Now my 5 yr-old daughter knows what a \\"perambulator\\" is, you won't get that from the Wiggles. As far as the complaints in regard to \\"scariness\\", all I can say is, if this is scary because Babar's mother is killed by a hunter, then you'd better take Bambi, The Lion King and close to all of the fairy tales off of the reading list as well. The subject is handled compassionately and tastefully. Of course I want to sheild my child from horrific content, but if we refuse to gently ease them in to life's realities, such as the loss of loved-ones, then their entertainment turns from safe into vacuous pretty quickly. I won't even waste bandwidth on the silly, leftist nonsense regarding imperialism. There is no political content here, subtle or otherwise. If you really want the kind of western culture \\"self-flagellation\\" that these aging hippies seem to thrive on, try Disney's Pocahontas, or a Cartoon version of The Life of Che Guevara. Assume the best of your kids and try the Babar series, particularly the older ones."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"Some children's books can be read over and over again, and Jean De Brunhoff's book about Babar, the little elephant is among them.The copy we have in our house were purchasted in 1988 and has survived 4 kids.

The very sad part for a six year old is the beginning where Babar's mother dies and Babar runs away. But Babar is lucky and meets an old lady who takes care of him. And the joy is always big in the end when Babar meets his childhood friends and cousins again in the end of the books. And even becomes a king and marries his cousin Celeste.The book was written in 1939, but is still well worth reading for any child, and should be part of every lucky child's book collection.

Even so, the pictures moved me even before I could read the stories by myself. I remember developing quite a passion for elephants from the story of Babar, and learning about the illegal poaching of these great creatures in elementary school.

It is kind of bizarre, so keep in mind that it was written in the 1930's. First, Babar's mother is killed, as was the fate of most classic animal stories. Then, he decides to become more like men, HOW ODD! He wears clothes and walks on his back legs. Any time any of the elephants in this book wear clothes, they gain the instant ability to walk on their hind legs. When he returns to the elephants, he is crowned king, which is unlikely since elephants are matriarchal (they are led by females and grown males are banned from the group except during mating times). Then he marries his cousin, and they live happily ever after. In the spirit of Curious George, who was kidnapped from his home and forced to conform to human ways, this is a charming but very out-dated tale."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"I am 14, and I still like Babar.

I was stunned by how much of the dialogue and how many of the pictures I remembered. This book is a reasure that you and your children will share for years to come.

Of course, there were four of us, aged three to eight, repeatedly reading about this despicable deed, and unfailingly shocked to tears. But on the next page, the city was so much like the one which roared across our windows. The younger amongst us would not have found it extraordinary to come across an elephant in Paris, and the older ones knew that there was a direct way from our native city to the forest where, as elephants, we did belong.

Its a poignant, charming book that warms my heart. I hope every child reads it"},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"At age 6, I knew something about this book wasn't right. I hated having to \\"dress up,\\" and when I read that Babar is made \\"king of the elephants\\" on the basis of his \\"fine clothes,\\" I felt uneasy. Why does one have to wear a shirt and tie just to be a decent human being? Can't people be appreciated if they don't wear suits? Can't we be accepted as we are? Or do we want to teach kids that we're only as good as the clothes we wear?Worse, this book is an obvious parable on how European powers tried to force their ways on Africans, Asians, and Pacific peoples. The aboriginal people of Africa, for instance, had to learn French and English, and had to dress in European clothes, even though the clothes were expensive and the heat would've been stifling. The colonial masters would introduce these people to \\"civilized clothing\\" under the guise of \\"moral education.\\" But the real reason was that they could create a bigger market for their manufactured goods if they persuaded Africans to wear shirts and ties!If you are an educator or parent, DO NOT read this book to children, and if you can, have it removed from the school library. It sets a terrible example for the children. Instead, read them \\"The Sneeches\\" by Dr. Seuss. It shows what really happens when you try to succeed based on your appearance alone!"},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"I second what one of the reviewers said about the imperialistic propaganda.My husband recalled reading this book as a child, so when my mother-in-law got it for my daughter, I was delighted. So, I read it today for the first time and was utterly horrified at the blatant propaganda in it! Wow, it scares me to think that the book is a classic and that a few generations grew up reading it! I'm returning it to the nearest used book store. I'm sure my daughter is too young to pick up on the offensive things as I do, but there is tons of kind and cute literature for children out there, so why bother reading this (on a personal note, I did not find the book either charming or delightful, but rather tedious and boring, offensive things aside)?"},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"We received this book as a gift for our 3 yr old. I read it to her and it was really disturbing. Other reviews have noted that it must be read \\"in context\\" as far as the time it was written. I disagree - when was a child's viewing a mother's brutal murder (Babar seeing his mother being shot before his eyes) ever appropriate fare for a little child? Then, Babar has to run for his life and later on in the book, there is another death. Also, Babar is surprised when his cousins have no clothes - this is upsetting to him. I find it offensive - elephants don't need to be like people - they don't need clothes. I don't see the charm in this book at all. I don't see the attraction. One thing -- Babar marrying his cousin is the one thing that is not shocking - its not like incest, like brother and sister or like they grew up together -- people have been marrying cousins for thousands of years - up until at least the beginning of this century - hardly immoral."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"Thank God for the French speakers of the world. Were it not for them, Babar might not have ever been created and we would have to live in a wretched Babar-less world. As it is, however, we are blessed to have this delightful story at our fingertips at any time. The story of Babar was originally published in 1933, and it has stood the test of time with dignity and flair.The story of Babar is simple. After his mother is shot by a cruel hunter, the little elephant runs away to a metropolitan city. Once there, he is taken under the wing of a kindly older lady. Babar then proceeds to become the greatest dandy of children's literature today. Here is the section I love the most:\\"Babar then buys himself: A shirt with a collar and tie, a suit of a becoming shade of green, then a handsome derby hat, and also shoes with spats\\".Contrary to popular thought, an elephant in spats is the most dignified thing in the world. With these purchases Babar has transformed himself from rural rube to the original metrosexual. He becomes cultured, learning the rudimentary aspects of human civilization while regaling party guests with his tales of the forest (note his pin-striped pants and casual dinner jacket). Eventually Babar is lured back to his jungle home and is swiftly crowned King of the elephants.The 1933 setting in which Babar acclimatizes himself has grown more charming over the years. And most remarkably? Most older picture books contain at least one racial stereotype somewhere in the midst of a picture. Not so our darling \\"Babar\\". I feel safe in saying that you might search through any future adventure of the winsome elephant and not stumble across a single picture or piece of writing that causes you a twenty-first century gasp of disgust. This isn't to say that there aren't some rather peculiar dated aspects to the book. I read this book as a child and had a vivid visceral memory return to me when I saw the sickly state of the former King of the elephants who passed away after eating a bad mushroom. That is a grotesquerie unknown to the kiddies today. But all in all, \\"Babar\\" is without fault. Certainly he's the essence of capitalism. One might believe the elephants crown him king as much for his pretty red convertible as for his brains. But Babar is still a unique and moving tale that will continue to entertain the masses of children for years and years to come."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"Ah, to be King of the Elephants. Not only do you get to live in the palace in Celesteville, but you also get to rewrite your life story. In the original books, Babar was an ordinary elephant who was orphaned at a young age and went to seek his fortune in the city before he returned and was chosen to be king. In the newer video series that my kids brought home from the library the other day, Babar recounts his adventures as a young prince growing up in the palace. And they say elephants never forget!The original story is fairly simple. After a hunter kills his mother, Babar runs away until he comes to a city. As luck would have it, one of the first people he meets is a lady who loves to spend money on young elephants. Soon Babar has a dashing new wardrobe, a private tutor, and elegant friends. Life would be wonderful if he weren't so homesick. When his two cousins show up, Babar decides to go back home with them. The elders of the elephant herd decide that Babar, with his civilized ways, should become their king.There's a school of thought that criticizes the Babar stories as colonialist. But then, most of children's literature written before the 1970s isn't exactly politically correct, is it? Do you tell your children that Babar is a tool of the imperialist establishment, or do you point out what a wonderful culture the elephants built when they banded together to build Celesteville, their capital city? Or do you just read the stories for pure enjoyment?"},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"My children adored this book from a very early age due to the charm of the text and the pictures. The bon-bons, the kind old lady, the suit of clothes, all create a Parisian fantasy for the big, shy Babar. My kids are now high-schoolers and take French. I like to think it was due to those first images of the Tour Eiffel in this book! Every kid should have this delightful story. My high schoolers still enjoy a trip down memory lane once in awhile with Babar."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"This book holds my fondest memories of my childhood, a childhood that was in some ways harder than Babar's. The idea that from the loss of a parent, I could still grow up and be king was something that that gave me confidence and hope. It made me want to learn and to teach others, and it helped me know that life isn't always easy and pretty, but you have to make the most of what you are dealt. I would recommend this book for every child, but especially for those that have lost something dear to them and could use a little help imagining what is possible.The low reviews for this book are all absurd, they are great examples of how poorly we treat our kids and how little we think of them as individuals. These people think they need to hide the world from their children rather than let them see and explore it for themselves. If you feel guilty sharing this book with your kids because you can't deal with reality, then you should really reconsider breading. The world will be a better place for your restraint."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"I think the reviewers who claim this book is imperialistic, or a bad story because Babar's mother gets shot are off in their assessment of the basic story. Imperialistic? This book is about an elephant. Perhaps it is not appropriate for a 3-year-old to read about elephants being shot and dying, but my daughter is six-years-old and has no problem understanding the concept of death and that it is a tragic eventuality of life.I found this book a great entrance into a discussion with children about many topics, including France / Europe, elephant hunting and the efforts over the past 100 years to ban it, poisonous mushrooms, and the fact that the English language is a living, breathing, changing thing and a book written in the 1930s uses language different from a book written today. Yes, Babar's mother gets shot by a \\"wicked hunter\\" and the king elephant eats a mushroom and dies, and my daughter found these things very sad. So we talked about hunting elephants and why people hunted elephants and the fact that some mushrooms are poisonous, so we never eat anything growing outside without checking with mom or dad first. Personally, I am glad my daughter knows that hunting elephants was once a very popular sport and today is shunned by the majority of the world.I think that shielding our children from the past / history simply because we are uncomfortable with some aspects of it does them an injustice. To understand where we're going, we need to take a look at where we came form. I hope that this book continues to be seen as a classic in the years to come."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"I have fond memories of tracing my fingers over the elephants, enjoined trunk to tail, which walked over the back and front of our huge BABAR book. Thanks to a thoughtful baby gift from my cousin, I continue to do so, with my two sons. We enjoy finding Babar among the other little elephants and weep together over his mother\`s cruel demise. We continue to delight at his resilience and enjoy with him his first experiences with people things, and always rejoice at his good fortune and friends.While there are some problematic elements, ( as when the hunter shoots Babar\`s mother or when he marries his cousin,) please keep in mind when this was written and do not let this stop you from sharing this classic with your young ones. Parents and caretakers should seize this great opportunity to talk with them while addressing the issues. There are many positive aspects to the story and the characters, themselves. Delightfully illustrated and charmingly told, the one drawback is that the text, while charming for adults reading aloud, can be an obstacle to early readers."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"This book is about an elephant's travels after the death of his mother-- his search for independence and his return home. He takes what he has learned on his travels and offers it to the other animals in the forest. The book teaches that you can overcome aversity and make good things happen by working hard. Babar gets beyond the death of his mother by going to the city, studying and by learning how to act in society. I like the book because it is well written and has excellent pictures. It also has a strong message and teaches you a lot about the ways of the world. I also like the way that elephants are used to teach the message.---- Makki Russo (Age 7)----"},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"I love Babar as much for the pictures as for the story. When I read it again to my daughter, I turned to the page where \\"Alas, that very day, the King of the elephants had eaten a bad mushroom\\" and thought wow, I remember that! The resurging memory of that illustration is so keen in my mind, it's as if twenty-plus years had just fallen away. And next comes my very favorite line, for its old-fashioned text and neatness of phrase: \\"It poisoned him and he became ill, so ill that he died. This was a great calamity.\\" Which is not to say that the story of Babar dwells on sad things, because it doesn't. Whatever happens to Babar he deals with it with grace and moves on. Endlessly adaptable, this is an elephant who so charms the ladies that he woos and wins Celeste in just their brief drive home. The only sticking point for some parents who are encountering this book for the first time and therefore don't have their eyes all misting over with tender rememberances of their own childhood is that Babar is chosen to be the new king of the elephants because he is considered to have \\"learned so much living among men\\". If you are trying not to teach your children that humans are above and beyond all other animals, you may not want this subtle message. Overall, I think this book is wonderful and, at the end, when he and Celeste fly away in a hot air balloon to begin their honeymoon, it is clear that the story continues. This can be taken in the vein of allowing for endless opportunity of sequels but I prefer to think of it as the beginning of your child's opportunity to answer \\"what happens next\\" and regale you with their own series of stories about the adventures of Babar, the little elephant."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"Babar first came into my life at when I was 8 and in 3rd grade. I will always remember because that was the happiest grade-school year of my whole life. I was going to private school with a wonderful, sweet teacher and awesome friends. Among all the wonderful things my teacher did with us were some of the neat things in the classroom, some being her supply of story books. Naturally as an animal lover, I grabbed this book during silent reading because I needed some reading material. Tears were streaming down my face as I began to read of Babar's mother's death, and I had tears of joy as some good people take Babar in. I remember being so touched by Babar that whenever someone would mention the word &quot;elephant&quot;, I'd get all misty-eyed! It seems funny now but at the time it was quite a dielemma! I was too embarrassed to tell my mom and dad why I was upset so they were concerned! Then my mom went on a trip to California and visited a bunch of garage sales and found some patterns for making little felt Babar and friends dolls. No doubt, Babar had touched my life deep inside. My wonderful childhood was made richer."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"Enjoyed reading this series so much to our son that I am buying these books 25 years later as gifts."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"I read Babar the Elephant as a child and he made me dream of someday going to France and living a marvelous life like Babar and his family did there. Books such as &quot;Babar the Elephant&quot; truely do awake in a child a want and need to explore different worlds different than their own. I know I maybe just talking out of experience, but as a child I took every moment to enrich my little mind in something as big as dreaming of going to France to see the Effiel Tower and such. Little children need time to read this book to explore the true self inside themselves, to search out this petite explore to the world of culture as Babar does in his books. Babar is different from the Bearstein Bears; Babar is a middle class man/elephant that has a family and a house in middle class Paris and he does ordinary things as well as out of the ordinary things. Like coming to America and flying around in Hot Air Ballons and wild things such as that. A child with the need to read really should read &quot;Babar the Elephant&quot; and all his great adventures. Great imaginations, especially young ones shouldn't go to waste let them dream of different lives in a different country--because dreams really can come true somday---I went to France when I was finally 17 years old--three whole years ago.

I read it to my boys, and now my grandchildren have met the gentle, bemused, wise elephant, his wife Celeste, the old lady, and the little elephants Flora, Pom and Arthur. I confidently assume I'll be reading Babar to great-grandkids one day. As in so many animal stories, there's the loss of a parent, followed by the assumption of responsibilities and rank. Babar is different, however. Just look at the insouciant way he wears his crown. As a small child, a half-century ago, I liked the endpapers best, with the elephant parade: nose to tail. As an adult, I appreciate the deadpan tone of the narrative as Babar learns how to rule. His creator has given him the correct dignified posture to grace his human clothing. People with too much time on their hands have offered literary criticism of this series. Children know better, and simply enjoy the stories and pictures."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"I remembered how much I loved Babar growing up so I thought I'd get it for my 5 yr old and 19 month old.

But take time out to re-read Babar as an adult -use your adult judgement, apply your morals and beliefs to this book. You will not need to dig very deep to see that this story is based on unabashed imperialism. It is, in fact, offensive. I am not saying that you should not go ahead and read it to your child. But do have a discussion with him or her about what Babar learns from the lady, his relationship with his mother and his bride. As for myself, I am just not buying this one."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"I purchased this book thinking that Babar is one of the great classics and how much my 4 year old would love it. Well, I'm glad I read it first. The first thing that happens to Babar is that his mother is killed by poachers. How frightening is that for a young child? Then, left alone in the world, he goes off on his own, has wonderful adventures (the part of the book that's fine) only to come back and marry his cousin. Well, those are not the sorts of things that I'm willing to expose my young children to."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"We are getting rid of this book at a garage sale.

This is NOT what I'd choose to read at bedtime with my kids at all."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"The Story of Babar was on my library's list of recommended books to read to preschoolers, presumably because it is a classic. Alas, as I have been finding in many of the classics we have read (the original Winnie the Pooh, Mother Goose, Grimm's fairy tales, etc.), Babar is not what I would consider a good book for young kids.The illustrations are cute, I really like the rich vocabulary, and the story is linear and easy to follow. However, there are many decidedly adult themes presented and I just cannot understand the benefit of exposing a 3 year old to such horrific situations. Worse, the story handles these terrible situations in a completely emotionless way--giving the young reader very little time to process the events and instead starting on the beginnings of violence desensitization. I was also unable to detect any positive messages/morals to be learned from this story.My daughter and I tend to be fairly practical. Fantasy, fiction, and whimsy are wonderful creative outlets, but we prefer they be based at least somewhat in reality. Talking elephants--we can do. Elephants walking on their hind legs, shopping, driving cars--ok, we can totally go with it. But they should still be elephants in some way: what they eat, where they live, how they socialize--something. In Babar, the characters were blatantly humans, who just happened to look like elephants for some reason. We tend to find that frustrating.That said, this is not an offensive or horrible book with no place in society. I just don't think it's a good choice for young children. It could certainly be a useful resource in teaching older kids about several aspects of history (French history, colonialism, the draw of urban centers through history, etc.) as long as it was accompanied by discussion and further research."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant","review":"I don't know why this book is a classic. Foreigners come to Babar's home and kill his mother. He goes to the land of the foreigners to learn to be just like them because the are so swell and all. He then takes their ways back home with him. marries his cousin and gets everyone to wear clothes like the foreigners. This is a nightmare, not a children's book."},{"Title":"The World of the Dalai Lama: An inside Look at His Life, His People, and His Vision","review":"Whenever we encounter one like His Holiness or we encounter a book like this, both serve to ground us or to remind us again of our purpose and existance if only for a moment. Often times we take living for granted or moreso, we tend to forget ourselves in the HUM of life. This book is like a window where we can peer at our forgotten selves. When his Holiness said \\"the Law of Karma is infallible\\" it jogs the conscience and we remember. This book reminds us to look back so as to go forward with a stronger and renewed purpose. We may not know where we are going to if we do not know where we came from."},{"Title":"The Chinese House: Craft, Symbol and the Folk Tradition (Images of Asia)","review":"This book might be more appropriately filed under 'young readers'. First, it is a small book, hardly more than a paperback. Second, it does not go into any depth about Chinese houses, but gives more of a conversational style overview of culture and history. Illustrations are few and far between. There are no plans, elevations, or serious architectural drawings. Any seventh grader with a report due should be thrilled to find this book. Anyone else will be left wanting. How odd - it is an Oxford University publication."},{"Title":"Walking Sipsey: The people, places, and wildlife","review":"This is an excellent book to read as well as an excellent guide to exploring the Sipsey Wilderness. Mr. Manasco knows the area like no one else--he could be blindfolded and placed out in the most remote area of the Sipsey at midnight and know exactly where he was and find his way to civilization by dawn!! We never tire of going back through the book--and never tire of walking the Sipsey ourselves. We would also never tire of knowing Jim."},{"Title":"Gawayne and the Green knight;: A fairy tale,","review":"This was AWESOME. It's a retelling of Gawayne and the Green Knight as an epic poem (or as a long poem; I don't recall what separates the epics from the limericks, so don't hate). The language isn't terribly convoluted or old-fashioned as you sometimes find with older literature/poetry, and it was just awesome. I don't even read epic poetry (much) and I really enjoyed it (well, there were a few parts that dragged, but not horribly so).It's been a long time since I read the original tale of Gawayne (if ever), so I can't say how close this was or wasn't to it (he's got a Love Interest that I don't recall for one), but it was still good.Have I mentioned that this was a great read?There was a slight formatting glitch where the poem lines were all indented into the middle of the page, but if you went BACK a page they'd all line up on the left side thereafter...it was weird, but hardly a reason not to read this. Because you should read it. And then maybe make your friends read it."},{"Title":"Gawayne and the Green knight;: A fairy tale,","review":"I absolutely loved this! It's not the original epic poem (in case you, like me, were also looking for that), but I would imagine it's probably a good retelling of it, in a very fun and lighthearted manner.

Ooh-la-lah!).My buddy S and I were taking turns reading this book out loud to one another as we replicated part of de Beauvoir's journey through the Southwest.

Now we shall drink whiskey with some bums in the Bowery! Zout allors!\\"There's much to like in this book, and much that's maddeningly trite. I bought the book in the UK and since many Brits love to hate the US, it was kind of fun to read the slobberingly positive pull quotes on the front pages. Still, I recommend this book to readers of good travel literature.Warning: you will want to drink whiskey and smoke cigarettes while reading this book.

This book is fun. We think of Simone as the woman who initiated the second wave of feminism with her book, &quot;The Second Sex;&quot; as the companion of Jean-Paul Sartre, a man plagued by lobsters and his own sense of self; as the globe-trotting political activist. Some may know her as the author of the frightening novel, &quot;She Came To Stay.&quot; The Simone who wrote this book was the best part of Simone de Beauvoir. The book is a snapshot of America, entering the center stage of world power, taken by a native of a country whose time of leadership has passed. It is also the story of a middle-aged woman falling in love. This book was unavailable for many years but it is important both as a view of America in mid-century and as an insight into one of the most important women of the 20th century."},{"Title":"America Day By Day","review":"\\"America Day by Day\\" written by Simone de Beauvoir is a first hand view of America during post-World War II times by one of France's intellectuals of the time. She travels around the United States, first landing in New York City and ending back in Paris only to become disappointed by the look Paris has after touring America. This book was written after her visit but creatively written in journal format, dating from January 25 to May 20, 1947. On the contrary to public opinion, Beauvoir is not anti-American in this reading. Although she is very critical of the way of life people have in the United States, she seems throughly interested throughout her stay. One can note recurring themes that Beauvoir focuses on throughout the book, ranging from female rights to racism to the architecture and fellow intellectuals from America. This book is recommended for help on discovering different perspectives about the United States."},{"Title":"America Day By Day","review":"In Simone de Beauvoir's, America Day by Day, she travels through America in the late 1940's, post WWII. She documents her observations and experiences as she takes a cross-country journey, stopping in popular U.S. locations such as New York, Boston, Chicago, New Orleans, the Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, Hollywood, and San Francisco.Beauvoir's travels help her to understand the diversity that embodies America. America is considered \`the land of opportunity,' a country where the inhabitants are granted certain freedoms. Thus, Beauvoir whole-heartedly embraces her first experience as an American. Intrigued by the American lifestyle, she wanders, looking for her next new experience, her next new adventure. The former Catholic school girl experiences a spectrum of American culture; she dabbles into alcohol and drugs but also incorporates touring museums and lecturing at various, distinguished women's colleges into her travels. Beauvoir almost seems reckless in how she behaves in a country completely foreign to her, but the way in which she free-spiritedly follows her instincts is very much admirable. She is very wide-eyed and excited about America, but she also expresses her irritation as she passionately acknowledges her opinions on topics like racism and segregation, education, American women, democracy, and communism. \\"Hardly a day has passed that I haven't been dazzled by America; hardly a day that I haven't been disappointed. I don't know if I could be happy living here; I am sure I'll miss it passionately\\" (382)."},{"Title":"America Day By Day","review":"Simone de Beauvoir writes America Day by Day as a daily journal, although she actually wrote it after her return to France. Her casual tone allows the reader to travel along with her journey across America. Beauvoir seems enthusiastic about America and does not focus on stereotypes, despite coming with some preconceived notions from movies and friends. Beauvoir also talks about the variety of people in America, which anti-American authors often overlook. The book portrays America well, while highlighting some social problems of the early 1950's, some of which no longer exist. Through her travels she speaks of the rising problems of the fear of communism, the semi-equality of women, and the segregation of Blacks. Other main themes she contemplates through her experiences are religion and democracy. Beauvoir also mentions her views on the American university system and on American intellectualism in general. Despite her relatively negative themes, Beauvoir's admiration for American friendliness and trust shows through. Her love for America is clearly seen. On the last page she describes her arrival in France and how dull it seems compared to America; she says, \\"Over there in the night, a vast continent is sparkling\\" (390). America Day by Day is a beautifully written and interesting book."},{"Title":"America Day By Day","review":"Before reading it, I was concerned that the writing might be pretentious and annoying. But she essentially came here with an open mind and maintained it throughout her stay. She portrayed 1940's America beautifully."},{"Title":"America Day By Day","review":"Simone de Beauvoir's account of her travels in America in the winter and spring of 1947 is both entertaining and insightful. Though Beauvoir only stayed in America for a few months her scope was far from limited; well connected, she traveled through much of the east coast, west coast, and south, and a bit of the mid-west. Beauvoir comments on everything from the American jazz scene to the individual character of towns to American cordiality. She both marvels at America and is critical of some of the phenomena she encounters there; particularly insightful are her examinations of racial discrimination and the double-sided aspect of American optimism. Also, more than just a picture of post-war America, many of her observations are incredibly relevant today, especially her descriptions of American political apathy - particularly among young people - and American conformism. America Day by Day offers a unique, intelligent perspective on America and American life from which one can learn about both America's past and present."},{"Title":"America Day By Day","review":"America Day by Day by Simone de Beauvoir is an easy and interesting read. Beauvoir, a French author, takes the reader through her travels by diary like entry, where she calls things as she sees them. From New York to California, Beauvoir stops to speak at major colleges and hits many \\"tourist\\" attractions. She seems to follow the saying \\"when in Rome, do as the Roman's do\\" by eating hamburgers and speaking English as much as possible. She tries to make her entire trip as \\"American\\" as possible. And just when she though she could never adjust to America, she does and has to re-adjust to France in the end."},{"Title":"America Day By Day","review":"\\"America Day by Day\\" is a look at the experiences of Simone de Beauvoir, a French existentialist, as she traveled through the United States in the Spring of 1947. Beauvoir chronicles her experiences in journal form, and the reader is able to gauge her reactions to different regions and factions of American life first hand. We witness her awe at all the conveniences in a hotel lobby, and her disdain for the situation with blacks in the South prior to the Civil Rights movement, among other things. Beauvoir primarily mixes and mingles with intellectuals and journalists, but she also has meaningful interactions with college students and African Americans. Through this all, we see Beauvoir's positive and negative views of the United States--both the goodness in the nature of the American people and the ways in which American freedom and democracy is restricted by the aristocratic nature of society are featured."},{"Title":"America Day By Day","review":"\\"America Day by Day\\" is an insightful literary and analytical piece of American culture in the 1940s. Simone de Beauvoir looks at the United States through very critical and apprehensive eyes. She notes the virtues of American society: the food, jazz, the buildings and the warmth of the American people. She also notes the vices: racism, the poor state of plantation workers, American consumerism and the political apathy of the American youth. Beauvoir's opinions of America are particularly poignant because she already an established French intellectual before she travels to America. The fact that she is a French woman arriving in the United States after the end of the Second World War also gives a new dimension to her perception of America. Her past experiences have heightened her perception of all the things around her; this reflects in her sensitivity to sounds, smells and temperature changes. Simone de Beauvoir can be seen as a fair critic of the United States and its culture as she tries to describe her experiences in America holistically; and does not focus on the negative aspects of American culture as would be expected from a French critic."},{"Title":"America Day By Day","review":"One of the most accessible books by this great author. It has been a gateway to her other works including the Mandarins. Plus it is a joyous and interesting journey through an America rarely heard about. I realize now that so few Americans were really travelling in the fourties, we had wrapped up the war and wanted to stay home. Excellent book."},{"Title":"America Day By Day","review":"An excellent place to begin seeing America through critical eyes. A companion piece to this is Henry Miller's &quot;The Air-Conditioned Nightmare.&quot;"},{"Title":"America Day By Day","review":"Like de Toqueville before her, Simone de Beauvoir analyzes America, its present state and future promise, as only an outsider can, objectively, without influence or taint from the very values and phenomena under examination. If that makes _America Day by Day_ sound like something other than a travel book, good, because it is much, much more.It is an insightful essay on the very things that define us as a nation: our optimism, our work ethic, our *color line,* and our politics. Offered to us episodically, in the pages of her travel journal, her thoughts on American society are so accurate and penetrating that her conclusions remain relevant today.Her main conclusion is this: \\"...America is one of the pivotal points of the world, where the future of man is being played out. To 'like' America, to 'dislike' it -- these words have no meaning. It is a battlefield, and you can only become passionate about the battle it is waging with itself, in which stakes are beyond measure.\\" Everyone should read this book to discover why we are a \\"pivotal point\\" and what that means for us and the rest of the nations of the world."},{"Title":"America Day By Day","review":"If I could go back in time, I would have loved to have been Simone de Beauvoir's travel companion! She gives readers a view of post WWII America in America Day by Day from the perspective of an outsider looking in, and she does it the same way as she shared her travel experiences in her autobiographies: with a neat mix of her curiosity, sense of adventure, independence, and intellect. Only in this journal of her four-month trip around America, there are more details to enjoy.Beauvoir's journal is an intellectually stimulating series of adventures. While lecturing at prestigious colleges and universities, she also socializes with professors and students, and she shares her impressions of both the Americans and her French countrymen and women living abroad. From hi-brow parties with famous writers and actors to the shady bars filled with suspect characters in the underbelly of the big cities, from Cantonese opera in San Francisco to quaint, provincial New England villages, and from small art studios to slaughterhouses and prisons, de Beauvoir doesn't miss much! She wants to absorb as much as she can. She's not afraid to try new things! Going to a boxing match or smoking marijuana (!) is a welcome adventure! Even getting lost in New York City because she didn't write down the address of where she was supposed to give a lecture doesn't kill her adventurous spirit--she just keeps moving on, trying to find the right address, and luckily runs into friends who are on their way to go listen to her anyway.America Day by Day is great armchair traveling! You have a brilliant, adventurous tour guide in de Beauvoir, who skillfully mixes her impressions, critiques, history, and philosophical perspective."},{"Title":"Mysticism and philosophy","review":"While Stace's analysis on mysticism is somewhat dated, it remains an invaluable critical examination of the claims of mystics from a philosophical perspective.In the past century, organised religion has undergone something of a decline in the West, leading for people to seek alternative forms of experiencing the transcendant besides organised religion. Many have turned to 'mysticism' in order to try and fill this need, and the increase in popularity in mysticism and thinkers like Meister Eckhart has been matched by a flurry of academic interest in mysticism.Stace however critically looks at the claims of mystics from an analytical perspective in philosophy, suspending judgement on the truth or falsity of their claims. One of Stace's most interesting arguments is that mystical experience has more in common across various religions than the members of each religion would accept. To this end Stace quotes Ruysbroeck and Eckhart quite frequently, and compares there mystical experience with the writers of the Upanishads and Buddhist scriptures.Stace also concludes though that mystical experience is essentially subjective (in common with William James) and by itself it doesn't give us objective knowledge about the essential nature of things, nor does it prove religious doctrines such as the immortality of the soul, but it does represent an appropriate expression of the human spirit in terms of its desire for transcendance and to the holy and beautiful in life.While Stace has somewhat under-rated the complexity of mystical thought within Christianity and also other religions, and some of his ideas have been superseded by more up to date scholarship (such as Bernard McGinn's far more accurate study of Christian mysticism for example) for Philosophers of Religion this remains a useful text for exploring claims of religion which are based on so called mystical experience."},{"Title":"Mysticism and philosophy","review":"In contrast to other philosophers who have written on the topic of religious experience, Stace is a perennialist, searching for a meaningful way to discuss the similarities between documented cases of religious experience. He begins with this assumption, which to me seems like an intuitive place to start (as opposed to Katz. See \\"Language, Epistemology and Mysticism\\") so like-minded readers may be drawn to his methods. Although this may seem like a very good place to start an inquiry into \\"mysticism,\\" upon closer inspection, his method leaves much to be desired.First and foremost, Stace makes little distinction between \\"experience\\" and \\"interpretation.\\" From the philosophy of mind, thinkers who wrote a few decades after Stace, such as Levine (see \\"Materialism and Qualia: The Explanatory Gap\\"), Nagel (see \\"What is it Like to be a Bat?\\") and Jackson (see \\"Epiphenomenal Qualia\\") have presented powerful cases concerning the vast and potentially unbridgeable gap between experience and its interpretation. I won't reiterate Stace's position here, but ultimately we have to ask; \\"What is accomplished by defining the \\"universal core\\" of religious experience linguistically when there is such a disparity between experience and the theories we use to explain it?\\" Can this be casually overlooked especially considering the \\"ineffable\\" nature of the experience? I do not fault Stace for not mentioning this due to the era in which he wrote, but this is a critique that needs serious attention. Compounding this point is the fact that Stace has had no religious experience of his own making it all the more dubious that he could make that which is by definition beyond human understanding meaningful.Stace also omits non-dual logic systems that seem more apt at addressing self-annihilation and religious experience (i.e., as found in the Diamond Sutra) than does the discourse of either/or logic. When discussing an \\"experience\\" in the rational sense where a grammatical subject and predicate are required, what can one seriously take Eckhart to mean when he asks God to rid him of all concepts of God while at the same time striving for his own annihilation? (see Sermon 52) Also, to profess to have such a position that stands outside of both subject and object is metaphysical speculation. To force a grammatical subject and object onto an experience that is calling for neither seems to be akin to forcing a square peg through a round hole. Or, as a wiser man than I once wrote, and I paraphrase, \\"It is as if Stace has a star-shaped cookie cutter, presses it into the dough of religious experience and then claims that the dough is star-shaped.\\"We also need to keep in mind that Stace speaks only incidentally of the body, which is to be expected considering the methodology of analytic philosophy. By doing so, he reduces religious experience to language, negating both the body and the unconscious. It is through the body and in the body that religious experience is cultivated and received. Also, the role of concentration on the breath which through prolonged focus in meditation and prayer bridges the conscious and unconscious is not mention in any way. I think that for a more full picture of this \\"universal core,\\" attention to both the body and the unconscious is needed.I would next like to critique Stace's use of the categories of \\"extroverted\\" and \\"introverted.\\" He seems to use these in a phenomenological sense, roughly correlated to \\"inner\\" and \\"outer,\\" but he gives little attention to clarification. It seems that floating between these two perspectives is a \\"self,\\" which when discovered is the end-all of religious experience (much to the chagrin of Buddhism). He seems to have some initial insight to make this distinction, but he seems to take this for granted. I think that much insight can be gained by translating Stace's use of these terms into the typology of Jung. By doing so, I believe that much of Stace's agenda is exposed. For example, I think it is clear that Stace is some form of introverted, intuitive thinker, probably emphasizing the thinking due to his profession and method. His intuition is also evident by his perennialist's nature. As he is a philosopher, he finds truth in systematization, which I believe explains why Stace strongly favors other mystics who were intellectual enough to systemize their work. This bias is all the more evident where in the book Stace ridicules and insults Teresa of Avila for her anti-intellectualism at several points. His bias discredits and discounts those who simply have religious insight but do not systematize it, labeling such mystics as secondary in status. It is my opinion that Stace has given undue preference to those who happen to think like himself.It also is evident that in not further breaking down this typology, he makes a broad generalization between \\"introverted thinkers\\" and \\"extroverted feelers\\" in a very \\"either/or\\" sort of fashion excluding anything in the middle (i.e. an extroverted thinker or introverted feeler). In making this generalization, Stace presumes introversion to be categorically superior to extroversion as it often ends with rational analysis. I think Stace has undermined his own position by not thinking through the implications of this generalization.As an ultimate systematization, or even an initial step in systematizing religious experience, Stace fails, but that is not to say that he is not without merit (as per my 4 stars). If one reads him with such concern in mind, his optimism and drive to seek the universal is nothing short of inspiring, especially when compared to Katz (who denies anything meaningful can be said about religious experience). I compare both Stace and Katz to watching some politically spun \\"news\\" program like Bill O'Rielly or John Stewart. Sure, they may be fun, but one must keep in mind that both are catering to a specific bias. If you can remain mindful of such a bias, then you have a chance at seeing through to what lies beneath in order to conduct your own study."},{"Title":"The Commercial Mediator's Handbook: A Practical, Systems-Based Approach","review":"This is the first book that approaches mediation of commercial conflicts in a systematic, theory-based way, yet it is easy-to-read and functional.

For the private life of the great man and for the less formal aspects of his life, the best book is &quot;Atoms in Family&quot;, by his wife, Laura Fermi. Both are remarkable books. The book by Segre, who himself won the Nobel prize for the first observation of the anti-proton, besides being very well written, has some features of his own. First, there is, in an appendix, a series of letters exchanged between Fermi and Persico, another distinguished physicist, of about the same age, which talk mainly of education:which book to use for thermodynamics (Planck), how to study, progresses in some researches, etc. Second, an interview with a friend of Fermi's father, the engineer Amidei, who had a great influence on the education of teenager Fermi, by lending him books he assumed would be important for his future. Among t! hese books is the Mecanique (mechanics) of Poisson, which remained impressed in Fermi's memory forever. The list of these books, with the dates when they were taken and given back, is there. Fermi's style, the simplicity that comes from deep knowledge, is exemplified in many occasions. Perhaps the best story is that of the malfunctioning of Compton's watch; or the first measurement of the power of the first nuclear explosion, made by Fermi by measurind the displacement caused by the shock wave on little scraps of paper released when the first light from the explosion arrived. I read this book at least ten times. I know I will read it again many times."},{"Title":"Enrico Fermi, Physicist","review":"This is an interesting biography for it is written by a friend with same interests and loyalty to each other. No jealosy, no envie but appreciation and loyalty how nice. This is the story of Fermi mostly about his intellectual and social life and not about his private life and that part is in fact covered very nicely by his wife in her beautiful book. Segre without any short cuts describe Fermi, his behaior, his mastery in physics with all important documents reproduced and day by day their successes and few dissappointments. There are certain scientific explanations about the experiments they conducted days in and days out and if you are not into Atomic physics those explanations are just words but even if you do not know what they are doing you still get the pleasure of visualising masters in action. descriptions are very vivid. Hard work is necessary but knowing what you are doing is more important and this book along with the biographies of other master Physisist shows the same. Prof Serge is exteremely good in writing biography, you do not get bored while reading the book. All the surroundings, social and political world conditions are clearly described, showing the conditions these people had to go through and yet was exteremely productive."},{"Title":"Enrico Fermi, Physicist","review":"Overall, the book \\"Enrico Fermi Physicist\\" was very informative and interesting. The long time friend and first graduate of Fermi, Mr. Emilo Segre, stood by Fermi's side for many years. Mr. Serge also wrote the book, and was able to do so in a very all-inclusive manner. Not only does the book teach us everything that Fermi's has accomplished through his long and illustrious career as a physicist, but it also shows us a very human side of this brilliant mind. There are stories about Enrico's childhood dispersed intermittently throughout the book, so we can look at Fermi as a regular person, rather than as a series of brilliant mathematical laws and experiments. Due to the chronological design of the book, we see Enrico grow from a young and furtive mind, with an unrestrained sense of enthusiasm for math and science, into an old and wise master of physics.I think that Emilio Segre was compelled to write his book on Fermi for several reasons. By reading the book it is very clear that Segre has the utmost respect and appreciation for Fermi because when he describes the man it is in a tone of awe. He spends almost a page later on in the book talking about how impressed everyone was by Fermi, and how the man's brilliant mind warranted respect form all who could see him work. I also think that Segre felt some type of duty, almost a responsibility, to share Fermi's story with the rest of the world because he knew he was better qualified for the task than anyone, thanks to his close relationship with Fermi.By reading this book one learns of Fermi's classical experiments, which would eventually come to yield the atomic pile, and later help foster the construction of the atom bomb to be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II. There is also a myriad of additional scientific details in the book, depicted in confusing and esoteric jargon. Personally, I think the book could have been more simplistic in the explanations of Fermi's work, instead of spending so much time with detailed information of little significance to the average reader. Overall, the book was engrossing, but excess scientific information gets a bit cumbersome later on in the book.Science buffs who also like a bit of history and want to learn about a scientist's life should read this story. As far as scientists go, I found Enrico Fermi to be one of the more fascinating scientists to ever live. Through reading the book, Fermi is revealed not only as a scientific and mathematical genius, but also a fun loving kid, who was almost expelled from school for a prank he pulled."},{"Title":"Enrico Fermi, Physicist","review":"I found this entire work to be well written and very informative on both the more personal life of Enrico Fermi, and on his various accomplishments and work regarding radioactivity and physics. Despite being written from a more personal view, as it was authored by a friend, the book maintains its commtittment to detailing the events in his life, including what influenced him and what he in turn influenced. A fascinating tale of a Nobel Prize Winner who worked on the infamous Manhattan Project, this book lists the many discoveries Fermi came upon and what his work later led to in the discovery of producing the fission needed for reactor and atomic weapons. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in this area of physics, and those interested in the people tied to the Manhattan project. As a scientist, Enrico Fermi was an accomplished individual, and this book is able to bring to light the depth of his character and efforts in his respective field. Written from his friend's perspective, the retelling of his life is very well planned and thought out, and I commend the detail Segre put into its creation. With various interviews and detailed accounts of his life, this book is an invaluable resource for understanding more about the atomic bomb and the people who helped bring it to life. One of the most important things books serves to do is to remind American citizens how lucky they are to have gotten such great physicists and scientists to come support this country and how invaluable they are today, as they gave us a chance for the future."},{"Title":"Enrico Fermi, Physicist","review":"I've always been fascinated with Fermi's life and knew very little about him. I'm spending too much time reading on present day problems and people complaining about their rights being violated. Time Magazine rated Fermi one of the Top 20 scientists of the 20th century, including Einstein, Salk, Wright Brothers, Hubble and others. Fermi's wife was Jewish so in the late 1930's they left Italy to come to America (real lucky for us). Imagine adding Fermi to the Nazi research and subtracting him from our research. I think we would all be talking German today if Fermi assisted the Nazi's. I am not a scientific person (like the prior reviewer has so expertly depicted)but a realist. After America declared war on Italy, Germany and Japan, Fermi was declared an enemy alien, like many Italian Americans. Fermi's travel was limited and his mail read by the government. Did Fermi leave America, did he ask the Supreme Court to rule if his rights were violated, did he go to the newspapers, no he continued his work to help defeat the Nazi's and Imperial Japan. Imagine Fermi one of the greatest of the 20th century being restricted in his travel. Today, every two bit con artist complains today their human rights are being violated if their back packs are searched. I did not understand any of the scientific writing but the man was remarkable and history has judged him one of the best. Not many people real know his story, unless you are in the scientific community. I'm not sure why, history would be a lot different if Fermi had not come to America. If you do not understand the scientific part read the War Years and Professor at Chicago. With Salk, Einstein, Hubble, Fermi changed the world. Think where we would be today without him. Think about all the great scientist in the last cenury, only 20 picked, Fermi was one of them."},{"Title":"Enrico Fermi, Physicist","review":"I thought this book was great and did a great job of pacing the reader through Enrico's life, as well as superbly establishing a connection between the reader and Enrico. Emilio Serge did a great job of making it feel like you actually knew Enrico Fermi in real life which made the book that much more engaging and enjoyable. To be honest I found the beginning of the book the most interesting, more specifically Enrico's childhood experiences, influences and how he became interested in physics altogether. After checking multiple online sources, I found the book itself to be one of the most comprehensive sources for information on Fermi, as it includes the entire scope of his accomplishments, dreams, failures and life changing experiences. Written in a very simple yet elegant manner, Serge writes with an embedded loving friendship that still exists despite Enrico's untimely death at the young age of 53. Every page is filled with a seemingly endless number of intriguing facts about Enrico's life, whether it be his troubles and resistances along the way to success or the outcome that occurred after his development of the atomic bomb.

True the Murach style of side to side page of one topic is a very good thing but... teaching is not a complete chapter on some topic with a conclusion (Perspective) at the end. Teaching requires additional lessons and exercises at least at the end of each chapter to reinforce and to give hands on for the material just covered. This book after the first two chapters has none. Zilch, nada, zero. No reinforcing exercises what so ever. You have your &quot;How To's&quot; on each two pages, a usual one paragraph conclusion and terms reiteration at the end of each chapter and then on to the next chapter. Yes you can learn from this style but it will be a bit difficult and it is one of the very few books I have ever had in my 18 years of IT where there were no additional re-inforcing exercises to &quot;cement&quot; what you just learned. No hands on after the chapter. That cost this book a 3 Star rating. BTW, I completed the whole book before I wrote this. I am going to have to get another SQL book to assist in &quot;cementing&quot; the How To's into my skillset."},{"Title":"Murach's SQL for SQL Server","review":"The most important feature of this book is that it provides good coverage of SQL Server topics with good comprehension.I was skeptical when I heard of the 2 page format: explain a concept on the left page and show an example emphasizing important points on the right page. It turned out to be an excellent approach to teaching a subject area. Each concept is bite sized. Each example demonstrates the concept. The important points reinforce the key items and introduce subtleties you might not encounter until you've used SQL Server for a while.I read the book as background to the 70-229 SQL Server Design exam. This book's scope provides only a subset of the exam's topics. It is a great SQL Server introduction book."},{"Title":"Murach's SQL for SQL Server","review":"I picked up this book last week and I have to saywhat an excellent book it is!

However, if you are just beginning to learn SQL, then you should really slug through \\"SQL Queries for Mere Mortals\\" first. Having done that, I found Murach's 2 page presentation style on each topic a very good way to reinforce what I had learned in \\"SQL Queries for Mere Mortals\\".

I like the two-page format that this book provides. You open the book and on the left page is all the details of what you are learning and on the right you get a broken down summary of what you just read on the left. This may seem like redundant info... and it is, but really, the info gets drilled deep into your brain. You might think that this format would bore one to tears, but it doesn't... well not too bad anyways.Brian does a good job of explaining how things work. You get a decent overview of Microsoft SQL Server (such as using Enterprise Manager, Query Analyzer and such), but most of this book is about the SQL language. You will learn all about your basic SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE statements and how to use them to your full potential. You also learn about stored procedures, subqueries, triggers...etc. In other words you get a pretty darn good overview of SQL for SQL Server.If I could do half stars here on Amazon then this book would be more like a 4.5/5, only because of the redundancy (the whole two-page style I mentioned above). Like I said before, it is good because it gets drilled into your brain, but without that there could have been a lot more meat on these bones.

It would be a great tool to have in the Administrator's library as well, though it is more language-specific than adminstrative-task oriented. The book starts with language elements, then moves through database design and implementation issues and finally on to \\"advanced SQL skills\\" - much of which is oriented to working with a larger SQL Server implementation with pre-existing code, views, tables, etc.There is good information on backups, restores, things like that, but my opinion is that the book is so much more a reference on the language and implementation than the administration of SQL Server - that's where the completeness of the coverage is really what makes it unique. For example, if you want to understand the CASE and COALESCE functions - it's covered with narrative and direct examples of the usage. CONVERT, CAST, UNIONs, are more examples.This text is one that you can put on the shelf and refer to whenever you get stuck with a function/syntax issue. Combined with Books Online, you'll be set.One thing I would like to see more of is an explanation of the gotchas, with some workaround ideas.

In my visitations to speak to elementary and middle school students, teachers have told me they needed supplementary material in the teaching of this period of U.S. history. Consequently, I am endeavoring to complete 12 volumes of persons, black and white, who distinguished themselves during the War of Independence. The books are not intended for indepth study of the war or hero. Rather,emphasis is placed on the youth of the subjects-as far as research allows-anecdotal material of interest, and the qualties that made them role models.

Heroes and Heroines of the American Revolution.)","review":"Idella Bodie's book on the Francis Marion, also known as the Swamp Fox, has several shortcomings. The book is small in size, only slightly larger than the jewel box case for a compact disc, and has about 66 pages of text in large print. These in themselves are not shortcomings, however, the book contains several typographical errors... The book also contains factual errors regarding swamps. The author states that the swamps of South Carolina smell bad. This is not true. I have spent at least fifty weekends exploring the swamps of that State, including the Congaree Swamp and the Four Holes Swamp. Swamps do not smell bad. I would be surprised if the author even spent one day visiting and marveling at the shimmering beauty and fairy-tale mysteries of the swamps of South Carolina. Another shortcoming is the poor writing. The narratives are fragmentary and relatively undeveloped. The episode regarding the Native American (page 23) is a bit far fetched -- I think that Idella Bodie has been watching too many Robin Hood cartoon movies. The study section on pages 79 to 81 are boring, and is sure to frighten most children away from this book. Is there anything good about Idella Bodie's book? Yes. The drawings are excellent. Unfortunately, the artist responsible for the exquisite pen-and-ink drawnigs was not credited. The map on pages 70-71 is a good idea. The book deserves at least one star, because it covers one of my favorite things, namely the South Carolina swamps. On the other hand, the writing is immature and resembles that of an ambitious high school student, at best."},{"Title":"The Revolutionary Swamp Fox (Bodie, Idella.

Portmann, the famed Swiss zoologist, has written his most famous work now unfortunately out of print but still worth getting. There are no earth shattering statements but rather careful study culminating in the relaxed style he uses. This book has been written for the general reader although it is not lacking in academic qualities and the practicing scientist can still gain enormous insight into his/her field and especially in how to write well and without pandering for the market as many do today.Portmann introduces his ideas regarding the \\"form\\" of an organism through practical studies of the animals themselves considering not ony external shapes but internal developments such as nervous systems, organs and so forth. He brings to mind the interlaced wholeness of the organism, rather than being constructed from bits as seems to be the current way of thought. Certainly the book is not as ground breaking as D'Arcy Thompson's remarkable work but still, whereas Thompson considers the mathematical structures shown to be relevant in an animals build, Portmann looks at the whole animal and makes his most important point that organisms are not just structured for functions' sake but rather exude self expression not in the human way of expression of their own idea of self but rather as an expression of the \\"type\\" which IS the animal itself. This idea sort of creaps up on you as you read his book which is full of very good drawings making his points.As I reached the end of it I found that much more work needs to be done in this way of study in order to bring back, so to speak, the organic aspect of the organism and let biology once again be a science of life rather than an attempt to imitate the exact sciences such as physics. I believe that through such approaches not only biology but the whole of science can undergo a fundamental change in its current outlook which is of course a product of the mechanistic way of thought. This way of work enriches science and its study avoiding the deadness often felt once something has been analysed until basically nothing remains of the elusive \\"life\\" which is the only real meaning attached to a science of life.If only more of his work has survived."},{"Title":"Medieval Military Costume: Europa Militaria Special No. 8 (Europa Militaria Special, 8)","review":"This books is rather thin - only 96 pages - but there is not page crammed with gorgeous illustrations or colour pics ( generally two or three large ones on every page!!) that show military costumes in Medieval times.

He will typically describe an organisms behavior or behavioral trends and then desrcibe the competing hypothoses for these trends, phenomena or divergance from these typical trends.Like I said though, this book is technical. Don't attempt reading it unless you have completed 2 courses of undergrad biology and calculus, as well as chemisty (most of the chemicals used by ants and the like involve simple organic compounds I was a chem major myself.)In other words, this is not like On Human Nature or Journey to the Ants: This is more like a 3rd or 4th year advanced biology course textbook."},{"Title":"Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Edition","review":"Dr. Wilson's \\"Sociobiology,\\" together with \\"The Insect Societies\\" and \\"On Human Nature\\" (that three volume set is essential to any thinking man's library) is sufficient to challenge and focus any perspective on Evolution and Society.

Nor in it's own way does great propaganda. In contrast, truly important scientific books render themselves obsolete by opening new fields for subsequent scholars to elaborate. Edward O. Wilson's 1975 landmark Sociobiology, which introduced neo-Darwinism to the public--and which has now been reissued to mark its 25th anniversary--is just such a book. Vast yet coherent, Sociobiology demonstrated in rigorous detail how Darwinian selection molded the various ways in which all animals--from the lowly corals to the social insects to the highest primates--compete and cooperate with others of their own species.Outraging the leftists who dominated academia, Wilson suggested numerous analogies between animal and human societies. While men have drawn such parallels since long before Aesop, Wilson's command of natural history and the power of neo-Darwinian theory in unifying this vast body of knowledge lent credibility to his grand ambition to reduce social science to a branch of biology, just as, Wilson argued, biology could ultimately be reduced to chemistry and chemistry to physics. .Tom Wolfe has lauded Wilson as &quot;the new Darwin,&quot; but that's somewhat overstating the case. Wilson is more the workaholic synthesist who brought to wide awareness the insights of even more original but lesser-known sociobiologists like the manic-depressive Robert Trivers and the late English genius William D. Hamilton. It was Hamilton who launched the neo-Darwinian era in 1964 with his theory of &quot;kin selection,&quot; which mathematically answered a question that had long nagged Darwin: Why do social creatures, whether ants or humans, tend to be nepotistic? Why do we sacrifice for our children and even for our more distant relatives? Hamilton showed that acting altruistically toward your kin can be in your genes' self-interest even when it's not in your own. Richard Dawkins, another sociobiologist inspired by Hamilton, popularized this insight in his 1976 bestseller The Selfish Gene.Only the last of Sociobiology's 26 chapters is devoted solely to human societies, yet it blazed a trail that many others followed. In recent years, this genre has become wildly popular with readers of serious nonfiction books. Amazon.com lists 416 titles under &quot;sociobiology&quot; and 1,218 under &quot;human evolution.&quot; While Wilson's archenemy, the Marxist media hound Stephen Jay Gould, has largely been reduced to negativity and obfuscation, many others have responded gallantly to Sociobiology's challenge. Among the most enjoyable introductions to neo-Darwinism are The Third Chimpanzee by the bracing Jared Diamond and How the Mind Works by the entertaining Steven Pinker. Matt Ridley's Thatcherite perspective adds rigor to The Red Queen and The Origin of Virtue. Robert Wright's neoliberal The Moral Animal is a good read but sometimes tries to make Darwinism sound like a beta release of Clintonism.Despite the success of neo-Darwinism in answering some fundamental questions about human behavior and in attracting many of the best minds of our time, it has not been terribly popular with either left or right. Ironically, while the religious right futilely attacks Darwin's theory of what we evolved from, the left clamps down upon Darwin's theory of what we evolved to. The left has long denounced sociobiological research for validating what conservatives have assumed all along: that human nature--with its sex differences and its stress on individual, family, and ethnic self-interest--is an innate heritage, not a blank slate that can be wiped clean by speech codes, sensitivity workshops, and re-education camps.Not that the left hasn't tried: Stalin shipped his Darwinists to the Gulag. In the politically correct West, evolution-oriented scientists haven't been murdered. Yet Wilson had a bucket of ice water poured on his head, IQ scientist Arthur Jensen needed a bodyguard, the police investigated racial difference scholar J.P. Rushton for six months, the U. of Edinburgh fired IQ researcher Chris Brand despite 26 years of tenure, and a mob of protestors beat up Hans Eysenck, Britain's most prominent psychologist.Wilson's orthodox Darwinian sociobiology made it countless enemies in academia. Centrist anthropologists John Tooby and Leda Cosmides accordingly re-launched sociobiology under the neutral name of &quot;evolutionary psychology.&quot; Pronouncing themselves the truest True Believers in equality, Tooby &amp; Cosmides portrayed human nature as almost monolithically uniform, and proclaimed that evolutionary psychology should only study human similarities.But while egalitarianism served as a useful cover story for infiltrating neo-Darwinism into academia, it proved a largely useless methodology for learning about humanity. Why? Because knowledge consists of contrasts. To learn much about human nature, we need to look for patterns of similarities and differences among humans. Ironically, therefore, evolutionary psychology has become primarily the study of sex differences.You might think that conservatives would give sociobiology a sympathetic hearing, if only because anything Steven Jay Gould abhors can't be all bad. And, indeed, many rightwing heavyweights like James Q. Wilson (The Moral Sense), Francis Fukuyama (The Great Disruption), and Charles Murray (&quot;Deeper into the Brain,&quot; NR, January 24, 2000) have increasingly built their worldviews upon a Darwinian plinth. Tom Wolfe's A Man in Full is The Great Human Biodiversity Novel.This is a natural evolution for American conservatism. After all, Darwin himself was crucially inspired by the free market economics of conservative icon Adam Smith. And as Pope John Paul II's endorsement of Darwinism demonstrated, the theory of natural selection is reasonably compatible with the main creeds in the Judeo-Christian tradition, except for the kind of ultra-literalist fundamentalism that makes a fetish out of the universe being created in 4004 B.C.Having shot itself in the foot over Galileo, the Roman Catholic has wisely learned not to bet its prestige on one side of a scientific controversy. Science works best with theories that are falsifiable, religion with beliefs that aren't. Creationism, an extremely easily falsified theory, just makes religion in general look stupid. Similarly, when conservatives are excessively solicitous of the feelings of Creationists, they end up looking dim, too. Worse, anti-Darwinism keeps conservatives from noticing that neo-Darwinian science is corroborating and extending much of the conservative world-view. It's time to wake up and realize: we're winning. # # #Steve Sailer is a columnist for VDARE.com and an Adjunct Fellow of the Hudson Institute."},{"Title":"Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Edition","review":"The \`new' edition of Sociobiology could not be more of a disappointment. The original version (1975) remains a landmark work and it's importance both to biology and to social science can hardly be exaggerated. The theoretical framework and the masterful scholarship contained in the original are nothing short of astonishing. Which makes the silver edition all the more a travesty. For a literary work it would be permissible to republish a work in its original form. This is not the case for a work of science. The original work touches on practically every subject of relevance to biology. And since it's publication advances have been made on every single front. And yet the work has not been updated. The last chapter on humans and their role in the world of sociobiology was at once the most controversial and least well supported of the entire book. Since 1975 the work on human sociobiology has been proceeding at a brisk pace, generating, not only books, research articles and edited tomes but whole journals dedicated to the topic. The inclusion of such research would greatly enhance not only the work itself but also the standing of sociobiology as a viable framework for understanding human behavior. Lamentably, all new research has been wantonly excluded. It is simply scandalous to republish the work, essentially unaltered from the original under the misguided denotation of \`new'. In science 25 years is an eternity. Republishing this work is not like releasing a second edition of The Selfish Gene or The Descent of Man unaltered. It is more like releasing an encyclopedia 25 years later without making any updates whatsoever. What was once a splendid work, now re-released turns out looking, cliched, trite and unforgivably out-dated. As far as I can see, the only reason to publish a work on science is to promote new knowledge and this edition can make no such claim. Interested readers would do just as well to save their money and buy an old edition of Sociobiology for a quarter of the price."},{"Title":"Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Edition","review":"This book is, to my mind, the most important single book on social behavior in animals and humans, edging out Darwin's The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), as well as Maynard Smith's Evolution and the Theory of Games (1982). Only 30 of the book's 575 pages are devoted to Homo sapiens, but this is the part I am interested in, and the part I will discuss in this review.I recently reread Wilson's Sociobiology because I had only a vague memory of what exactly he said about human sociobiology, but numerous writers alluded to the crudeness and inaccuracy of Wilson's analysis. It is well known that Wilson's sociobiology of our species was bitterly critiqued by liberals and Marxists for its \\"reductionism,\\" and \\"biological determinism.\\" It is well known that sociobiology has shed these criticisms in recent years, but some have alleged that the radical's critique of Wilson's early contribution to human sociobiology is, regretfully, well-deserved.To my surprise, upon rereading I found this charge to be quite without merit. We may know much more about human sociobiology today than a third of a century ago, but Wilson's general exposition is virtually flawless. Wilson's central point is that human genetic development has created a species that enjoys a plasticity of social organization orders of magnitude more flexible than that of other species. Human genes, so to speak, liberate us for a panorama of cultural life-worlds. Reductionist this is not. Genetic determinist this is not. Wilson speculates that genes promoting flexibility in social behavior are strongly selected on the individual level, but he follows Darwin in speculating that group selection may have been important in making us who we are.Of course, Wilson decisively rejects the \\"tabula rasa\\" view that the human mind can be successfully indoctrinated into any arbitrary cultural system (the devout wish of the social engineers of the political left and right).\\"Although the genes have given away most of their sovereignty,\\" he asserts, \\"they maintain a certain amount of influence in at least the behavioral qualities that underlie variations between cultures. Moderately high heritability has been documented in introversion-extroversion measures... neuroticism... depression, and the tendency toward certain forms of mental illness such as schizophrenia.\\" (p. 550) Wilson suggest that the field of \\"anthropological genetics\\" could lead us to a valid model of the biological foundations of human nature. Wilson describes two widely disparate methods of anthropological genetics. The first uses laboratory experiments to identify the individual units of human behavior, for instance Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs and George Homans' behavioral moral theory. The second is phylogenetic analysis, in which we compare and contrast humans with other related species. At the time Sociobiology was written, this method was popularized by Konrad Lorenz, Robert Ardrey, Desmond Morris, Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox, and others. Wilson is (rightly) skeptical of this body of research, preferring to derive genetic predispositions by establishing \\"the lowest taxonomic level at which each character shows significant intertaxon variation.\\" (p. 551)\\"Human societies have effloresced to levels of extreme complexity because their members have the intelligence and flexibility to play role of virtually any degree of specification, and to switch them as the occasion demands.\\" (p554) In sociological theory, Emile Durkheim and Talcott Parsons had developed socialization theories in which individuals internalize social norms, and thus become \\"indoctrinated\\" with values that lead them to behave prosocially even when it is not in their material interest to do so. Wilson attributes this idea to Campbell (1972), and discusses the possibility that group selection is involved in this sophisticated aspect of human psychology. This, of course, has become a major theme in contemporary sociobiology.\\"Scientists and humanists should consider together the possibility,\\" says Wilson, \\"that the time has come for ethics to be removed temporarily from the hands of the philosophers and biologicized.\\" (p. 562) Wilson's discussion of this issue is incisive and nuanced. Today we would say simply that human ethics is a central aspect of human evolution, and that morality is the product of a gene-culture coevolutionary dynamic that must be studied in a purely scientific manner. Wilson clearly understands that human culture sets the stage for human genetic evolution just as much as the converse.In sum, I could find no hint of the reductionism and biological determinism that critiques have charged permeates Wilson's treatment of human sociality. Rather, I find a sophisticated and nuanced analysis that includes most of the theoretical tools that were to be developed over the succeeding four decades. Wilson's judgment here is deeply moderate and considered, leading me to believe that his bitter critics simply recoiled at the reasonable suggestion that there are biological foundations to human behavior and morality, and hence limits to the extent that humans can be indoctrinated into extreme anti-humanistic ideologies. The true enemies of human freedom are those who yearn for a system of totalizing culture that is capable of eliminating individual will and reducing people to cogsS in an immense social machine. Probably such enemies of freedom cannot succeed in the long run, but they certainly have the capacity to ruin the lives of millions in the attempt."},{"Title":"Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Edition","review":"This is a classic by the most famous &quot;bugman&quot; in the world, a naturalist in the twentieth century who drew conclusions from the observed behaviour of insects. The original hardcover version was quite expensive, and the abridged version in paperback lacked the full text. This is not a short read, but is absorbing and a &quot;must&quot; for the &quot;everyman&quot; who wishes to learn from the thoughts of a master. I have the original hardcover but am glad that the book will be more widely available and is sure to be something that readers of Wilson's popular books will want to have in their libraries. Wilson's Pulitzer Prize winning &quot;On Human Nature&quot; is another book well worth reading for an overview by one of the best American minds of the latter 20th century."},{"Title":"Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Edition","review":"Great read!

It has taken 25 years of reading, re-reading, listening to many interviews with Dr. Wilson on NPR, and seeing stories about E.O.Wilson and his life-long contributions to the understanding of animal societies and their human relatives. I bought this edition, and gave it to a friend as the interest on a $500 loan. A self taught genius who still works in obscurity for the USPS, it re-enforced and validated ideas that he had these long years of work that enabled him to put two of his children through medical school (one is a worker ant.)

I knew that there had to be more to the late fifties/early 60's than history suggests. This book sheds some light on what really went on. It wasn't all sugar and spice, that's for sure. Kudo's not only to the author, but to the artists that were interviewed. The reader will come away with newfound respect for each of them.

I wound up a fan of Karen Schoemer, the reformed rock critic whose wry, witty manner brings both an off-beat look at the other side of '50s music and a writer who weaves interesting, honest memories with the interviews (and aren't memories what vintage music's all about?).Karen grew up in plush New York suburbs and saw the grit of classic rock (Springsteen especially) as an escape from both sterile surroundings and her parents' messy divorce. Yet through many years as a free-lance rock critic for Newsweek and the New York Times, she never forgot the white-bread '50s pop hits that somehow stayed with her even after countless interviews with punk and grunge types. So she chose to embark on a quest for meaning in her life through meetings with stars from her mom's (and my mom's) generation. To my delight, the formula worked.Seven '50s stars made Karen's cut, with the \\"holy grail\\" in the form of, oddly enough, Connie Francis- whom she finally meets at her retirement home in South Florida. She also talked to big-band era singers- Frankie Laine, Patti Page, even the all-but-forgotten Georgia Gibbs. Pat Boone, mentioned earlier, proves to be irrepressible, while two minor teen idols- Fabian and Tommy Sands- fill out the collection. In all seven pieces, Karen's a participant, not an observer. This may turn purists off, but she's very entertaining and has surprising twists in both the interviews and listening. Sands, for instance, was best-known as Nancy Sinatra's (short-lived) husband; his only huge hit, \\"Teenage Crush\\", sounds what she calls \\"grotesque\\" yet once Karen hears Tommy's uneasy renditions of Sinatra-type standards, she's unexpectedly moved.That's the essence of \\"Great Pretenders\\"- the discovery of real musical and emotional nuggets in a framework that doesn't sound too promising. \\"Give me more bad music\\"? \\"Connie was a virgin!\\" \\"Patti Page: for those who thought Ella Fitzgerald was a little too taxing.\\" Yes, Karen sounds like a snide know-it-all, but she's better than that. There's real warmth here as she appreciates this music for what it was- and how, after so many years, it can win over even a wannabe hipster.\\"Great Pretenders\\" isn't your average book of rock criticism; it's not a memory-lane piece; it isn't chick-lit either. It's part musical autobiography, part road trip, and all Karen Schoemer- a woman you'll either hate (if you want nostalgia) or, like me, you'll enjoy for her spunk. Whoever said \\"I hate spunk\\" never met her- and the soundtrack's great (if cheesy) too!BTW- I always loved Pat Boone's \\"Speedy Gonzales\\"."},{"Title":"Great Pretenders: My Strange Love Affair with '50s Pop Music","review":"Any interested in 50s pop music must read GREAT PRETENDERS: MY STRANGE LOVE AFFAIR WITH '50S POP MUSIC: it tells of the mid-1960s-born author who fosters an interest in the genre as her parents' marriage mirrors the ups and downs of the 50s musical movement and finally fails.

But it's a little hard to buy Karen Schoemer's opinions, or even believe everything she writes. She was a music critic for \\"Newsweek,\\" yet she claims that she never heard the Barbra Streisand recording of \\"People?\\" Even harder to believe: She asks Frankie Laine about his 1957 album entitled \\"Rockin',\\" but says she never bothered to look at what songs are on the album. This woman is a professional music critic - why would you bring up an album if you had no clue what material it contained? Then she slams \\"Rockin'\\" because it contains re-recordings of his earlier hits, not mentioning that was a common practice that everyone from Sinatra to Dinah Shore did at the time. I agree with a previous reviewer who said she was particularly harsh on Mr. Laine. Schoemer seems to have no idea of what he meant to audiences of the time. \\"The absence of sexiness in his voice, the bland bonhomie\\" she writes, then later saying he was \\"more chaste, less threatening\\" than early Sinatra. What she doesn't seem to know is that Laine's sexy performing style and R&B-flavored; crooning earned him the nickname Mr. Rhythm early in his career, and his rougher edges were seen as a bit unsettling compared to Sinatra's more traditional crooning. Also, and this is just a personal opinion: The man is about turn 93 - Has he done anything to merit such a bitter portrayal at this stage of his life?Even factually, some of the book seems off kilter. She says the Bear Family Connie Francis box sets sell for close to $300. Check amazon - the list price is under $130 for both English-language sets. I've had both since they were released; the prices haven't changed in that time. Schoemer says \\"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" starred Joan Crawford, who is nowhere to be found in that film (it stars Bette Davis and Olivia de Havilland) -- didn't this book go through fact-checking?Schoemer intersperses vignettes of her own life between the profiles, but it's all a bit clumsy. And while one not need be a fan to write about music, you should at least be able to appreciate it. Schoemer approaches the music with a snarky, campy, condescending eye, rather than hearing what made it so compelling to audiences in its original day. The music is still compelling -- if you're willing to listen with an open mind."},{"Title":"Great Pretenders: My Strange Love Affair with '50s Pop Music","review":"(Make that ** 1/2 stars)Make no mistake: Karen Schoemer's book is first and foremost about Karen Schoemer (including unwelcome details about her sex life). Her opinions on the artists she interviews are of little worth, seeing how the fullest extent of her \\"research\\" (she actually admits this!) was often to pop a \\"greatest hits\\" cassette into her car radio on the drive each \\"interview.\\" (She doesn't exactly print interviews with them -- snippets of interviews would be more accurate.)Schoemer \\"gets\\" the music of some of the artists, and totally misses that of others. She is utterly clueless when it comes to pre-rock and roll era stars like Patti Page, Georgia Gibbs and especially Frankie Laine. She's basically a rock critic attempting to \\"understand\\" her mother's attraction to pop rock (post-Page, Gibbs and Laine) music, so why these three artists were included is anybody's guess.My own guess is that their names are what is going to sell her book (anyway, that was my reason for buying it).Still, as frustrating as the book is when dealing with classic pop, the author manages to bring up two good points: 1) that rock and roll owes a large debt to the pop music that preceeded it; and 2) that loving an artist or a song is akin to a love affair. Okay, neither sentiment is particularly original or profound, but in the profusion of rock-oriented music \\"histories,\\" the first point needs to be stressed as often and in as many venues as possible.Schoemer fares best when interviewing former teen idols (male var.) from the early rock era (Fabian and Pat Boone), both of whom she developes large crushes on; supporting and illustrating the second of her second-hand points. When Schoemer is turned on by a star, she's more likely to get turned on by their music -- so her chapters on them (or, rather, on her reactions to them) are far more positive.It's unfortunate that the book wasn't written by someone who actually understands and enjoys the music of the great singers who are being \\"profiled.\\" Since the majority of readers purchasing the book are going to be fans of artists rather than the author, the coupling of Schoemer's narcissistic confessional style with her general ignorance of 50s pop, become nearly insurmountable flaws.The book also lacks pictures of the stars Schoemer \\"interviews.\\" I suppose this was done to keep down production costs; but since the author doesn't mention bringing a camera with her, the idea of showing fans how their favorite singers look probably never entered her head. (There is, however, a vanity shot of Schoemer on the inside of the dust cover.)What ultimately saves the book, however, is the author's interview with Georgia Gibbs. No, she doesn't get Gibbs' music -- she fails to appreciate Gibbs' beautiful voice and doesn't like her haunting ballads and torch songs. Still she gives us something that is priceless in its rarity -- an interview with Georgia Gibbs herself! That alone was worth the price of the book for me."},{"Title":"Great Pretenders: My Strange Love Affair with '50s Pop Music","review":"Normally I am caught up in books discussing much more serious subjects. It was time for a break. So when a friend told me he had just finished up Karen Schoemer's \\"Great Pretenders: My Strange Love Affair With 50's Pop Music\\" and offered me his copy I simply could not resist. In fact, I had almost purchased the book myself a couple of months ago. It was a book I had high hopes for and I wound up reading it in a single day. As one who has been collecting popular music for more than 40 years I hoped to gain some additional insight into the music of the early 1950's. Very little has been written about this period and much of what you do find is extremely negative. Most of the so called \\"enlightened\\" rock critics immediately dismiss the music of such artists as Pat Boone, Connie Francis and Patti Page as trite and superficial. Yet this music certainly struck a chord with millions of Americans in the early fifties. Karen Schoemer wanted to find out why and she certainly seemed to have the credentials. She wanted to know why her parents, her mom in particular, loved this stuff. So she decided to write a book about this era. She began this project back in 1999 and admittedly struggled with the concept over the next several years. In the end she wound up interviewing seven of the era's biggest stars. She chatted with Patti Page and Frankie Laine, Georgia Gibbs, Fabian, Tommy Sands and two of the biggest stars of early 50's pop Connie Francis and Pat Boone. Much to her surprise she discovered that most of these folks were anything but the stuffy, uptight people she expected to find. As of matter of fact she really did like most of them. And as her work on the book proceeded she found herself enjoying this music even more. She suddenly decided it was OK to enjoy this stuff despite what the so-called critics thought of it. Not everything she listened to had to be hip or loud or socially relevant. Karen Schoemer had discovered what made this music so attractive to her parents generation.\\"Great Pretenders: My Strange Love Affair with 50's Pop Music\\" is in fact a mighty strange book. I craved to learn more about the songs and about the artists Karen had a chance to speak with. Instead I came away frustrated that I did not find out as much about these people and their careers as I had expected. In general, I found \\"Great Pretenders\\" to be pretty unfocused at times and I certainly could have done without the frequent references to the authors personal life. For a project in the works for 7 years I would have to classify it as somewhat of a disappointment. In spite of all of its shortcomings I still managed to finish \\"Great Pretenders\\". I just happened to be in the mood for some lighter reading and it fit the bill perfectly. Though it was not a total waste of my time in the final analysis this is a book that clearly misses the mark. As such it is not a book that I can wholeheartedly recommend."},{"Title":"Great Pretenders: My Strange Love Affair with '50s Pop Music","review":"As a major enthusiast of the late '50s/early '60s teen sound, I was excited to check out this book. Unfortunately, Schoemer's attitude toward the music she's writing about is apparently the same attitude held by the vast majority of music critics, albeit wrapped in a different package. My first problem with this book is that the author doesn't seem to know what she's writing about. Several times in the introduction, she refers to \\"teen pop,\\" but only a few of the performers she features are truly teen pop. If she'd taken the time to research the teen sound instead of namedropping her hip indie rock pals, maybe she would have figured out that teen pop and pre-rock 'n' roll pop are not the same thing.I was also confused by her desire to write about this music before actually listening to any of it. From reading the introduction, I was able to gather that this book was some sort of response to her relationship with her mother. If that's the case, she should have written an autobiography. I was particulary upset by the chapter about the great Tommy Sands. Schoemer makes a big deal out of how much she wants to interview Tommy, and I can't blame her -- I'd love that opportunity myself. However, we soon learn that she's never even heard Tommy's music, and her main reason for wanting to interview him was because her mother liked him. She buys a CD of his Steady Date album, and describes his song \\"Teen-Age Crush\\" as \\"grotesque\\" and decides that the only way she can \\"enjoy\\" his music is to think of it as being so bad that it's good. This is an insult to both Tommy and the countless people who truly enjoy his music.While I appreciate the fact that Schoemer wants to revive interest in talented artists such as Tommy Sands, Fabian and Connie Francis, I wish that the author would have written this book because of a true love for their music. Instead, she seems more interested in herself and proving other music critics \\"wrong.\\" Since Schoemer is supposedly a music writer, I would have hoped that she'd realize that music is not about being \\"wrong\\" or \\"right,\\" but about simply loving the music. Unfortunately, that is not the case with this book."},{"Title":"Great Pretenders: My Strange Love Affair with '50s Pop Music","review":"Why do below average authors get their boring books published and other,more talented ones go by the wayside? Just asking...Having read this book in one sitting I can't begin to imagine the waste of beautiful trees..The so-called \\"interviews\\" with the singers were seemingly written by a fifth grader. They were one-dimensional and completely uninformative. Why the author felt anyone would be interested in her personal family upbringing and life is something only she can figure out. Obviously she knows someone in the publishing industry with poor judgement in book selection.I hope someone writes a more worthy book on this subject. She certainly didn't."},{"Title":"Great Pretenders: My Strange Love Affair with '50s Pop Music","review":"It'a an ambitious look with a complicated thesis and perhaps only a really theoretically comfortable writer might have pulled it off, someone like Greil Marcus or the late Lillian Roxon for example. Basically we have been led to believe that pop music entered a steep decline after Elvis joined the army and before the Liverpool invasion of December 1963. Schoemer argues that it was not as bad as all that, which isn't that much of a thesis, but it's interesting to think about. She reproduces a typical top 100 pop list for a week in 1959, and a mere survey of the list proves her very point that American pop music, even in what was supposedly the worst of times, had a richness and a depth and a freshness that you just can't associate with the second rate.Wasn't it CS Lewis said that the health of a country depends on the richness and multiplicity of its minor writers--not its great superstars, but the everyday writers in the background? Schoemer has something of the sort to prove here, and yet her book lacks the requisite concision and force to make its case. Two huge problems get in the way. Number one, her own personal saga (and her problems with her mother) might be the single dullest storyline of any work of creative non fiction of the past 20 years. Reading this book, you just can't believe she held down a professional job (music critic at NEWSWEEK?) for she comes across as a self-obsessed blogger.Problem number two, is that she decides to hone in on seven pop stars of the period, which might have been an OK strategy, had she been able to bring even one iota of insight into any of them. Patti Page comes off best, but Schoemer's just not prepared enough to do a proper interview. Patronizing isn't the word. She wastes their time with her ill-defined \\"Tell me what you meant to girls of my mother's generation\\" questions.

Then came this: \\" . . . jazz coronetist Sidney Bechet.\\" Now I suppose one could have meant \\"clarinetist\\", or even may have mistakenly thought Bechet played cornet, or even conflated the two, but from that point, I found it difficult to take seriously anything in the book, given either the author's or editor's carelessness in regard to this point. Furthermore, I was constantly distracted by mental images of someone trying to play a coronet: can't blow into it, so I guess you'd have to bang it like a tambourine (which this pair would probably render as 'trampoline.')Hardly a book goes by in which you can't find some egregious editorial error of this sort. One would think Simon & Schuster could pay enough to obtain competent editorial help. As for Ms. Schoemer, as a would-be music critic of the stature to which she aspires in these pages, she simply should have known better.As noted elsewhere in these reviews, instances of this sort keep cropping up, and I found my interest (and Ms. Schoemer's credibility) slowly dwindling.

Of the seven, Pat Boone comes across as the most integrated fully rounded personality, truly someone who seems to bear no grudges or in any way feel intimidated by his many critics.

And this is where the fascinating questions come up. What makes good music good and bad music bad? Do marketers of music have an obligation to deliver a challenging, creative product? Most of all, why has rock'n'roll history as we now know it been tweaked to marginalize the impact of squeaky-clean pop vocalists, making them pariahs while issuing sainthood to performers like Elvis, Johnny Cash, and Chuck Berry? Schoemer's digging into Billboard charts and crates of musty records reveals that pop music at the time was not so clearly defined as critics choose to see it now through a somewhat distorted lens.That's the meat of the book. Scheomer's own struggles with chronic fandom and family tension take up a great deal of space, however, and they distract from the larger picture. A little less of Schomer's story would have allowed more of the profiles of the pop statrs as they are today, and it is in these segments that the multiple threads of \\"Great Pretenders\\" bind together into an enlightening whole."},{"Title":"Curse of Carranca","review":"Persis Bradbury is 6 foot tall and blue-eyed who believes she is engaged until her boyfriend dumps her for a blonde model and since she is so tall it's hard to find a guy of the appropriate height and she ends up asking her boss to send her to Madrid to work on a project for the company.

If you are looking to feel sorry for her, this is not the book for you. Elsie Lee wrote a story that was the inspiration for me to become an independent woman.The plot is filled with twists and turns, as well as some hysterically funny scenes. As in the other reviews, it involves a prophecy, hidden wartime secrets and and an amazing tale of a woman who grows into herself. She also happens to have a cat, Shadrach, who can be bribed by chicken wings.If you have the chance to pick up this book, I highly recommend you do so. I have had my copy since 1966. It is well loved and never fails to give a good read when I need one, so I will never give it up. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Curse of Carranca","review":"This is one of Elsie Lee's best mystery-romance titles in my permanent collection. Both plot development and character growth as the book proceeds are delightful...particularly the wife's reactionwhen she sees her husband attempting to treat her as a possession rather than a partner. The Amazon delivery was both timely and just as advertised. Thanks again."},{"Title":"Redgauntlet","review":"I find &quot;Redgauntlet&quot; one of the less satisfactory novels in the Waverley series. Certainly, it has the local flavor, the dialect, the imaginative description of evocative landscapes all his novels have, but it is not a blast as some of the others are. The plot involves a fictitious third Jacobite rebellion, and it is interesting to see how Scott (especially in the notes from the Magnum edition, included in this edition) argues this time not for the historicity but for the historical probability of the events described. While Scott is often hailed as the inventor of the historical novel, &quot;Redgauntlet&quot; also shows him to be a forerunner in the historically probable novel--a genre practiced to great effect by our present-day history buff, Umberto Eco.But probability alone does not a great novel make. Darsie Latimer's character is even less probable than his semi-historical counterparts, such as Edmund Waverley and Henry Morton. And this is strange, since moving further into fictionality, one could argue, a writer might allow themselves more latitude to make a character interesting, even if certain circumstances remain historical. Is this a conscious effort on Scott's part to show, after the fictionality of history, the fictionality of fiction?Scott disturbs narrative conventions even further when the conspiracy against the Hanoverian King George III completely fails to materialize--ironically, for what seems to be the silliest of reasons: the Pretender (or the Chevalier if you're a Jacobite), Charles Stuart, refuses to give up his mistress. Thus, the main plot of the novel sizzles out and really not much happens in these 400 pages. Mind you, I personally don't need much to happen, but the 19th century novel did. Scott as a postmodern writer? That is pushing it too far, but this novel awaits a postmodern critique enlightened by a reading of Eco and Bakhtin.That said, there are some really interesting things going on. Apart from the &quot;regular&quot; set of characters of Scott's Scottish novels, this one features an orthodox Quaker who is the epitome of anti-militant mercantilism. The form is also quite new for Scott--the novel is an epistolary, a set of letters between Darsie Latimer and his friend Alan Fairford. Thus, the novel's first-person point of view is split, and this provides for interesting contrasts.For me, Scott sort of shot himself in the foot with this novel. His earlier novels (&quot;Redgauntlet&quot; is the last of the Scottish novels, written eight years before his death) lead one to expect a major action to happen before the denouement, and this one avoids that a bit too artificially. It seems that Scott was at pains to stick to history, and his own political convictions, a bit too much: a fictitious Jacobite rebellion is OK as a narrative vehicle, but it shouldn't interfere with the peaceful Great Britain (in which Scotland was in many respects subsidiary to England) that Scott himself inhabited and advocated. And so narrative excitement has to give way to Scott's pacifist politics--an honest choice, which Scott consistently maintains in all the Waverley novels--and character development and politics take precedent.A final note: Scott has always proven himself a masterful and honest critic of royalty and nobility, especially of those characters he seems to love. &quot;Waverley&quot;'s Mac-Ivor is chastised for his political obstinacy, in &quot;The Fortunes of Nigel&quot; King James I (a Scot) is rebuked for his fickleness and corruption, and in &quot;Redgauntlet&quot; the formerly charismatic Stuart proves effeminate and tragic (dying an impoverished alcoholic, in the footnotes). And often enough, these tragic characters are of more interest than the somewhat ineffectual and sometimes foolish main characters: something for readers of literature to sink their teeth into."},{"Title":"Redgauntlet","review":"Redgauntlet is generally considered to be one of Scott's best novels. It is set in 1765 and returns to the theme of his first novel Waverley, describing an attempt to overthrow the Hanoverian monarchy and return Britain to the rule of the exiled Stuarts. Of course there was no Jacobite rising in 1765, so Redgauntlet is not, strictly speaking, an historical novel. The story however is consistent with the history of the period and plausibly shows what might have happened. The novel is all the more powerful and poignant because he does not attempt to create an imaginary rebellion on the scale of 1745, but rather describes a revolt which history might have been unaware of, a last small scale, almost pathetic, attempt to resurrect a cause which had already, long since, been lost.The story is initially told by means of a series of letters between Darsie Latimer and Alan Fairford, two young friends who have grown up together. There is a mystery regarding Darsie's family origins. He knows almost nothing about his background except that he must not set foot in England until he is 21. Gradually, as Darsie discovers more about the secrets surrounding his life, he is brought deeper into a conspiracy. Alan is warned by the beautiful \\"Green Mantle\\" that Darsie is in danger. But Darsie fails to heed the warning and soon faces a man who knows all about his past, the fearsome Redgauntlet.Scott tells the story well. The epistolary form works well enough, given the at times inherent implausibility of this way of writing, where letters go on for an unreasonably large number of pages. The story is exciting with lots of incident and action and a good number of surprises. The romantic element of the plot is unusual involving both Alan and Darsie with \\"Green Mantle\\". Perhaps best of all is the genuinely creepy short story \\"Wandering Willie's Tale\\" which lives up to its reputation as the best short story in Scots. This story is often anthologised, but it is even better when read in its proper context.The edition of Redgauntlet edited by G.A.M. Wood and David Hewitt is undoubtedly the best possible version of Scott's text. This edition takes as its base text the first edition. The editors have also consulted Scott's manuscript and, unusually in the case of Redgauntlet, the proofs, which show Scott's corrections to the first draft of the printed text. By doing this the editors have been able to restore many lost readings and correct numerous mistakes. In addition this edition has a full glossary and extensive notes. A little effort is required to read Redgauntlet, as Scott's language can at times be quite difficult, but this effort is amply rewarded, for his story of the last rising of the Jacobites is one of his greatest creations."},{"Title":"Redgauntlet","review":"In his 1824 novel REDGAUNTLET, Sir Walter Scott says farewell to the dethroned Stuart Dynasty with its colorful, haughty claims to the Crowns of Scotland and England. Law and a commercial order comfortable to property owners have taken root by the time of the third Hanoverian King and displaced the older claims of personal and clan loyalty to a God-anointed sovereign. England, and increasingly Scotland, now make up a nation of shopkeepers and overseas traders and their souls are content. Even those of smugglers.The two principal characters, men in their early 20s, can be objects of gentle fun, as they hastily and clumsily grow up. Yet these youngsters (and two young women they meet and admire) represent the future of the United Kingdom. Initially, in the summer of 1765, the two, newly minted lawyer Alan Fairford and his dreamy laid-back alter-ego Darsie Latimer, are at least a little bit open to the romance of the \\"auld days.\\" Like many Romantic Movement heroes, Darsie is not sure who he is. In addition to the usual reluctance to allow himself to be defined by profession, church, state, older adults, etc., Darsie does not know who were his parents. Strong hints are that he will know as soon as he turns 21. Meanwhile he is to avoid leaving Scotland at any cost. Alan has delicate health and is the dutiful son of an overbearing lawyer of Edinburgh. He uncharacteristically rebels and strikes out on his own when Darsie is violently carried away across the firth of Solway into northwestern England. That deed was done by persons unknown but increasingly suspected to be using Darsie as a pawn. Slowly, it becomes clear that Darsie's rebel uncle, Hugh Redgauntlet, is using the young hero to mobilize support for a fresh rising in England and Scotland to put the Old Pretender back on a throne that he had rolled the dice for 20 years earlier in the crushed rising of 1745.There are many ways and levels for reading Scott's historical novels. One, followed by thousands since Scott's death in 1832, is to find lessons for today's world in the pasts of England and Scotland. Many Americans grew up in a world echoing the skepticism of Nanty Ewart (Vol. II, Ch. 13, p. 250), \\"Tell that to the marines -- the sailors won't believe it.\\" And might not the US in Iraq in 2006 spring to mind when Darsie Latimer is said to fall easily in and out of puppy loves like a \\"Mahratta conqueror, who overruns a province with the rapidity of lightning, but finds it impossible to retain it beyond a very brief space\\" ( Vol. III. Ch. 4, p. 290).Or we can enjoy REDGAUNTLET for its striking comparisons. Darsie, for example, has learned enough of the uncle who kidnapped him to know that his laying on violent hands had been for no personal gain. \\"... he could as soon have imagined Cassius picking Caesar's pocket, instead of drawing his poniard upon the Dictator\\" (p. 293). And \\"Freedom of religious opinion brings on, I suppose, freedom of political creed\\" ... (p. 303).REDGAUNTLET is a wise, complex tale by one of the world's greatest story tellers.-OOO-"},{"Title":"Life is Tremendous","review":"I saw Charlie \\"Tremendous\\" Jones live and in person back in 1978 in Harrisburg, Pa. when the old PMA rallies were going strong. He appeared along with Dr. Peale.What impresses me about Jones is that he is funny, charismatic but has a powerful message too.Life is Tremendous is another one of those small books that sometimes gets overlooked because of it's small size. This book is only 105 pages and can easily be read in one evening or even in less than an hour. But it should be read over and over. It is outstanding. Charlie will get you laughing and provide a very powerful message.To really appreciate Charlie Jones, listen to one of his cd's or audio cassette tapes. He will get you rolling and you will come away with ideas you never thought of before. One of my favorite quotes from Charlie is:\\"It's not how hard you fall, but how high you can bounce backfrom adversity that counts.\\"AND...\\"All leaders are readers.\\"Want to be good leader?

I loved it."},{"Title":"Life is Tremendous","review":"&iexcl;Life is Tremendous&iexcl; is like a guide for everyone&iexcl;s life. It guides readers to find out the meaning of life, and how to become good leaders and successors. The author focuses on leading readers to be optimistic and enthusiastic to their lives by building up a positive attitude and a fine personality, since he believes enthusiasm makes the difference. It gave us a clear picture of how to build up an active attitude, which helps us to be a positive person. Besides, this book also told us how to face eleven common problems in our daily life, such as nervous, difficulties, fear, etc. And readers will discover that, the author always told us to rely on God, and leave our problems and difficulties to God.Many people may not agree that life is tremendous. But I am sure that, after reading this book, you will change your mind. As it gave me lots of constructive opinion for my life. The most impressed idea from the author is that if I believe, then I can do it. After reading this book, when I handle a task that I think I may not able to complete, I told myself I believe that I can do it, then I did it with a good result. What I think is that, it is confidence. No matter what happens, if you have confident, then you can do it.Besides, he told us we have to get excited about our work. I think it is true that living is not doing what we like to do; it is doing what we have to do. For myself, I will feel boredom for the studies, but when I think of the reasons of studying, which is aimed at helping me to gain more knowledge and broaden the experience of my life, then I will become energetic and excited about my studies again. On the other hand, the author reminded me &iexcl;production to perfect&iexcl; is very important. Although I have many planning in my mind, however, if I do not start to do, I will never succeed. Apart from having a flexible planning for myself, implementing what I have planned is critical to perfect.There are some areas related to religion in this book. As a Christian, this book reminds me to rely on our God. Very often, when I was busying with my work, I will forget my beloved God, I will just rely on myself and forget my power is from our God. But this book reminds me that I can hand-over all my problems to our God, and I will become peaceful.This book will lead you to think more deeply about your lives, and you will find out many useful perspectives and suggestions to improve your life quality. If you want to have a happy, healthy and productive life, this is a book which highly recommend to you.Written By Ng Shuk Yee Shirley (City University of Hong Kong - Marketing Department)"},{"Title":"Life is Tremendous","review":"I have been reading &amp; re-reading this book for YEARS, ever since it first came out.

It's truly a \\"SIB KIS\\" work of art. I have had the pleasure of hearing the author speak and most recently a 90 minute private tour of his business where he personally directed me to classics by Oswald Chambers, Spurgeon and could quote passages and find their location from memory. This visit was unannounced and Charlie had just returned from a chemo treatment! Charlie is living proof of his claims and if any one doubts the connection he makes with our creator to these principles needs to spend just five minutes with him to understand their validity. Charlie is \\"suffering\\" with terminal prostate cancer. Yet to see him, be hugged by him and hear the energy in his soul would put most young people to shame. Charlie has no fear of his future and actually is looking forward to this next phase of his \\"journey\\". I have read many books that \\"tell\\" people how to live. Charlie actually lives his philosophy and tells them to stop trying to be perfect and enjoy the one who is! If you read this book years ago and found it helpful, read it again as odds are you situation in life has changed, but fortunately these principles have not.

The authors believe that every one can be happy, relaxed, healthy and secure in today's high-pressure society through development of certain personalities and attitudes. In fact, attitude is very important; it affects our thinking and ways of doing things. If we have positive and enthusiastic attitude, every problem can be solved and everything can be done. We need to get involved in our occupation and give heart to do it, then we will be success. The authors also quoted many daily examples that make us more easily to understand the principles and make the book more lively and interesting.After reading this book, it really changed my attitude. I'm now always thinking positively and to be more get involved and enthusiastic when doing something. This book taught us to see things from different angles, and we will find that actually everything has a positive side. Moreover, we need to seek some benefits from the problem, in fact, having a problem is not a bad thing since we will get something valuable inside the problem. The authors also mentioned that self confidence is very important, if we believe that we can do it, then we really can do it.

The book's extensive bibliography shows that the naturalist author drew from a wide range of primary scientific sources to weave together uniquely interesting information regarding the inter-relationships of organisms in these neo-tropical environments. Most readers will welcome these brief but intriguing natural history accounts, and will be pleased that the author selected to describe only the most abundantly observed species. Personally, my only regret was that the book wasn't considerably longer. I have tried hard to find other, more in-depth, guides to the natural history of this region, but there simply don't seem to be any.

The authors did a beautiful job of putting this together-the artwork, the photographs, the biographical element and the descriptions of Baltimore neighborhoods &amp; landmarks (and other)."},{"Title":"Baltimore's Own Little Italy Artist: the Artwork of Tony DeSales","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in street art and the Baltimore area. It is packed with Tony's beautiful artwork and the authors' detailed stories of the area. Every Baltimorean should own a copy. Rita and her co-authors have done a superb job."},{"Title":"Baltimore's Own Little Italy Artist: the Artwork of Tony DeSales","review":"Rita D. French, Perrin L. French and Irvin F. Lin Baltimore's Own Little Italy Artist: The artwork of Tony De Sales (Genovefa Press P.O. Box 50954, Palo Alto, CA 94303 www.genovefapress.com), 2003, 224 pp. $29.95This volume spotlights the artwork of Tony De Sales. His pen and ink drawings, some colored with crayon or simple paint, documented the architectural details and settings of his origins in working class Baltimore. Tony's sister, Rita De Sales French, and brother-in-law, Perrin L. French, unite Tony's life story with his artwork.For thirty five years Tony maintained his \\"outdoor\\" studio and sales room at the corner of Fawn and High streets in Little Italy, an intersection frequented by locals, tourists and celebrities en route to see the sights of this historic and culinary-rich area of Baltimore. Tony's grandparents, his paternal side from Palermo, his maternal side from Warsaw, arrived in Baltimore in the early part of the 20th century. At an early age Tony became the family mainstay-his parents separated and his mother, Genevieve, suffered from mental illness. He never married and helped to raise his younger siblings and later cared for his mother until her death in 1998. On good summer days Genevieve would sit with him as he worked and greeted passersby.The people he met on his corner of Little Italy often became friends. He gave them postcards of his prints to mail back to him when they returned to their homes across the U.S. and the world.The book is filled with reproductions of Tony's artwork and some photos of the actual scenes he drew accompanied with descriptive text. The book covers the span of his artwork: Little Italy, Baltimore Harbor at Fells Point and seaway, Annapolis and places outside Maryland that Tony visited.This volume makes a perfect gift for collectors of Italian American art, devotees of maritime and urban landscape art. It would serve well as a souvenir for tourists to Baltimore, Annapolis and Washington D.C. and a rewarding way for residents of the Baltimore-Washington D.C. corridor to learn and appreciate the place they call home."},{"Title":"Baltimore's Own Little Italy Artist: the Artwork of Tony DeSales","review":"This book is a unique combination of biography, city-history, and insight into the feelings and production of a gifted, self-taught artist. Tony DeSales overcame limitations of means and circumstance to bear witness to the city and neighborhood he loved.The authors of this book, in turn, do justice to the artist's life and deep-felt monochrome and color sketches. Writing, production, and reproduction of the artwork are all first-rate.This book is a bargain at its price, and is priceless for those who share Tony DeSales' love for Baltimore."},{"Title":"Baltimore's Own Little Italy Artist: the Artwork of Tony DeSales","review":"The book I bought was priced resemably and was in great shape as well as being delivered in a timely fashion...I would have no problem in purchasing from this buyer again....the book was a great flashback to a time when Little Italy was at its best. Im sure the streets of Little Italy miss Tony and all the attention he brought to the area from visitors from all over the world. Thank you Rita for allowing us a glimpse into the life of Tony and your family.Keith Baker"},{"Title":"Mega Memory","review":"While Kevin Trudeau right now seems to be shaking up the FTC, the FDA and other government agencies, drug companies and food companies with his #1 best selling book Natural Cures \\"They\\" Don't Want you to kow about, Kevin really cut his teeth as a memory expert.I first heard about this program about 10 years ago, but forgot about it (that is a joke) and only recently purchased it. In fact, I did have a horrible memory or at least I thought I did. Like good health and nutrition, memory is more a matter of doing the right things and mastering the right strategies. Kevin Trudeau offers an easy system to show how to do just that.Kevin Trudeau is the world's leading authority on memory. He has appeared on numerous television shows, conducted seminars and helped no doubt millions to achieve previously unattainable goals with memory enhancement.This program is like mental aerobics. It stimulates your brain cells and helps to unleash previously untapped potential in this case, memory power.When I did the first few exercises, I was uncomfortable. Sort of like physical exercise. This program stimulates the brain cells causing neurotransmitters to be increasingly released and stimulated.Kevin acts like a coach. These are not just easy listening cd's that you casually listen to, the program and the cd's are like a live workkshop with Kevin acting as your personal coach. After you go through a particular exercise, Kevin will review it and ask you to answer specific questions.For example, one technique Kevin teaches is to turn numbers into a phonetic equalivent. Kevin will call out some numbers and ask you for the answer. He then says if you can't respond at the speed he asks, you need to go back over the material and do the exercise again.Before using this program, I had a horrible memory and while I am not where I want to be, I have made tremendous progress in a short time. Remembering names, phone numbers and training material is easy and fun. I can remember more in less time than before. What turned me on to this program was when a friend of mine easily memorized the names of over 600 people he had just met. He told me that it was using this program that helped him achieve that.Mega Memory is a great program and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Mega Memory","review":"I bought the audio cassette Mega Memory Program back in 1993 while at was at Harvard Law School.

Not only has our memory improved drastically, it has added a new spark to our marriage of 25 years. Truly! This technique enhances one's creativity, which too often is allowed to lie dormant. It has not only challenged us to think differently, but, in so doing, has produced numerous smiles and good, hearty belly-laughter from both of us.In response to others' reviews:RE the user who was annoyed by Trudeau's voice: I personally found his voice to be pleasant to listen to. I'd actually mentioned to my husband that he had a good voice ... relieved that it was NOT annoying to listen to. Goes to show that it's all a matter of personal taste.RE the \\"warning\\" of 2-15-05 Sites: does the lawsuit referred to have any bearing on the effectiveness of these memory techniques? None whatsoever.RE \\"Kevin does a poor job of presenting the material\\": even though a few areas were unclear, clarity came after listening to subsequent lessons.

However, it did take a lot of work and some of the exercises seemed overly simple at the time. There are one or two techniques that i skipped as i felt that the time invested in them would now be worth what I would get out of it (remembering cards is an example, a lot of work and I dont play cards enough to make this worth it)If you read this book go ahead and break his rule about not reading ahead. Although he claims you should not do this, it will allow you to see if each exercise is worth doing.My only complaint is that the book is written in a simple tone and at times seems to be designed for children. This got annoying after a while. I also found the book to be too long as he fills up some chapters with personal stories to illustrate the success of his method. These stories probably are not true to begin with and most of them are boring.That said, if you want to improve your memory, buy the book.

Clearly the concepts applied here can be applied to other small houses, but the majority of the houses in this book are for wealthy people who can afford second or part-time homes.

It has an interesting plot and some great moments, but is a little loose in the dialogue and suffers from periodic bouts of disjointed pacing. It's like a star running back recovering from a torn ligament. There's a lot of solid muscle and talent there, but with the connectve tissue damaged he just can't play up to his former potential. He's still better than most of other guys, but slowed down just enough to level the playing field a bit.I have enjoyed Ms. Holders books in the past, especially those written with Chris Golden. That may be the reason I am a little disappointed here. This is a good book that has some incredible siblings that came before it. I tend to think that one more revision or possibly a stronger editor could have lifted this work to the same level as those that came before.It is definately worth a read, especially for die hard Buffy Fans, but if you really want a great Slayer book(s) check out the Gatekeeper Trilogy.

I found myself having to flip back quite a bit to remind myself of who certain characters were and what the new chapters were referring to.I liked the introduction of India as the Slayer who preceded Buffy. She reminded me a bit of the season five version of Buffy in her willingness to sacrifice herself for someone she loved. I also liked the exploration of the four elements and how they related to each Slayer.One thing that I had a problem with was that Buffy and Faith seemed to be lacking their healing time. The book referred to Faith as needing stitches for an injury that she received, which seemed odd since even when the Slayers have serious injuries (except when Faith was in a coma on the show), it rarely takes them more than a day to recover.

Clearly, the big evil is linked to the Slayer's nightmares, which revolve around four figures: one burning, one dripping wet, one covered in mud, one shrouded in windswept linen. Each carries a box of grafted skin and bone. Giles learns that the last Slayer to encounter a similar container was India Cohen--Buffy's immediate predecessor. Strangely, Buffy has never given much thought to the young girl whose death activated her own Slayerdom, but now she must draw on the strength of those who came before her. For Buffy is being stalked by a monstrous force that journeys through time, fortifying itself by draining the primal power of a Slayer. Buffy must orien herself on a continuum against evil that predates even humanity itself. . . .\\"REVIEWThe Book of Fours is an impressive accomplishment, and it's obvious why Pocket Books gave it the prestige of a hardcover launch. Spanning several countries, centuries, and even dimensions, The Book of Fours is the most complex Buffy novel I've read to date--indeed, it's one of the few that begs for a second read to take everything in. To put it another way: the novel opens with the apocalypse, and then things really get rolling . . .The plot of The Book of Fours involves an ancient demon/god called The Gatherer, and his hunger for power that comes from the blood of Slayers. Served by humans, demons, and special beings called The Wanderers, The Gatherer remains a largely unseen character in the novel--most of the dirty work is done by his followers. Without going into excessive detail, suffice it to say that the threat he presents to Sunnydale can only be overcome if four Slayers are present to stop him--unfortunately, only two are alive (Buffy and Faith), and that's one more than normal. The solution? A trip to the Ghostlands, one of the resting places of the dead, to find the spirits of Kendra and India Cohen (Buffy's predecessor as Slayer) and ask them to temporarily take over the bodies of human hosts in order to the fight the Gatherer and his minions.The novel does an amazing job of fleshing out India, Kendra, and their Watchers (Kit Bothwell and Sam Zabuto, respectively). Characterization of the main Scooby Gang members is right on target, and Holder does an especially good job of showing the characters interacting with each other in ways different than the standard Bronze scenes of many Buffy novels. Two things require special praise: the depiction of Faith, who can easily become either a caricature or a character without an edge; and a scene where Willow is in a car accident--even though I knew she couldn't really \\"die\\", it still had me turning the pages compulsively with my heart racing to see what would happen next.Interestingly enough, The Book of Fours is the first Buffy novel I've seen to incorporate original settings and characters from other Buffy novels--for example, there are references to the events of Spike & Dru: Pretty Maids All in a Row and to the Gatekeeper Trilogy. If there are any downsides to the novel it's probably that simply too much stuff is thrown in--it's hard to keep track of all of the different characters, and some of the minor subplots (like Xander's cousin becoming ill) should probably have been trimmed. Quibbles aside, however, The Book of Fours is one of the best Buffy novels I've ever read and is highly recommended.Jhaeman's Buffy Reviews: http://www.geocities.com/jhaeman(c) 2004, Jeremy Patrick-Justice"},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"Having recently devoured the Sons of Entropy triology, I found Nancy Holder's latest book very disappointing.

But according to most people it seems the author of the book was the problem.Gernerally, i don't notice the authors of the books when i first pick up the book, but as i was reading the reviews for this book, i noticed that Nancy Holder is the one where people always say that books are always to confusing, have too much information, or jump back and forth to many times for a person to understand.I still do not understand what exactly happened in The Book of Fours. I know that it was meant to focus on the four slayers, two live ones and two dead ones, but all the other plots did not fit in with the story. i also thought that the ending was to hard to follow and the prolouge at the beginning made no sense in refrence to the rest of the book.The only semi-good thing about this book was that it focused on the life on the slayer before Buffy, India. I really wanted to know who she was since they never mention her on the show. Although they did mention her and she was one of the main parts of the book, i firmly believe that this book has ruined any more furthur stories any Buffy author wants to write about India."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"I read this book this past summer in the absence of any new Buffy episodes on television. I wanted something that would give me the feeling I get when I watch the show. I wanted to be excited, intrigued, amused--on the edge of my seat. This book presents none of this. The premise of learning more about the Slayer who came before Buffy is very intriguing as is the hope that we will see Kendra, Faith, Buffy and India (Buffy's predecessor) all kicking some major demon butt. Yet the book fails to live up to the standards that the show so often successfully delivers. The set-up to the big fight is way too long and full of so much extraneous information that never really comes into play. There are also waaay too many characters here and not enough Scooby-Gang interplay; too much backstory and not enough &quot;in-the-library&quot; plotting. The story jumps all over the place and there are too many things going on at once. Despite all this, there are a couple of things worth mentioning. Firstly, the character of India is fairly well-rounded and interesting. Other things to note are a Spike and Dru cameo and a couple of good Oz &quot;scenes&quot;, though a &quot;wink-wink&quot;-Seth Green reference may make you groan out loud. All in all, this is an unsatisfying adventure and proof that if Joss Whedon isn't at the helm for the dramatic twists of the chosen one, then things in Sunnydale are pretty much as &quot;authentic&quot; as the Buffy-Bot."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"I found that the problem with this book is that it had too many flashbacks and not enough story &quot;in the now&quot;. It seems as if Ms. Holder got carried away with the flashbacks then realised she had a page limit so squashed the ending down to fit it in. There are too many useless flashbacks which do nothing but frustrate the reader. The ending is too rushed and is not the same as the bit at the beginning. When I first read the book, I was nearly at the end when I thought that the book was a 2-parter, as there was no sign the book was nearly at an end. In trying to fit the ending into about 10 pages, Ms Holder loses a TREMENDOUS amount of detail. I would also have liked to have learnt more about India Cohen. She seems like an interesting character, but we could have learnt more about her. I also found the bit about Xander's cousin a useless side plot. I didn't even realise they were talking about Xander until the end, but it just sounded so silly.Ms. Holder's books are usually very entertaining, but unfortunately this one gets lost among flashbacks.In conclusion, this book could have been fantastic, but instead, I wish I hadn't bought it."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"This book was nothing like Buffy at all. The author had the characters saying and doing things they would never do, especially Faith. It's like Faith was a whole other character. If you want to read a really good buffy book Christopher Golden is a great Buffy author."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"I am an avid reader and love all things Buffy but this book now holds the title for worst thing I have ever read. It's so bad I felt compelled to warn others that reading the blurb for next week's Buffy episode will be more enjoyable and fulfilling. The story's premise is a fine one however, Ms. Holder's writings are a structural nightmare. She should limit her efforts to Watcher's Guides and leave fiction out of the mix."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"Nancy Holder is held in high regard by public opinion as a competent writer. Of course, most people tend to forget that her best works were co-written by Christopher Golden, a superior writer who more than makes up for Holder's inadequacies. Simple comparison shows that when it comes to this dynamic duo, Golden outshines her in every way. And while Golden established himself as a literary genius with &quot;Pretty Maids All In A Row&quot; and &quot;The Lost Slayer&quot;, Nancy Holder's &quot;The Book of Fours&quot; painfully demonstrates her shortcomings as a solo writer.Firstly, the most annoying element in this book is not Fire or Air, but Ms. Holder's blasted habit of telling her stories without any linear context. The climax is delivered in the first few pages and then repeated (with little to no similarity) in the end. Throughout the book we are taken backwards and forwards through time with no consistency: Buffy is talking to Giles, then she's dreaming of Kendra, except we don't know she fell asleep until the next chapter. Willow is clinically dead and then revived, but she appears on the Ghost Roads after recovering. Faith flirts with a few men at the Fish Tank, the story moves on and then suddenly jumps back to a man she danced with. Vampires plan to resurrect the Master even though this is Season Three and his bones have been crushed to powder. Axes are flying all around Sunnydale and you'll never know who has what and how they got it.Secondly, there are far too many characters in this novel, and most of them are completely useless. Kevin Harris, Holly Johnson, Micaela Tomassi, Simon Lafitte, Tervokian and countless others appear and disappear from the story with little to no effect. And the fact that their stories are never resolved only leaves the reader frustrated (i.e. WAS there any reason the Wanderer of Water chased Holly Johnson? Is she a future Slayer? Did Micaela and Neema return to the Council? What happened to Tervokian? And what did the &quot;Kevin Harris cancer&quot; plotline have to do with anything? It had no impact on the story; Kevin's mother wasn't even NAMED, for God's sake, and she had more lines than he did). So what Ms. Holder ultimately accomplishes is handing you a horribly-underdeveloped main plot and an assortment of sub-plots you either don't care for or don't understand.That, of course, is my main bone of contention with this book. Holder's worst mistake, both in this and other novels she's worked on alone, is paying too much attention to details and not enough with the big picture. The concept of four Slayers banding together, of Buffy discovering the truth about India and maybe even learning from her (mainly that emotions aren't always a good thing for a Slayer to have; India let her love for Kit blind her and she stupidly sacrificed herself instead of finding a way to stop the Wanderers) is a good thing. But India Cohen's scenes are few and far between, as are Kendra's, and by the end of the book you still don't have enough about her to see her as a &quot;fleshed-out&quot; character. Disappointingly amusing for a book subtitled &quot;A Historie of Four Slayers&quot;. Instead of having a cohesive, consistent plot and characters, you have bits and pieces of stories that don't connect in any way, and you're left rather rudely unsatisfied.Finally, another hideous flaw Ms. Holder's books suffer from is underdevelopment of crucial scenes. The final battle against the Gatherer is a confusing mess of metaphors and impossible events, and even after you finish the book it's still unclear exactly HOW Buffy defeated it. There's talk of needing four Slayers, and four friends, and four Wanderers, and four Axes, and the final resolution has nothing to do with any of this.All in all, a mediocre read from a mediocre writer."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"I can't say enough how much I loved this book.

One of my friends, a bigger Angel fan, asked me if Buffy was the first Slayer, and, having read The Book of Fours, I was able to explain it to her better. This book cleared things up along the history lines of the Slayers and it was a good read, but really slow in the middle."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"The problem with all the hard-cover 'blockbuster' Buffy novels thus far is their attempt at being grand epics which start off with a bang and gather promising momentum before crashing and burning with an unsatisfying fizzle. .... The premise is intriguing enough - Buffy and Faith have to fight and defeat the Wanderers,4 mummy henchmen of an evil force known as the Gatherer which needs the Slayers' primal life-force to incarnate itself into this Earth. However,to do that,they have to join forces with lovesick India and anal Kendra,Buffy and Faith's dead predecessors respectively. If that isn't bad enough, the Wanderers have brought calamities with them to Sunnydale like raging forest fires, tidal waves, hurricanes and earthquakes.The Gatherer's slutty voodoo queen Consort,meanwhile,is busy playing all sides against one another even as she schemes to rule the world with the Gatherer's power. Confused already?Well,you're not the only one. The narrative then plods on with gratuitous flashbacks,unnecessary characters who annoy rather than enlighten with their irrelevance(until now,I'm wondering what [in the world] Xander's cousin has to do with the overall plot)and cameos by Spike,Dru,Willy and a host of other characters from the previous hardcover novels and the Gatekeeper Trilogy.Oh,and let's not forget another dead Slayer,Lucy Hanover. ..."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"This is an amazing book!! It stays true to the show as the dialouge stays true to the chars. I have a lot I want to say about this wonderful book.First I want to talk about the chars in this book. The one that stands out the most is Faith. Holder takes the reader in a journey into the world of Faith. Her thoughts, feelings, and at times her jealous feelings. The show has hinted to Faith's pasts, and what makes her tick....this book, goes where the show leaves off. At times, the reader will feel compassion for her. She just wants what Buffy has. Friends, a watcher, and a mother who loves her. Faith has a tough outter shell, but under that shell is what the reader will discover.The plot is one for a great movies would be made. A big ole demon wants to eat the soul of slayers. Once he has done this, he will walk the earth....and there will be no more slayers...ever. There will be no &quot;Chosen One&quot; for the rest of time. Buffy and faith can't fight this demon alone. They have to call on two slayers, India and Kendra that have been killed. Together, all four slayers must unite and defeat this demon. If they can't, the world will come to an end. The Slayers fight side by side in an exciting and dramitic conclusion. This is an incredible read.But this book comes with a warning. You need to have a vast knowlege of the Buffy series, buffy books, and authors of vampire books. &quot;The Book of Fours&quot; is a very detailed and extremely deep book. You may want to read &quot;Drew and Spike: Pertty Maids all in a Row&quot; by Chistopher Golden and &quot;The Gatekeep Trilogy&quot; by Nancy Holder and Christopher Golden. Now, do you *have* to read these books before this one? No, but it clears up somethings. Holder does a good job to fill the reader in on what happened, but it still better to have read the books.I liked how Holder used Kathleen Ramsland in her book. It was a wonderful touch.I also liked how Holder is a wonderful job in creating a past for the slayers, and the evil that's waiting to be released.This is a wonderful read, and will keep the reader glued to the pages to see what happens next. I highly suggest this book. You won't be sorry. If your a fan of Buffy, you need to add this book to your collection."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"This was the second or third BtVS book I read, my first one was the Wisdom of War, and I liked BoF better. Maybe I'm a sucker for the Scoobies High School years. Since reading this I've read two of the Gatekeeper triology and I think Nancy Holder is the best Buffy tie-in author.I would recommend this to any Buffy fan. Disagreeing with previous reviewers, this is not \\"crap\\", and someone over 16 can read this and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"Many of the reviews that have been put up have upset me, The Book of Fours, By: Nancy Holder I personally thought was a wonderful book.I have been told by far to many people that you if you haven't read the Gatekeeper Trilogy and Pretty Maids All in a Row, you will be lost, but I don't think this statement is right, I haven't read any of those books and I understood all of it. Its just in the beginning that you understand very little but if you just stick with the book and keep reading it turns out to be wonderful. By the time I had bought the book so many people had told me it was not very good and I was not going to read it but in the end I read it anyway and I am thankful for that.The only thing I found remotely boring about the book was all the looks into the past I found those so boring that I wanted to skip them but I didn't, and they weren't really that bad after all.I think this book has everything a reader is looking for a lot of action a little bit of romance a little humor (I loved the part about the surf board it cracked me up) and the best thing of all, something about the book that just makes you keep reading and reading! I especially enjoyed the parts about Kit and India (mostly the parts in her diary).The 1 piece of advice I have for you is that do not let the first prologue totally confuse you, that is the part I think Ms. Holder should not have put in the first prologue because you can make absolutely no understanding of it till the end. (don't let it frustrate you as it did me).All in all, I think all the Buffy fans should read this book! I know they would love it!"},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"Most people who decide to read this book will be avid BTV fans, like myself. Thus, so much backstory is just redundant and useless. The storyline, though creative at elementary stages, is not very well developed. The writing isn't that well done, either. The characters aren't true to their personas in the television series. Their emotions and the way they talk are very uncharacteristic of the original characters. Like one said before, the Buffy lingo is forced. Though I think that it is a goo plot, I could have been developed way better than it has been. I don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"...but it just didn't live up to its potential, I felt. I would have given it three and half stars if I could. Maybe it's because I have such a higher standard for Ms. Holder, being one of the two best Buffy novel writers. I agree with the reviewer who stated that there were too many characters, and especially too many flahsbacks. Flashbacks are fine --loved the flashback of Kendra-- but if they focus soley on the history of the villians, I personally don't need to know that much about them; too much time spent on supporting characters that aren't even on the show. And I just have to cripe about the small, but very careless mistakes in this book. The most blatent being that the author got Kendra's Watcher's name wrong! How do you get Roger from Sam Zabuto? And Gile's never met him. And the fifteen pages or so dedicated to Xander's cousin's illness could have been used for better things.The positives of the book. Faith! At last they acknowledge her existence which has only been done in one other book --mentioned only-- and for the most part she was true to character. The plot was also good with better than average bad guys, though I think the natural disasters to Sunnydale were a little overdone. And the idea of the four Slayers, I liked, but again did not live up to its potential mostly due to a rushed climax that seemed to be crammed into the last twenty pages, and once the danger is over the book ends two or three pages later, typical of a Buffy novel, which gives it a small touch of incompleteness. A very good read for fans, but Holder's &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot; is far superior and not as memorable as &quot;Immortal.&quot;"},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"I picked up this book because I am a huge fan of Buffy, and very interested in the Slayer mythology. This one promised a story about Buffy's predecessor India. I was hoping for something good, but was sorely disappointed. There's a bout 70 pages of good story crammed into 400 pages.First of all, the characters were totally out of, well, character. It seemed like the author tried to hard for it be \\"hip\\" and funny, instead failing to stay true to the source material. Also, there were way too many subplots, none of which went anywhere or had any purpose. This ties into my third complaint, that the author was never consistant with details. At times she would go into a 6 page spiel about Xander's cousin's cancer or some stupid thing, and other times she left out so much that it was virtually incomprehensible. The first and last 20 pages are just jumbles of words and have no connections. I like non-linear storytelling, but there are flashbacks in flashbacks in flashbacks here when a simple paragraph detailing what happened would work. I also hated the shifting from third-person to interior monologue without segues. Very confusing.I actually started liking it in the middle. The villain seemed very unique and menacing. This is completely deflated by the ending, however. One minute everything is chaotic and crazy (bad details again), and the next it all just ends and everything goes back to normal, without an explanation. The climax is anti-climactic and it all ends in 5 pages.Another fault is lack of internal continuity. At one point there is a full paragraph copied word for word 2 pages later.The climax is in the prologue, which is a serious no-no, especially since the prologue and the end of the book don't match up in the unfolding of events or dialogue. And if India and Kendra had to possess Willow and Cordy's bodies to fight the Gatherer, why did Lucy just pop in as a ghost and start kicking [rear]? And what did Mirielle have to do with anything? Or Neema and Micaela? Hanging plot threads abound here; if they tie into other books, that's just as bad, since any story should stand on its own. Also she gets info from the show wrong; example: she calls Kendra's Watcher ROGER Zabuto, when on the show they clearly called him SAM Zabuto. Maybe the editor went crazy from reading all 400 pages over and over. I hope he/she got fired for letting this poorly constructed book hit the shelves. You may think that is harsh, but I spent time I will never get back reading this drivel.In short, read the back cover and you've got as much info as you need. The story never resolves and the promise of an interesting villain is trampled by never explaining it clearly enough. Yes, there is action, but it doesn't matter if you don't know why and what they are fighting. The show always explored motivations for characters' actions, but everything in this book just unfolds, often without telling us why. It is a poor addition to the Slayer library."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"I found this an original and exciting addition to Buffy . A suggested read."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"This was an awsome book. I found myself wishing that they had made this into a story arc on the series. It was fun and very true to each charecter. It is the first book that I have read in the Buffy book series. I love how it incorporates the past slayers. Especially Kendra, who was such a great charecter, the total &quot;straight man&quot; to Buffy. They were a great team. It was a great ride, as always, with the Slayer. I totally recommend."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"Like I said, a bit complicated. But let us not dwell on its complicatedness. First the good bits. The plot for a start. Its so perfectly 'Buffy' that they could have based an entire season of the TV show around it. It jumps on you right from the prologue (which, by the way, is one of the best bits) and doesn't let up. The flashbacks are (whilst slightly too numerous) beautifully written and provide a great insight into slayers of the past and present, something which the show has failed to do a lot of the time.However the slight downside to this book is that it requires the reader to keep his or her concentraition levels at level that resembles Buddhist monks. If they don't the result is nausea followed by bleeding from the ears followed by sudden cranial explosion, (or you might just lose the plot, which is also irritating). This especially true of the final chapter which I had to read 4 times before I got the jist of it.So in conclusion, a super good read which I am happy to award 5 stars.Oh wait, hang on. Oh yeah, half a star off for unnecessary over complication and half a star off for the really bad Seth Green joke which contained all the subtlety of being hit in the face with a sledgehammer."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"As always Nancy Holder delivers an action packed story. The Book of Fours is a complex tale of slayers past and present. A great evil the Gatherer sends out his wanderers of fire, water, air and earth to kill the slayers. His victory will end the line of slayers forever.There are many elements to recommend this book to readers. The plot is interesting. Set in the time frame of the third season, Angel and Buffy are still together. Ms Holder has provided the tortured couple some lovely moments. Buffy and Faith take on some unique monsters as the story begins. The description of this particular battle is not to be read on a full stomach. It is both exciting and terribly humorous. The author also details the evil as it grows from nothingness to a great power with the help of a flea and a sparrow. It is almost poetic. The final battle is vivid. The action is heart stopping.I can't give this novel five stars because for everything I enjoyed about it I found that it had too many characters, too many subplots, and too many flash backs. This is the first book of the Buffy the Vampire Series that I can only recommend to fans who have seen the television series or who have read the excellent Gatekeeper's Trilogy co-authored by the same author. Someone new to the tale of the chosen one, the mythology of the slayer would be confused or not understand the full impact of the plot."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"We're used to strange events in Sunnydale, but the latest problems make it doubtful that there will be a Sunnydale in the near future. An unstoppable forest fire, hurricanes, downtown tidal waves and a gratuitous earthquake pummel the unlucky city, and the Slayer and her faithful companions begin to smell a rat, or several rats. Buffy, Faith (appearing for the first time) and even poor Willow find themselves having nightmares, the very same nightmares. And the keep running into very irritated mummies with unpleasantly sharp axes.Giles investigates and realizes that a universal bad hair day is in the works. The mummies are called the Wanderers, serving a prehistoric evil known as the Gatherer. To make matters worse, a voodoo queen and a gangster demon are also chasing Slayers. Not just the two current slayers, but their immediate predecessors India Cohen and Kendra become tangled up in the demonic plot. Even Willow and Cordelia must become directly involved in what becomes a titanic struggle to prevent the Gatherer from conquering Sunnydale and the rest of the world.This is a complex plot, rich in parallel threads and frantic action. Perhaps a bit too complex. Prepare to have to pay attention. No one is quite who they seem to be and our young heroines must face magic and betrayal before they can confront their opponents.Lately some of the Buffy chronicles have been slightly short on plot, but Nancy Holder has served up one of her best. At a time when the television series seems bogged down in one tragedy after another, it's a true relief to settle down with a Buffy story that is about the strength and courage that is the hallmark of Buffy and her companions.The book provides a great mix of story and Slayer lore that will delight all fans. Despite the many zigzags taken by the plot, Holder manages to keep everything working together. This one's a keeper. Hopefully the author will figure out how to put Sunnydale back together again in time for the next novel."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"Let me begin by saying I believe Nancy Holder(along with Christopher Golden) to be among the best original Buffy novel writers. The Book of Fours explores in depth some of the more recent Slayer history that the show has of yet not delved into. It starts with Buffy and Faith sharing disturbing dreams of an ancient and powerful enemy-the Gatherer. The Gatherer deals with the four elements: air, water, fire , and earth-which also leads to very interesting background on the Slayers' powers. It leads Buffy to explore more of the history of her predessor(India Cohen) and how India's final battle led to Buffy being &quot;called&quot; and how India's killer is setting its sights on Buffy and Faith. This is very interesting because the show has never dealt with the Slayer before Buffy. The story also includes Buffy's immediate successor(and Faith's predessor), Kendra. Buffy and Faith must band together with their Slayer ancestors(and friends) in order to defeat this enemy that could stop the Slayer line forever.While this story was very exciting(I confess I finished it one day), it only gets four stars instead of five for a couple reasons. One, in order to understand some of the story not only must you have watched the show, but you have to have read the Gatekeeper triology as well as the Spike &amp; Dru: Pretty Maids... book. Two, this book constantly changes back and forth between past and present and between many, many characters. It makes it a little confusing. Third, the plot is very convulted with describing the enemy and how it came about. Very long and just a tad boring. Not to mention that the book is a little darker than the show is. Fourth, there are a couple little inconsistencies. For instance I though Kendra's watcher was refered to as Sam Zabuto in the What's My Line episode. In the book he is referred to as Roger Zabuto.However, for the most part this is a great book, fairly consistent with Joss Whedon's vision. Holder does a great job bringing Faith's character(before she went bad) to life. That is just how I imagined her in scenes not shown on the show. Holder also does a good job bringing the complex yet loving relationship of Buffy and Angel to life. Their few scenes together are great and any fan of this duo will love them. Nancy Holder does a good job and this book will be a treat for any Buffy fan."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"I have been waiting a long time for some sort of story line involving the Slayer before Buffy. The good news about &quot;The Book of Fours&quot; is that India Cohen is a character in Nancy Holder's latest Buffy the Vampire Slayer novel. The bad news is that it is hard to work too much about India into the novel because we when it comes to Slayers past and present we also have Faith and Kendra, not to mention Lucy Hanover roaming around the Ghost Roads. &quot;The Book of Fours&quot; takes place during the first half of the third season of Buffy, before Faith turns into a rogue Slayer. After one of her L.A. classmates dies and Willow is severely injured in a car accident, Buffy is forced to deal with the mortality of her friends. The ante is upped when Buffy and Faith both begin dreaming about strangely swathed figures carrying horrific boxes across a desert. Eventually the villains this time around are revealed to be the Gatherers and their representative on earth, the sorceress Cecile Lafitte, in yet another human minion spending centuries trying to bring their evil overlords to Earth, while Sunnydale is best by an elemental onslaught of earthquakes, floods, hurricane winds and fires. In the end it will take four Slayers to fight the big bad evil brewing in Sunnydale.Ultimately, all of the other Slayers receive rather short shrift in this novel. The story with India was that she was in love with her Watcher and he with her, but they never got around to telling each other let alone do anything about it. The idea of Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Bothwell, India's Watcher, being haunted by the death of his Slayer is a solid idea but gets somewhat lost in all the other activities in the book. Neither Buffy nor Giles have any strong reactions either to the forbidden love or the inevitable death of the Slayer raised by the story of India and Kit. Faith is just there, the building tension with Buffy implicit but not really developed; there is not any real reason this story has to be told at that particular point in the Buffy chronology. One of the themes of this novel is what it means to be a Slayer, but Buffy and Faith never get around to any serious discussion of their obviously different takes on what is happening and what it all means. Kendra is basically tacked onto the story, being the necessary fourth for the novel's climax. But if there is very little to the meeting of Buffy and her predecessor India, there is even less with Faith and Kendra. These should be monumental moments and they pass without much consequence, although Holder creates a nice moment where Buffy sees the shade of the Slayer yet to come. The book touches on the unique circumstance of having two Slayers at the same time, but does not pursue it; at some point this needs to be worked out, because having more than one Slayer either means the powers of the Slayer are diluted or suggests you have the potential for creating an army of Slayers with just a bit of mad scientist creativity.One of the strengths of this novel is that Holder continues to work in the Ghost Roads and some of the other characters and details from the Gatekeeper Trilogy, which remains the best of the Buffy original novels. One of the new ideas introduced is that each Slayer represents a basic element: India-water, Buffy-air, Kendra-earth, Faith-Fire. This is certainly interesting idea raising all sorts of questions: Will the next Slayer represent water? Is the order always the same, and if so, what significance might it have? How exactly do the Slayers match up with their respective elements? In &quot;The Book of Fours&quot; this idea becomes rather cumbersome: there are four axes, each of which matches up with an element and which will instantly slay the corresponding Slayer with but a touch, a weird sort of Russian Roulette version to slaying the slayer with a 1-in-4 chance you have the right ax for the right Slayer. However, the point here is simply to justify having the four Slayers stand together (with Willow and Cordelia serving as the human hosts for India and Kendra).The more I think about it the more I wish &quot;The Book of Four&quot; had been four books, each focusing on one of the four slayers, each volume adding another piece to the puzzle. Certainly Holder does not suffer from a lack of good ideas, but there is just too much worth pursuing crammed into this one (there are a couple of subplots involving Xander's cousin and Micaela Tomassi that disappear for most of the book and suddenly pop up at the end again). Her ideas for Buffy's predecessor were worth developing a lot more than she had time/pages to do in this book. The story of the Slayer before Buffy should have been a great tale to be told, but &quot;The Book of Fours&quot; is merely good. Most readers will find it enjoyable, but somewhat disappointing given &quot;what might have been.&quot;"},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"In 1993, India Cohen was fifteen years old. She had just arrived in Japan, where her Navy father had been transferred. She had her whole life ahead of her. That all changed one dark night, when she met Christopher Bothwell, who told India that she was the Slayer, chosen by fate to fight vampires and demons until the day she died. That day came in 1997. And as fate chose India, so it chose the girl who would follow her as Slayer - Buffy Summers. Now Buffy and Faith - the second Slayer, the freak accident, who succeeds Kendra, made Slayer when Buffy died and was revived - are having nightmares. Sunnydale is bombarded by the four elements - a raging fire, a devastating hurricane, a powerful earthquake, and a deadly flood. Buffy and Faith fear the worst - the end of the world may be near. To stop it, Buffy and Faith won't have to just work with each other, but with the Slayers that came before them, who lost their lives to the same evil that now threatens the world. This is one enemy Buffy and Faith may not be strong enough to defeat. But they will have to. Because the world is counting on them. This was an excellent new Buffy novel, one of my favorites. Nancy Holder has written an exciting, thrill-a-minute adventure."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"Unlike Immortal and the Gatekeeper Trilogy, which Nancy Holder co-wrote with Christopher Golden, The Book of Fours has a notable lack of focus about it.The plot itself is good and most of the original characters are interesting, particularly India and Kit, they slayer and watcher previous to Buffy and Giles. However, the sub-plots are thin and plentiful making the story feel incredibly unfocused and the main plot jumps around too much. I have the distinct impression that much of the story cut in the editing process.There are more characters in this book than in most soap-opera series on television, which also makes the book hard to follow. The original characters probably outnumber the characters from the series (which include many semi-regulars such as Spike, Dru, Willy the Snitch, Angel, Faith, Kendra and the Master, among others) and Holder gives back story on every single one of them, which detracts from the plot a great deal. In addition, characters from previous books make apperances and if you haven't read the Gatekeeper Trilogy and Pretty Maids All in a Row, you will be lost.There are a few great one-liners in the story, one in particular dealing with a surfboard really cracked me up, but again they aren't as plentiful as in her earlier works and much of the Buffy-lingo seems forced.The best part about this book, however, is the promise of a follow-up story dealing more in-depth with India and Kit, the former slayer and watcher with a forbidden love. I'm looking forward to it and I'm hopeful that next time the editor will do a better job of molding the text into a memorable and enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"There are four Slayers running around in Nancy Holder's &quot;The Book of Fours,&quot; but the really interesting one is not Buffy, Faith or Kendra, but rather the &quot;new&quot; one: Buffy's predecessor. If the focus had been more on India Cohen, or even exclusively, this would have been a really first-rate Vampire Slayer novel. But there ends up being way too much going on in this story. Then again, one of the things that makes Holder stand out as a writer of Buffy stories is that she continues to use the people and places you creates (e.g., the Ghostroads), so hopefully there will be some more on India down the road. They already proved in the Spike &amp; Dru novel that stories about past Slayers can work, so let's just keep our fingers crossed on this one. &quot;The Book of Fours&quot; is not a great Buffy novel, but it is certainly above average."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"THE BOOK OF FOURS sat on my shelves unread for two months because I was afraid it would contain the same major flaw that marred the otherwise excellent THE EVIL THAT MEN DO. It does. No the book isn't too complex, there aren't too many characters, too many subplots, or too many flashbacks. Frankly, I liked the part about Xander's cousin because it gave Xander (the token &quot;normal&quot; of the Scooby Gang), another chance to let the true nobility of his character shine. The problem with both books is that Ms. Holder seems to forget that she's writing entries in a series, not one-shots. Both books have far too much death and destruction going on in Sunnydale for a series. Enough happens to Sunnydale in this one to have it declared a Federal Disaster Area and take years to pull itself back together. In fact, if not for some little hints in the last few pages, I'd be expecting the entire planet to have been rocked back to the Stone Age by the Gatherer's power. It's a shame, because other than this flaw, Ms. Holder is one of the best writers of Buffy books and this is a very worthy effort. I do agree with other reviewers who recommend that you read the Gatehouse Trilogy and PRETTY MAIDS ALL IN A ROW before this book, but not because you need to have read them in order to understand THE BOOK OF FOURS. I think you should read them first because this book contains &quot;spoilers&quot; for them. Now I wish I had ready PRETTY MAIDS first. I look forward to the story of how Buffy will free India even if Ms. Holder doesn't tone the disasters down to a believable level. Her writing is compelling enough to keep me going even while I gritting my teeth."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"this is one very cool book. sunnydale has always been known for it's disastors because of it's proximity to the hellmouth. but when everything from earthquakes, hurricanes, and forrest fires start raging against the town all at the same time, giles goes into research mode. they come to find out that an ancient evil has been brought to sunnydale. his minions are called the wanders. they each possess an axe that is used to kill slayers. one wanderer is of air, fire, earth and water. as buffy is the slayer of air and faith is the slayer of fire, the ancient evil called the gatherer will be unstoppable if both slayers are killed because no more slayers will be called ever. this leads giles to the conclusion that they need the spirits of the last 2 slayers which was kendra(slayer of earth) and india cohen(buffy's predessor and slayer of water). they perform a ritual where kendra possesses cordelia's body and india posseses willow's body to try and stop this evil from ruling the earth. this book has a lot of twist and turns in it and a lot of history lessons. it was a great read and i would highly reccomend it to all buffy fans. it was also great to see a book with faith and buffy working together. most authors seem to avoid faith. i don't know why. she was one of the best characters on buffy besides angel of course."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it was exciting, different, and had many new characters.

The nightmares revolve around four figures that represent the four elements: fire, water, earth and air. Each figure carries a box, covered in bones and grafted skin. Giles soon learns that the last time that these figures were seen, were by India, Buffy's immediate predecessor. Now Buffy is cramming every bit of information about India, and these strange figures into her brain, so she knows exactly how to save Sunnydale, and the innocents who reside there.This was an amazing addition to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer book series. Holder has created an intricately woven novel, featuring a brand new, never before seen slayer, India Cohen. The scenes are written so descriptively, that you feel as if you are right there with the Slayers, fighting the evil that lurks around Sunnydale. A must-have book.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"I read this book in one night, I couldn't put it down, and when I finally hit page 401, I was so sad that it was over. I wished I had slowed down a bit, savored it more. Two thumbs up for Nancy Holder, this book was written amazingly well and captured the truth of the characters. I believed what I was reading. I could truly see Buffy and the Scoobies doing and saying what Nancy wrote on the page. So take my advice. Rarely does one come across a book based on a television show that speaks so honestly about it's characters, so take your time, savor the words, let them weave into your thoughts, You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"Overall, I believe that this was a great story. It was nice to go back to season 3 and see all of our favorite characters from BtVS (including Buffy, Willow, Xander, Giles, Cordelia, Faith, and Oz). I really liked the plot and thought it was quite clever. I also liked how you got to see things from all the characters' points of view. At times the subplots could get confusing, but it eventually all came together and I believe that this story was huge success. I would recommend this book to any BtVS fans."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"What happened? Holder is capable of much better than this. Up to the last thirty or forty pages the book is great, but then it runs right off a cliff.First, the good: Holder understands the characters, and writes them wonderfully. Their dialogue is true to form, often quite witty, and she provides interesting insights into their psyches. The inclusion of Faith is especially welcome, and long overdue. Buffy's predecessor in the Slayer business, India, is a fabulous character, and Holder's passages about (and especially by) her are a joy. The plot is epic and interesting, and suspense is well-maintained.Unfortunately, the book has major problems, most of which give the impression that Holder was up short against a deadline. It's poorly edited, for one thing. There are passages toward the end that are repeated verbatim. Characters suddenly know things they haven't been told, or if they have, they then act in contradiction to it - case in point, one of the major characters in the story sets the good guys up for a fall; they shouldn't realize that and yet do, and fall for the trap anyway.Numerous minor character inclusions early in the story never pan out to anything, and only take up space and diffuse the focus, seeming as if Holder intended something to happen with them but simply didn't have the time to flesh them out.The finale is impossible to follow - again, as if Holder simply didn't have time to write it thoroughly enough. The menace of the piece has a clear objective, achieves it, and yet for some insufficiently explained reason fails. The action at the end is so fast, it can't be comprehended - a Slayer falls, a ghost takes her place (doesn't it? couldn't really be sure), but the ghost is physically real (I think; my head hurt, by that point)...and then, people who died are inexplicably just still alive, the ghost is - uh, what happened to the ghost? - the betrayer character is suddenly back in everyone's good graces, because - uh, why was that, again? Did I miss something? (You get the idea.)Hardcore fans may still enjoy this one, as long as they're sufficiently forewarned about the hopelessly muddled ending."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"I personally agree with what others have said about this book. It has alot of information. At some points you could say too much. I would like to see more written about faith and India and about sluyers in general. Also to find out what happened to willow as the book ended without telling us.Overall it was good, but lacked things at certain points."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"In contrast to some of the earlier reviews posted, I had no trouble following the storylines of this book. It's nonlinear, but nonetheless compelling and interesting. The characters are true to the series, and there were more than a few surprises that worked without violating internal consistancy. While I haven't read all that many Buffy books, I'm a big fan of the show and thought this was as good as many of the episodes, and better than quite a few."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"After reading the marvelously gory and delightful \\"Pretty Maids All in a Row,\\" this novel was a total letdown. I think it is set approximately between seasons 2 and 3, from what obscure details I picked up. An odd apocalyptical battle like this absolutely does not fit in with the series story arch, and it took a lot of [...]-it-up to accept its plausibility (even as far as sci-fi goes).I think Joss would not approve, and if he did, what was he thinking? Accepting Faith and Angel fighting side by side was a bit absurd if it is held in the context of season 3. If this story had ever been integrated into the actual Buffyverse, it is doubtful that Faith would've then joined forces with the dark side with such powerful vengeance.Despite the brilliant immagination it took to conjure such descriptive and huge scenes, Sunnydale never would have been the same after earthquake, flood and fire. Certainly not much insight was given to the characters of the other slayers, leaving a hollow impression of their personalities. And I don't want to spoil the ending, but let's just say, it was a sad excuse for a conclusion. It felt like they dismissed the whole thing as one of those \\"dreams\\" or something. Over all, it lacked a strong connection with our beloved Buffy, and did not fit in with the grand scheme of things.A novel must connect strongly with its parent show in order to speak to the reader, like something that actually happened between shows. An appocalypse like this would not go unmnetioned if it had occurred, unless everyone lost their memories. (Like in the episode \\"Tubula Rosa\\" which isn't until season 6, so sorry writers.)On another note, I highly reccommend \\"Immortal\\" as a great read, a clear and undeniable bit of Buffy, especially if you watch the show. And why else would you want to read a Buffy Novel but that you just can't get enough from one night a week of Buff."},{"Title":"Book of Fours (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","review":"I didn't like how the story kept switching between modern Sunnydale and past stories. I did like the whole relationship between the four Slayers and I liked learning about Buffy's predecessor. One of my friends, a bigger Angel fan, asked me if Buffy was the first Slayer, and, having read The Book of Fours, I was able to explain it to her better. This book cleared things up along the history lines of the Slayers and it was a good read, but really slow in the middle."},{"Title":"Hype and Glory","review":"The writing in HYPE AND GLORY is sloppy beyond belief at times, but most of the anecdotes are amusing enough to keep you breezily turning the pages.

I wish there was more of a supernatural element to the story like in the Tomb but that is just a personal preferance, also the relationship between Alicia and the cop never really seemed to have a purpose, it was all set up and had your interest but then it just dissapeared.

When a gas station clerk realizes he knows the identity of the lottery winner who has not yet cashed in the winning ticket, the action begins and dead bodies abound.The story is gripping and the book, despite its length at 400 pages, is tough to put down and resume later. I could not wait to get back to the story to discover what would happen next.The book's shortcomings arise in the fact the book is self-published and suffers from the lack of a professional editor. There are several grammatical errors and a few speling errors. The POV sometimes abruptly changes leaving the reader unsure who is speaking. Fortunately, the great story makes up for these flaws. However, the book would be so much better had it passed through the hands of a major publishing house editor.The book is a little slow to start as the author apparantly felt he must introduce almost every character to the reader before getting the action started, and that was a little difficult to work through. But once the action started, buckle up and hold on for the ride of your life.I highly recommend the book. If it were not for the aforementioned problems, I could have given the book a 5-star rating. The story is 5-star, but the grammer, spelling, slow start and sudden POV switching bring it down a little.Looking forward to the next novel by Mr. Kushel."},{"Title":"Lotto Trouble","review":"Mr. Kushel's first publication will not be his last....some publisher will pick up this author based on an outstanding self-published book about mistaken identity, mistaken assumptions, greed, crime, sex, coincidences which may or may not be, drugs, the going wrong of best laid plans, etc. Very hard to put down ....good guys, bad guys,good/bad guys, bad/good guys, etc."},{"Title":"Lotto Trouble","review":"After a friend recommended this book to me, I was very skeptical about reading it.

I was kept up late at night in San Francisco reading about the exploits of these classic characters.It is no wonder that there aren't as many great books such as this one out on the market today.

The Seventh Poldark Novel","review":"Metaphorically The Angry Tide is a novel well-named. This is the watershed volume in the series, and also the one that breaks from the eighteenth-century which readers of Poldark had heretofore known, and brings to conclusion many storylines, situations....and characters. Death is more plentiful in this Poldark book than in any other, if not in all others combined. Several central figures do not survive this story, and one who is lost here is not only someone known from the series' start, but a person surely everyone had thought truly irreplaceable: which this person was, for the series is never the same afterward, nor is the shadow cast by this figure's death ever absent in the five books that bring Poldark to its 1820 conclusion.In The Angry Tide, Captain Ross Poldark, a man of independent thought, is elected a member of parliament for the borough of Truro, Cornwall, and he and Demelza travel by coach across the breadth of England, arriving in a London splendidly described by Winston Graham. (After the chapter that sets the characters firmly in the capital, you'll feel as if you've just taken a guided tour of the world's largest city in the concluding years of the 1700's.) In London, Ross and Demelza settle in only to be swept up into the tide of political life and intrigue, as the nation gossips of little else besides the new man of the hour, whose reputation as a master of warfare carries his name fearfully to every mind: Napoleon Bonaparte. Elsewhere, Elizabeth, desperate to heal the rift in her marriage to George, takes the most drastic step imaginable and consults with a famed foreign obstetrician, intend on inducing premature birth of the child she carries, hoping a second premature delivery might lay to rest George's doubts about his being the father of her son, Valentine. In another marriage in the series, the portly, despicable Reverend Osborne Whitworth, far from a sinless clergyman, rediscovers the charms of a more than willing substitute for his psychologically traumatized wife Morwenna, and in so doing gets more than he could ever have bargained for. And lastly in London, the calculating George Warleggan befriends a sadistic former infantry officer, a man who loves killing and fears no one, a celebrated marksman who has emerged the victor in many past duels, and whose lust for Demelza---and distaste for Ross---comes to a head with pistols at dawn in one of the city's parks..."},{"Title":"The Angry Tide: A Novel of Cornwall 1798-9. The Seventh Poldark Novel","review":"Let's just say that, even though this is a blockbuster terrific read - that I remember clearly 35 years after reading it, I still am not happy with what the author did to these terrific characters.* Captain Ross Poldark is elected a member of parliament representing Truro, Cornwall.* Demelza and Ross arrive in London where the craven Monk Adderly attempts to first seduce her and when that fails attempts to ruin Ross.* George, not content in achieving all he has wanted must find fault in everything he could love and makes those around him miserable.* Elizabeth who has run out of options and patience, confronts George with logic, anger and love but fears it will not be enough to bring them happiness for long.* Morwenna and Drake pine for each other.* The loathsome Reverend Osborne Whitworth finally goes too far.* Dwight and Caroline, is not perfect, but they do their utmost to help their dearest friends.* Aunt Agatha and Geoffrey Charles initiate a chain of events that lead to tragedy and create great havoc for years to come.Totally addicted to this series back in the 70's watching it on Masterpiece Theatre Sunday nights with my mom and sisters.

Dwight & Caroline Enys (and Horace), Verity & Andrew Blamey. And of course Demelza and Ross (still all too human). George Warleggan remains the same fascinating character.

The author passed away in 2003 at age 90 so it is truly the last written by him.From the publisher: Cornwall, towards the end of the 18th century. Ross Poldark sits for the borough of Truro as Member of Parliment - his time divided between London and Cornwall, his heart divided about his wife, Demelza. His old feud with George Warleggan still flares - as does the illicit love between Morwenna and Drake, Demelza's brother. Before the new century dawns, George and Ross will be drawn together by a loss greater than their rivalry - and Morwenna and Drake by a tragedy that brings them hope...' From the incomparable Winston Graham...who has everything that anyone else has, then a whole lot more.Also from the Publisher: the Poldark series, the subject of the landmark BBC series Ross Poldark is a heartwarming, gripping, and utterly entertaining saga that brings to life an unforgettable cast of characters and one of the greatest love stories of our age. An intricately plotted story spanning loves, lives, and generations. The Poldark series is the masterwork of Winston Graham, who evoked the period and people like only he could, and created a world of rich and poor, loss and love, that readers will not soon forget."},{"Title":"Beyond Modern Sculpture","review":"This book would be of interest to anyone interested in the the evolution of art and relationship to technology & modernism.Burnham received a BFA from the Yale school of Art in 1959 and a MFA in 1961.From 1955 until 1965 he worked as a sculptor, often created sculptures that included light.

After years of seeming neglect through the middle of this century, documentary film is again undergoing a wholesome reassessment by a new plethora of practitioners, commentators and academic scrutineers. We can hope that this will contribute to the long-standing integrity and innovation in this form of film, which founded the beginnings of cinema. It all began in 1895 with Lumi&egrave;re's patrons diving under their seats as a locomotive rushed towards them on the screen. The fiction film then took over in 1903, coincidentally, with the intervention of film editing techniques.The literature about documentary of recent years is preoccupied by the questions of where to now, the imminent death of the documentary and how close to the &quot;truth&quot; is this film genre? After this questioning and the continual pushing of the boundaries of form, style and means of expression the documentary is still very, very alive. Heated debate continues for definitions of the very essence and nature of the genre. Many of the innovations introduced over the years by documentarists have been quickly adapted into mainstream television and feature films.Recent titles of books about documentary film express this lively debate: &quot;Representing Reality&quot;, &quot;Blurred Boundaries&quot;, &quot;Claiming the Real&quot;, &quot;Theorizing Documentary&quot;, &quot;Fields of Vision&quot;, &quot;The Art of Record&quot;, &quot;Documentary Dilemmas&quot;, &quot;Framer Framed&quot;, &quot;Innovation in Ethnographic Film&quot;, &quot;New Challenges for Documentary&quot; and the book that is the subject of this review &quot;Imagining Reality: The Faber Book of Documentary&quot;. If &quot;Imagining Reality&quot; had been published before the debates raised in the recent books mentioned above, it could well have been titled Imaging Reality.The editors of &quot;Imagining Reality&quot;, Kevin Macdonald and Mark Cousins from the UK have made a careful, considered and very readable compendium from which to consider the major issues concerning documentary. It is a book that should interest all, especially documentary aficionados. It will also become a valuable resource for teaching about documentary film. However, from an Australian point of view their book seriously underestimates our contribution to this exciting film genre. There is no mention of any Australian films or filmmakers throughout the book. It is a serious failing. Another area found wanting is a consideration of the impact over the last forty years of films by women that provide a unique perspective on the human condition.Although they acknowledge it in the preface, the editors have excluded the now controversial area of ethnographic film and the issues of &quot;representation&quot;, &quot;rights&quot; and &quot;reflexivity&quot; relevant to all forms of documentary. The current debate on &quot;reflexivity&quot;; the open positioning and acknowledging of the filmmaker's views (and sometimes themselves, e.g. Broomfield, Mike Rubbo, or Alby Mangels) in the body of the film. In this way further layers of &quot;truth&quot; are manipulated by the filmmakers, as they provide the viewer with information concerning who they are and why they are making a film. The very humorous piece in this book on the British filmmaker, Nick Broomfield broaches the issue, but we miss a follow-through.Opinion is now leaning towards the view that documentary film is as much a fiction as any other fiction. Yet practitioners of the documentary are generally well aware that from idea to final mix, their film is the product of the process of many thousands of selective decisions. These many decisions will, they hope, create a realistic re-creation and representation of the mood, atmosphere and meaning of the actual events that they are shooting and then editing into their final product.The new development of small hand carried camcorders in the Hi-8 and digital format has allowed both non-professional and professional film-makers to make low-budget, credible and often unusually intimate stories such as the &quot;Video Diaries&quot; series that were produced and broadcast recently by the BBC and SBS-TV. I would have enjoyed a more detailed investigation here.Despite these limitations &quot;Imagining Reality&quot; remains a fascinating read as many of the selections chosen have not been published in such an accessible form before. There are incisive and new insights into the greats of documentary such as Flaherty, Ivens, Bal&aacute;zs, Vertog, Grierson, Wright, John Huston, Reifenthahl, Jennings, Warhol, Welles, Oph&uuml;ls, Malle, Marker, Leacock, Rouch, the Maysles brothers, Wiseman, De Antonio, Morris, Loach and Pennebaker. What a roll call, and what fascinating reading they provide! Documentary, we realize, can be all things to all.As the Canadian turned French filmmaker Chris Marker comments, near the end of this book, we are in a technological age during which &quot;rarely has Reality needed so much to be imagined&quot;.John Darling Documentary filmmaker and Lecturer in Media Studies, Murdoch University, 1997"},{"Title":"Imagining Reality","review":"This anthology includes the following essays:\\"Filming Death\\" By B&eacute;la Bal&aacute;zs\\"Lowell Thomas and 'Lawrence of Arabia'\\" By Kevin Brownlow\\"Grass: A Nation's Battle for Life\\" By Merian C.

It's mainly geared for someone who wants to decorate with house plants and the advice on leaf coloring and size of plant is really helpful if you want to know how to display your plants aesthetically. The book is organized by house location (living room, bathroom, etc.) then the kinds of plant (bulbs, bushy plants, upright plants, winter flowers, etc.). There's also a section in caring for dried flowers. The section in artificial lights and hydroculture is a bit scanty, but that doesn't seem to be the main focus of the book. The care and regulation of plants is shunted in the back section of the book."},{"Title":"The Indoor Garden Book: The Complete Guide to the Creative Use of Plants and Flowers in the Home","review":"This book is wonderful for quick reference. Beautiful pictures help guide plant selection. The &quot;plant finder's guide&quot; is useful because it uses symbols to define the care needed for each plant.

That book gives info on each plant from the direct knowledge of the authors and as a result has proved to be the best tropical houseplant book bar none, thus far. They give personal observations, recommendations, etc. Whereas 19 out of 20 such books have the usual set of short paragraphs with pedestrian info (i.e. dimensions, temperatures, light requirements, etc.). The Elberts also cover a goodly number of varieties and cultivars one is likely to encounter.This book is just not what I need but it shouldn't be faulted for that! What it does it does very nicely. Some really gorgeous photography. And its organized to appeal to those indoor gardeners who want similar types of plants grouped together, rather than separately-alphabetically. Photos are a bit small for the individual specimens. There are large sections devoted to how to dry flowers, how to decorate bathrooms, etc. I am still looking for a really good book just on the plants."},{"Title":"The Indoor Garden Book: The Complete Guide to the Creative Use of Plants and Flowers in the Home","review":"This book tries hard.

In fact, it wastes the reader's time with large sections on arranging plants in the home, illuminating plants for maximum dramatic effect and arranging dried flowers. It does get around to plants here and there, but they seem to be thought of - as a bit of an inconvieance.It is an attractive book and those looking for a cheap, small, coffee table book can add a star or two to this review.

But his family is anything but \\"traditional\\" --- Nick has two lesbian moms. When Nick is young, he doesn't realize anything is unusual; he loves his birth mom and Jo, and they love him. When he splits open his chin on the coffee table, Jo rushes him to the hospital for stitches. When they lounge in the backyard eating watermelon, they end up in a silly seed-spitting contest. But as soon as Nick starts school, he begins to realize that his family is different.Nick's classmates pick up on his uniqueness right away, and the teasing begins as early as kindergarten. Some of his teachers even treat him differently, uncomfortable with his family situation. Nick doesn't have a lot of friends, but he deals with it. He finds a lot of his happiness at home with his music, his vast aquarium hobby, and his relationships with his moms, especially Jo. His birth mom tends to be a bit more practical, worrying about putting food on the table and paying the bills. But Jo is different. She's the one who cheers away his tears and takes him paintball shooting. She's the one who talks to him about important topics like sex and death, who teaches him to stand up for himself and respect others. Even though Jo didn't give birth to him (or even officially adopt him), she's his mom in every single way.But life isn't always fun and games at home. Jo starts drinking too much, and it puts a big strain on the family. And then the three of them battle cancer together when Nick's birth mom is diagnosed with the disease. It may never be easy or traditional, but his family is Nick's whole world. And then one day his family starts to fall apart...Julie Anne Peters has created an amazing story with BETWEEN MOM AND JO. The diverse characters have incredible personalities with multiple layers; they quickly become very real and relatable. The emotional depths visited in this special story will have readers both laughing and crying and everything in between. Many of the issues addressed are a bit touchy yet necessary as they are happening in our world. Very highly recommended for everyone, young people and adults alike.--- Reviewed by Chris Shanley-Dillman (author of FINDING MY LIGHT and THE BLACK POND)"},{"Title":"Between Mom and Jo","review":"This is a lovely book.

What if they were not married in the eyes of the law, and one of them has no biological or legal claim to you?Ever since he was little, Nick has been teased because he has two moms. Nick's mothers taught him not to be ashamed of his parentage, no matter what others said. Though it is hard for him to deal with bullies and name-calling at school, Nick is pretty happy when he is home.Happy, that is, until his moms split up. Nick stays at home with Erin - who he calls Mom, who he's always called Mom, because she biologically is just that - while Jo gets an apartment of her own.As always, Julie Anne Peters has written a realistic, dramatic story. Children of divorce will benefit from reading this book just as much as those who are products of a same-sex marriage. Hopefully, this and other stories by Peters will encourage readers to be more open-minded and more compassionate towards others."},{"Title":"Between Mom and Jo","review":"I loved it!

Ones that target the area of Gay fiction ? As I like reading books that are seen as Edgy content and out the box , I don't mind it as who am I too judge what an author wants to write about and I also on the other hand actually find books like this interesting to read. One of my favourite authors in this area is Julie Anne Peters as her books are real and you can sit back and imagine the situations and events unfolding before your eyes. All of her books have also had their covers redone and for those who have seen the TV Show \\"The Lying Game\\" - doesn't the main character Nicholas on the front cover look like Thayer from The Lying Game.In Between Mom and Jo by Julie Anne Peters we are taken into the world of Nicholas and his two moms Erin and Jo. Erin was his birth mum and Jo -his other mum -the one he always felt a strong connection with. The story goes through his life up till the age of 14-15yrs when Jo and Erin decide to split up after being together for most of Nicholas's life. His mum has meet someone else and it's now Hello Kerri, Goodbye Jo. Now Nicholas is torn between a decision that could change his life as though he is ultimately Erin's son since Jo never adopted him - he wants to live with Jo.What will happen when Nicholas is forced to choose between his Mom and Jo ?

Erin, Nick's birthmother, insists on sole custody of her son, despite the feelings of both Nick and her now ex-partner, a recovering alcoholic, that Jo is responsible enough to care for him. Things escalate when Erin invites her new girlfriend, Kerri, to move in with them. Nick struggles with angst, depression, and rage as the tug-of-war battle ensues.

The story takes a few unexpected twists dealing with cancer, separation / divorce, custody issues, and new relationships. All the characters are really believable, and where one could easily fault one character over the other, the dynamic is such that in the end you have empathy and understanding for all sides.Great story, nicely told, and well written. I really recommend this book."},{"Title":"Between Mom and Jo","review":"BETWEEN MOM AND JO is the first book I've read by Julie Anne Peters, but it won't be my last. In fact, as soon as I finished this book, I went and read KEEPING YOU A SECRET and LUNA. And while we're on confessions, this is also the first book I've read dealing with GLBT issues, but again, it won't be the last. This book grabbed at my emotions, affecting me with every word so deeply that I finished it in only a matter of hours--and have been thinking about it ever since.Nicholas Nathaniel Thomas Tyler has always only known one type of family life. He's the only child of mom Erin--and mom Jo. His earliest memories revolve around one or the other of his mothers, but it's usually Jo who is prominent, making him forget about the need for stitches at age three or tangling with the homophobic teacher he had in third grade. His mothers, of course, have their ups and downs like all parents do. Mom Erin complains about mom Jo's drinking and her inability to hold down a steady job; mom Jo can't stand mom Erin's stony silences when she's angry. For Nick, having two mothers is just the way life is. He's heard all the \\"queers\\" and \\"faggots\\" through the years, he's wondered about the father that donated sperm for his conception, and he's been haunted over whether having two lesbians for parents will make him gay.Most of all, though, Nick has experienced love from two women who only want him to be happy. He has a three-legged dog named Lucky 2, a ton of fish that he takes care of religiously, and there's even a feral cat named Savage thrown into the mix to keep things interesting. Nick's life is pretty normal--or as normal as it can ever be--until the year he turns fourteen, and Jo moves out.After a marriage, a child, lost jobs, meetings at AA, college courses, and a relationship that they'd always promised would remain whole, his mothers break up. Nick is suddenly thrust into turmoil, and his whole world falls apart. He's left with mom Erin, his biological mother, even though what he wants most in the world is to be allowed to live with mom Jo. Erin won't hear of it, however, even though she's the one with Kerri, her new girlfriend. She's the real parent, and Jo let trust get in the way of legally adopting Nick, so there's no out.As Nick descends deeper into depression, as Erin becomes fanatical about not allowing her son to even to talk to Jo on the telephone, as Kerri moves into their home, something has to give.BETWEEN MOM AND JO is heartfelt, genuine, and painfully honest. For anyone who has ever watched the breakup of a family, or for those with gay or lesbian parents, this is the book for you. I promise it will stay with you for quite awhile.Reviewed by: Jennifer Wardrip, aka \\"The Genius\\""},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"I have to say that i was quite impressed by the content of this book.

This is the book. Barely into chapter 3 and I can tell you not only does this book give you a very solid intro but leaves nothing out... including many of the why's and how's.

Although the COM interface is language-independant, one must know C++ code and nomenclature thoroughly to be able to navigate the examples and text. The author's contempt of other programming languages, particlularly Visual Basic, comes through fairly clearly when they are discussed (really only one chapter).

The author starts with a simple non-COM example, and evolves it into a full-fledge COM component, explaining along the way how COM solves various software problems.This is the best introduction to COM programming I've read. It's better written and more focused than COM/DCOM Primer Plus by Corry, Mayfield, and Cadman, and it's a smoother introduction to COM than Beginning ATL COM Programming by Grimes, et al.I was able to start doing some simple COM development shortly after reading the book. If your not interested in C++ COM development, or already have experience with COM development, this text will probably not offer you much. However, this book is perfect for programmers new to COM (and even new to C++)."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This is much more than a COM book. The book spends a lot of time in the first half talking about the more general concept of interfaces, which is more of a software design topic. Then he shows how to implement those interfaces using C++ abstract classes and gives a very good discussion of inheritence, polymorphism, and virtual function tables. Everything is done in pure C++ so you can see what is going on. No wizards or macros to hide the details. The diagrams were very helpful.Even if you choose to not use the COM architecture for your software the discussion of interfaces will help you write software of much higher quality. Seeing how the interfaces are implemented and the discussion of inheritence and virtual function tables gave me a much better understanding of the C++ language.The key to understanding COM is understanding interfaces and this book does a very good job explaining them. Eventually when the author gets into the Microsoft specific COM library you can see how those chapters build on the earlier chapters. You can see how a program can evolve from a set of inflexible C++ classes, to some compile-time flexible C++ classes that use interfaces, to run-time flexible components using DLLs, and finally a full blown COM component.Near the end of the book it is not as thorough with the examples but that is because the topics presented there are too large to fit in a single chapter. The first 8 chapters are worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This book begins by assuming the reader knows little more than basic C++. In the second chapter it introduces some simple C++ classes about which the reader will think to herself, &quot;okay, this is simple&quot;. From there it builds: adding incremental changes to the original C++ code, gradually making it more useful, explaining each change as it goes. By the end of the book, the original example has grown up into a full fledged COM component, written completely from scratch. No wizards, no templates. At this point the reader will not only be able to recognize the elements of a COM component, but more importantly, she will understand *why* COM works the way it does. The mystery surrounding the ATL and Visual Studio wizards evaporates, and the developer can see them for what they really are: simple shortcuts."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This is a great book for any of you who would like to learn more about COM.

The example code is very good and you can reuse it for your own programs well. But why have the author build this sources not with regular makefiles for client, proxy and server? He choses to build up one Makefile which you must scratch to build up code for debugging. This takes me a longer time when I build up my first COM-Server.

Rogerson demonstrates a very good understanding of COM. And in this book, he shares his in-depth knowledge via a breakdown of the foundation of COM. The concepts and advices Rogerson presents are imperative for understanding the architecture and creation process of COM components. For instance, the author analyzes object containment and aggregation and demonstrates fully implemented examples of both forms of components. Furthermore, he discusses the importance of reference counting in COM and possible problems programmers face when implementing aggregated components such as memory leak. Rogerson breakdown of COM architecture in this book definitely helps programmers learn COM at its core and move one step closer to designing and implementing their own COM components.COM design and implementation is an involved process. I believe even the experienced COM programmers would agree. However, in Inside COM Rogerson provides a clear analysis of the theories behind COM and demonstrates each aspect of COM architecture with valuable C++ examples. Lastly, he concludes the book with a complete C++ implementation of a set of COM components that utilizes most if not all the theories he discusses throughout this book.

I'd recomend this book highly."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This is an excellent book to get of the ground with learning the basics of COM. If you work through the examples, you will know the foundation of COM programming. Two things disappointed me. One, the descriptions of his examples became less comprehensive toward the last chpaters, making it harder to grasp. Given the excellent beginning sample, I was disappointed. The thrading chapter in particular left me hanging a bit. Second, I would have liked to have seen a chapter on implementing a existing COM object, such as need for shell programming for example. Otherwise, a good book."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"i've been reading books on COM since the past 1 year. Most of the books are initimidating for the beginer. lot of books don't explain what COM architecture is about, they market COM. But this book explains what the COM architecture is about and largely succeeds too. I'd definitely recommend it for programmers begining COM. Agreed that it does not cover all the topics in a great detail such as Connection Points &amp; Type Libs, but hey you can always refer to another book. Dale Rogerson has done a fine job. I like the way he describes things, especially the little stories at the begining of each chapter."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"COM is rich in good books. It has the heavenly three (D. Chappel, D. Box, K. Brockschmidt) and now this one. It is a good alternative to Don Boxes (Mr. COM) masterpiece. It clearly explains the foundations on a C++ level and no more. You will have to turn to Brockschmidt for that. I strongly recommand this book and wish more other subjects would have books on comparable quality."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"The author stuffs everything in a dir and provides readers a make file without much comments, which makes readers stay inside COM but do not know where to go!"},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"Rogerson uses many great analogies to bring the technical subject of component programming down to a level where it can be digested quickly and well understood!"},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This great book gave me a very deep and broad approach to COM development using VC++ 5.0 I can recommend this book to anyone who wants to know the COM/ActiveX concept from the foundations."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This book takes you step-by-step in understanding the intrinsics of COM.

If you don't know C++, do not buy the book. It is not a practical book. It just takes too much time to write COM this way. After you know the basic of COM, you will need other book(s) to do the actual COM development...and then this Inside COM probably stays inside the shelf forever. And some years later, you probably think of this book as the COM appreciation book.For the amount of information it provides, this book is over price."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"Each chapter starts with a story or allegory that somehow relates to the ideas of the chapter. I thought this was a unique and greatly helpful way to keep my interest in the book. It helped me understand the abstract theories involved in COM. This was an excellent guide for solving the problems I was having creating an ATL control in ActiveX. Every time I had a problem, this book provided an answer. The examples were complex, but explained well. They were an exact match to the problems I was trying to solve. Rogerson has created a masterful work that you will never regret buying."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"It's a good book to start COM.

Dale Rogerson should be commended. I've been in this field longer than most and can safely say this is one of the best intro books I've ever read. Clear, concise and straight to the point. No bloated examples that run for 200 pages. Just tiny and very simple snippets of code demonstrating the precise mechanics of how to develop a COM object from scratch. Target audience is C/C++ developers with a Microsoft compiler background though others will benefit as well. Don't listen to the naysayers on this one. This book is terrific."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This is the best book on COM. It teaches you what is COM and how to use it. Essential COM only tells you what is COM, but does NOT tell you how to use it. If you really need to use COM, go to this book. If you are not interested in what is under the hood, you may only need VB COM. But as a professional COM programmer, you got know what's going on inside. One reminder is that you need to have C++ knowledge. But that's the way it is. Buy this book and read it a couple of times. You would eventually understand what is COM."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"After skimming through four other books on COM and ActiveX, I found Inside COM to be the most clear and concise of all the books that I read.It provides a good high-level overview of COM and avoids a lot of the nasty details until later...A great first book on COM."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"I have to say that i was quite impressed by the content of this book. I started with David Chappell's book on COM and ActiveX and this took me a bit deeper into this somewhat complex subject. I would recommend it to anyone.

Nice book, though"},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"Ok, this is the skinny on COM:1) COM is hard2) you will not learn COM by reading only one book3) attempt COM in stages: read about it, use someone elses servers, write your ownservers, write your own servers in a multi-threaded environmentTo learn COM you must take weeks of expensive courses or read these books in this order:1) &quot;Understanding ActiveX and OLE&quot;: optional; easy read but recommended2) &quot;Inside COM&quot;: strongly recommended; if you really appreciate &quot;Essential COM&quot; without reading this first you are smarter than I am3) &quot;Multithreading Applications in Win32&quot;: strongly recommended4) &quot;Essential COM&quot;: essential; once you have your COM bearings read this book, then read it again in 6 months to realize how many details you missed the first time5) &quot;Beginning Atl Com Programming&quot;: recommended6) &quot;Effective COM&quot;: optional7) &quot;Essential ATL&quot;: optional8) &quot;Inside OLE2&quot;: optional, for brave souls onlyWhew! That is a lot but it all really is required. If you attempt shortcuts or read the books out of order, you risk being crushed by someone who really knows COM. Oh yeah, you must also know C++ cold, suspend your beliefs about C++ objects, and be open to the idea of distributed components. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This is much more than a COM book. The book spends a lot of time in the first half talking about the more general concept of interfaces, which is more of a software design topic. Then he shows how to implement those interfaces using C++ abstract classes and gives a very good discussion of inheritence, polymorphism, and virtual function tables. Everything is done in pure C++ so you can see what is going on. No wizards or macros to hide the details. The diagrams were very helpful.Even if you choose to not use the COM architecture for your software the discussion of interfaces will help you write software of much higher quality. Seeing how the interfaces are implemented and the discussion of inheritence and virtual function tables gave me a much better understanding of the C++ language.The key to understanding COM is understanding interfaces and this book does a very good job explaining them. Eventually when the author gets into the Microsoft specific COM library you can see how those chapters build on the earlier chapters. You can see how a program can evolve from a set of inflexible C++ classes, to some compile-time flexible C++ classes that use interfaces, to run-time flexible components using DLLs, and finally a full blown COM component.Near the end of the book it is not as thorough with the examples but that is because the topics presented there are too large to fit in a single chapter. The first 8 chapters are worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"If you are new to COM or know very little about it, this is the place to start. It explores the infrastructure without overwhelming the newcomer and gives very convincing arguments about why a specific component is there and how it ended up so.Keep in mind that one way of looking at this technology is to see it as an improvement on C++. (For this I call Don BOX to witness stand [1st chapter of 'Essential COM']) Also, don't forget that C++ is the implementation language of MFC and ATL frameworks. Hence the tendency to emphasize C++ in such technologies and (Micosoft Press) books.If you can't stand C/C++, I suggest that you grab one of those 'Active ... with Visual Basic/ Visual J++' books. These languages make the use of some aspects much easier, e.g. garbage collection, exception handling. But then again can you claim to know an architecture without getting your hands dirty with its assembler? I guess not!When you finish reading this book, if you think you can take more serious stuff, make sure you check out Don BOX's books: 'Essential COM' and 'Effective COM.'"},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This is a remarkable book for those who do not want to feel like a dummy looking at the stuff produced by a code generator (a so-called Wizard). This books explains everything, from why a C++ generated virtual table complies with COM specifications to the threading models of COM. This book will serve you best if you follow it letter by letter and develop base classes for your development according to the author. Then try to use standard ATL Wizard from VC++, compare its output to what you have learned and you will say to yourself: Ha! I know what is done and why! You will also get a feel that the author could have been the one who created the ATL Wizard. Even a complete example from this book, TANGRAM, bears the same name as a VC++ example. However unless you really have to develop very customized stuff I would recommend Wizard since it does all the work of the numerous component registrations for you and handles all compiler and linker switches. Also the book uses makefiles, so if you like IDE, you will feel slightly uncomfortable. It is also an excellent C++ tutorial on multiple inheritance and class libraries. A lot of C++ details are explained along the way. You will be a much better C++ programmer after you are done with the book"},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"A great look at COM under the hood. The style is clear and friendly, and the code is very well-written and documented. The author starts the first chapter with an excellent introduction that establishes the merits of COM as a component technology as well as the benefits of component-based programming. The following chapters continue with the development of COM Components from DOS command line programmes to fully-working COM Dll's.One of the great things about this book is how the author endeavors to explain the cryptic and confusing terminology of COM. I especially enjoyed the explaination of the concept of COM Apartments, which is the best treatment of the subject that I came upon to date.One has to keep in mind that this book is about COM, and just that. Active X controls are barely touched upon. ATL is not used at all. Instead the author builds his own light-weight library of classes, and that is the only drawback to the book that I can see.It's a great book for understanding the enternals of COM, but you'll probably need another to cover ATL, which is largely the standard library for writing COM and Active X components in C++."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This book starts out with a simple C++ class called by some other code, and works to encapsulate it into a component, basically implementing COM from scratch. This really lets you understand how it works and why. It's well written and does a good job describing all the details.As others have mentioned, this is not a book about ActiveX, OLE, ATL, or any of that, and it doesn't pretend to be. This book just describes COM, the basis for those technologies. If you want to really understand what's going on with COM, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"If you want to learn COM in C++, this book is DEFINITELY where you should start. If you find COM difficult to grasp, don't worry, it is most likely because you haven't learned from the right resources, or you haven't read this book.This book really covers all the essentials of COM programming. The author does a great job in making COM simple to comprehend. For instance, the author takes you step by step in every step of the way in every detail that required for you to get your hands dirty with code practises. Not only the explainations and code samples in the book are CLEAR, they are also backed up with diagrams on topics that are just can not be dissolved by words alone. Nicely done!If you were to take COM in University, this would be one of the two books required for the course. &quot;Inside COM&quot; would be for COM 100, and &quot;COM and ATL 3.0&quot; would be for COM 200. So if you want to learn COM in C++, these are your BEST BET. They get you started coding immediately, they provide all the required fundumentals, and best of all, they both are well written with NO mumble-jumble space filler!TIPS: Atfer you done with Andrew's book, go back and read Dale's book on chapter twelve - &quot;Multiple Threads&quot;.

ActiveX covered? Where? OLE? Author sends you for details about it to another sources. Pretty much nothing about IDL, marshalling, multi-threading (just take the things as they are).

Then, the mistakes are many and gets worse as it goes. The worst part is that the examples use makefiles that you can't understand. This is okay until the examples get more complex and then the author stops explaining the projects. The author should include .dsp files, but doesn't. At least, he should explain the projects so I have a chance at building the examples later in the book. My favorite quote is on page 211 &quot;First, we'll use C++ classes to make using COM components more like using C++ classes.&quot; My second favorite quote is on page 287 &quot;The first three (parameters) are easily explained... The third parameter holds localization information.&quot; Dale never again mentions &quot;localization&quot;, so I guess it was easy for him to explain."},{"Title":"Inside Com (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"A very easy and useful book.

I read the rave reviews on the back of the book and foolishly bought it. It is a rambling collection of pages about a period of history in which I have no interest (the 1800's) and the writing in very choppy and boring. The back of the book gave no clue as to the time period or the nationality of the characters. The &quot;coming to America&quot; stories are my least favorite. I never, ever throw books in the trash-I usually give them to charity or to the library. I threw this one away. I want this book off the street, so no other poor soul would make the same mistake I did and read this drivel."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Unlike many of the reviewers on this site, I started reading In America expecting not to like it. That's what happens to me with most novels by American Intellectuals. By the end of chapter zero, I was sure I would enjoy hating this book. Only an American Intellectual could listen to a discussion in Polish, without having spent a minute studying the language, and understand the essence of the conversation. But then came the rest of the book, which was a journey through time and interesting places. For me Sontag's California and Poland were the stars of the novel. I especially enjoyed Sontag's pictures of Zakopane in the days before it was taken over by tourists. Sontag's writing reminded me of I.B. Singer. The characters were not as strong, but the flow of the book had that old county feel. So, if you raise you sights a little lower and forget that Sontag is an American great and that this novel won awards, you might actually enjoy it as a light autumn read."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Sontag had fun recreating all this history and I enjoyed reading it, to a point. What was that long monologue by Edwin Booth - a character who did not appear in the book until nearly the end - doing as a conclusion to a book that was about Maryna? I skipped it. Why not conclude as she began with the conceit of the writer being drawn in by the characters, at the end drawing away and telling the reader how their lives went on?"},{"Title":"In America","review":"It was great experience to read this book. Yeah! it's great."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Reading this book is like having someone snatch a particularly juicy feast out from under your nose before you've had the chance to enjoy it properly. &quot;In America&quot; is a rich tale to savor, but slices of it are underdone and it comes to such an abrupt end that the reader is left wondering what happened to the final course.Starting the novel with an awkward Zero chapter--meant, I think, to better explain the characters--Susan Sontag tells of Maryna Zalezowska, the leading Polish actress of the 1870s, who comes to California to open a utopian commune near Anaheim. The commune quickly fails, and Zalezowska begins the task of reinventing herself as an American actress. She does this brilliantly, and begins a new career traveling across the United States in a private train car performing everything from Shakespeare to the 19th century's favorite sob-fest, &quot;East Lynne.&quot;The sections on how an actress of that age learned and prepared roles, and the insight into nuts-and-bolts workings of 19th century American theater are marvelous, as are the stunning monologue chapters expressing the three main characters' internal and external struggles (the book ends with a devastating monologue by Edwin Booth that is one terrific piece of writing). On the other hand some of the characters are barely sketched and &quot;In America&quot; simply ends. There's no resolution, no sense that the last page of the book should be the last page-in fact, you'll probably turn that page expecting a concluding chapter. And you'll feel cheated.There's something mean about allowing readers such access to characters' minds and emotions and then chopping the narrative when there is obviously so much to come. Is it that Sontag can't sustain the narrative? The novel reads that way.It is hard to know how many stars to give &quot;In America.&quot; I found much of it fascinating, but felt slighted by the lack of resolution. Yes, even though I know that the real-life model for Maryna, Helena Modjeska, had a long and successful career before retiring to the remote Southern California canyon that still bears her name, I feel robbed of the chance to follow her there, guided by Sontag's masterly hand."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Award winning literature should provoke thoughtful questions. Susan Sontag's &quot;In America&quot; prompted my bookclub to ask: 1) Where the heck was her editor? 2) Was it simply Susan Sontag's turn to win the National Book Award? 3) If &quot;In America&quot; was penned by an unknown author, would it have even been published? 4) Did the guy who was quoted on the back cover actually read the book? Would he please tell us where the &quot;hilarious&quot; parts are? 5) Why did the chapters that were 1 paragraph yet 17+ pages long irritate us so? 6) Does a single interesting premise like &quot;Immigrating to a new country allows you to reinvent yourself&quot; merit 387 tedious pages? and finally 7) Why the heck did our bookclub pick this book?"},{"Title":"In America","review":"I share the same sentiment that others have expressed: Why did this book receive the National Book Award? From its disconnected beginning, to its rambling stream of consciousness ending, the book lacks cohesiveness, character development, and theme. Even the plot is trite and fails to captivate. One senses that Sontag was rushed in the writing -- perhaps hoping to fulfill a contract? Although she bothers to take some time in the beginning to explore Maryna's desire to retreat to America, her family background, and initial delvings into the theatre; Sontag literally whisks the reader through the middle of the book to its conclusion -- dabbling at Maryna's theatre excursions in San Francisco and her touring trip with her husband. More frustrating is Sontag's constant fluxing of writing style -- from hypothetical letters, to experimental conversation in which she addresses multiple people (upon Maryna's brief return to Poland), to the gibberish of a soliloquy delivered by Edwin Booth.Ultimately, the book fails to achieve a unified theme. Sontag hints at the destruction of a utopian society, at the strange interworkings of a marriage of convenience, at an actress's chameleonic personality, at the &quot;plight&quot; of the privileged immigrant. However, none of these themes is explored in depth, nor does any one seem to be the author's driving motivation behind the book. Similarly, none of the characters' behavior offers convincing explanation; and therefore, not a single character won my sympathy or understanding.For a captivating book on immigration to the West, as well as the profound, analytical exploration of two very different people in a marriage, I highly recommend Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose instead. In America is a weak, languishing similitude of that great book, at best."},{"Title":"In America","review":"I have enjoyed the depth of Susan Sontag's lucid, witty essays in the New Yorker magazine, and recently we saw her on Cspan Book -TV. A caller asked what would be the best introduction to her writings, and she suggested her novel \\"In America.\\"This book was surprisingly disappointing to me. I kept waiting to get swept up into it, but came to the last page with only a sense of duty for finishing. The characters are drawn well enough ,the time frame (post-Civil War America) is interesting, but the book failed to engage me somehow. Sontag has an affinity for the movies and for actors;she has created as the lead character a Polish actress who finds stellar success on the American stage.I will continue to enjoy Sontag's essays but doubt I will read another of her novels."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Generally, the reviews of In America here are dazzylingly unfair. Certainly, reading this novel is not like sitting down and watching TV, or even reading the Sunday New York Times. The novel demands that the reader read changes of style, tone, shift in narrative focus, change from letters to first person narrative back to third person narrative, to a sort of interior monologue. What is wrong with this, if it is done with control, as Songtag does, except for the fact it demands that readers fail to be lazy? So, this is not a novel for the easily frazzled. It demands faith from the reader, but rewards the reader for this trust with a deep investigation of what it means to be an American and human."},{"Title":"In America","review":"This book is the first I have read by Susan Sontag. But I thought, National Book Award, it must be excellent. I was disappointed, however, when I had to force my way through the quasi-historical prelude to Chapter One. Relieved to make it to the first chapter, at least by now the characters are making sense. I literally force myself to finish this book. None of the characters are appealing, form Maryna, the actress, to her husband, Bogdon, or her lover, Ryszard, all Polish immigrants. Surely the most self-involved of all is Maryna, her main topic of interest being herself and her effect on other people. The plot and sub-plots all revolve around this woman. She dominates the entire landscape of everyone's thoughts. Why? &quot;Frankly, my dear, to borrow a phrase, I don't give a damn.&quot; All the historical detail in the world cannot save this book. I also purchased THE VOLCANO LOVER, but after this experience, I think I'll pass both books on to those obsessed with 18th century verbage. Historical is one thing, mind-numbing is another."},{"Title":"In America","review":"In America intends to be an \\"important\\" act of \\"literature.\\" It is not. It is not even a good read. In the whole story of Maryna Zalezowska, a Polish actress who emigrates to America with a horde of friends and admirers, fails to found a commune farm, and returns to success on the stage, the only remotely memorable moments are snapshots of local color that are almost digressions from the story itself.The account of two of the characters' sea passage across the Atlantic, focusing on the contrast between their first-class accommodations and those in steerage, actually is touching. There are descriptions of 19th century New York, early Anaheim, and Comstock Lode silver mining towns that might make a die-hard jingoist shed a tear, not because they are flattering of America, but just because they portray her painted large in all the false glory of the gilded age. The last chapter, a long, rambling, almost humorous monologue by Edwin Booth as he half-heartedly tries to seduce the protagonist by telling her how pathetic a person he is, is worth reading (or maybe that was only my impression because it was the end of the book).But these highlights are actually digressions from the story itself. The real story, revolves around Maryna, who is terribly uninteresting. She possesses a self-centeredness that enables her to do whatever she wants and entrain those around her in her wake, but when one looks closer to see what aspects of her character this self-centeredness might stem from, there is nothing. No innate charisma beyond being a beautiful woman, no grand ideas other than those lifted wholesale from 19th century French social theorists, no traits of human mobility, as if a present-day purveyor of postmodern literature could condescend to believe in such a thing. By authorial fiat, Maryna is the center of her world, but she lacks the attributes that might enable her to be the center of the reader's.Since Maryna must be the focal point of the book, on several times another character's subplot is developed just to the point of becoming interesting, only to be promptly aborted. One couple in the commune, Julian and Wanda, have latent marital problems that America brings into much clearer focus. Wanda makes a suicide attempt, and then the characters are shipped back to Poland and mostly forgotten about. Maryna begins an affair with her persistent admirer Ryszard. It turns stale and ends. We discover Maryna's husband Bogdan is sexually attracted to the Mexican farmhands in Anaheim, but this goes nowhere as it is immaterial to Maryna's career, and by extension the book. Basically, the whole novel revolves around an innately uninteresting person, and all other characters must become even more completely two-dimensional to avoid supplanting her.In America contains nothing worth caring about. It contains a few digressions that aren't enslaved to Maryna's story, and in these digressions, Sontag shows she is capable of writing a much better book. However, she did not do so."},{"Title":"In America","review":"The plot of \\"In America\\", Susan Sontag's National Book Award-winning novel, is adumbrated in her introductory note, where she describes the real historical life that inspired the fictional work. In Sontag's words, the novel was \\"inspired by the emigration to America in 1876 of Helena Modrzejewska, Poland's most celebrated actress, accompanied by her husband, Count Karol Chlapowski, her fifteen-year-old son Rudolf, and the young journalist and future author of \`Quo Vadis' Henryk Sienkiewicz, and a few friends; their brief sojourn in Anaheim, California; and Modrzejewska's subsequent triumphant career on the American stage under the name of Helen Modjeska.\\" While Sontag strongly emphasizes that the characters and actions depicted in her novel are purely invented (and there is no reason to believe the contrary), the plot largely follows the biography that inspired it.\\"In America\\" begins in a post-modernist fashion, the book's \\"Chapter Zero\\" being the first person narrative of a contemporary authorial voice who finds herself coming out of the cold winter of an unidentified Eastern European city, shivering, into a party in the private dining room of a hotel more than a hundred years earlier. There is seemingly a disjunction of time and place. The narrator does not understand the language the people are speaking, \\"but somehow, I didn't question how, their words reached me as sense.\\" From this point, the authorial voice, the imagination, begins naming the people in the room-in effect, begins creating the characters that will populate the tale to follow-and begins probing the animated conversation she overhears, the snippets of enigmatic dialogue that will gradually accrete into the novel. As the narrator suggests at the end of this Chapter Zero, in words resonant of a theme by Virginia Woolf, \\"each of us carries a room within ourselves, waiting to be furnished and peopled, and if you listen closely, you may need to silence everything in your own room, you can hear the sounds of that other room inside your head.\\" Thus, in typical Sontag fashion, the novel itself begins with a self-conscious intrusion of theory and authorial presence.From this interesting and auspicious beginning, \\"In America\\" seamlessly glides into the narrative proper, the story of Maryna Zalezowska, a much beloved Polish actress who, together with her husband Bogdan, her son Piotr, her paramour Ryszard, and an entourage of friends and followers, emigrates to America in 1876. Landing in New York, the group spends a brief period living in Hoboken, visiting the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia and exploring New York City before embarking on a voyage to the West. After a brief sojourn in San Francisco, they move down the coast to Southern California, where they establish a small settlement in Anaheim. Maryna, the leader of her band of ardent disciples, sees their vineyard and farm in Anaheim as a kind of acting out of Fourieristic ideals, a little Brook Farm of Polish emigrants in the Wild West. Life is hard, however, and the utopian dream soon becomes a dystopic unraveling as Maryna goes back to San Francisco, has a brief affair with Ryzsard and returns to the theater. Her husband, Bogan, remains at the Anaheim settlement until it can be sold and then rejoins Maryna in San Francisco, where she has become an overnight theatrical sensation, her Polish stardom now burning brightly in America.From this point, the novel becomes almost exclusively the story of Maryna. She changes her name to Marina Zalenska, travels to Virginia City and, eventually, New York City (and even, briefly, London), and attracts fans and admirers wherever she goes. Her life becomes a self-centered, exhaustive tour of America, performing with her own repertory company and making stage appearances with the Edwin Booth, the most renowned actor of the time. Pushing the narrative's other characters into the shadows, Marina Zalenska makes America her own, \\"In America\\" being not so much the story of what it was like for a group of Eastern Europeans to emigrate to America, but, rather, the story of Marina Zalenska's personal triumph in America.Susan Sontag is a brilliant writer, her prose supple and lithe. Reading this book is effortless. Sontag also uses a range of stylistic devices-journal entries, letters, theatrical dialogue, monologue-which make \\"In America\\" a fascinating literary construction. However, the quality of the writing does not redeem the listless tenor of the tale or the shallowness of the characters and ideas which Sontag propogates. At one point, Maryna says, \\"an actor doesn't need to have an essence. Perhaps it would be a hindrance for an actor to have an essence. An actor needs only a mask.\\" Unfortunately, Maryna's view of acting seemingly permeates this novel, the view of the character becoming the practice of the author: the characters and the ideas of \\"In America\\" are not essential, but only superficial. Like the post-modernist beginnings of Chapter Zero, the reader only gets a shallow tale, a tale that glides on a sparkling smooth surface with trivial and uninteresting characters; while the writing is easy, the story fails to hold the reader's interest and, hence, the reading becomes difficult and soporific. \\"In America\\" is perhaps worth reading, but it is not deserving of the National Book Award."},{"Title":"In America","review":"You can't ignore the self-consciousness of the author in this book, but in away she deals with this and does away with it in the prologue. The mystery of this book is the borderline between Sontag's consciousness and the protagonists. What it is really about is the violation and domination of the minds of others. Not only is the protagonist an actress as a character but a historical person acting out her consciousness through Sontag's mind. Rather than some mystical conjuring act this is an active method of recreating ideals. The feminine ideal is an endless performer: one who is constantly made-up and at the same time natural. It is this contradiction which is explored in the protagonist's life. Sontag is testing the merge of actor (ficional being) and actual person. The performer is inevitably lost, but paradoxically in this novel the performer is pushed back on stage. Is this where she naturally belongs? This is what you should ask going into In America. It is about ideas concerning identity and its conclusions are highly sophisticated."},{"Title":"In America","review":"This was a fascinating book. Written in Susan Sontag's unique writing style it is a many layered work. It entails a woman's search for her own itentity, the idealism of commune life, the nature of love and much more. We start off with a group of Polish idealists starting up a commune in California with no idea of what they are doing and end up seeing a picture of the theater life in America at the end of the 19th. century. Only a writer with skill like Susan Sontag could pull off a transition like this so smoothly. The only objection I have is the ending---the book simply ends. There are no obvious loose ends hanging, but the story definately lacks a conclusion."},{"Title":"In America","review":"I was hoping for a long more than this from Sontag and the National Book Award committee. The story is somewhat of a cliche and the characters -- while noble in a sense -- are somewhat dull and overly introspective. This was a chore to finish."},{"Title":"In America","review":"A truly entertaining book that kept me captivated. I enjoyed Sontag's use of different writing styles to convey the many characters through the story."},{"Title":"In America","review":"In 1876 Poland's leading actress, Helena Modrzejewska, along with family and friends, including journalist and novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz (\\"Quo Vadis\\"), emigrated to southern California to establish a utopian community. Like most such communities, it failed, and so, with a newly Americanized name, Helena Modjeska launched a second career as her adopted country's leading Shakespearean actress, touring coast to coast with such celebrity actors as Edwin Booth.These are the skeletal historical facts on which Sontag bases her second novel: Helena Modjeska becomes Maryna Zalenska, Henryk Sienkiewicz becomes Ryszard Kierul, although Booth gets to keep his name. This local slice of Anaheim history was rediscovered by Sontag and stuck with her; the novel's genesis is re-imagined in the opening Chapter \\"Zero,\\" one of the most brilliant examples of metafiction ever published. A twentieth-century writer is walking through a winter storm in Warsaw when she happens by a party inside a hotel--a scene, of course, that takes place wholly in her mind. She listens in on their conversations and realizes that the celebrants are planning to leave for America; although theirs is not the story she had planned to write (\\"having tried to conjure up a hotel dining room from the same era in Sarajevo\\"), she \\"decided to follow them out into the world.\\"\\"Into the world\\" means \\"into America,\\" and, for an immigrant, Sontag's Zalenska is a bit too perfect, too confident, too understanding--in spite of her affairs and her failings. She's almost a nineteenth-century romantic fantasy figure of imported aristocracy. Sontag sets this feminine ideal against the starry-eyed, comic naivety of the actual and imagined eccentrics who surrounded Modjeska/Zalenska, including a closeted husband with an eye for the local youth and an endearingly irritable voice teacher.The real-life Polish immigrants left behind a rather generous body of texts--journalism, diaries, letters, memoirs--that Sontag made liberal use of when composing her novel, and \\"In America\\" similarly alternates among these various genres during the course of the narrative. The incorporation of scattered passages from the original texts without setting them off from her own writing led to charges of plagiarism against Sontag, although all the excerpts, while obscure, are in the public domain, and one would be hard-pressed to say she tried to hide their use.Such perceived impropriety would have been forgiven, in any case, if Sontag's experiment had resulted in a more cohesive work, but the book occasionally has the whiff of being the product of a writing seminar. The final result is a novel whose chapters fluctuate from postmodern brilliance to family scrapbook. Nevertheless, I still found the story of the Modjeskas/Zalenskas almost consistently fascinating enough to excuse the relatively minor shortcomings of the methods Sontag used to re-imagine their tale."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Once the gassy raconteuse of Chapter Zero has been endured (this device may have been charming in brief, but does not remain engaging for more than a few pages), there is a brief, disorienting feeling of freedom as the unknown frontier of the novel is broached. Unfortunately, this exuberance dissipates immediately.Not that there isn't a terrific novel hidden In America somewhere.I can't help but wonder why Sontag chose to tell much of the novel from her female protagonist's perspective, since her male narrators are so consistently vividly imagined and effective, and her female characters are not. A scene in steerage and an excerpt from Maryna's husband's diary are much more provocative than Maryna's musing... since the actress-protagonist is a motivating force and an object of adoration, there really isn't much for her to do besides inspire and wonder. Interestingly enough, this imbalance, this failure of imagination when portraying male and female perspectives, is also evident in The Volcano Lover (a much more fully realized book).Perhaps the questions Sontag asked herself in writing this book were never satisfactorily answered for (asked by?) the author... or perhaps the book means to evoke the aridity of both failed dreams and success, as well as the narcissism of the theater and the heavy blankness of the American gaze.Regardless, this is not generally a diverting reading experience, nor is it particularly engaging as a novel of ideas."},{"Title":"In America","review":"The designation of &quot;National Book Award Winner&quot; has lost all credibility.

Whatever it may be, it is fascinating narrative-poetry, and only worth of the highest praise."},{"Title":"In America","review":"This National Book Award Winner is the story of a famous Polish actress who emigrates to the United States in 1875, with her husband, child, and an entourage of friends and would-be-lovers to start a new and idyllic life for themselves on a commune farm located near the German settlement of Anaheim, CA. They are artists, writers, actors, and nobility who fail at farming in the hot, dry climate they chose to cultivate. Maryna Lezowska (real life Helena Modrzejewska) changed her name to Marina Zalenska (real life Helena Modjeska) returned to acting and began a triumphant career in America. Called the \`Countess' as a publicity ploy because of her marriage to a Polish count, Marina became famous across this country and astounded audience after audience with performances of Portia and Lady Macbeth, two among many roles she portrayed. I was amazed by her memory. She performed one arduous role after another, a different play every night of the week, but the heroines sounded so similar: How could she remember which one she was doing? What a repertoire! As Sontag's story unfolds we are treated to America and Americans through the eyes of a brilliant woman of the 19th century. At the end we enjoy a visit from an alcoholic Edwin Booth as he soliloquizes re his life, a famous actor-father, Shakespeare, and the brother who killed Lincoln. We see America embrace theater; a thorough, insightful, picture of America in a bygone era. I found this journalistic, historical novel ... very boring for the most part. Certainly not a page-turner.

I read the novel with quickness and fascination from beginning to end. Those who have panned it may not recognize (or value) its uniqueness. It blends the form of the script with the form of the novel. For example, it ends with a fascinating soliloquy by Edwin Booth, who goes on for pages as Maryna has before him. It's about the self-obsessed, intriguing, grand lives of great performers more than it is about \\"coming to America\\" or \\"setting up a utopia doomed for failure.\\" It's about self-obsession and not being able to stand the reflection of yourself that you see in others who are like you... It doesn't hold together in a linear way. It's more like Morrison than Frazier or the like. It's inventive in form and style, and I found it fascinating."},{"Title":"In America","review":"In 1876, a group of Polish immigrants flee the Russian authorities that control their native land. They establish a commune in Southern California. The person behind the journey is Poland's leading actress, Maryna Zalewska who has given up the stage to be with her husband and son IN AMERICA. She persuades several individuals and families to join her on her quest for freedom.However, political and social freedom does not necessarily mean economic freedom. The commune fails, leaving its bankrupt members wary and disillusioned with their taste of freedom. Maryna, not one to sit around and mope, returns to the stage where she becomes the &quot;American&quot; rival to Sara Bernhardt. She wonders about her future IN AMERICA and the dreams that died with the collapse of the commune. With novels like THE VOLCANO LOVER and IN AMERICA, Susan Sontag has become the novelist of choice for historiographers and anyone who enjoys a well-researched period piece. The story line is filled with the abject lessons of American history that is not covered in American classroom settings. Maryna is an intriguing character and her ability to adapt to circumstances is admirable. She fails to gain reader empathy because nothing really disturbs her except her own ennui. Fans who enjoy a well-written historical novel will find Ms. Sontag's tale enchanting and entertaining.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"In America","review":"In a long and very public career, Susan Sontag has made a great many pronouncements, and inevitably some have come back to haunt her. Certainly her characterization of the white race as the cancer of history seens like a grandiose bit of breast-beating. But hey, there's no point in beating up on her new novel for a statement she made nearly 25 years ago. &quot;In America&quot; is by no means a perfect work of fiction--to call it a novel of ideas is in fact the highest compliment AND the lowest blow you could aim at it. Yet it's packed with strange and cerebral wonders that only Sontag could dream up. And the protagonist is a truly memorable, realistically erratic diva, who cuts a dramatic (in every sense of the word) swathe across late Victorian America."},{"Title":"In America","review":"The best feature of Sontag's novel was the narative style which did not fail to change from Chapter to Chapter. Sometimes it was in an omniscient voice, and other times in the character's own first person narative, in writing and speech, which brought us into the minds and thoughts of the various fascinating Poles in the story. The plot of the story is ineresting in itself to a certain degree, but the idea of leaving Europe and forging a new life in America must have been re-done many times over esp. in the original immigrant literature. The irony of how the Europeans went to America to leave what they were used to behind, to escape the fetters, but seem to pursue the exact same fetters in America is present in Sontag's novel. It also brings out the other ironic element of wanting to do something different and unexpected, but falling into the mold in wanting to form an utopian community which was fashionable at the time. I enjoyed the flow of the storyline and the characterisation of Ryszard as the writer and Maryna as an actress, artists who without art will lose their self, and their use. The first Chapter of the book also leaves one wondering -- was that the author as a persona -- Sontag imagining her characters into play? As a writer would? To see their world, enter it, and develop it? Or was it a neutral observer preparing is for Maryna's plan to leave for America? Sontag's novel of immigration, America, Europe, art, religion and relationships is thought-provoking and a fascinating study. Highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Our book club agrees totally with L.A. Readers Anonymous. Terrible.

Mildely interesting story, laconic pacing, settings thathave been desceibed better by even the likes of John Jakes (isn't that sad, since I did NOT like his latest effort either). I keep reading, waiting for something to happen and I have so far beenr disappointed (and I am nearly finished). All I can say is I am glad I took this one out of the library first, otherwise I would have felt ripped off. Sorry, but awards do not a good book make. Two stars for effort and some nicely crafted language, otherwise find something else to read and don't waste your time on on this one."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Susan Sontag's National Book Award winning &quot;In America&quot; is a beautifully written but complex - if not difficult - novel of ideas. Boasting some of the most gorgeous prose ever committed to print, it is bursting with heartfelt yearning and promise for the future as it traces the path taken by the celebrated stage actress Maryna and her community of friends, who embittered by their history of colonisation by the Russians, chose to leave Poland in the late 19th century to build a utopian commune in America. Their grand agrarian experiment to rediscover the vitality of simple living and return to basics fails. Due to lack of experience or otherwise, Maryna's commune comprising scholars, writers, painters and their families, breaks up and some of them return to their former lives in Poland. Maryna herself, after a brief period of self imposed exile returns to active professional life and quickly establishes herself as a celebrity once again but this time in her newly adopted country. &quot;In America&quot; raises a whole cache of fascinating ideas. It contrasts the inherent cynicism and corruption of old world values with the innocence, optimism but also shallowness of new world morality. Sontag's ambitious novel starts off promisingly, using an unnamed female narrator who then mysteriously disappears, never to show up again. The narrative then segues seamlessly into a penetrating and fascinating peek into the Polish soul. Using a blend of shifting perspectives, the experience is both insightful and mesmerising. But when the utopian commune breaks up, some of the magic in Sontag's writing also evaporates. Certainly I found the final 100 pages or so a little pedestrian. The use of a jumble of literary formats including letters, poems, rotating confessions, etc also gives a slightly disjointed and unstructured feel to the book. The concluding section featuring a soliloquy by Edwin Booth emerges from nowhere to close the book ! Talk of abrupt endings. However, the high points were so absorbing I was too far away in seventh heaven to notice or mind. &quot;In America&quot; is an outstanding literary achievement. It may not make easy reading but it'll repay your effort many times over. Don't miss it !"},{"Title":"In America","review":"I read this book as my first Sontag excursion. I picked it because it won the National Book Award. I was incredibly disappointed in the book. True enough, Sontag is an excellent writer and an expressive one as well. However, in this book, she seems to have been carried away by a desire to show the reader, just how many different writing styles she seems to perceive herself to have mastered. She slips into perhaps six different styles of writing in the book, ranging from the epistolary, to the stream of consciousness to the plain prose. The book is more an experiment in stylized writing techniques and the plot and story are just plain droll. I found myself wishing I was at the end, by the time I got to the half way point. While it is unusual for the NBA to give their award to such a mediocre piece of literature, it would be my recommendation to any would be reader that they NOT WASTE THEIR TIME reading THIS BOOK. It is not worth the investment. I would have rather reread the plays by Shakespeare and others that she constantly references in her book, just so the reader understands she has a complete knowledge of classic thesbian literature. I will not bother to read any of her other works, nor any future ones either."},{"Title":"In America","review":"After the intruiging, if slightly awkward, opening chapter in which Sontag insinuates herself into the narrative, this high brow soap opera begins to skirt terrain already charted by the likes of the far less gifted Isabel Allende in, say, &quot;Daughter of Fortune&quot; or &quot;The Infinite Plan&quot;, though it never abandons its philosophy in favor of melodramtic plot twists, as did those unfortunate books. Indeed, there's far more substance and interest here in Sontag's dissection of cultural displacement, artistic integrity and sexual mores than there is in the fairly listless plot, which always seems to be moving forward without ever gaining steam. Even the most dramatic of events (the collapse of the Anaheim compound, for instance) is rendered with such clear-eyed dispassion that it can be hard to care about these characters or their various fates. That said, this novel is so wrought with provocative ideas, the prose is so elegant, that only the most shallow of readers will fail to be drawn into the world (or, rather, worlds) which Sontag has beautifully delineated: the Old World vs. the New, the material world vs. the interior (artistic) world. If this book fails to reach the narrative and intellectual heights of &quot;The Volcano Lover&quot;, it offers enough rewards of its own to make it worthwhile reading. And every new Sontag book is a welcome addition to the shelves, whatevers its flaws."},{"Title":"In America","review":"This odd novel is like a charming house surrounded by an imposing edifice. While I found the idea of the first chapter very appealing - we observe the author considering her characters and gradually entering their lives - the lack of paragraphs and sustained distance were frustrating. I kept turning to the blurbs on the back to give me faith that the book would achieve motion. When it finally did, it felt like a railroad train developing steam and then chugging right along. The stories of New York and Anaheim at the turn of the century were wonderful, as were the carefully researched tales of trouping in America. Maryna, both a diva and marvelously complex woman, was grand enough to carry the novel and most of the major characters on her back. The novel's coda, unfortunately, was as dense and forbidding as the opening. While I enjoyed reading Edwin Booth's reflections on a life in Shakespeare and was fascinated by the fate of the Booths, more of my attention was commanded by Sontag than either Booth or Marina. Perhaps that brought the act of imagination full circle with the author once again facing her creation, but I missed the livelier environs of the heart of the book, when Marina was stealing the spotlight and creating the illusion of something larger than life."},{"Title":"In America","review":"In this novel, a Polish theater star travels to America with her troop of blindly smitten friends and family in the late 19th century to live off the land and hide from the spotlight. When her plan for self-sufficiency on the farm fails, she challenges the American theater stage.The beautiful Polish actress, Madame Zalenska, whose self-centeredness is nauseating, does offer a level of sharp wit and intelligence that at times makes her likeable or at least respectable. There are rare glimpses of Sontag's tendency for profound insight throughout the novel in terms of her ability to recognize and document the subtle delicacies of human relationships. Kernels of Sontag's views on American culture, sexuality, race, and art are present in the novel but in the context of the shallow story they appear out of place.The novel contains far too many boring lists of Madame Zalenska's numerous performances and far too many hyperbolic descriptions of Zalenska's seemingly superhuman acting ability and feminine charm.Zalenska's brief venture into the role of a farm wife in Santa Ana, California was the most interesting part of the novel as it offered some respite from the \\"star quality\\" of Zalenska that had become tiring early in the novel.The novel ended abruptly coinciding with the introduction of a character who had been merely mentioned prior. The ending robbed the reader of hope for some last minute character development or growth on the part of Madame Zalenska that could have added import and resolution to the novel as a whole."},{"Title":"In America","review":"If I want to read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century, then I read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century. This boring, pretentious, rambling, self-involved, pontificating mess passes itself off as fiction, but it reads like one of those junior-high assignments where students are told to imagine themselves living in another time or place. How on earth it could have received a National Book Award is a mystery, even considering the spotty reputation of the award. One or two times I began to feel swept up in the narrative (I appreciated Bogdan's journal entries, his unrequited pining for lovely young boys), but quickly enough that narrative flow was dammed by another lengthy, boring letter or monologue. I would refer those who want to read a masterful book about an eastern European artist coming to America in the nineteenth century to read Josef Skvorecky's 'Dvorak in Love'. Now there's a book!"},{"Title":"In America","review":"The plot of \\"In America\\", Susan Sontag's National Book Award-winning novel, is adumbrated in her introductory note, where she describes the real historical life that inspired the fictional work. In Sontag's words, the novel was \\"inspired by the emigration to America in 1876 of Helena Modrzejewska, Poland's most celebrated actress, accompanied by her husband, Count Karol Chlapowski, her fifteen-year-old son Rudolf, and the young journalist and future author of 'Quo Vadis' Henryk Sienkiewicz, and a few friends; their brief sojourn in Anaheim, California; and Modrzejewska's subsequent triumphant career on the American stage under the name of Helen Modjeska.\\" While Sontag strongly emphasizes that the characters and actions depicted in her novel are purely invented (and there is no reason to believe the contrary), the plot largely follows the biography that inspired it.\\"In America\\" begins in a post-modernist fashion, the book's \\"Chapter Zero\\" being the first person narrative of a contemporary authorial voice who finds herself coming out of the cold winter of an unidentified Eastern European city, shivering, into a party in the private dining room of a hotel more than a hundred years earlier. There is seemingly a disjunction of time and place. The narrator does not understand the language the people are speaking, \\"but somehow, I didn't question how, their words reached me as sense.\\" From this point, the authorial voice, the imagination, begins naming the people in the room-in effect, begins creating the characters that will populate the tale to follow-and begins probing the animated conversation she overhears, the snippets of enigmatic dialogue that will gradually accrete into the novel. As the narrator suggests at the end of this Chapter Zero, in words resonant of a theme by Virginia Woolf, \\"each of us carries a room within ourselves, waiting to be furnished and peopled, and if you listen closely, you may need to silence everything in your own room, you can hear the sounds of that other room inside your head.\\" Thus, in typical Sontag fashion, the novel itself begins with a self-conscious intrusion of theory and authorial presence.From this interesting and auspicious beginning, \\"In America\\" seamlessly glides into the narrative proper, the story of Maryna Zalezowska, a much beloved Polish actress who, together with her husband Bogdan, her son Piotr, her paramour Ryszard, and an entourage of friends and followers, emigrates to America in 1876. Landing in New York, the group spends a brief period living in Hoboken, visiting the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia and exploring New York City before embarking on a voyage to the West. After a brief sojourn in San Francisco, they move down the coast to Southern California, where they establish a small settlement in Anaheim. Maryna, the leader of her band of ardent disciples, sees their vineyard and farm in Anaheim as a kind of acting out of Fourieristic ideals, a little Brook Farm of Polish emigrants in the Wild West. Life is hard, however, and the utopian dream soon becomes a dystopic unraveling as Maryna goes back to San Francisco, has a brief affair with Ryzsard and returns to the theater. Her husband, Bogan, remains at the Anaheim settlement until it can be sold and then rejoins Maryna in San Francisco, where she has become an overnight theatrical sensation, her Polish stardom now burning brightly in America.From this point, the novel becomes almost exclusively the story of Maryna. She changes her name to Marina Zalenska, travels to Virginia City and, eventually, New York City (and even, briefly, London), and attracts fans and admirers wherever she goes. Her life becomes a self-centered, exhaustive tour of America, performing with her own repertory company and making stage appearances with the Edwin Booth, the most renowned actor of the time. Pushing the narrative's other characters into the shadows, Marina Zalenska makes America her own, \\"In America\\" being not so much the story of what it was like for a group of Eastern Europeans to emigrate to America, but, rather, the story of Marina Zalenska's personal triumph in America.Susan Sontag is a brilliant writer, her prose supple and lithe. Reading this book is effortless. Sontag also uses a range of stylistic devices-journal entries, letters, theatrical dialogue, monologue-which make \\"In America\\" a fascinating literary construction. However, the quality of the writing does not redeem the listless tenor of the tale or the shallowness of the characters and ideas which Sontag propogates. At one point, Maryna says, \\"an actor doesn't need to have an essence. Perhaps it would be a hindrance for an actor to have an essence. An actor needs only a mask.\\" Unfortunately, Maryna's view of acting seemingly permeates this novel, the view of the character becoming the practice of the author: the characters and the ideas of \\"In America\\" are not essential, but only superficial. Like the post-modernist beginnings of Chapter Zero, the reader only gets a shallow tale, a tale that glides on a sparkling smooth surface with trivial and uninteresting characters; while the writing is easy, the story fails to hold the reader's interest and, hence, the reading becomes difficult and soporific. \\"In America\\" is perhaps worth reading, but it is not deserving of the National Book Award."},{"Title":"In America","review":"This book tells the story of an actress, Maryna Zalezowska, a character Sontag tells us is loosely based on the career of Helena Modjeska, a famous turn-of-the-century Polish actress. The basic story is of her acting life in Poland and subsequent move to the \`promised land' of America, where she sets up a commune with fellow artists and friends, and continues her acting triumphs.Throughout the book Sontag blurs fact and fiction. Real-life characters, such as the American actor Edwin Booth, interact with the fictional characters. Similarly, we hear of Sarah Bernhardt, described as Zalezowka's greatest rival, and of key moments in American history. Sontag is clearly trying to retell the American myth in fiction, and this is certainly not the first time a writer has used the method of using both real and fictional characters - Cervantes's Don Quijote is an early example. However, with this book, Sontag fails to convince on either the fictional side or the depiction of the reality of emerging America. Character description is poor and it is extremely difficult to engage with the heroine. This is partly because there is so little context - we get no sense of her struggle with her adopted country, and no picture of any of the minor characters, with the possible exception of her husband, Bogdan. This is a shame, because the other characters are potentially extremely interesting. One commits suicide - we have little idea why. We don't really find out what any of the Poles think about their new land, or their new neighbours. At the end of the book they simply go back to Poland. Again, it's not clear why, or whether they feel they have succeeded or failed in their artistic endeavour. Similarly, Sontag seems to have little of interest to say about the new land. America is seen as the place where \`everything is new', where \`money is important' and where you can \`create your own future'. No major insights there! There are things to enjoy and appreciate in the book - the descriptions of theatrical life being particularly interesting - but these are are few and far between.Sontag is an extremely self-conscious narrator, constantly reminding the reader that she is there, commenting on the story she is telling. This prevents her from losing herself in the story, and the reader from doing the same. This is partly a problem of the novel of ideas. Yet plenty of other authors have managed to bring a novel of ideas alive, Milan Kundera being a good example. Sadly, as in her other fictional work, the reader of In America feels the presence of the theorist/philosopher too strongly to be able to enjoy the book as a work of fiction, and is left feeling frustrated."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Electing to read IN AMERICA beacuse of its awards I found this bloated novel to be a bit heavy on author intrusiveness. As many have pointed out, the first chapter (actually a 27 page paragraph) makes the author analyze a room of Polish people and, without knowing the language or actually hearing conversations in toto, assign them roles as if casting the play that follows. I think this is why we are left with incompletely fleshed out characters. The premise of the book ( expatriation from European nobility to American homgenation) has been written before and better. There are pages of beautiful descriptive writing to be sure - Sontag is well practiced at her craft - but in the end we are left not really caring about the stolid, laborious venture through which we've waded. Though Sontag is hypnotized by studies of history's influences on the present, I think she writes better when she sticks to her own metier."},{"Title":"In America","review":"I read this book because it won the National Book Award for fiction this year, and I am trying to read all such winners so I figured I should read this year's winner. (I have now read 39 winners and that leaves 15 unread.) This book starts very oddly and people who quit reading if they are not caught up by a book by page 25 will probably quit reading this. They shouldn't. It would have helped me if I had read the back of the title page, which tells whence Susan Sontag drew her inspiration, and how this book relates to the factual setting of the period. I found this book once the central character and her group decided to come to America very interesting reading, and consistently holding my attention. Extra tidbits which interested me were the stray references to events and people referred to in the story: e.g.: Mayne Reid? Do you know who he was? I looked him up in a reference work. Ditto as to the novel and play East Lynne. This is a historical novel where the factual historical references are accurate so far as I can tell, not like some historical novels. I remember how bothered I was by Sir Walter Scott's Kenilworth, which had no chronolgical consistency to it that I could see. (The story is laid in the period 1574 and 1575, but Amy Robsart actually died in 1560; Shakespeare appears in the book, but was not even born before Amy Robsart died.) Give this book a chance, I say."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Susan Sontag won the National Book award for \`In America'yesterday. Having just finished this book I wonder why? It is a goodbook, but not a great one.Another reviewer here attacked \`InAmerica' because it did not have much plot. That reviewer might becomplaining that long passages of the book are letters and excerptsfrom a diary laid out in chronological order. It is true this is nota fast-moving page-turner, but plot is not why one usually readsSontag. Rather the insight that is typical of Sontag's book-lengthessays is what you would expect to find in her novel.If there isanything insightful here it must in the in the interplay between thethree major characters in the novel. They are the famous Polishactress Maryna, her husband Bogdan, and her bachelor friend Rysard.The opening scene of the novel is so far fetched as to be not evenbelievable. We are at a cocktail party in Poland. An unnamednarrator, who does not speak of world of Polish, relates what ishappening. Yet she claims to understand the events that transpirearound her. That is ridiculous and annoying.From this oddbeginning the novel picks up speed and becomes more interesting.Maryna surmises that she cannot remain at the pinnacle of Polishtheater forever. She wonders, \`The public is fickle. My public wantsto love a newer, younger face.' This is her reason she wants to quitPoland and move to America. She gathers together her retinue afriend who is a painter, a doctor, and other hangers-on andretreats to the mountains. There most of her circle decides to moveto the New World and establish a commune.The commune is establishedin Anaheim, California. At that time (19th century) the countrysidewas mostly empty having been recently settled by German immigrants.The farm that Maryna and her friends establish is called a \`commune'by some other book reviewers. But to me it seems that Maryna was ableto convince her friends to move with her largely by the weight of herpersonality. I did not find that she said \`let's establish acommunistic commune'. Yet that is exactly what her neighbors did inSouthern California. There were several patterned on the Brook Farmand the writings of Fourier. These were true communistic ventureswhose plight and origins are described by Edmund Wilson in \`To theFinland Station'.Maryna is pursued across Poland and then inAmerica by her writer friend Rysard. He writes articles on the Polishactress and on his own journey to America for Polish newspapers.Rysard seeks the love of Maryna. (It appears they were loversbefore.) Maryna's husband for reasons that I never learned evenencourages them to travel to San Francisco together. Would you sendyou wife off with someone who was seeking her affection?Maryna leftthe commune she had established and moved to San Francisco to seek toreenter the theatre. Her main motive appears that the commune wasrunning out of cash, but she also wants to prove that she can succeedin the English-speaking American theater. The commune falls apartwhen the \`expatriate intellectuals' as they callthemselves prove inept at making a living growing grapes. Therewere also domestic difficulties such as perennial fights between oneof the married couples there. Each commune dweller drifted away forhis or her own reason.Maryna says \`Every marriage, every communityis a failed utopia. Utopia is not a kind of place but a kind of time, those all too brief moments when one would not wish to be anywhere else.'Anyway, as other reviewers have already pointed out, Maryna returns to the theatre and triumphs. This return did not seem so triumphant as it was written by Sontag at the onset. It appeared more happenstance. But later descriptions of Maryna on-stage and the resultant accolades make the reader more convinced that Maryna deserves to be called a great actress.The character Rysard might be Susan Sontag's alter ego. Rysard, the writer, says that he cannot stand people, but the love of people is required in order to be a writer. Rysard makes several other comments on the craft of writing that perhaps come from the opinions of Susan Sontag."},{"Title":"In America","review":"What a disappointing bore! Our reading group expected an interesting and vibrant story about the utopian communities that formed in California in the 1870s. What we got was a long-winded diatribe without enlightnment of the supposed subject matter. Where was the plot? Where was the character development? In terms of both style and content, our book club all agreed that this was the most poorly written book we've read. Some of the books we've thought had interesting, thought-provoking stories include: Tales of Genji, White Oleander, Yellow Raft on Blue Water, and The Poisonwood Bible. We didn't feel that there was any beauty to the writing in Sontag's book. We agreed that we would have been interested in discovering more about the characters and their lives.

Astoundingly irritating!"},{"Title":"In America","review":"\\"In America\\" is a strange, beautiful and difficult book among Susan Sontag's oeuvre. Better known by her non-fiction, this one is a quasi-departure from her milieu. Likewise her previous fictional effort, \\"The Volcano Lover\\", this is a historical novel, loosely based on true events. But, Sontag is an artist, therefore, her work is more than simply retelling a real story.As she tells in a brief introduction, this work is inspired by the life of Poland's most celebrated actress and her immigration to America. \\"Inspired by... no less and no more.\\" With these words, we learn that Sontag has appropriated of the characters and made them her own. This is certainly one of the most intriguing aspects of \\"In America\\" - how an artist recreates life the way it pleases her fiction. This theme is very suitable since it is a novel about an artist (the protagonist) who has to reinvent herself in order to survive when her dreams of a utopian society go astray.The character is Maryna Zalezowska, Poland's most celebrated actress of her time, who has conquered hearts and minds with her art. Tired of this life, she immigrates to America, taking with her, her husband, son, lover and some friends. America appears to her as a dream, as something that could never go wrong, a place where money meets dream and they are happily married.After Maryna's idealist community doesn't work out, she has to recreate herself, and return to the stage. Once a celebrated actor, now like a newcomer she has to prove her talent. The approach of art - especially theater - is different in the States from Europe. But she is a smart woman capable of giving audiences what they want - even if that means corrupting herself somehow sometimes.It feels like Sontag is telling us this is the art of being an American. The art of reinventing one's self whenever and however it is needed. Maryna is the intersection of both worlds - the Old and the New one. Love has a role in her life, as well, but smaller than art. Maryna lives and dies for the theater - in other words, for her art.While Sontag is very known by her essays on culture, politics and so on, her novels are distinctive for dealing these subjects inserted in a fictional account. Despite being written a decade ago, \\"In America\\" is tremendously up to date. This is a story about what makes one country, and what immigrants find in their new country. America is receptive to Maryna once she is able to give what her audience wants. What do they want? That is a very tricky question. Love, for once. But they are also delighted with death. But above all, they want to be more than Europeans. Noble titles, as a character says, are very impressive to Americans - and who cares if they are real.As a post-modern novel, the opening and closing chapters, are quite interesting. Both of them are a first person account of Sontag herself entering in Maryna's world and departing from it. However difficult they are for a reader - they are a single paragraph twenty-page long - these sequences in \\"In America\\" are beautiful and meaningful. The strange feeling they give us is certainly related to Maryna's own strangeness of a foreigner in a country in the making."},{"Title":"In America","review":"I expected to like this novel; Sontag has a wonderful reputation and the storyline had potential.

Mehlinger's book School Reform in the Information Age to be refreshing. He addresses school reform, for sure, but not from a \\"top down\\" or \\"tougher standards\\" or \\"what's good for America\\" approach. For Mehlinger, the only legitimate reforms are those that address how teachers teach and how children learn. The tool to enable these reforms to sprout, he says, is technology. He believes technology has the potential to reshape the very nature of schooling itself.Mehlinger presents a concise history of the American educational system including the most popular current reform philosophies, both classic and progressive. He teases out what should be the role of schools and the role of teachers in the Information Age. He especially explores the impact that technology can have for implementing change in each of these arenas. He explains why such changes are not easy, because the stakeholders are not fully agreed on the degree and direction of changes required.The book stresses the importance of having a \\"vision\\" for what we want schools to be right now and in the future. This vision, according to Mehlinger, must include the widespread use of technology. He makes the case that Information Age technology is the single greatest factor affecting the ways we live and that, as such, it must also alter the way we conduct schooling. For him, technology is the key to a new school vision and a revised mission.Students are not dumber nor are teachers lazier now than 25-years ago when American education led the world. Schools are still doing a pretty good job of what they have successfully done for the past 100-years. It is just that these practices have not adapted to the many social changes in American culture. What worked 25-years ago is no longer viable pedagogy today.Technology will be used in schools because it appeals to students. It does, however, challenge the present relationship between ! students and teachers. Technology enables learners to gain control of their own learning. Mehlinger says this is a good thing.The book points out that the principal advantage for adopting technology in schools is not so schools can just do faster and better what they have always done. To quote Mehlinger, \\". . . its primary value is that it can provide the spark for re-energizing teachers, for prompting educators to envision new ways to teach, and for creating the kinds of schools needed now.\\" He predicts that technology will become more powerful, faster, cheaper, and easier to use.Howard D.

It had no silly romance,ridiculous gun fight (\\"I don't like straw hats.\\" Pow-Pow), ridiculous reason to hold the fort or fight for property. If you read western novels, you know what I am talking about. This book had more depth, way more depth. I loved each character. The book is written in such away that you don't have a main character, all the characters are main characters, but not overly done were it could be confusing. The book had fantastic flow and for me is marked high in writing. The book had a western meets Frank Miller (graphic writer/Artist) feel.This book was a gift and I would not have bought it in this style. The printing of this particular book I found it rather annoying, I felt as if I was reading a manuscript, or catalog. The size of the book is just large, and clumsy. The book is also printed in an old type set font, and was rather hard on my eyes. You can find this book in paperback, hardback and e-book.

Oscar Wilde inhis introductory poetry says: Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are cultivated.\\"One can't say that this novel is beautiful,but there is an element of eternal truth that even in ugliness has great virtue."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"this is one of the most accessible period novels i've ever read. the style of the storytelling is very conversational... indeed sometimes it seems like the main point is to showcase the conversations, especially the ones with Lord Henry in them, who is very quotable. i read that oscar wilde used to think of his witticisms ahead of time and then try to steer the conversations to a place where he could say them in public, and i guess there's no conversation more artfully directed where you want it than one you write yourself.the basic story is one that most people know before they pick up the book, but the descriptive style and the snappy dialogue are interesting enough that it doesn't matter. the only real flaw is that it seems like a lot of the book is missing towards the end... the story wraps up a little too quickly and the descriptions of dorian's descent into depravity is really beautiful but also incredibly vague and so that kind of helps to flatten the pacing near the end.overall i'd highly recommend this book, especially for lazy-reading. it has that kind of dreamlike quality to it."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Dorian Gray is very good novel, but it suffers from soapbox syndrome. The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This book surprised me with its Gothic horror and surprising plot twists toward the end. This novel, for all its horrible philosophy on life, captures in a poignant way a lost person's search for fulfillment. Despite his indulgent quest for all kinds of pleasure, Dorian is still unfulfilled and in one of the most captivating passages of the book turns to opium to forget life. His descent into the opium den is characterized as a descent into hell, a personal hell which he has brought himself to and in which everyone sees through him and is against him.Though I wasn't a big fan at the beginning, as the book progressed I think it may have become one of the most memorable books I've read. The theme of the book is sin - its putrefying effect both on the sinner and those around him. One of the best moments of the book and one that sticks vividly in my mind is towards the end, when Dorian, sick of seeing his portrait so mangled and distorted by the sins he has already committed, does a \\"good deed\\" in order to try to start to clean it up. He races up the stairs, unlocks the secret room where his portrait is hidden, throws back the cover, and is faced with the same ugliness that had been there before. Then he is faced with a horrible realization of truth: because he had done the \\"good deed\\" out of motivation of making his own portrait/soul look better, he hadn't done a \\"good deed\\" at all and was now so deep in his depravity that even what he calls love has been warped into an all-encompassing egotism.Dorian's egotism gets progressively deeper. throughout the book. As Lord Henry says, It begins as innocent narcissism, but as it grows it begins to shunt blame for the sin of others and even motivates the good he does at the end of the book. Rather than his heavy sins bothering Dorian, \\"it was the living death of his own soul that troubled him\\" (226). His breakup with the young country girl was motivated more out of a desire to cleanse his portrait from its grime than any love for her, \\"for in hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self\\" (228). Being able to view his sin on the portrait in a sense made it more difficult to be selfless - \\"nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all\\" (106) - and Dorian recognized this difficulty.The idea of pleasure in Dorian Gray is portrayed as a goal to pursue but never reach. \\"A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied\\" (84). Despite Dorian's pursuit of pleasure (and pleasure of the most exquisite kind) he ends us dissatisfied and empty, jaded to the idea of the fullness of life. He is encouraged on by the influence of Lord Henry, who gives advice such as: \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it,\\" (21) and \\"sin is the only real color-element left in modern life\\" (31). Dorian is quickly influenced by Lord Henry's philosophy, aping to everyone else Lord Henry's views and words and acting out on them by plunging into the pits of hedonism.The portrait itself is a mirror of Dorian's soul. It was a \\"visible emblem of conscience\\" (96). As Lord Henry's pleasure seeking philosophy takes hold in Dorian's mind, he sees that \\"eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins - he was to have all of these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame; that was all\\" (109). However, in with a horrible fascination, Dorian \\"grew more and more enamored of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul\\" (131) for \\"what the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat away its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive\\" (122). Even though \\"the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away\\" (161) the portrait held on to its life of decay, just as Dorian held on to pleasure, refusing to be cleansed and beautiful again until Dorian's death.Quotes:\\"She was free in her prison of passion\\" (65).\\"She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy\\" (49).\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\\" (4).\\"Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One's own life - that is the important thing\\" (82).\\"And how horribly real ugliness made things!\\" (128)"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This book is the most decadent of all the English works in the canon of literature, I think.

As curiosity got the best of me, I finally looked this person up on the Internet. Finding that Dorian Gray was the main character of a most elaborate and interesting tale, enthralled me. Therefore, I set out to read this novel. From the preface alone, I was spellbound and couldn't put the book down.Lord Henry, with his quips and one-liners literally made me think twice. His tranquil ability to convince anyone of anything, sans Basil Hallward, amazed me. Although, I did find a few opinions of Lord Henry to ring true, for the most part I found myself thinking: \\"He's absolutely correct. Oh, wait! That's completely immoral and self-indulgent!\\" Needless to say, Lord Henry was my favorite character in the book.This book truly puts one's own life into perspective. It makes one think, and re-think of the importance of being true to only oneself without influence of others. As Lord Henry said it best: \\"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to oneself\\"."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I thought this book was amazing. While the writing for some might be difficult at first, the later chapter are the ones that capture the imagination. The morals of Lord Henry might seem somewhat selfish and shallow, but I guarantee his quotes will make their way back to reader's head. This is definitely the most influencial book I have read."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the greatest books of our time. It is over one hundred years old, but has aged gracefully and is still easily understood and as relevant to matters of life now as it was when it was first published. Though there have been many imitations of it and many film depictions of it, none of them do justice to the real thing. This timeless classic follows the development of a teenager, Dorian Gray, into manhood as the people that he calls his friends corrupt his soul. This is symbolized in a portrait that Gray hides, which was painted by the man who was perhaps his only good-hearted friend, Basil, who later met his untimely demise. Along with the exceptional plot and surprising twist at the end comes the message that Oscar Wilde cunningly imparts to the reader: One must be master of oneself because outside influences often disfigure one down to the deepest part of their soul. On top of all this, the book is also simply well written and entertaining. It is enjoyable because Wilde uses his mastery of everything from satire to suspense to convey his message and an extraordinarily compelling plot to the reader. You should read this book if you are looking for new knowledge, literature with a deep message, or simply a good time. This edition is especially helpful because it has a glossary for the meanings of some older words and supplementary reading written by Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Wilde's only novel contains some of the greatest dialogue of any literature written in the english language. There are few books that could be considered more quotable, and even fewer that could be considered more insightful. The novel is enjoyable even upon a cursory reading, but its splendor is revealed only when it is studied. Wilde reveals so much of himself in his art, and through reading of Wilde's biographies, plays, and the literature that inspired him, the reader becomes intimate with Oscar, and is able to understand him more throughly than most authors would allow from a study of their work. This is a piece I have truly enjoyed, and continues to be one of the premier pieces of English literature."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray. (...)"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' is an exceptional novel. Through this novel Mr. Wilde presents many characteristics of the human heart and mind. It hits hard telling the truth of the way in which people really are. Mr. Wilde in his novel asks the question how far would one go to obtain beauty and youth forever to please society? And in doing so presents the desires of most humans to remain young forever and the lengths in which they might go to obtain it. This novel illustrates the obession society has with the outward appearance rather than the inward and is shown in the novel by the Dorian Gray being accepted into the 'circle' despite the 'rumors' that he is a bad man. Through Dorian Gray and Lord Henry Mr. Wilde also illustrates the influence of people over people. Resulting in the destruction of character.I enjoyed the book Dorian Gray because of the fact that it does tell the truth and quite often people don't like to hear the truth, but Oscar Wilde went against what society would view as good and did and wrote what he believed, which makes an wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I decided to be the FIRST to review this one here. Haha, go me.Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Wilde gives a new definition to the good. Dorian Gray's problem, despite the fact all his sin is transmited to a painting, art reminds him of the good, and this reminding is enough to be in discord with himself. I don't feel, as some suggest, that Dorian regreted his wish of eternal youth and beauty, but the images of the painting, art itself, drove him crazy - his self doubt. The art showed his inauthentic life, how his feelings and actions were not in harmony. In De Profundis Wilde talks about Jesus' criticism of the Pharasee for studying, but not living what they know - they have no feeling for life, they are souless driviling intellects. Dorian\`s cognizance of his own inauthentic soulless profanatory abject self did him in, he died killing the reminder of his splintered self, and of the frustrations of being an aesthetically induced schizopherenic. Wotton's warning was that conscience makes egoists of us all. Is it the dualistic nature of conscience that drives Dorian to kill himself, not regret? In the end he desires to do good, but is it? Can he? Is he? Wilde, the master of Paradox, leaves some poignant questions, if not eschatological questions, availab.le to be thought upon. Wilde is highlighting the importance of art as truth and art as a mirror, but in the end who is the mirror? Art makes reality, as far as reality is a truth anyway, a perception of truth and reality that is more meaningful than these nonexistant abstracts. But then there is sin to ponder on, is it real? Wilde would say so."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"After reading Dorian Gray, it took numerous books to accept that not all authors can have the genius and prose gifted to Wilde. Dorian's journey of making his life an art, exploring issues such as hedonism, sin, conceit, deceit and youth is an unforgettable one, and this book has lingered on in my mind since I first read it, and I think will continue to do so forever.

The title character, the beautiful and naive Dorian Gray, sells his soul so that he can remain beautiful forever. Instead of his body ageing, a portrait of him suffers instead. What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery.

I didn't notice when I ordered it that it's not the size of a regular book--it's more the size of an academic journal or magazine. Nearly 8 X 10 inches. Further, there's no named editor, no introduction, no apparatus at all. Just the text of the story--and that is printed in two columns on the page. The result is a book that won't fit on the shelf and that is unpleasant to read. Baffling."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a hard novel to get into. But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better. The way that Wilde closes the life of Dorian Gray is perfectly written, and paints a perfect \\"portrait\\" in our minds as well."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"great book hard to read because print was so small"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I have recently begun reading all those books I \\"should\\" have read a long time ago. I started with Dorian Gray because I knew the basic premise and liked the concept. I was sooo disappointed.

Quotable Quotes galore."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Once his portrait completed, Dorian Gray wished to stay young and handsome forever,on the other hand his picture would deteriorate with time .

It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Every so often one has the good fortune of discovering an author whose work reaffirms all that is appreciable in literature by exemplifying its worst. Oscar Wilde, after reading whose novel and two fairy tales, quickly obviates any further need or desire to be further acquainted. The knowledge found on the cover of my paperback edition, between the obligatory sickly hagiography that usually betrays the expectation it inspires, that The Picture of Dorian Gray was apparently the author's only fruitful attempt at a \`full-length' novel, leaves one snickering ante facto in not entirely facetious gratitude. Wilde was seemingly more at home in the realm of fairy tales, and this 217-page full-length novel not by itself finding ground to fill the space between the covers, finds itself supported by three samples of that genre.One might be forgiven for assuming that the novel portends to explore an emotional or philosophical metaphor of a relationship between the eponymous painting and its subject, but the implied exploration is unfortunately mostly specious. The metaphor, to be sure, is there, but it is a mere seed that never takes root or grows out of its entirely obvious and superficial form, and the story thus fails to fulfil its promise.Furthermore, the filling leaves one with a bad aftertaste. None of the three characters have any endearing features to redeem themselves for the gall they otherwise freely spew. \`Lord Henry' in particular has no characterizing dimension other than denigration of everything else in the form of dull pseudowitticisms, from which comparison we take it the aristocrat was intended to benefit. We learn his contempt of clergy (bishops \\"don't think\\"), stockbrokers (\\"even a stock-broker can gain a reputation for being civilized\\"), dowagers (they are \\"overdressed\\"), academicians (tedious), the middle class (not modern), Americans, marriage, women, and Jews (I don't believe any mention of the religion ever lacks the adjective \\"fat\\"). The misogyny in particular is so pungent and the female characters so weak that the protagonists cannot otherwise but treat them with the contempt that they do. If indeed \\"women are decorative\\" it is merely because the men do not have a vision that sees beyond superficialities. This is no parody of aristocratic vanity (in the style of Thackeray, for instance) so one quickly finds oneself wishing for one of these maligned targets of Lord Henry's dull wit to return the favor with a dull but well-deserved kick in the [rump].When the characters are not railing against the world, they are theorizing about it, but the obvious inconsistencies and utter inanity of the theories make them impossible to consider seriously. To give an example, and not have one character take the brunt of all the book's failings, the artist Basil Hallward states first (speaking of his own work) that \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter,\\" but six pages later that \\"an artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.\\" A story dealing ostentatiously with a profound relationship between ars and artis, in which the artist doesn't remember from one moment to the next whether or not he put feeling in his art, reveals that its author has lost control of his subject. Othertimes the theories are merely silly and quite impossible to take at face value. What to make, for example, of the idea that \\"beauty is a form of genius- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation,\\" or that \\"people say sometimes that beauty is superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.\\" This is just tripe without considerable meaning.Within this theorizing there are faint reverberations reaching toward some oblique philosophy of hedonism, but never quite advancing beyond a mere slogan. Without actually doing the work of fully expounding the philosophy, or having the courage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot. One of the adjunct characters, Jim, whose sister Sibyl later commits suicide over the protagonist, finds out he is a bastard son, his mother was orphaned, and forgives her (what for, we are left to guess), all within the space of three quarter page. Dorian's swings of attitude toward Sybil from ignorance through love through despisement through sorrow to self-forgiveness are so extreme and irrational that they make a pastiche of emotion. Jim's completely unfounded anger toward Dorian is so unrealistically sudden and out of proportion that it is obvious how Jim's fears will be realized and that there will be a confrontation. There is no mystery, less a sense of a world to discover than of being dragged along by an uninterested parent. The rhetorical questions Dorian asks in his histrionic despair are answered immediately, it is for me simply to get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on.Even more fundamentally, the characters are shallow, undeveloped, and quite stereotypical, the dialog stilted and unrealistic- altogether a surprisingly unsophisticated style, especially in the light of the beautiful writing of his contemporaries. Dialog has a tendency to spin off into unrelated tangents that are unceremoniously and artificially \`snapped back' to the main thread. Henry's inability to speak in any other form than witless aphorism is at first merely unfunny, then quickly boring, later irritating, and finally not bearing further reading. And this is unfortunately barely the only character development in the story at all, the only other characters having little strength of will of their own to resist mimicking this trite ascerbicism.If the book has revealed anything at all, it is not a deeper analysis of art or hedonism, but a much more animal homoeroticism. Dorian Gray is much more than anything else a love story with the trimmings (envy and a murder-suicide), and all the less respectful because it dares not speak its name. Female emotions are contemptible, but the same expressions of liking (Wilde can never bring himself to call it more), admiration of beauty, and extreme flattery by men towards other men, are accepted naturally and not subject to this contempt."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"It is just not my kind of book... iT IS ON MY BOOK SHSELLP WITH OTHER BOOKS THAT i HAVE BOUGHT AND FEEL LIKE i MADE A MISTAKES- IN JUDGEMENT."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The book starts out OK, with the known Oscar Wilde wit and his excellent descriptive skills.

Colleges study this book in literature classes. That's not to say no child would not get stuff from this book, but the few children that could would probably be just fine with the original work.

I never did, but thought I would give it a try as I really enjoy dry British wit and intelligent prose. Beyond that, I wasn't sure what else I was expecting, but for my tastes, I didn't end up entirely satisfied.The opening 10 or 20 pages insinuated themselves into my imagination and I felt that I would be entertained by the main characters throughout the rest of the novel. The detailed descriptions of the lovely country setting and extravagant flowers gives one an impression of decadence and a high society jadedness that I somehow expected from Oscar Wilde, having read none of his previous work. Unfortunately, the remainder of the novel didn't hold as much pleasure for me.Dorian Grey is a relatively uninteresting central character who is but a blank canvas for Lord Henry to experiment upon; Dorian's own thoughts and musings are not so compelling in and of themselves and yet we are treated to quite a few pages of them throughout. Lord Henry himself is an interesting character whose mean-spiritedness, which approaches evil in some instances, is obscured by his verbose bantering on half-baked, jaundiced observations on Victorian life. These also consume considerable paper stock, and as witty as his musings start out (his thoughts on marriage were particularly humorous to me), they start to run together and become somewhat of a misshapen lump through which I felt I was slogging at times.Anyway, the story is relatively well known to most at this point, regardless of whether you have read the book in question or not. It progresses more or less as one might assume, which is not entirely a bad thing (I would not classify this tale as a mystery or as a horror novel, a genre to which I see it is sometimes curiously attributed). Oscar Wilde is definitely saying something here, and there seem to be many elements of allegory contained within the story. I have read that he saw parts of himself within all three of the main characters, and they do seem to represent different facets of a single personality. Unfortunately these same characters are hamstrung by this very fact, as they each seem only part of a personality, part of a character, and not well rounded or believable in their motivations or actions.This is the first Oscar Wilde I have attempted to read, and I won't say it is my last, but there are classics of English literature which are as well written, more engrossing, and, in the end, more memorable, at least to this reader (\\"Silas Marner\\" comes to mind as a fine book I only just recently read for the first time as well).So, overall, about 3 stars from me. In my opinion it poses some interesting questions, sparkles in a few spots, and held my attention for a few hours, but it's not something I would return to or recommend for pleasurable reading.As a side note, I am somewhat surprised by the criticisms of the homoerotic nature of the relationships portrayed within the novel. Wilde portrayed the passionate nature of what amounts to a love triangle in a very effective (if slightly florid) way, and, as has been noted before, the relationships between the men seem more genuine and believable than those involving the fairer sex. Maybe this type of undertone would be out of place in a Hemingway novel but good grief it's Oscar Wilde! Scratch beneath the surface and read about where this man was coming from and the times in which he lived and worked."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I read this book(translated to the portuguese), here in Brazil about twenty years ago.Being writen in XIX century, this novel remains a classic book."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Wilde's literary genious is evident throughout.

Although the moral of the story has been copied over by many other authors (with slight variations), the dilemma remains the same - is one willing to sacrifice his internal peace for the price of the eternal beauty?

As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of \`relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"A book for all time.

His only novel, Oscar Wilde's satire of the upper class in late 19th century Britain mocks their vapid lifestyle, while at times glorying in it, though the story arc comes from the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe. The combination is both delicious and shocking. \\"Picture\\" is also a veritable gold mine, or should I say minefield, of ironic aphorisms, most of them emanating from the mind and mouth of Gray's friend and mentor Sir Henry Wooten, who is kind of like Michael Scott of \\"The Office\\", except with a functioning brain.Brilliantly written, entertaining and thought provoking, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" stands highly recommended to readers young and old. It's sad that Wilde lived at a time when homosexuals were persecuted, in his case prosecuted, even moreso than they are now. A giant of 19th century literature could have contributed well into the 20th century, but died penniless, estranged from his birthplace in Ireland, and home in England, at the age of 46 in the year 1900."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a quick, easy and enjoyable read. I knew the very basic premise of the story from watching the 2003 movie, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I also had a lot of wrong preconceived notions because of the the movie.The Picture of Dorian Gray was less supernatural in nature than I expected. Other than not aging and having the picture age for him, Dorian was a regular guy. When given the opportunity to live his life without his behavior marring his beauty, he chose debauchery. I found myself thinking, who wouldn't? He tried to experience everything the world has to offer (a noble pursuit) and finds that life can become pointless without boundaries.Dorian's friend, Harry, is the absolute shining star of this novel. He counsels Dorian in the way of the world, full of his own theories and cynical viewpoints. He's humorous and more often than not, what he says makes a lot of sense.The one thing I disliked about The Picture of Dorian Gray was that it seemed like the most interesting pieces of the story were missing. Oscar Wilde was very vague about exactly why Dorian actually did in the years he spent corrupting his soul. People who were once his friends couldn't stand to be in the same room as him and no explanation was given. Perhaps in 1890, when the book was published, saying that he did vile, cruel, disgusting things was enough. Now, 120 years later, I need more.

I AM ALSO A HUGE BEN BARNES FAN"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Most people never truly contemplate the real meaning of beauty. It has an alluring quality that cannot be fully understood, even in an abstract form. One of English author Oscar Wilde's motivations was to write a work that praises beauty as an art but simultaneously reveals its darker nature. That is what I believe he attempts to accomplish in his sole novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The work is set in late 19th century London at a time when the cultural excesses of the Victorian era reached their zenith. Infused with elements of Gothic horror, it is a work of Symbolist prose, the Symbolists being a group of literary luminaries who sought to glorify beauty and aesthetic decadence almost as a kind of spiritualism. Wilde is no doubt part of this new endeavor to perceive beauty in an innovative fashion, and he objectively promotes a rather original world outlook through the dynamic characters he creates.The Picture of Dorian Gray is built upon an interesting premise. A local artist named Basil Hallward is fully enamored by the subject of his latest portrait, the eponymous Dorian Gray. Basil, like almost everyone else, is impressed by Dorian's pulchritude and handsome features. As Dorian indulges Basil by sitting for a portrait, another one of Basil's friends, a dignified aristocrat named Lord Henry Wotton, enters and, he too, takes a tremendous liking for the vigorous youth. Later, Dorian holds a discussion with Henry about senility and Wotton reveals to him his hedonistic worldview: \\"To me, beauty is the wonder of wonder. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world lies in the visible, not the invisible. [...] A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do.\\" With this in mind, Dorian upholds a new creed by swearing that youth is the only noble quality worth possessing; he would rather have Basil's new portrait of him age in exchange for remaining eternally young. Consequently, Dorian proceeds to engage in every sort of pleasurable vice possible, while the picture of himself hanging in his room slowly decays. The plot proceeding from this point forward holds up well, though the climatic conclusion may seem clich&eacute; in light of the Gothic horror stories that many readers are acquainted with.Wilde does a splendid job of displaying a tone of biting sarcasm. His clever use of wit and double entendre to reveal introspective truths with all the effort he can muster is one of his valiant triumphs. Dorian's lust for sensual pleasure reveals the author's taste as an aesthete and suggests another aspect of the novel's motifs, that of duplicity. Dorian leads a double life by interacting with aristocratic high society during the day and indulging his senses at night. This dualism of Dorian's character underscores the dramatic complexity of his inner struggles.Dorian Gray can be seen as a man willing to exchange his very soul for what he craves. He candidly discards his reputation and eventually risks his life for his lofty desires, which is reminiscent of the Faust legend. Wilde's protagonist is not very remorseful for his debauchery and is constantly being manipulated by his friend and confidant, Henry Wotton. Ultimately, Dorian is a tragic hero participating in an Aristotelian tragedy where he is subtly cognizant of his impending doom and experiences multiple catastrophes. His hamartia proves to be his downfall.While every work of fiction has its shortcomings, Dorian Gray's are minimal. The author exhibits a delightful candor in his narration and characterization, and his nuanced writing style is replete with metaphorical and psychological analyses of flawed individuals. No bookstore should ever be complete without a copy of The Picture of Dorian Gray adorning its bookshelves."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"THis book is not only about \\"The Picture Of Dorian Gray\\" but it is a few short stories by Oscar Wilde.

I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about.

It is a true classic."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"In roughly three weeks Dorian Gray starring Ben Barnes comes to DVD in the UK (and I intend to buy it. I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil.

I already knew the story, but what struck me most was the perfection of the writing. Wilde uses such beautiful, concise and clear language to convey his own version of the Faustian legend.The subject matter is troubling to some but one cannot deny the quality of the art."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The book at times appears to be a sequence of Wilde's best one-liners, intersperced with narrative. Once, when I thought that that was all that the book was, I still liked it: after all, the story was a good one, the one-liners were mostly good, and if the two didn't fit well together, well, that was a pity, but it didn't prevent the book from being fun to read.I realise now that the book packs a greater moral punch than I'd thought. Wilde makes evil seem genuinely attractive; and this is not to be done merely by telling us that so-and-so finds evil attractive, and then giving a spurious causal explanation. When Dorian performs his first act of genuine cruelty, not only Henry, but the author as well, tell us to forget about it, that it doesn't really matter. They even give us some genuinely good arguments. (Whereas Basil, the force of good, seems to be able to do little but utter stolid platitudes.) So we forget about it as much as Dorian does, and are hit over the head all the more smartly by the end of the book. It's true, Wilde still gets a bit carried away with himself in places; and the effect of seeing so many of his epigrams together in the one place is to make us wonder if we could write a computer program capable of creating a couple of hundred more; but I was wrong in my initial reaction. The flippancy and the deep seriousness are both necessary. They contrast, but they do not clash."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised. I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \\"deal with the devil\\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-)"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made.

However, the reader soon realizes that even the purest beauty can not save us from the horrors and intrigue of sin. After seeing his portrait, Dorian curses the fact that soon his beauty will fade and declares \\"if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture to grow old! For that - I would give everything\\". Dorian soon finds that his ill-fated wish has come true, and his portrait now carries the burden of age. As the years pass, Dorian becomes obsessed with sins and evils, for they do not afflict his personal appearance, but rather aid in the deterioration of his portrait, his soul. But, although Dorian continues to sin and think nothing of the consequences of his actions, he is consumed with an overwhelming fear that his portrait and sins will be revealed to the world. Through the actions and sins of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde shows human's weakness to the evils of the world. Wilde urges all readers to renounce sinning for it leads to the deterioration of one's moral principles, but more importantly, creates an everlasting fear that can destroy one's soul and eventually destroy one's desire to live. This story should be read by teenagers everywhere for it shows that the true nature of our character is judged by the beauty of one's soul, rather than the beauty of one's face."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Though it's rather slow to get going in the initial chapters, Oscar Wilde's &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; builds up into a splendidly effective piece, written in highly polished prose. Dorian Gray, who is suggestively described as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; ... is painted by his friend and admirer, Basil Hallward. Dorian, a self-centered social luminary whose character is reminiscent of Narcissus, makes a bizarre sub-Faustian wish which tragically comes true: that his beautiful portrait may age, while he retains his youthful looks. The conclusion is disastrous, the culmination of a narrative containing elements of murder, suicide, blackmail, a confrontation in a grimy alley and an episode in an opium den. The characters are very well sketched out, particularly the triad of Dorian, Basil and the intellectual cynic, Lord Henry, Dorian's mentor and the mouthpiece of some of Wilde's most cutting amoral opinions. The style is, typically, marvellous, characterised by brilliant exchanges and aphoristic gaiety. Wilde lacerates English bourgeois culture, the conceptions of sin and virtue and the attitudes towards art of his time with tremendous aplomb. Some of his quips are patently snide, sometimes mysogynistic, as in: &quot;Woman represents the triumph of matter over mind, while man represents the triumph of mind over morals.&quot; Oh, isn't that just despicable?! I love it!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \\"phew\\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"What a wonderfull book. I Love the classic's. There are plenty of great books written today, but the classic's are from other periods in time that show life in a different light."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I picked up a an audio cd of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' at the same time I was reading 'A Stranger's Child' by Alan Hollinghurst. Interestingly the respective narratives move through Edwardian England while peeling back the layers of sexual repression and eroticism associated with the era. The author Diana Galbaldon accomplishes this successfully, too, with attendant similar homo-erotic themes in her Lord John (Grey)series.While both listening and reading similar books simultaneously I was trying to keep the characters aligned with each story. In fact, several characters from each book have the same name. 'Dorian Gray' begins with a prologue by the author that addresses in advance the freedom to publish content that Wilde surely felt would be controversial. This proved to be prescient.The main character for whom the book is named in effect sacrifices his soul for the vanity of youth and life's experiences and excess. Up to a point, one could make a contemporary parallel to a life lived by a celebrity (i.e. Mick Jagger, Lindsay Lohan, etc.) at least from a public perception perspective. The song 'You're so Vain' by Carly Simon could easily have been written as homage to the Dorian Gray character.There exists in the story line a protagonist (the painter of the picture) and antagonist - a friend of the painter's who, arguably is a devil incarnate, guides by suggestion Dorian Gray down a path of self-gratification, vanity and excess.For those of us that recall the Twilight Zone TV series from the 1960's, this book - a classic for it's time - would have made a marvelous episode."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has appeared in nearly a dozen forms, some reflecting publishers' objections, some adding new material by Wilde to compensate for cuts, and some simply bowdlerized in pirate editions. For the first time, Wilde's original manuscript submitted for publication has been printed as he wrote and intended it, before other people's prejudices and pressure caused him to alter the text. This is a beautifully produced large format book, beautiful cover with Caravaggio's \\"Narcissus\\" cropped and darkened, detailed introduction, bibliography and analysis of the complete publishing history of this unusually tortured author and book. All variants are included in the notes and annotations. Of particular interest is the fact that it is this text, which has not previously been published, that Sir Edward Carson, Counsel for the brutal and sociopathic Marquis of Queensbury whom Wilde absurdly sued for libel over an open note in a men's club in which Queensbury, father of Wilde's infamous lover Bosie Douglas, wrote \\"Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic).\\" But for Wilde's utterly mad legal action against Queensbury, he would not have faced the tremendous wealth of testimony and written evidence placed before the civil court by Carson, and would not have been prosecuted for any crimes, as he was after losing his libel action. Many of the passages which appear only in this new edition of \\"The Picture\\" were used by Carson to paint Wilde into a corner of criminality; and it is interesting to see just which sentences and paragraphs were accumulated to impeach Wilde on cross-examination. All in all, this is a wonderful book, almost too grand for its subject matter. But then Oscar, I am sure, would have expected nothing less."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"When THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY was first published in 1890, England was still in the last throes of a Victorian morality that still prided itself on all sorts of morality, especially sexual prudery. Into this realm of things which were not dared to be spoken, along came Oscar Wilde to say them. Wilde's gay background formed a subtext both in the novel and in his personal life that both titillated and repelled much of England.THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a reworking of the popular literary motif of the consequences of making a deal with the devil. The average Englishmen well knew of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus who had signed such a pact with Mephistopheles involving the exchange of power and knowledge for Faustus' soul. Every human being has a soul worth bartering; Wilde dared to suggest to a homophobic England that even a gay man's soul was as well.Dorian Gray is a young, handsome man whose portrait is painted by Basil Hallward. Beginning with the very introduction of Gray, Wilde consistently combines two seemingly unrelated themes: the role of the artist in society and the role of the gay man in that same society. In the Preface to his book, Wilde maintains his aesthetic belief that the only purpose of art is to have no purpose: \\"All art is useless.\\" Wilde connects this inutility about the nonpurpose of art with the aging and the dissipation of the painting that grows progressively more unattractive the more that Gray sins. Lord Henry Wotton, who is surprisingly the most interesting character in the book with his witty epigrams and biting cynicisms, is the rou&eacute; who leads--or perhaps seduces--an initially innocent Dorian into a life on nonstop debauchery. Dorian, urged on by Wotton to drop Dorian's newest girlfriend, the actress Sybil Vane, crudely berates what he saw as a second rate theatrical performance, causing her to commit suicide in grief at his cutting remarks. After her death, Wotton leads Dorian into a two decade long life fall into sin. Eventually, Dorian considers it time to clean up his act and this is where many readers have become confused with Dorian's advice about art in the Preface and Wotton's advice about art in the book. When Wilde asserts in the Preface that art is useless, he rejects the current Victorian notion that art ought to be used for the betterment of humanity. He states that the contrary is true. Art must not be used for betterment. He further implies that his belief's corollary must be true too: that art cannot harm human life. In fact, as he finishes his Preface, he notes, \\"All art is useless.\\" Yet, in the novel, Wotton rejects Dorian's claim that his painting has led Dorian's beauty on a straight line road to disaster--for Dorian, for Sybil, and earlier for Basil, whom Dorian has murdered. What is apparent, at least to Wotton if not to Dorian, is that it was not art that was responsible for their deaths, but Dorian, who in his hubris wanted to assume the same mantle of godlike near immortality that damned Faustus centuries earlier. Thus, art had nothing to do with Dorian's descent into evil. It was nothing more prosaic than pride gone berserk.Wilde's not so subtle intent at painting his own portrait of a homoerotic connection between Wotton, Dorian, and debauchery has also been a source of much confusion. Wilde could not afford to state explicitly that Dorian was involved on a gay level with Wotton, Adam Campbell or anyone else, but it is pretty clear that homoeroticism was just one in a long line of events that Wilde knew would point out the ongoing degradation of Dorian. But if Wilde allowed Dorian to escape the consequences of his seduction by Wotton, then he might not have been able to find a publisher. It was hard enough the way it was to do that.Readers today regard THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY as a fascinating if not a dated period piece about trading one's soul for forbidden delights, but no other book warns of the consequences as eloquently as this one."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I picked up this book to read, partly because I am a big fan of Wilde's plays, and partly because the concept behind this novel has become such a part of our collective conscious that I wanted to know what was behind it.It was filled with all the wit and cynicism that I expect from Wilde, but, I found it to be a bit tiresome to read. I suspect that this is partially due to the fact that it is so solidly grounded in the late 1800's that the concerns of the characters are a bit distant.Still, I must say that I feel that it is a book worth reading. Anything that has seared itself into the western world's consciousness is worth investigating."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \\"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant. If you've never read it, pick it up and savor it. Don't rush through it for the plot. Ponder it as you read. If you have already read it, put it away and try it again in five or ten years. You may discover new meaning, and much that you missed. That's the beauty of a timeless novel. Its wisdom will wait patiently until you've had time to catch up."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, a story of morals, psychology and poetic justice, has furnished Oscar Wilde with the status of a classical writer. It takes place in 19th-century England, and tells of a man in the bloom of his youth who will remain forever young.Basil Hallward is a merely average painter until he meets Dorian Gray and becomes his friend. But Dorian, who is blessed with an angelic beauty, inspires Hallward to create his ultimate masterpiece. Awed by the perfection of this rendering, he utters the wish to be able to retain the good looks of his youth while the picture were the one to deteriorate with age. But when Dorian discovers the painting cruelly altered and realizes that his wish has been fulfilled, he ponders changing his hedonistic approach.Dorian Gray's sharp social criticism has provoked audible controversy and protest upon the book's 1890 publication, and only years later was it to rise to classical status. Written in the style of a Greek tragedy, it is popularly interpreted as an analogy to Wilde's own tragic life.

There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The greatest marriage of classic literature and modern philosophy, poetry masquerading as prose, and a psychological epic in art-house clothing ever created! The genius of Oscar Wilde knew no bounds, and this book remains disturbingly chilling and alarmingly familiar over a hundred years after its first controversial publication. Though the plot could never exist anywhere outside of fiction, it is at once starkly shocking and believeable, never once wavering from the quietly accusing mood set early on.Dorian Gray is a beautiful youth who becomes painter Basil Hallward's artistic obsession, and the masterpiece painting Basil creates of Dorian seems to mock the young man, who grows jealous of the fact that it will never grow old or ugly, as he knows he will. He silently curses the painting and wishes it would age instead of him, and eerily enough, the painting becomes in itself a picture of Dorian's vain, ugly, hedonistic, and murderous soul.Indelibly true and deliciously quirky, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a treasure trove of genius observations and statements so true and yet so stunning you'll be forced to look over it a second time, just to make sure you didn't miss any of Wilde's poignant words. Well worth your time and energy, this book is reason enough to fake sick from school or work so you'll have the extra time to read it."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde is a man who is obsessed by appearances. In this particular novel, he follows from the moment Dorian Gray sells his soul to the devil named beauty and youth, pleasure and enjoyment, to his death and he describes how someone who looks perfect, perfectly young, intelligent, brilliant, beautiful, moral and healthy is in fact nothing but a monster decaying in all possible immoral actions, deeds and ways just under the surface. It is a very strong criticism of victorian society that considers appearances as more important than real ethics and morality. He exposes the hypocrisy of such a society where a whole class of people are nothing but perambulating pictures of perfection hiding the mire and mud of crime and evil. We can also feel another dilemma in this book. Oscar Wilde's own dilemma who has to keep up appearances, the appearances of a well behaved, well educated and perfectly integrated man in this aristocratic society of his, and who yet lives a passion and a whole basket of desires and impulses that are absolutely rejected as crimes by victorian society. We know he will not be able to hide this deeper nature forever. But the book shows that no one can evade one's being exposed and rejected, condemned and sentenced to some punishment forever. There always comes a moment when one will be exposed and rejected. This shows how deeply Oscar Wilde must have suffered in his life. The painting is nothing but a mirror of the deeper self of Dorian Gray, but a mirror who will become one day his accuser.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I love it.

For this, he would give his soul; and that was exacly what happened.This is no ordinary book. This book is funny and interesting.

Finally decided to re-read it in English. I was astonished as to how differently I perceived it this time around. Without a question, Wilde is a master of words, but the subject of this book was questionable. It appeared to me, that Wilde was set on pushing his own philosophy and views of life and self onto others, and, as I read it, I found myself rejecting it with every fiber of my being. I was rather surprised to have such a strong reaction to this piece of literature. Would not read again and would not recommend it to others either. Just my two cents."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"It's been a while since I read The Picture Of Dorian Gray, but I'll try to review it as well as I can.The Picture Of Dorian Gray takes place in late nineteenth-century England, among the wealthy middle- or lower upper class. It is about Dorian Gray, a young man who is beautiful, charming and popular. His good friend Basil Hallward is painting his portrait, and during a visit at Basil's house he meets Lord Henry, another friend of Basils. Lord Henry is decadent and provocative, and Dorian is very impressed by him and his ideas.Lord Henry tells him about how precious his youth and beauty is, and how awful everything will become when he grows old (\\"When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter then defeats\\").When Basils painting is finished, Dorian sees his own beauty in it and is struck by the fear of aging. He makes a pact with the devil, and sells his soul so that he can remain young and beautiful forever, while his painting grows old and repulsive. His former kind and lovely self is gradually reformed, and he grows evil and corrupt although he still appears just as fresh and innocent as he has always been.This book is not the best one I've read, but it is pretty good. I think that the characters are sometimes turned into caricatures of themselves; they don't really appear to be real persons. Although I really liked Lord Henry's philosophical monologues, they sometimes grew tiresome and a bit too long. The novel, and in particular the ending, is quite predictable.However, the book is beautifully written (like most of the books I've read from that time (but I don't know if it's because of their superiority to the writers of today, or merely because the good ones are the only ones that are left to future generations))(...) There are strong homosexual tendencies in the friendship between Dorian Gray and both Basil and Lord Henry, and their friendship does not feel like a mere friendship.Apart from being a way for Wilde to, through Lord Henry, give voice to some of his philosophical ideas, I think the novel is about the shallowness and hypocrisy of the Victorian society, which considered outward appearance more important than ethics and moral."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"In the book the Picture of Dorian Gray Dorian, the main character makes a powerful wish that impacts his life and the lives of others.

It seems as if all of Dorian Gray's evils are inspired by his sidekick, Lord Henry.

I find myself finishing almost every book ahead of schedule, and liking quite a few of them. So when I found out we'd be reading The Picture of Dorian Gray in junior year of High School, I started it with a positive mind. It was a famous classic after all! However, in this particular case, I was disappointed.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a novel with far too much unused potential. It's about the adventures of Dorian Gray, an upper class young adult living in the 1890's. Dorian acquires a magical portrait that diverts all physical traces of sin from him to his face in the portrait, allowing him to commit as much sin as he wants and remain looking youthful and innocent (i.e., after his insults drive his girlfriend Sybil to suicide, his portrait develops \\"a touch of cruelty in his mouth\\" [pg. 91] but his actual face remains the same). He gets advice from other characters about how he should live life, and after following his friend Lord Henry's way of life (outlined in a little yellow book that encourages Dorian to remain vain and shallow) and living hedonistically and selfishly for years and years, he finally realizes how \`ugly' his soul has become and launches an attempt at redemption. While it seems like there would be lots of action, I was disappointed at the lack of plot in general, and most of the book is actually rich people talking about human nature. Many of the book's lessons are taken from the obscure musings of Lord Henry, who acts as an outlet for Wilde's opinions, and while this is a decent way for Dorian to learn about life, I would much rather have read about him learning through experience as he traveled around doing something interesting. He could have been living a life of incalculable sin, and yet chooses to have sex and hang out in gardens smoking opium all day; not quite the worst decision ever, but not an exciting book.The lack of action isn't the only disappointing thing about the book. I constantly felt that Wilde was too busy sending messages to the audience to really give his characters life. Every dialogue read less like a real conversation and more like a (sometimes cryptic) scripted debate, and Wilde skips past something like twenty years' worth of Dorian Gray's character development (summarizing the slow corruption in one chapter). Other characters serve only to invoke development in Dorian, and no other characters show any significant development themselves, making the story just slightly distant. Wilde wastes space for the plot to talk about his ideas about human nature, crossing the line between novel and essay too much for my pleasure (\\"...you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you.\\" [pg. 220] is a good example of Lord Henry voicing Oscar Wilde's opinion on not just Dorian, but on life, and the Victorian generation). Another book that actually balances preaching with plot well is Animal Farm by George Orwell; it manages to simultaneously deliver a message about communism and entertain the audience. If you want a book where it is mostly messages and the entertainment is scarce, Dorian Gray is the book for you.Well, why is the story so famous? Part of its reputation is due to its shock value concerning homosexuality. There were various less-than-covert hints at homosexuality and adultery, which, unfortunately, are no longer effective in the 21st century. Now that the president is praising gay service in the military on national television, it is hard to be amazed about having gay characters in a book, and so a lot of impact is lost on me. Besides these homosexual exchanges between Dorian and the other male characters, the book is fairly void of plot, and Wilde's reliance on shock value make it boring and harder to take seriously at this point in time, no matter how revolutionary his writing may have been back in his era.The book was short enough to read through without losing focus, and to be fair, Wilde's writing is always very elegant with a signature fancy flair. Many of Lord Henry's musings are interesting, and most of the dialogues are widely quotable. The problem is that the story is just a little bit too boring for me to consider it a book you would normally read for fun, and combined with the superb premise of Dorian's magical portrait, this book's plot was really disappointing."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"If the book was entitled \\"The Picture of Dorietta Gray\\" it never would have become a classic. The idea of a man's beauty when the book was written and even today is suspect. There is something feminine about a beautiful person, pretty eyes, long eyelashes, a voluptuous mouth and smooth skin. Masculine men are suppose to be rugged even if handsome, a jutting jaw, thin lips and leathery skin. That Dorian was barely a man when his portrait is completed is important because when he wished for eternal youth, he refused to become a man and to be a pretty boy as he aged was itself, a decadent act.The book begins with lots of talk about Art and how Dorian Gray himself was a work of art who shouldn't bother with the hurley burley of real life. His first corruption comes when he can't accept Sybil Vane is so in love him she loses her ability to inhabit the lives the Shakespearean woman she played so well. But then the book become less about how Dorian fails to live up to the art of his life and more about his shadowy, decadent ways.Men and women fall in love with Dorian Gray. After Ms. Vane, it appears that Dorian falls in love with no one but he lurks around the docks, bars and opium dens with other men. What he actually does that is so disreputable is never clear and but for those of us living post Stonewall have a pretty good idea that it involved casual sex with men.The novel anticipates the celebrity that consumes us. It also proudly promotes male beauty in a new way. But after setting up a grand discussion about art and beauty, I think the book transforms into something more pedestrian, a creepy tale of horror where art and beauty are forgotten."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Title of Book: The Picture of Dorian GrayBy: Oscar WildeReviewed by: M. PoppinsPeriod: 5Basil Hallward painted a picture of his friend, Dorian Gray. Dorian was about eighteen years old, and everyone said that he was very beautiful. Lord Henry Wotton (Harry), Basil's friend from Oxford, became Dorian's best friend after they met. After the picture was finished, Basil gave the picture to Dorian as a present, and Dorian made a wish that he would always be young, and the picture would grow old. His wish came true. Whenever he did something bad, the person in the picture would get older. Dorian's face never changed after the picture was finished. He never let anyone know about the picture. One day, Dorian showed Basil the picture and showed him how much the picture was altered. Dorian then murdered the man by digging a knife behind his ear, stabbing him again and again. The day after Basil was dead, Dorian made Alan Campbell (one of his former friends) get rid of the body, by blackmailing him. Dorian then decided that he was going to do. He was going to destroy the picture, because he thought that he was going to be in peace after the picture was gone. He grabbed the knife that he had used to kill Basil and stabbed the picture with it. A cry and a crash were heard. A while later, his coachman and footman went through the windows, up to where Dorian was. On the wall, there was a picture of Dorian Gray, young and beautiful. On the ground, there was a man who was wrinkled, withered, and loathsome of visage. They had to examine the rings for them to recognize who he really was.I liked this book because it was fun and interesting at the same time. This quote is what made Dorian's wish come true: &quot;...only if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that would grow old!&quot; He didn't know that his wish was to come true. I love when things like that happen!I also disliked the book, because in some parts, it just went on and on about things that I didn't understand. Also, there was too much philosophy in this book. This was something that Lord Henry said: &quot;I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, down-right cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated...&quot; The quote still goes on. I think that Lord Henry is too philosophic.My least favorite part of the book was when Dorian was stabbing Basil, because that was too nasty for me.

It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him.

Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read.

In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book.

Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind. We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man. His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray.

Another reviewer said that this book was about people doing horrible things, and yet the book was impossible to put down.Nearly everyone knows the story. Dorian Gray wishes that his portrait will show the ravages of time and wickedness while he remains young and beautiful - and he gets his wish. I knew that Dorian's life was going to be ruined - and at times I could predict what was going to happen next. Usually that turns me away from a book. But Wilde's storytelling is so delectable, so riveting that (to use a cliche) it was like watching a train wreck. Terrible to see, but I couldn't look away. I was fascinated.I have heard complaints about the 'flowery' language, but I loved it!Being the overthinker that I am, this book also raised some questions for me: Was Dorian really corrupted by Lord Henry, or did Lord Henry merely show the world Dorian's true hidden nature? Was Basil to blame somehow for painting the portrait? This was probably Wilde's goal - to make us think, and to make us question our hidden nature."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Ever since I got my kindle, I've been downloading free classics and The Picture of Dorian Gray was one of them. I remembered it was an option to read for our British Literature final paper so it caught my eye. I started reading the book knowing absolutely nothing about it and within the first few pages I was caught up in its beautiful writing and witty banter between the characters. It's a great story about how a man basically trades his soul for his youth. Wilde writes about the debauchery that Dorian goes through without being so literal about it, which is probably because he was living during victorian times, but it's great because it lets your imagination wander. He doesn't outright say that Dorian seduces women, gets high, or is bisexual, but you assume all of that from his writing. This is not a story that teaches you to choose the \\"good\\" path in life. It's a story that tells us that if we could be a little hedonistic without consequences we would. I'd love to live Dorian Gray's life for a week to know what it feels like...but then have it erased from my life.The negative reviews were basically that the book is boring. I admit there was this one part of the book where it describes everything that Dorian Gray bought, but it's only for a chapter. Another negative reviewer wrote that this book is full of quotables without substance, and well, I don't think the quotes are a bad thing. It's funny! I personally love reading all types of books, both classic and modern, but the ones that keep me fascinated are the classics. The style of writing is just beautiful."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"It felt longer than the actual (approx) 280 paper pages it is. I skipped over some of Dorian's ranting about 60% through. I've never skimmed like that... Even in Anne of Green Gables. Aside from the tangents on his experiences abroad and the scents of different flowers and such, it was a good read. Nice ending, but I feel like it was a bit abrupt.SIDE NOTE ON TECHNICALLY EBOOK ASPECTS:The chapters are not recognized by Kindle.

Although, there are a few typos on the Kindle version."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I love this book. I revisit it every few years. I'm so happy to be able to read it with my Kindle app. Now I might revisit Wilde's dark world more often."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"My friend told me about this book, maybe 2 months ago or so. His reccomendation was so promising that I was eager to get this book. After about a week I was in a bookshop and I saw this book, immediatly I had to buy it, and it was so cheap.I've read it in a week or so, and after I finished it, I opened the first page and began reading again - thats how marvelous this book is. The dialogues are so thrilling and full of witty but thought provoking aphorisms, especially from Lord Henry (one of the characters). For example: \\"I am too fond of reading books to care to write them.\\",\\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\\" ,\\"Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the cave-man had known how to laugh, History would have been different.\\"Wilde writes so naturally, with no stifness and with so much humour!I won't go into the subject matter because you can get that anywhere on google. But I will tell you that this novel made me a fan of Wilde and also made me read more of his work!Next week I plan on getting his plays (also from Oxford World's Classics, because they put so much to provide you with a good introduction, chronology and resources about the book, and the format is beautiful and easy too read).It's not hard cover, but I like it better as a paperback, it is not thick and you can take it anywhere with you, and its cover and design is unique."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"It deals with a commonly met theme in literature, the wish of men to stay forever young.

Short lecture with a great story"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This book was so well written and covers so many important, seemingly timeless dilemmas that I felt guilty while I was reading it. Even though there is no explicit language, there was a subtle sexual undertone throughout the work that was frightening. It is one of those books that people love to hate and hate to love because it hits so close to home for people in so many walks of life. I think the reason it can touch so many people is because it makes people wonder about how well their friends would think they are doing rather than how well they themselves think they are doing. \\"What would I look like if the mirror were to show my 'inner' self rather than my 'outer' self?\\" is the pervasive question here."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I enjoyed reading this book I chose it because of the Author. I had not read anything by Oscar Wilde until this book and it is a good read.The Picture of Dorian Gray"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I really loved this book from the beginning to the end. I'm a fan of Oscar Wilde, and I could'ntmiss this great classical novel. The book is dominated by two amazing and strong personalities :Dorian Gray,a character full of life, and his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton.The story is deliciously dark and unusual, and as far as I know this is the only novel Wilde hadever written. It provides an interesting look on the society of the time through this multi-layeredstory, and Dorian Gray is a perfect representation of the human species. The novel depicts anundeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, and allows thereader to understand better why it upset the British society that was emerging from the socialconstraints of Victorianism. I appreciated the beauty of his writing style, always elegant, witha flow that looks like poetry all along the book. The conversations exchanged are also witty andpoignant.Maybe some people could find the flow of the story quite slow, or with too many descriptions,which may not give enough room for imagination. Also the text was a little small, but remainedvery readable.Anyway, I highly recommend this book. It is a great way to start discovering Oscar Wilde's workthrough this book full of mystery, which still asks today this valid question: \\"What are peoplewilling to sell to get eternal beauty?\\""},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"It arrived very quickly.

I've enjoyed this author for many years. You will have a great adventure with this story."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"How to rate such a classic book? Everyone should read to understand the magic of beauty itself. The great work of Oscar Wilde reveals a lot of himself."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The story was great...but I had a difficult time going off on the tangents with Oscar Wilde. This was written for a time when people had only books for entertainment. Too many words these days are too &#34;binding.&#34;"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is not just a book, it is a story that delves into each human's beliefs and views of the world, a book that makes a person really look differently at the world around them. Although Oscar Wilde wastes much space with over-explanatory details, the moments in which he tells his story are moments of inspiration and causes of great self-examination. The story, in which a good-looking young man gains eternal beauty, really makes its reader look within themselves and find the person they are and who they want to be. Also, through some very good symbols, Wilde is able to make his reader find new meaning in the world around them and is able to open the reader's eyes to the magnificence--and ugliness--of life itself.Even though the book is mostly filled with simple dialogue and extended (and sometimes, unnecessary) descriptions, the overall effect the story itself can have upon the reader's mind is overpowering. Not only does Wilde's occasional complex dialogue add to the reader's understanding of the world, the ideals with which Wilde writes (and therefore gives his character) make the reader work to understand where they fall within the spectrum of day to day life.The book was slow moving at first, but really started to pick up, due to its author's ability to excite the reader's mind, with the first meeting between the main character and the man who he would eventually blame for all of his problems. I would definitely recommend this book to those who have an open mind (there are some controversial ideas and lifestyles within the story) and are able to follow a character's complex mindset because, although most of the book is simple and in some people's eyes, artless, it still provides the reader with multiple \\"out-of-the-box\\" type ideas.I enjoyed the book, and the message it sent was one that I will probably never forget. It is one that forces the reader to question what they value in life, make them question what a \\"perfect\\" life would be. Because of the story's ability to reach within the readers mind and plant a new outlook on life, the book would be a great read for anyone who is interested in hearing the story of a man who gave up everything in order to keep the only thing he believed to be important within the world, the thing that he himself feared losing the most."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"A classic noir fiction novel were the worship of material values related to physical beauty and immortality drive the ego of a young man belonging to the upper classes of the English society of the XIX century to a tragic fate after circumstances force him to confront his real self. His life takes a swift turn for the worse when he sees the awful expression of his rotten soul expressed on his own face painted in a portrait. Oscar Wilde wrote an essay intended to decry certain paramount values acclaimed by western societies. It features rich pieces of wisdom and underlying messages. Great ending"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I enjoyed this public domain book very much in that the story line held my interest and was full of interesting observations of human nature which are as relevant now as they must have been when the book was published."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde is phenomenal at taking your mind and all its components, rearranging them and laying them back out in an entirely different order. There's a lot to be learned from Dorian Gray, I promise he's well worth your time."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I decided to re-read Dorian Gray for an upcoming book club discussion but I knew that I wanted to read the annotated edition because I cannot resist special editions--books, films, and music-- with all the accompanying special features. I had not realized the extent to which Wilde's original version differed from the final published edition. This edition gives me everything I would ever want to know about Dorian Gray, including not only everything he wrote that was edited out later but extensive footnotes, illustrations, photographs and paintings of innumerable peripheral points of interest.The Picture of Dorian Gray bears similarities in my mind with other notable philosophical metaphysical fantasies of the nineteenth century--Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and one less well-known than those others but perhaps an even more direct influence on Wilde--Balzac's Le Peau de Chagrin, or The Magic Skin. In that novel, a man purchases a magic wild ass's skin that is supposed to grant his every wish. He, of course, indulges in every kind of debauchery and decadent, hedonistic activity he can imagine and discovers that the skin magically shrinks and his life span is correspondingly shortened with every wish fulfilled.All of these novels were published before Wilde wrote his philosophical fantasy and they all influenced him, along with other tales of magic portraits by Hawthorne, Poe and Gogol. Wilde used the device in a particularly unique way. The portrait is kept in a locked room in an attic as any reminder or repository of our darkest impulses would be, in a back chamber of the subconscious. In the final published version of the novel, there are connotations of homosexuality and bisexuality among the characters of the impossibly handsome Dorian, the effete artist Basil Hallward and the caustic, witty, married (and bisexual) Lord Henry Wotton. Each of these characters depict aspects of Wilde himself, with Lord Henry being the primary expounder of Wildean bon mots and witty aphorisms--\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about,\\" \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" etc.In the original, uncensored version one can easily see from our \`unsuppressed' 21st century perspective that Wilde is writing about characters that are gay or bisexual. Even though Wilde was writing between and through the lines about these matters of sexual identity, it wasn't subtle enough to not be used as evidence against him in his trial for \`gross indecency' a few years later.From the perspective of someone outside Wilde's era, the novel is a strange, nightmarish parable of sexuality, youth, immortality and moral conscience. Without the sexual components, the novel is a strange neutered fable and attempts to heterosexualize it, as in the famous 1945 film version, only produce strangely asexual men with nebulous fetishes.It is Wilde's only novel and it is a brave, noble attempt. Its weaknesses, of which Wilde was aware, stem from his experience writing for the theater. There are pages of dialogue that could have easily been lifted from a page of script in which not a line of descriptive narration appears. On the other hand, there is an entire chapter in which there is no character interaction whatsoever, no dialogue, merely an extensive, descriptive catalog of the cultural stimuli that contribute to Dorian's dissipation.Upon reflection, one wonders if Wilde would have felt the need to write this novel in a less sexually repressed era. In our current day there would be thousands of opportunities for objective purgings of the darker impulses to be manifested not only through painting but numerous other visual media. Wilde would be one of many gay authors. The novel cannot be separate from the time in which it was created, however, and in the England of 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray was an extremely daring shot in the face of Victorian social and cultural customs."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde is one hell of an elegant writer. He focuses a lot on beauty in his writing, and it really shows. The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a narcissistic man, only to fall in love with a a beautiful painting done of himself. He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better... The Importance of Being Earnest. Regardless, if not for the plot, read it for the experience in exceptional writing."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This a well written unusual story with strong characters and definitely worth reading. Still, I would not rate this work of art as an excellent one. Its actuality for todays life is limited and, on my opinion, contains too much unbased social philosophy."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"about an old classic like Dorian Gray? Still entertaining after all these years. A bit wordy for the new crowd, but the lesson of the story is infinite."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Fantastic quotes and very poetically written book. Interesting story as well, definitely worth the read. I recommend taking a spin through the book"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Believe it or not, I had not heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray until the movie League of Extraordinaty Gentleman came out. I know, crazy right. No, I havn't lived under a rock my whole life. I don't know how i missed it. Well, after seeing the movie I rented every movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray I could find and fell in love with the story. Then I read the book... and fell in love with the writing.Reading the first chapter is like being swathed in wonderful writing from head too toe. I felt completely surrounded by it. You can almost feel the warmth of the garden, hear the sounds of the birds and dragonflies, and smell the beauty of the flowers as you sit and listen to this conversation between Harry and Basil. The writing is an immersive experince. And Basil's description of his first encounter with Dorian and the feelings that Dorian stirs in him, sound almost... romantic. At the least there's definately a bromance going on. And we also see the first crack of Dorian's facade in this chapter, which Basil's decsription of how Dorian sometiems seems purposefully cruel to him. Isn't it interesting, the first chapter ends with Harry demanding to meet Dorian and dragging Basil into the house and we haven't even met Dorian yet ourselves.As I read the book it occured to me that it could also have been titled the Influence of Lord Henry Wotten, for Harry's (as he's called by his friends) opinions and influence are as central to the story as Dorian Gray himself and more of a factor than the portrait itself. Hardly a scene goes by that Harry, whether present or not, is not quoted as an authority. It was as if he was the potter and Dorian was the clay. Harry was fully aware of his influence, and Dorian... Dorian seemed to be racing from one sensation to another like a spoiled child.This was by far one of the best written, most interesting stories I have read. I will read it over and over and would recommend it to everyone.STATS:Nook Pages: 240Genere: ClassicRe-readability: Very High"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I was curious about this book from another book I recently read. I first picked up the audiobook narrated by Edward Petherbridge (8 disks, BBC Audio, 1994/2010) from my Library, but I couldn't stand Edward's narration. He was terrible. He spoke really fast, then slow all of a sudden. He was british but it just was NOT working. It's was like Narrator ADD, and I just HAD to put the Audiobook down.Then I took out another AudioBook, narrated by Michael Page (7 disks, Brilliance Audio, 1995), and it was absolutely AMAZING!!! Michael does a wonderful job of keeping the pace and volume easy to follow and the words were British and clear. WOW!! Great job! I highly recommend Michael Page for all audio recordings.The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)Moving on to the story....It was great! It is definitely a Gothic classic. It is a story about a boy, Dorian Gray, who is beautiful beyond belief, but naive as well. He is first discovered by an artist, Basil and becomes the artist's muse. Basil paints the most wonderful, telling portraits, when Dorian sits for him. His work like never before. The artist has a friend, Henry, who is an absolute cynic. Henry thinks he is enlightened, but he is just a miserable existentialist mess! Dorian takes to Henry and they get close, thereby pulling Dorian away from Basil the artist.Henry is full of skepticism, and a deliberate, mean, philosophy on life that he expresses through twisted words and phrases. To Dorian, this is all new and he starts to look up to Henry, emulating him, and following his words. The Good, beautiful, kind, and chaste Dorian becomes a wicked, evil, manipulative, infamous character that everyone is afraid of. His good looks remain, through a portrait made by Basil.Just as Dorian is an inspiration for Basil's blank canvas, so is Henry an inspiration for Dorian's mind as a blank canvas.That is the story.But my summary won't really help you understand the book, you just have to read it.It's very interesting, and well written. I definitely find myself getting angry at some of the things said and done. I am repelled, I feel disgusted, I feel for the minor characters. I sympathize with Basil and I hate Henry. This book got me good.It is am absolutely one-of-a-kind novel I highly recommend you read. You might walk away feeling a little dirty inside, and questioning yourself as well."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Occasionally one reads a book that leaves a lasting impact in one's mind for the duration of a lifetime, and crops up at the most curious of times. \\"Dorian Gray\\" by the brilliant Oscar Wilde is such a one for this reviewer. While you are remaining curiously young and ageless to your friends and the world at large, your aging portrait hidden from all eyes is inspected by you alone as the years go by with some trepidation as the case may be, and as time marches on. Not only is your true appearance accurately portrayed in the picture, showing your actual physical age, but revealing in great detail your personality along with your good deeds and misdemeanors etched meticulously across the painting. When friends of mine sent word recently saying \\"Expect us to look younger since you saw us a decade ago!\\", I was quick to respond \\"I fully expect you to look your appropriate age, and far superior than when you were last here\\". Although this was meant as a note of humor on my part, the thought of Wilde's masterpiece came to mind immediately and the air around me was chilly for a moment. As for Dorian Gray when he attempts to alter and amend his portrait (which might be interpreted as his soul), I shall leave new readers to discover the results of such an enterprise for themselves. A powerful and magnificent novel by one of the greatest literary figures of all times."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"My first encounter with Mr. Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray has left me feeling my soul has been put under the microscope and I have been forced to look into those secret dark places that I keep hidden from the outside world. The language and attention to detail envelopes the reader and at times seems to go on for pages with no end in sight (the section on jewels and music for instance). I love this about Oscar Wilde's writing style. How deliciously dark and disturbing this book is. I am astonished it has taken me so long to read such a brilliant book."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Set in the 1800's in the streets of London, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a haunting story of corruption brought unto Dorian Gray by the Lord Henry Wotton. Oscar Wilde explores the pleasures of life, beauty, and temptation through the character of Dorian who, one day realizes that his beauty will fade after Lord Henry's comments on Dorian's youth being captured perfectly: \\"Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!\\" (Wilde 3). Dorian unknowingly offered his soul to the devil for his physical beauty in return, all his sins would be reflected in the painting.After his friend Basil, paints a masterpiece of Dorian, he tries to protect Dorian from Lord Henry's thinking and goals in life knowing where it would lead him. Although Hayward is only in the novel for a short time, his character inspired me to keep reading until the end where we can finally see how justice is served. Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil Halyward, who grudgingly introduced him to Dorian. Lord Henry is the character you love to hate; he is such a perfect character, you can sense that something is wrong with him.The young and handsome Dorian Gray is the main protagonist who made me rethink my future and how I looked at life. Although very rich and in good social standing, he chooses to hang out in the slums of London in opium dens and around the docks, symbolizing his sins and where his values lie. The way Oscar Wilde characterizes Dorian gives a vivid and accurate picture of a good boy gone bad.The principal theme of this novel is that self-worship leads to self-destruction, this is one of the main themes that pulled me into reading this book. However, another theme that goes hand-in-hand with the previous one is living a double life. Many speculate Oscar Wilde used this as one of his themes because he was inspired by the story; The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson.Although written over 120 years ago, this book is a must have and should be in every library across the world or on your shelf. This amazing read forcibly opens your mind to imagine every detail and corner of this story you can feel yourself get lost, just be careful you don't end up in an opium den!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This is real entertainment. You have debauchery, murder, a love story that isn't really one, a main character that you both like and hate, and some kind of supernatural thing going on (usually not my cup of tea, but this case is the exception of the rule.) The best part of the book was that I kept wanting to know what happened next, and there were enough twists and turns to be interesting, yet still believable. I highly recommend this!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I read this when I was in High School and read it again now and I still see Oscar as a genius.

While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details. It's contemporary today, as proved by a recent film adaptation (starring the drool-worthy Ben Barnes) which was quite accurately adapted from the book and is, to my mind, required reading. Or should be."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Just adding my two cents to a list of great reviews.I love British literature, and Oscar Wilde is a lot of fun. I read this book fairly quickly, it seemed that the text flowed well and the subject matter and characters held my interest. It is a lovely novel about vanity and envy. The message may have been written long ago, but it still holds merit today.And without giving anything away, you will be surprised at many points in this novel. Pleasantly of course."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This is a review of the free Kindle edition.I had, of course, heard of the Picture of Dorian Gray, but with the joy of a Kindle I'm now able to read it for free.Wow.The story is amazing. The character of Dorian Gray shines (sucks the light out of the room?) during the story. The imagery of the picture is wonderful to reflect the corruption of Dorian's soul. Along with Dorian, I do wonder if he could have reversed it, if he had cared enough to try.

READ IT NOW!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I used the built in dictionary regularly with this story which is rich with precise descriptive language of the 19th century."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines. Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \\"dandy\\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy. You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Innocent and young Dorian Gray is seduced by some bad influences, and taught to worship youth, beauty, and sensation. Due to a passionate prayer, the physical effects of a life dedicated to self-gratification and pleasure-seeking are borne by a painting of him instead of by his own body. The story focuses not on the actual events of Dorian's life, but the discussions on the philosophies supporting such a life. To this reviewer, the message is that a life of selfishness and self-gratification corrupts, and in the end we can have no separation from this corruption. Dorian Gray is a tad slow at times, as the conversations can get long, but it is still educational, and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \\"Importance of Being Earnest.\\" And his \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Unfortunately I made it through both high school and college without ever having been assigned this book. Over the years I have read plenty of Wilde's works, but for some reason or another, missed this one over and over. I recently sat down, and decided that it was time to give this a read. To be honest, I knew very little about this actual book prior to reading it, other than it involved a picture that aged rather than he in the painting.I expected to have difficulty reading this book, since it had been such a long time since I had read anything from the Victorian era, however the language was surprisingly simple, and Wilde's wit is as sharp as ever. Almost sharp enough to harm the reader should they not be forewarned or guided through the readings. Should someone of a weaker mind read this book, it would be easy to fall into the trap of Dorian, who himself was poisoned by a book and the words of his friend.Summary without giving too much away: Dorian Gray is an Adonis-like beauty, young and full of life and innocence at the beginning of our story. His beauty has attracted the obsession of a painter who paints picture after picture of him. Basil (the painter) tries to keep young Dorian pure and in love with life. Henry, a friend of Basil's comes to the studio as Basil paints his master work - a portrait of Doran. Henry fascinates young Dorian in his vile manner of speaking and sarcastic wit. His talk instills in Dorian both a fear of losing his beauty and a lust for all that is selfish and vile in life. Dorian's notable debauchery follows in exquisite detail with Henry always along for the ride to prod young Dorian down the wrong road. Several suicides and a murder or two later, complete madness begins to make its appearance.Wilde was brilliant in his writing of this book, he captures the time perfectly... the lust of it, the sexuality of it, the debauchery of it... all in the name of truth. In their words they say things that their hearts dare not to believe and their smiles are masks hiding the truth. And what if someone believed in these lies? What if they lived their life according to what they had been told? Then they would be Dorian Gray... and we will see what happens to him. This is a brilliant read, and for those of you who will have to write papers on it... the story is not long, but it is thick with meaning. There are very few stories that I would give 5 stars to, this is one of them."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Published in 1890, this novel by Oscar Wilde is a startling, fantastic portrayal of fin de siecle indulgence and hedonism.The novel is dark in its tone as it describes Dorian's fall from purity, and it involves itself heavily with suicide, death and supernatural occurences. The novel is also somewhat satirical, as Wilde makes reference to the absurd state of social affairs in Victorian London. Ironic and suspenseful, the novel keeps the reader interested in each plot development, and keeps the reader engaged and moved by the beautiful, carefully crafted prose.The story begins with Lord Harry Wotton, utterly captivated by a painting by a friend, the artist Basil Hallward. The painting is of the handsome and unspotted young Dorian Gray. Dorian is stunned at the worldly knowledge of the older gentleman, and soon finds himself under Lord Wotton's care and attention. Harry, the eternal pessimist, schools Dorian in his existential, hedonistic view. Dorian wishes in his vanity that the beautiful painting might age instead of he. When Dorian falls in love with and coldly rebukes a young actress, he returns home to find that the painting bears a faint expression of cruelty and callous; a certain sneer about the mouth. His wish had come true; \\"the canvas [bore] the burden of his passions and his sins.\\"As the story goes on, Dorian falls further and further into his own mind, indulging his every whim, strangling the lives of most everyone he touches by the ropes of scandal that Dorian is entangled in.Resonating throughout the story are the themes of power and love, overriden by vanity and swept beneath by slight homosexual undertones (easily overlooked by anyone who wants to overlook it).I thoroughly enjoyed this novel; the characters were well-developed, and I could identify with Dorian's desire to find a balance between his selfish motivation to indulge himself and his moral need to free himself from his sins. It is the endless plight of human existence: The moral drive to overcome the sins of our nature. The way the novel was written gives the reader a deep appreciation for Oscar Wilde, and the way in which he writes. The novel was a little difficult here and there, not because it was verbose or stylistically challenging, but merely because it was very in-depth. The book itself is a beautiful work; but moreso than the book itself are the ideas behind it. This is a book that makes one think about consequences of actions, the importance of emotions, of repentance and redemption.I would highly recommend this book.\\"Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.\\" - Basil Hallward to Dorian Gray, Chapter 9."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I have always heard of Dorian Gray, but never got around to reading it until now.

Compelled by my teacher to read it, I didn't think this book could give me so many hints. Thanks to Oscar Wilde I had my first approach to the Aesthetic ideolgy, absolutely one of the most involving and interesting: let's do &quot;Art just for Art's Sake&quot;! Dorian Gray embodies the new intellectual who thinks life should be lived as a work of art, so that it is possible to stop the destructive power of time. He also stated the only reality is that of impressions and sensations, and everything in life should be done in order to experience every kind of sensations, no matter how to do and what society could think. Well, I'm just a teenager and maybe for this reason I share some of Wilde-Dorian's instances: like me, the protagonist tries to reconcile wills of rebellion, linked to his soul's corruption, with desires of worldiness. In conclusion I think this is one of the best book I've ever read - and I have read al lot. I would suggest it to everybody who's willing to descover the most intimate and deepest aspects of his own soul!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This is a beautiful book in layout and design.

One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \\"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \\"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY.

This is a beautiful and definitive edition."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" provides a cautionary tale about the dogmatic pursuit of youth and beauty at the cost of one's own soul. Wilde provides an insight into the hedonistic lifestyle that he lived and championed. Indeed, one of the basic tenets of Wilde's philosophy - aestheticism - is presented in contradictory terms. While aestheticism attempts to redefine art as a means of beauty with no moral purpose, the novel's artwork - the portrait of Dorian Gray - shows the moral consequences of Dorian's hedonistic and narcissistic lifestyle.In a way, Dorian is the work of art, for he never changes his appearance. It is his portrait that is burdened with the sins and iniquities of Dorian's wickedness, for his portrait becomes haggard and disheveled as Dorian's soul sinks further into a dark abyss of nefarious behavior. On the outside, Dorian shows the luminous beauty of youth and a pure mind, yet the true soul of Dorian is diseased and dying. Any attempts at changing his inner essence only reveal him to be a hypocrite and egotist.Another cautionary tale is that in one of idolizing others and falling for their influence. Dorian begins his descent into immorality when he becomes enamored with Henry Wooten's philosophies that \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it\\" and \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders.\\" The cynical and satirical Henry Wooten espouses his hedonistic lifestyle, yet does not become entrapped in it like Dorian. Then, it is Dorian's influence who corrupts and ruins the lives of nearly all those with whom he is intimate.It is easy to see why this novel was criticized and decried as immoral in Victorian England. From the first chapter, there is a definite homosexual undertone. Henry and Basil admire Dorian's beauty and Basil declares that he cannot live without seeing Dorian everyday. Indeed, Basil's fondness of Dorian could just as easily describe romantic feelings toward a woman. Although there are heterosexual relationships, they are shallow and fleeting. Dorian's own deplorable actions are never revealed, save for opium, yet his corruption of young men implies that he engaged in acts of \\"gross indecency\\", the very same acts for which Oscar Wilde would be tried and convicted years later. Perhaps Wilde is attempting to justify his own lifestyle and criticize moral judgments, for \\"it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\"Although this is essentially a dark, Gothic novel, it does contain scenes of wit and humor. Henry's dialogue and witticisms convey the same tone as many of Wilde's highly acclaimed plays. Through satire, Wilde reveals the superficial nature of the aristocracy. Despite rumors of Dorian's sins, he is still highly desirable in London society, as his beauty and youth trump all.This is a superb novel by Wilde. I only wish that he would have honored us with a few more novels."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Dorian Gray was quite the read.Dorian Gray is a young man who has exquisite, wonderful features. He is good-looking. He is a model for Basil, a painter. Basil paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry, one of Basil's friends, meets Dorian and remarks how sad it is that Dorian will not always retain his youth and beauty. Dorian grows sad about this - and thinks, if only this picture would grow old and I can always stay young! He envies his own picture, because he thinks that the picture will forever retain its youth - while he will bear the wrinkles of life.Then things start becoming strange. After an unpleasant experience with his fianc&eacute;e, an actress, he looks at his picture and notices a cruel twist of the mouth. This is only the beginning. As Dorian makes his descent into debauchery and sinfulness, the picture bears the weight of his actions. Everytime he commits a transgression, the picture grows uglier and uglier. The picture becomes his sort of \\"conscience.\\"This book is one worth reading. I had heard of Dorian Gray and was curious. Wilde's writing was descriptive, yet easy to read. It is one of the easier classics, in my opinion.The only flaw to this novel was, at one point, there is a stage where Dorian collects a lot of things - like embroidery, etc. It describes the things he collects and makes lots of references and allusions to seemingly random people (perhaps famous people in history?). This seemed to me like a non sequitur, and just lots of rambling. Furthermore, it was confusing because I didn't know who the people being mentioned were. It was tedious, although I endured it. I'm glad I did, because the story progressed wonderfully.The ending is... quite morbid, but didn't come across as a complete surprise.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth your while. It will make you think - is eternal youth worth it? It will trigger lots of probing questions in your brain.

Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work.

Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The only novel by Oscar Wilde.

More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the &quot;evil&quot; influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, &quot;there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written or badly written.&quot; Wilde may have created a well written book, but he also, albeit purposely, created a book when, viewed from its many horizons, can be seen as terrible moral study in the lesson Gray undergoes."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":". . .of what we love about books: superior critical work, excellent physical presentation.

However, I was utterly disappointed. The disappointment had nothing to do with the novel's themes but rather its characters and delivery.As a literature major, I am one who enjoys long novels full of detail and old romantic language such as that of Jane Austen. While The Picture of Dorian Grey was written with glorious detail and all the flowery language that I love I found myself very bored. There were many places where I found that the story dragged and though I am sure they were meant to be brilliant social commentary I could not stand the countless scenes where Lord Henry or Dorian sat about with their friends and chatted.I may have still been able to give this book at least a three star rating if the boring scenes scattered throughout the book were the only fault but unfortunately what truly put me off was the characters. I cannot enjoy a book whose characters I do not come to love or at least care for in some small way. By the end of the novel I did not care one bit what happened to Dorian Grey; he was a spineless boy and a cruel man. Lord Henry was always a wicked man and a tiresome preacher of what he considered to be cleverness. Basil Hallward was the only character that I enjoyed and somewhat identified with but he was not enough apart of the story to redeem it and nothing could make up for Dorian himself.I was extremely disappointed in this book and I cannot say that I would recommend it to anyone other than a literature fanatic looking too read as many classics as possible."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Ugh, what to say about this book. I wanted so badly to love it, but I didn't. I didn't even like it a little bit. That's terrible when you don't really enjoy the very first classic you read. This isn't setting a good stage for the future and planning on reading one classic a month. Good thing Alice in Wonderland is next month. That will definitely make up for the suck of this one. Don't you hate it when you hear such good things about a book and you go in expecting to love it only to be completely disappointed? Yeah, that's what happened here.The book follows Dorian Gray (the original Mr. Gray, if you will) who is apparently a very beautiful man who is envied by many only he doesn't quite understand why. I liked Dorian but I didn't feel like his character had much depth. I liked that he wasn't all look how sexy I am you know you want this, but at the same time he was kind of a sissy. He follows this Lord Henry guy around like he's a lost little puppy dog and puts up with him bashing him on numerous occasions. I don't know who this guy thinks he is but I had to force myself not to skip over his parts. The only rational person in this book (minus his psycho obsession over Dorian) is Basil but he isn't in enough of the book to really care too much about.I think I know why I couldn't get into this book as much as the rest of the people who told me about it. Have you seen the movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Okay, I see Dorian Gray in that movie when I think about him. I see Stuart Townsend in all his \\"I'm the bomb get over it\\" glory. I cannot and will not picture him as the pushover that he was in this book. That movie ruined the book for me. I remember watching the actual Dorian Gray movie but it was boring too. I may have to watch it again just to see how terrible it was in comparison to the book, but I vaguely remember falling asleep at some point.The only reason I didn't give it one butterfly is because I was able to finish it. It was hard and it seemed like forever, but I did it. And the only reason I did it was to get to the end. I read on and off for like five days just to read about the scene I could have watched in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen after only an hour and a half. Stuart Townsend will always be my Dorian Gray. This book just didn't do it for me. However... Dorian is a VERY cool name. Props to Mr. Wilde for that."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Normally, I would love a Gothic novel, even if it flaunts conventions and is highlighted by long-winded descriptions of proper gentility. However, The Picture of Dorian Gray gets bogged down with trifles too often, which is distracting. There is an air of stuffiness and superficiality that becomes a little tiresome.Also, there are few redeeming characters in the novel, as the principal ones are nauseating. Take Lord Henry for instance. His long-winded philosophies and monologues dominate a good deal of the book; rather than adding much to the story, they become heavy-handed, like a point is being shoved in our face too often. And, then there is Dorian. So overdramatic and high-maintenance. Everything revolves around him and his precious little world. I get that he is supposed to be vain and materialistic, but there's little sympathy for him at all, especially when you realize he's more about forgetting his sins than actually repenting them. I realize that Wilde is philosophizing through his characters and the plot, but the means with which he goes about this is tedious.Still, there are redeeming aspects to the novel. Wilde does give us a moral to take away from the reading experience, as the Faustian angle of selling one's soul for beauty becomes apparent in Dorian's life. As Dorian ultimately chooses vanity over spirit and conscience, he sets the wheels of fate in motion. With devil in disguise Lord Henry egging him on, he gradually sees the portrait embody his tarnished soul: vanity, pleasures, sins. Wilde does give the book a very Gothic vibe. Dorian's portrait almost seems alive with grotesqueness, something horrible and monstrous hiding behind that sneer.While I did enjoy the Gothic aspects and the moral to Wilde's novel, I didn't like this novel as much as others."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"When asked to pick a favorite passage from a book, a lot of people will choose a vivid description. These people like authors to create beautiful scenes for them that they can forever conjure up in their heads. For this kind of reader, The Picture of Dorian Gray is probably a pleasure. Unfortunately, I am not this kind of reader.It is perhaps fitting that a book about beauty is defined by the images it creates rather than by the story or the dialogue. However, Oscar Wilde's mastery of dialogue is what makes his plays such a pleasure. For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray will never live up to Wilde's plays. This is not to say that the book is completely irredeemable; whenever Lord Henry is around, the book becomes better (but only insofar as it becomes more like a play, more focused on dialogue).You will love this book if you like descriptions, if you, unlike me, were able to read the chapters of The Grapes of Wrath that rambled about the land and that did not contribute to the plot. If you are like me, on the other hand, this book will be readable but not particularly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking.

Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \\"beauty for beauty's sake\\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I got this free for my iPad and I enjoyed reading it.

At first I thought it was going to be an old fashioned novel hard to understand, but in the contrary, even when it was written in 1890 Oscar Wilde criticizes so many attitudes and behaviors that our society still has. The book was quite \\"revealing\\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \\"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book. His thoughts, ideas, critics and points of view are clearly reflected. I really recommend the Picture of Dorian Gray, for me is a must read book.

The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \\"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that \`Ugliness is the only reality.'\\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that \`All art is quite useless\\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled \`useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \\"All art is quite useless,\\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called \`Aesthetic Movement,\\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\\"\\"\`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\\"\\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\\"\\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\\"\\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"To define is to limit.\\"\\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\\"\\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage. Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This is an old favorite of my mother's.

Today it would be difficult to get people to read it. As a former English teacher, I was fascinated and intrigued by Wilde's sentence structure and word choice; most readers today would find it stilted and actually difficult to read. In addition, the class structure adds more problems for understanding how the characters behaved. Lastly, the older British custom of describing men and their feelings about their friends would put off many readers. (Same problem with some of Shakespeare's sonnets.) While it is certainly a classic, there are many contemporary authors who deal with the theme as well as Wilde. It is probably a great choice for English literature majors; however.

This was not a comfortable read for me; in fact, it was quite difficult for me to finish. However, the difficulty did not arise because it was poorly executed; rather, it was so well done that I couldn't bear to watch the destruction of one man's soul.Oscar Wilde writes beautifully and eloquently, and this book overflows with witticisms and epigrams that are eminently quotable. However, many of these bon mots come from the observations of Lord Harry, who is the cynic that leads Dorian Gray down the road of temptation and vice. For that reason, I could not fully enjoy all of these wonderful sallies, knowing from whom they came and whose mind composed them.Dorian Gray is by no means an innocent throughout this book. However, he begins the book as An Ideal - the physical embodiment of all that is good, youthful, innocent and free of sin. In fact, his ideal purity is what inspires his friend, Basil, to paint the titular picture of Dorian Gray. Once Dorian makes the acquaintance of Basil's friend, Lord Harry, however, Dorian is fascinated by Lord Harry's worldly and cosmopolitan views. In a burst of youthful enthusiasm, Dorian wishes for the picture to bear the physical outcomes of his actions so that Dorian can retain his beauty. He soon discovers that his wish has been granted. Adopting Lord Harry's way of life, Dorian descends into a lifestyle of vice and pleasure seeking and perversely (and childishly?) anticipates the devastation he can wreak on the portrait without bearing any evidence on his own physical form.The levels of Harry's influence, Dorian's self-destruction, and Dorian's blindness to the true elements of his fall from \\"goodness\\" combined to make for a powerful read. I couldn't help but get a Faustian vibe throughout this novel, and I found myself calling Harry (in my head) \\"Mephisto! Mephisto!\\"The story told in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" of the ruination of a man's good character and moral compass is terrible, tragic, and, despite the fantastical nature of a portrait that reveals the blackness of one's soul, terrifyingly realistic."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This is really a must read, I recommend it highly.

Nevertheless, the beauty of the prose and the depth of Wilde's words are such that one can't fault the author for not living up to the standards he set for himself.

Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \\"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \\"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\\""},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a very dark tale of vanity, debauchery, drug use, murder and depression.

I don't generally like historical fiction much, but I got an assignment in my English class about banned books where we had to pick one to read, so I decided it was the perfect time to pick it up! I surprised myself when I ended up really enjoying the book. It's a great work and definitely a book that everyone should pick up at some point in their lives.Although there were a few characters I didn't enjoy so much, this book was overall incredible. Every book has a couple stumbles and can't really be perfect; but you know you have a true classic when the spectacular parts of the book are so spectacular that you kind of forget about the things you didn't like so much and fall in love with the book anyway. But it's not one of those books where I can easily point out what it is I liked about the book-the love for it was so gradual, I'm not sure at what point I feel head over heels for it or why!Important note! I'd recommend reading the introduction (if you read the version I did) AFTER you've already finished the novel! The introduction has a few spoilers for the book, though it doesn't explicitly say what happens. However, it was much easier to understand already knowing everything that happens.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"An absolute classic. This has always been my favorite. I highly recommend this book. It gets better everytime I read it!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This book is a classic. Mostly because it was the one book that Oscar Wilde wrote and it express a philosophy of the time in a fictional setting in a very unique fashion. The covert homosexuality is clear, for my personal taste, tolerable. It was an important part of his life. Also, the price was right: free."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was the only novel written by Oscar Wilde. The basic idea behind it is well-known even to those who have never read the book or seen any of various film adaptations. A beautiful young man named Dorian Gray possesses a portrait of himself, painted by his friend Basil Hallward. Dorian, who is very vain about his looks, expresses the wish that he could remain young and beautiful while the portrait grows old, only to find that he has made an unwitting Faustian bargain, because this is precisely what happens. Influenced by the hedonistic philosophy of another friend, Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gives himself over to a life of debauchery, remaining forever young while the signs of ageing begin to appear on the painting. The portrait, moreover, does not simply reflect Dorian's chronological age. It also acts as a reflection of the state of his soul. By the end of the story Dorian is no more than middle-aged, but the picture is that of a hideous old man, disfigured by a life of sin and vice.When the novel was first published in 1890 (in magazine form) it was highly controversial, for two reasons. The first reason was its undoubted homoerotic overtones, although Wilde toned these down somewhat when the novel was published in book form the following year. Explicit gay sex scenes would, of course, have been taboo in the 1890s, but coded references to famous homosexual lovers from history and mythology (Hadrian and Antinous, Edward II and Piers Gaveston, Jupiter and Ganymede) can be taken as an indication that Dorian's debauches are not exclusively of the heterosexual variety. There is also an indication that Basil's feelings for Dorian, and possibly Lord Henry's as well, go beyond mere friendship.The other reason why the novel was so controversial was that Wilde was wrongly thought to be espousing Lord Henry's world view and advocating a love of beauty and pleasure as the only good in life. This impression was strengthened by Wilde's Preface, which consists solely of twenty-five epigrams about art, including \\"There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all\\". These statements appear to align Wilde with the literary and cultural movement known as Aestheticism, or sometimes as the Decadent Movement. This movement adopted as its slogan \\"Art for Art's Sake\\", interpreted by many of its followers such as the French poet Theophile Gautier as a denial of the idea that there was any association between art and morality.Wilde's epigrams, however, should not be taken as the Twenty-Five Articles of a prescriptive artistic credo; they were rather intended as provocative aphorisms intended to stimulate discussion. The author himself frequently wrote works with a quite overt moral agenda- children's stories like \\"The Selfish Giant\\", social satires like \\"A Woman of No Importance\\" and \\"An Ideal Husband\\", poems like \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\". Indeed, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" itself can be interpreted as an overtly moral work. In a letter, Wilde said of the three main characters: \\"Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be--in other ages, perhaps\\"- an interesting remark, given that Basil is both the only character in the novel who is a creative artist and also the representative of a traditional, and often explicitly Christian, morality, which contrasts sharply with Henry's amoralism. Henry is a cynical dandy, much given to witty aphorisms, but like other similar characters in Wilde's works is not to be taken as a self-portrait of the author.If Dorian is a Faust-figure, Henry is his Mephistopheles, but he is a devil less corrupt than the man he tempts. For all Henry's cynicism, he never descends into the depths of depravity in the same way as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; does. He never quite has the courage to practise what he preaches, being guilty of what might be called inverted hypocrisy, making himself out to be worse than he really is. As Basil says to him \\"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\" Dorian's sins, however, are not limited to sexual debauchery and drug addiction (he becomes an habitu&eacute; of opium dens). His callous behaviour drives his fianc&eacute;e, the young actress Sibyl Vane, to suicide, and in an attempt to preserve himself from exposure he resorts to blackmail and murder.One thing that does link Wilde to the Aesthetic movement is his undoubted love of physical beauty; the story is written in a very rich, lush style with many striking descriptive passages, such as the opening description of the beautiful summer's day on which Dorian first meets Henry. Yet his attitude to Aestheticism is a critical one, and is perhaps closer to that of earlier writers such as Ruskin and Morris, both of whom promoted an appreciation of beauty not as an end in itself but as part of a wider political and social agenda. Wilde clearly saw the limitations, and the dangers, of a cult of beauty divorced from moral and human concerns. It is perhaps significant that, after committing his murder, Dorian sits down to calm his nerves by reading the poetry of Gautier, the writer most closely associated with the \\"art for art's sake\\" ideology. He breaks off his engagement to Sibyl after seeing her give a bad performance in the theatre; her explanation for the decline in her acting skills is that, having discovered real love, she can no longer be inspired by fictional love. For him, artistic concerns are paramount over human ones; for her, it is the other way round.As one might expect from the only novel of a highly original, idiosyncratic writer, the book occupies a unique place in the history of English literature. It is sometimes classified as Gothic fiction, and the work to which it bears the greatest similarity is perhaps another classic \\"Gothic\\" novel from the late 19th century, Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\", published five years earlier. Like Stevenson, Wilde wanted to explore the duality within the human soul between the virtuous public side and the darker private side which we are compelled to keep hidden. As a homosexual forced to conceal his homosexuality, this theme had an obvious appeal for him.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a complex, multi-layered work, and there is insufficient space in this review to touch on all its many aspects. It is, however, a work which well deserves its status as a literary classic more than a century after the death of its author."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This is to my knowledge, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. It is very intelligent and at some points, rather dark, but that all makes it even more fun! The story is that Dorian Gray, is a young man who finds the thought of aging, rather depressing. As it so happens, his best friend is an artist, who has been quite happy to paint a portrait of Dorian. Upon witnessing his youth preserved in art, Mr. Gray wishes it could perhaps, be the other way around...and his wish is granted but, in a nightmarish way. For now the painting reflects his sins. Believe me, he has more than enough. This is a great, if tragic story and I'm so glad it was free, as this was my first time reading it! Also, this book is positively packed with good quotes so, now's the time to create a My Clippings file on your Kindle."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray (Tor, 1891)I cannot comment on the scariness of &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em>, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. Why? Because, despite the reams of column inches I've read over the years on how scary the blessed thing is, I couldn't find myself even turning a hair. Simply put, Wilde was a comedian, albeit a bitter, misanthropic comedian. The man didn't have it in him to write horror the way the Jameses (M. R. or Henry, take your pick) or Poe did. (Though one should note that none of those three acknowledged masters of nineteenth-century horror ever produced what we would consider, today, a novel-length work of horror, whereas Wilde did; Poe's only novel was a fantasy, while the longest works of James one and James two are both novelettes.) So if you go into it expecting a horror novel, you may well find yourself disappointed. If you look at it, however, as yet another exposition of the incredible strengths of Oscar Wilde's creativity--the biting satire, the homosexuality so repressed it's half-erotic when someone stands up from a table, the rampant quotability--then like everything else the man ever wrote, &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em> will be right up your alley. It contains some of Wilde's most-recognized one-liners (\\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\", \\"If the cave-man had known how to laugh, history would have been different\\", \\"It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting.\\", and dozens of others), some thoroughly entertaining characters, a plot as old as time itself bent to Wilde's indomitable will, and any number of good, solid laugh-out-loud moments. It also, of course, comes with an excellent backstory that inspired Wilde's most important one-liner of all: \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written.\\" Needless to say, were this not the former, there wouldn't have been such an uproar over it, would there? ***"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The book \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", written by Oscar Wilde, deals with the issue of getting old and the question of how you want to live your life. In my opinion the book is a typical book from Oscar Wilde which shows the difficulties and the pressures in the community. Oscar Wilde is a critical author who always writes about his own point of view. Furthermore you can also learn about his personality and the society this time.I think that the Picture of Dorian Gray represents the wish from every person to stay young and beautiful with all the opportunities and chances, waiting for you to grab them. Also the second chance and the possibillity to change is a facility which is usually offered to the youth.Also the end is a perfect rounding which brings all topics and themes together to one point. And as Oscar Wilde shows in his opinion, the point is not how you look, it is more how you lived and what you did. At least the ending says that when you die,you die as the person you were and it does not matter who you pretend you are.The story of Dorian Gray is in my opinion a very gripping book which did not leave me until I finished it. And even then it makes me think about these things. Oscar Wilde's writing is very fast-moving and there are no long or boring scences in the book.Bringing all considerations together I have to say that I enjoyed the book very much, which is why I have read it in only three hours."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's color commentary on the tug of war between Basil Hallward (good) and Lord Henry Wotton (evil--think Wormwood in C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters). The rope they pull is the young Dorian Gray. The score in this classic battle is widely known; in the end Wotton pulls Gray completely to his end of the field with Hallward dragged face-down in the mud. For those who have not read it, I will not reveal the absolute ending.Several themes apply to us all: the high price of pleasure and self-indulgence as a way of life; the absurdity of our superficial preoccupation with outward beauty; and how idolizing appearances blinds us to the truth."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"What would a portrait of your soul look like?More than anything else, this question beats at the heart of this thought provoking book.For Oscar Wilde, his alter ego Dorian Gray would not be too pretty.As the book demonstrates, years of sin ultimately rob Gray of his youthful beauty. But, consistent with a wish made by Gray, this theft occurs only a canvas copy of him made by an adoring male artist when Gray was still young.While it would seem that eternal youth is a great prize, especially to the very vain Gray, it ends up becoming a curse. Gray locks the aging picture away in an attic only periodically returning to it to witness the ravages that would have been visited upon him were he not to have made his wish.In this way, while Gray is permitted to retain his external beauty, he's also forced to witness his moral deterioration.As with the more contemporary Angels in America, self reproach over one's homosexuality moves deeply along the subcurrents of this book. Though most don't know it, homosexuality was prohibited by law in Great Britain until 1967 and those convicted of it were forced into harsh punishments and even harsher treatments intended to \\"cure\\" them.It's this deeper sense that most people resonate with in one way or another...substituting their own private sins for those of Gray in their estimation of their moral appearance.Having said all that, it still prompts consideration that Gray himself and his friend Lord Henry -- sinful that they are -- are the most interesting characters in this book. Unintentionaly (perhaps), Wilde is suggesting that it's our sins that make us noteworthy."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This is a review for the Penguin Classics hardcover edition of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", ISBN: 0141442468. Amazon.com, despite its general excellence, fails to take into account the bibliophile for whom the quality of the edition he determines to purchase matters, so, this is not a review for the intellectual content of the volume I have recently bought, but, rather, a review of the quality of this particular volume's production.I had hoped, that Penguin had finally decided to market its considerable store of intellectual wealth to those who desire a book of some distinction, to those who still admire the craftsmanship of a finely wrought tome. Largely, in this edition (and in those others, similar to it) they have succeeded. The cloth covers of these editions are attractively designed; the typesetting modern, attractive, and readable; the cloth marker a thoughtful edition. However--and this is a thing unabidable--the binding is glued and does not have signatures. Sewn signatures are a sign that some care has been taken to ensure the longevity of a book.

He befriends an artist named Basil, and at first Basil uses Dorian as a model for paintings, putting him into classical scenes. Eventually, however, he decides to paint a portrait of Dorian as he truly is. Around the same time, Dorian befriends one of Basil's acquaintances, Henry, and Henry makes Dorian more cynical and jaded. When Dorian finally sees the portrait Basil has painted, he weeps and wishes that he would remain young, and the portrait would age in his place. When his wish comes true, Dorian will go to murderous lengths to keep the secret.Sometimes, a girl just needs a little bit of the classics in her life. Thank goodness Amazon offers a wide variety of public domain books available for free Kindle download. This was my first foray into Wilde, and I wonder how different of an experience reading his work in his own time would have been. To me, the homoerotic undertones leap from the page, but I wonder how much of that was intentional on his part, and how much of that is me being influenced by what we know of Wilde himself. Regardless, there is something sensually sinister about the interactions of the men in this book. And while most of them do have relations with women, very few seem to value or enjoy female interactions at all.I very much enjoyed this dark, cautionary tale of a wanna be Narcissus. It did take me a while to get into the pacing of the more classical language and writing style, having been reading a lot more modern books lately, but once I was about a third of the way through the book I literally devoured it. I know Wilde did not write as prolifically as some classical writers, but I believe I will be seeking out some of his other works.I could not help but feel some pity for Dorian Gray. He became exactly what everyone groomed him to be, then everyone scorned him for being what they had wanted him to be in the first place. Someone needs to get this book to Lindsay Lohan as soon as possible, she may find it familiar. Which make me wonder, with all the modernizations and mash ups of classic literature out there, why hasn't anyone done anything with this story? It seems to me that it could be redone with a modern twist, or vampires or something really well if the right person did it. Of course, if the wrong person did it, it would be wretched, so maybe it is best left alone."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This novel is one of the best classics available.

And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an \`immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a \`spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"With today's slippery morals and exhausting vanity, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an eerie comparison to &quot;then&quot; and now. There are many interesting scenes in the book that make this book very exciting. It is about a man who, upon receiving a portrait of himself, is so upset that it will &quot;mock&quot; him with it's permanent beauty, while he will age and decay. He makes a wish that he will remain young and beautiful and the picture will age and take his sins for him. In the end, though he is beautiful on the outside, he is horrendous on the outside.Definitely a good read for high school students. It's interesting and short, and not as cumbersome as other Romantic novels can be. You can relate it to today's times and it is not a hard read. I did not want to read ANY Romantic novels but I am very happy that I chose this one! And you will be, too!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This book offers its readers a chance to understand the meaning of true beauty and the reason why time passes the way that it does. If you enjoy really good quotes that make you think, this is a great book for you. It made me think of ideas and concepts that I had never thought about before. Some reviews of novels say they could &quot;never put the book down.&quot; But what happens when the book is over and it goes on the shelf? I would like to hope that, with this book, the wheels in my head will keep turning, and I will continue to think about the concepts it brought up, and apply it to my own life. I think you will do the same if you read this novel by Oscar Wilde"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Oscar Wilde tries to argue in the prologue of this book that literature, as a form of art, is not moralistic and that people therefore should not treat it as such.In all honesty, however, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an extremely moral book; it's just hard to decide what exactly the moral is. The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it. A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I absolutely loved the novel written by Oscar Wilde, The Picture Of Dorian Gray. When I was beginning the novel it was a little slow and even a little dry. But, as the plot thickened and the story went on, I can say it is one of my most favorite books ever read. Dorian Gray, the main character, is obsessed with his good looks and his youth. Gray sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. But his close friend who is an artist paints a portrait of Gray. As the years pass Gray doesn't age but the picture does. His conscious and eternal youth ends up becoming well ........ You'll have to read to find out.People most likely to read and enjoy this novel would probably be late teens and older. Mainly because it has a lot to do with being young and having all the time in the world to do whatever and learn and experience so much. It also is a little bit harder to read for someone younger. I would really recommend this novel to everyone. The story is great and has a little bit of everything in it."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Rod Stewert once sang that &quot;every picture tells a story&quot;, and in no case is this more true than of one Dorian Gray. By now everyone knows that young Dorian makes a childish wish that a beautiful portrait of his should age in his stead, and that he should remain forever young and vibrant, and somehow this wish is granted. What follows is a tale of increasing debauchery and depravity that poison a man's soul, while leaving no visible clue upon his face.This is not the most entertaining or gripping novel that you will ever read. Far from it, in fact, but the real merits of the novel come not from the action and plot, but from the extremely clever dialogue and the shredding social commentary. (not surprisingly, this novel took a long time to get published, and was later used as evidence against Wilde during his trial for indecency) Wilde takes several shots at the aristocracy, especially their values, as well as art itself, hedonism, and the very concept of morality.Perhaps the finest aspect of the novel are Wilde's quotes, often through his favorite mouthpiece: Lord Henry Wotton. Henry serves as a goad to Dorian through all of his excesses, and he waxes philosophical upon almost any subject that he can get anyone to listen to. He's wonderful and horrible all at once, and best of all, he doesn't even believe half of what he says. This is definitely a 'classic' novel, and well worth the read. Again, if you're expecting high paced action you'd probably best look elsewhere, but if you're in the mood to think a bit, then chances are you'll enjoy &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book. This has got to be Wilde's most personal work, one can tell from the writing itself that Wilde really put himself into these pages or maybe what he wanted to become. The tale of Dorian and the tale of Wilde have the same kind of \\"tragic ending\\" to it. Wilde's downfall of being accused of homosexuality and Dorian no longer being able to bear the pain of his acts and conducts bring tragic endings to their lives. I think that every person has or has had for a certain amount of time the wish to stay forever young and beautiful, the burden of time not affecting you at all but something else, in Dorian's case, it was the painting, anyways I'm rambling on and on, do read this book, it's 2:00 am right now and I have a Physics exam tomorrow, today actually, anyway, do read it, it's enjoyable, funny, touching and everything else that a good novel should be."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY has enough going for it to retain its classic status for some time to come. It is loaded with epigrammic sentences by a writer who continues to hold interest. Its concept was highly original and has inspired generations of science fiction, fantasy and horror literature since its debut. Wilde stows a lot of his themes and notes on society and character into its pages, so that it often reads like a stack of dispatches from the late 19th century. The dinner party scenes are priceless. It is certainly worth reading in order to understand why Dorian Gray has entered our language, so often alluded to.While possessing the above traits, the novel does have its flaws that are more pronounced under the glare of contemporary light. Wilde's bigotry shows through. Some of the passages are melodramatic and wooden. Dorian Gray's physical beauty is a work of art, and as Wilde says at the outset, all art is useless. However much he embodies many of Wilde's ideas, he remains rather vapid, even when he is at his most corrupt. Part of that is due to the fact that many of the actions that condemn him are only spoken of or hinted at. Mostly we see the highlights, the suicide of a young girl to whom he was unjustly cruel and some subsequent deaths."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The pompous words of Harry and the ego of Dorian fill the pages with quotable prose and vividly divine images."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Turned out great!

The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \\"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book.

Of the three main characters we have; Dorian Gray, who is a brainless puppet the personifies vanity; Basil Hallward, the artist who painted the fabled portrait and represents the sorrowful conscience; and Lord Henry Wolton, who is the quintessential 19th Century fop whose sole purpose in the book is to act as Wilde's voice on politics, religion and homosexuality and as a driving corrupter of everyone else in the book.The pacing is horrendously slow, the chapters devoted to explaining Gray's hobbies and the pictures of his ancestors in his hallway don't help with the lousy pacing. The whole story could have been condensed to a 30 page novella and would have been enjoyable.And, as a side note to the posthumous Mr. Wilde, forty is not old and hideous."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This novel is a philosophy book about the author's narcissistic anti-Victorian views and clever witticisms.

Bad moral."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Though this book was well written, Oscar Wilde fails in his attempt to glorify aestheticism, and in fact condemns it, and thus condemns himself. It was hardly surprising that following the publication of this book, the authorities sought to have him arrested for homosexuality. If aestheticism is embodied by Lord Henry, Henry is a despicable character, whose philosophies sound not only juvenile and sophistic, but ignorant due to his lack of practicing what he preached. He didn't act out his hedonistic, immoral theories, only Dorian behaved that way, and when doing so brought torment, shame, and guilt upon himself. And to preface the book with &quot;All art is quite useless&quot;? That makes no sense, since the picture was the most useful, significant, meaningful thing in life. Was Wilde's goal to declare his own dear philosophies completely worthless? If so, he succeeded, but I am much more impressed by someone who sets out to justify his philosophies rather than someone who sets out to debunk them."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I love the classics and somehow this one escaped my attention until now. I wish only that it hadescaped my attention forever. This rambling book of boring, sexually unstable rich people with nothing better to dowith their lives than look at pretty Dorian (because, Dorian is very pretty), and insult the commoners who have no rank or class,is tedious, boring and a complete waste of time.Dorian has his portrait painted while the painter and another man oogle him and tell him how pretty he is.The painter said his life was not complete until pretty Dorian came to sit for him.Dorian is very pretty..Dorian wishes he could stay young and pretty and that the painting would age instead of him.,,.. because he's young and prettyand men and women alike tell him how pretty he is.Dorian gets his wish and then the book ignores all his issues and goes off into the prose land of mushrooms.We next see Dorian decades later, the painting is hideous but Dorian is pretty. All his sins have left him pretty and the painting ugly.What happened in that time span is not told.Dorian is pretty.There is zero character developement and by the end I was just hoping everyone character in the book would die.Even Dorian, who is very pretty. We do not not know him, or the painter and have only a glimpse of the life of thethird main character in the book. He thinks Dorian is pretty too.*****************Spoiler Alert*****************I guessed the end about 1/3rd of the way through, I only missed that I figured Dorian (he, who is pretty) would torch the painting insteadof stabbing it.*****************End Spoiler Alert*****************I'm sure all the world is aflutter because of the daring topics discussed, or not discussed as it wasn't in this book. For its time period, I guessit would be shocking. Dorian, however, is still very pretty and that remains regardless of when this book was written.So, I hear this is only an edited version and somewhere out there is the REAL version, and it is oh so much better, but, nothing could savethis travesty of words. I wasted enough time with these pathetic characters (and author) although I think Dorian is still very pretty according to everyone.I'm only glad I read it on my Kindle so a tree didn't die in printing this boring book. However, if a tree was cut for your book rest assured, the tree would be happy because Dorian is very pretty!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I have recently read this book as part of my A-level syllabus and found it little more than an excuse for Wilde to voice his egotistical and condemnatory views of Victorian society. The storyline is faintly interesting but is ruined by Wilde's constant attack on Women."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"There isn't much to say about Wilde's masterpiece that hasn't been said already. Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man.

His life becomes one of increasing debauchery and narcissism.The most quotable of authors, Wilde uses a friend of the young man to deliver an endless collection of axioms and witty observations that add another dimension to the plot.As Gray becomes more convinced of his invincibility he grows more callous toward others and his actions become less human and more monstrous as the story progresses."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Am I no less agreeable?

He wishes that he--not the painting--will remain forever young and beautiful, while the painting ages and decays. Dorian's wish comes true and it is the painting that not only shows his age, but also all his sins. Oscar Wilde crafted not only a brilliant horror novel, but also a treatise on art and reality. Despite the claims of Lord Henry, art does reveal the truths of life. The painting reveals the true soul of Dorian Gray. When Dorian's beloved actress discovers true love (not the dramatic imitation), she is no longer able to participate in the elevated dramas on the stage. Then she loses Dorian's love. A book is what fully corrupts Dorian and causes him to live a life of sin. This is a story of the inability to bring truth and art together.

Wilde's generates idle irreverent amoral and bitingly sarcastic dialogue as if out of thin air."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a masterpiece of English literature from the 1800's. It's easy to see why the book aroused so much controversy when it was released, and why it had an integral role in Wilde's subsequent imprisonment: the moral dilemna the book presents is disturbing even today. Wilde was truly a great writer; it's obvious from reading this book. Not only was his wit top-notch as is often ackwnoledged, but his prose is very smooth and polished, very refined. Wilde's attitudes towards art are well-known - indeed, he says in the book's introduction that \\"all art is quite useless\\" - but it seems obvious now that he was a natural talent. I hesitate to say things like He was meant to be a writer, but it certainly seems true of Wilde. This is one of the books that shakes our moral foundations. Wilde's high-class lifestyle is well-documented - it seems his surname was utterly appropriate - and one can definitely see where the plot and perhaps some of the details of this book came from his own experience. Undoubtedly, the main premise of the novel - a man selling his soul for eternal youth - most likely sprung from a desire that Wilde himself expressed. Perhaps he was having doubts about his hedonistic lifestyle even when this book was written, several years before his imprisonment. One can conjecture all one wants, but the fact remains that this book is a marvelous piece of work. The wonderful, polished prose is a joy to read - with aphorisms abound - and I, for one, see it as a deep regret that this was the only novel Wilde ever wrote. We missed out on a lot of great literature, especially with the general disdain the plays are now looked upon with in our society. Alas, read this masterpiece, and you will miss out less."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since. It's rich and compelling words are fantastically written and portyayed in the mind frightfully real and visual. Oscar Wilde is one of my all-time favourite writers and I congratulate his excellence of writing and choice of description. After his two year sentence on Abnormal Sexual Vice his career literaly ended but even though he is gone, his writing is still fresh, enjoyable, and always a favourite."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"&quot;Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist...&quot; says Oscar Wilde's Basil Hallward - and every book is the author's autobiography. Wilde provides an irresistible coupling of his fascinating wisdom and seductive voice in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, a self-portrait.In a story of forbidden love, Wilde languishes in an idyllic setting eager with curous onlookers whom he delights in stimulating. He insists upon being provocative and alluring, taking 'strange pleausre in saying things that he is not sorry about having said.' THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is an image drawn by a lover whose passion for realism is transcended only by the hands of a writer who leaves everything to your imagination. As Dorian Gray protests, &quot;Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to.&quot;But this IS a book about thinking - and deeply. A book that fathoms the deep erotic recesses of the human heart and speaks its language perfectly."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Dorian Gray was definately an excellent book, although the wording was somewhat outdated. It is an excellent piece of work, but I just had one question about it. Do you really think it was all Dorian's fault that everything happened? I believe Dorian's horrid fate would never have existed if Lord Henry had not been introduced to him. Lord Henry put outrageous ideas into an innocent litte head, and should be noticed as the fault of all of Gray's actions. It just killed me that no one realized what was really happening! But besides that question of fault, it was a grade A book, that I would read again, but not without a dictionary by my side. I recommend it to anyone who likes intelectual reading, and who is willing to sit through outdated talk. Just go for it, it's worth your time, and better yet... it's a short novel!"},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"A tale of beuty, love, innocence and cruelty. Wilde did a wonderful job of telling the story of young Dorian Gray, a timeless beuty that never shows his age and whose face never displays his sins. He betrays close friends, is fuel for many a suicide, is down right cruel and unfeeling to any of his numerous loves, is selfish and self immersed; yet his young, beutiful face never shows a trace of ill being. Being in a room with him, drowns anyone with pleasure, peacefulness and charm- it is impossible to look at his face and believe that someone so sweet and innocent in looks would commit any of the evil he is rumored to have done. Instead of himself being affected, a portait of him as a young man endures the strain of his uncouth behavior.This timeless tale, set in England at the turn of the century, would be an excellent story line for any modern novel and would make a wonderful movie. Wilde's writting style is proliferic, poignant and delightful. It captures the language of the time period, yet was easy to read and easy to relate to. Wilde conveys the evil of the aestetic world and how it can drive one to stop at nothing for fear of losing it. And though he hints at such controversial topics such as drugs and homosexuality; it is neither detailed nor graphic; and is only slightly touched on. Throughout the novel, Wilde creates an image and lets the reader fully develop it for himself. I absolutley adored this book and highly reccomend it to anyone. Not for a moment did I think it dull, or too wordy. It is a very easy read (which is difficult to say of such a classic), and incredibly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"This book fits Wilde's description of a cigarette as a perfect pleasure - portable and brief, yet leaving you unsatisfied. Like Dorian Gray himself, this book is superficially charming, with its numerous and clever epigrams, but with some very ugly undercurrents, e.g. virulent anti-semitism, misogyny, and homosexuality. We never connect emotionally with Dorian Gray, who never matures into a complex or interesting character, but remains as some gay ideal with psychosis. Read Henry James' &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; or Edith Wharton's &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; for a far better written, devastating attack on Victorian morals and hypocrisy."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The definition of &quot;classic&quot; is something timeless and universal; this book is neither. It does ask some &quot;deep&quot; questions but it doesn't make you really care about the answers; the characters are one-dimensional and transparent. It's hard to seriously relate to any of them, or this story. The writers' language is beautiful in a flowery way. If you want a feel for the book, read the intro/prelude; there are some interesting statements Wilde makes about &quot;ART&quot;. Otherwise, don't bother. There's only so much of art-imitates-life-life-imitates-art you can take."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Unfortunately I didn't like this classic story for many reasons. I downloaded theFree Kindle versionand read about half of it. I finished the story by listening to the Librivox audiobook recording using thefree smartphone app.I found Lord Henry to be quite unlikeable. His statements were absurd, contradictory, and got old quickly. Here are some loose quotes... \\"The only things that are necessary are those that are truly unnecessary.\\" He had MANY of those and I saw them coming when only three words of a sentence were out of his mouth. \\"I find people infinitely fascinating.\\" Which he quickly followed up with something like, \\"I pay no attention to people at all.\\" I believe Wilde was trying to paint a pompous, egotistical fool and he did a great job. It made me dislike the character greatly.The story was not balanced well. We started out by meeting Dorian and quickly jumped ahead through years and years of his life. There was very little build up of tension. Chapter nine was completely painful to go through. Did we need to read, in long, boring detail, about textiles and gems?My biggest complaint - various evil deeds and adventures are eluded to, but not shown to us. Dorian's actions are key to the concept of this story, but they are told to us at a distance and with very little feeling. Authors hear often that they are to show, not tell the reader what is happening. Chapter after chapter told us, in only vague hints, what kinds of things Dorian was up to. We skip over incidents very quickly. Some are just a word or two in a sentence. I realize that The Picture of Dorian Gray was written in an era when prostitution, drug use, and vile acts couldn't be written about in detail, but it could have been done so much better.This story reminds me ofThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They both have themes of - Be careful what you wish for. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was also written at a time when sadistic endeavors and deviant sexual practices couldn't be written in detail. Stevenson succeeded where Wilde failed. I felt Mr. Hyde's strength and power. I could see the lust and greed. Wilde didn't bring any believability to this story."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"Informative, deep analyis and fascinating to see Wilde's own annotations in the text. Highly recommended for a closer look at a classic."},{"Title":"The picture of Dorian Gray,","review":"The essence of the book can be summed up when Dorian Grey wishes that his portrait to age, get old and decay but he should remain young and beautiful for ever! He not only accomplishes it but convinces others to this remarkable feat. He is so conceited, self absorbed and without any conscious that after he murders his true friend, he goes to bed and has a good night sleep. Dorian Grey is one of the most bizarre charecters in literature. I guess we all have a little bit of Dorian Grey in us at times, hopefully in small doses. Lord Henry, the quick witted,brilliant companion is none other than Oscar Wilde. Aremarkable book. If it were written today, there would be lot ofcontroversy as the male charecters bond so freely. Oscar Wilde himself was accused of homosexual act and was sent to jail fortwo years. He left England and moved to France where he died at avery young age.
