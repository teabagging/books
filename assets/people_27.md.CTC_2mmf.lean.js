Hamza studied in American graduate schools, and was summoned back to teach in Iraq as a way of paying off his university debts. When invited in 1972 to join the nascent Iraqi nuclear effort, Hamza did so with some enthusiasm, thinking this would be a wonderful professional challenge and not taking seriously the prospect of an actual bomb. In addition to Hamza's talent as a scientist and scholar, his finely-tuned ability to stay out of trouble quickly became apparent and he began a long march through the bureaucracy. By 1981, he was working directly for Saddam Husayn and by 1987 he served as director general of the Nuclear Weapon Program. This high stature inevitably brought the scientist head-turning benefits - a high salary, travel to the West, fancy cars, even a residence located within Saddam Husayn's presidential compound. \\"All that loot was softening me up, I don't deny it,\\" Hamza admits. With time, however, an absorbing intellectual venture turned into a descent into Stalinist hell. Finally, Hamza fully woke to his situation (\\"I had sold out for a Mercedes\\") and in 1994 managed to escape from Iraq, settling a year later in the United States.Although Saddam's Bombmaker is a well-written memoir (kudos to co-author Stein), it contains important information on two quite distinct topics of current interest: life at the highest levels of Iraqi regime and the inner workings of the Iraqi nuclear weapons project. It is hard to say which is scarier. Life in Saddam's court is morbidly fascinating. We learn about his paranoia about germs, his taste for virgins, and his personal penchant for brutality. As for the nukes, Hamza shows how, after an initial period (1972-81) of heavy dependence on imported technology, the Iraqis rethought their program, put twenty-five times more resources in it, and built \\"a crude, one-and-a-half ton nuclear device\\" by 1990."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"This book is not overly technical.

Also he claims that he was forced to return to Iraq and work on Saddam's bomb program but his description sounds more the story of a young nuclear scientist fresh out of school looking to advance to the top in his field rather than being a helpless conscript forced to contribute to a rogue nation's nuclear program.

Hamza is an MIT-educated Iraqi physicist known to have worked in Iraq's nuclear program for several years. Upon his defection he claimed to possess the most intimate secrets of Iraq's nuclear weapons program.But Hamza's credibility has been challenged. In the late 1980s, Hamza is known to have left Iraq's nuclear program to become a procurement agent for Saddam's regime. And despite his claim to have been the head of Iraq's nuclear program and to have worked specifically on weaponization, no evidence besides his own testimony has been adduced to support either of these claims. International Atomic Energy Agency documents, for instance, recognized Hamza as a participant in Iraq's nuclear program, but acknowledged someone else as its head.Scott Ritter, UNSCOM team leader from 1991-1998, has repeatedly challenged Hamza to a debate on Hamza's claims and credibility. But Hamza has refused. Ritter reports that the major cache of documents on Iraq's nuclear program, discovered by UNSCOM in 1991, suggests that Hamza was at best a bit player in the program - the documents make no mention of him. Hamza's claims also, according to Ritter, contradict those of other defectors whose reliability can be confirmed.Even the organization at which he has been based since his defection, the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), has found inconsistencies in Hamza's claims. In the introduction to &quot;Iraq's Efforts to Acquire Information about Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear-Related Technologies from the United States,&quot; a work based on interviews with Hamza, ISIS noted that Hamza's reports were &quot;deficient in several ways&quot; and that his interviews contained &quot;several inconsistencies.&quot; When these problems were pointed out to him, according to ISIS, &quot;Hamza failed to respond to comments by us on his draft report or to address the transcript inconsistencies.&quot;Because Khidhir Hamza has not presented external evidence for his claims, his personal credibility is the central issue in assessing these claims. Why then does he not accept the challenge to defend his credibility against the objections raised by Scott Ritter and others?Hamza's claims should be taken with a pinch - if not a bucket - of potassium iodide."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"from PUBLISHERS WEEKLY, October 16, 2000*:&quot;[The authors] keen sense of pacing (balancing personal memoir with political history) and clear and vivid writing serve to indict Iraq under Saddam, painting a detailed and convincing portrait of what it's like to live in a country under a violent dictator where there is no viable opposition or independent judiciary. . .Hamza recalls colleagues who were tortured and killed, and doctors weeping as they told him of being forced to watch the killings of Shiites, who Saddam feared politically, or the gassing of Kurds, designed both to eliminate this minority and to test biological weapons. . .Forecast: Hamza was featured in an article in the New York Times Magazine on Oct. 2 and this book will get widely reviewed.

Iraq has nothing close to this.\\"To this I say: North Korea, Pakistan, India (and coming soon, Iran) -- and ??? In this I do not mean to disparage the countries named, but they clearly do not fall within that reviewers idea of a highly developed industrialized \\"Big 5\\" nation. What Iraq was not able to develop on its own, it WAS able to buy.And that last is really one of the main themes of this book. The ability of Iraq to buy, and the willingness of others to sell, everything that Iraq needs -- for a price. This brought to mind Bernard Lewis's accounts in \\"Islam and the West\\" in which the West was more than willing to sell modern arms to Islamic states in the distant past. But I digress.Dr. Hamzah portrays/is portrayed as a man caught up in a combination of greed, ego, and fear. He was finally able to extricate himself and his family (and his accounts of his difficulties dealing with the CIA do not bode well for the future). His description of how easily he was ensnared in this gilded cage, one step at a time, is truly a cautionary tale.At the same time, his detailed description of how a rogue state can go about obtaining the necessary ingredients for a nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction) weapon is dismaying to say the least. But at least it takes a LOT of money.The one element that did not ring true (for me)was Dr. Hamza's description of his poker playing. He clearly knows very little about poker, and writing of his exploits as someone who does (even marginally) gave me pause. But it is more along the lines of grandiosity than outright fabrication. And that is perhaps the best way to approach this book. Accept that Dr. Hamza (for various reasons) puffs himself up a bit -- but that is also what made him more susceptible to Saddam's enticementsWell worth reading if you want to understand how Iraq could get a weapons program going, and maintain it in secrecy despite attempts to uncover it.

First,it's a riveting account of life inside Saddam Hussein's Iraq, a country run on fear, and a chilling look at his campaign to develop nuclear weapons -- an arsenal that he intends to use someday.But the book is also a deeply personal story of Dr. Hamza's journey out of madness. This is a fascinating tale, rich in detail, about his evolution from the dictator's most important scientist to a whistleblowing defector whose warnings about Saddam's plans are only now gaining the audience they deserve. But no dry academic tome or meditative memoir here -- this is a well-written, fast-paced thriller with a surprising twist or turn around every corner. The account of Hamza's flight to freedom, complete with dueling dissident groups, bumbling secret agents and dangerous border crossings, fairly crackles off the page and by itself is worth the price of admission.One other point: another reviewer in these pages expressed some skepticism about Dr. Hamza's story. This was more than a little puzzling. Dr. Hamza has been vetted by the CIA, the Pentagon and the State Department, all of which have attested to his bona fides. I wonder whether Dr. Hamza, having survived the terrors of Saddam's regime and lived to tell his story, will now face an assault on his credibility from sources whose own motives are open to question.All in all, a great read that you'll think about -- and talk about -- long after the book is back on the shelf."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"Wow, what a page-turner, and timely too.

Saddam's personal, criminal disregard for human life is made very plain. The reader can get closer to the man than he might otherwise care to through this book.It also gives us a remarkable story of personal courage.

The account of Hamzah's involvement in Saddam's attempt to develop a nuclear weapon is fascinating, but even at that is not the most interesting part of this book. Much more engrossing are the insider accounts of Saddam's pyschotic rule and the appalling depredations he has unleashed on his people. Particularly terrifying is the account of Saddam using his own government officials to unleash a horrific purge where officials were forced to kill one another to prove their loyalty. Hamzah's makes clear that not only has Saddam ruined Iraq economically, he has made so many in Iraq amoral government stooges. Even as his people starve, Hamzah observes that billions continue to be poured into Saddam's nuclear program, to say nothing of the building of more and more palaces for Saddam. Hamzah makes clear that Iraq is a nation led by a psychopath.More interesting even still is the utterly gripping tale of Hamzah's harrowing escape from Saddam's sick grasp. The chapters dealing with Hamzah's sojourn in Libya are both poignant and suspensful as the reader is left to guess how Hamzah can possibly escape the jeopardy he found himself in there as well as how he would extract his family from Iraq. This nightmarish dillema will have you on the edge of your seat.At the same time, it is discouraging to see the way in which the CIA so cavilierly and insensitvely dealt with Hamzah and his family. The US nearly lost an invaluable intelligence asset, to say nothing of being rather careless with the man's life and that of his family. It is similarly discouraging to see how badly UN inspectors have been duped by Saddam and how mislead we all were about the extent of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction program. It is also disturbing to see the willingness with which some nations assisted Saddam in his weapons program, including some in this nation, and that many of these same governments are again rushing headlong into taking the pressure off Saddam, all for the sake of making a buck. Hopefully the new presidential administration in this country will deal more aggressively and perceptively to prevent Saddam from getting the bomb and re-arming himself.I rated the book with four stars mainly because it bogs down a little towards the middle in describing the details of Hamzah's deal making on trips abroad to procure weapons components. I suppose this section is necessary to establish Hamzah's bona fides since we can see some are trying to mislead us into belieiving Hamzah was not extensively involved in Saddam's nuclear program. They likely are spreading such deception on Saddam's behalf as part of Saddam's craven disinformation campaign. Anyone with common sense can see that Hamzah's detailed account could only have been written by someone at the center of Saddam's nuclear program.Otherwise Hamzah's book is a can't put down thriller that will keep you on edge and engrossed. It will also leave you with a thorough appreciation for the freedoms we enjoy and the ability to live free of terror as well as the need to be ever vigilante against meglomaniacs in our own country who would attempt to seize power not granted them (Remember, Saddam was also vice president of his country when he illegally seized his current office.)"},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"Khidr' Abd al-\`Abbas Hamza (or Khidhir Hamza, as he is widely known) is one of the few high-ranking Iraqi defectors to have escaped from the repressive authoritarian regime of Saddam Hussein. In exchange for US sanctuary, Hamza gave US government and CIA officials valuable information into the workings of Iraq's ambiguous and secluded bomb and chemical warfare programs. Hamza's revelations first appeared as an article in the journal \\"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\\" (Vol. 54, No. 5, September/October 1998). In the present memoir, he has expanded his statements and given a fuller account of his life and work in Iraq until he defected in 1994. The revelations he discloses are chilling and certainly prove that Saddam Hussein will continue to remain a menace so long as he (and his Baathist Party) remains entrenched in Iraq, for Hamza's warning is that Saddam is capable and would use the bomb if he was so inclined to do so. Hamza's memoir reads most certainly like \\"a white-knuckled thriller,\\" with all the earmarks of espionage - only this time such accounts are reality.Khidhir Hamza was a doctor of nuclear physics, having received his doctorate in this field from Florida State University. He was also trained at MIT, the prestigious institute. In 1969, under the pressure of (indirectly) Saddam, who was not quite in full power of Iraq, Hamza was forced to give up his life in the US and return to Baghdad to repay the government for their payment of his education abroad, under the threat that his father would be tortured if he refused. Hamza, like any other loyal followers of Saddam, was lavishly rewarded with big houses, prestige and plenty of Mercedes' for his role in constructing a nuclear bomb (which began in 1971), which came close to success had it not been for the summer 1990 invasion of Kuwait that offset its completion.Hamza evidently has much to discuss when it comes to the inner workings and life of the privileged inside Saddam's Iraq. While loyalists were rewarded, any slight signs of independence was met with severe torture and imprisonment, as Hamza learned from several close colleagues. He describes Saddam's personal life and ways, often fringing on dementia. Saddam apparently has a taste for Scotch whiskey, flies into searing temper-tantrums and has a paranoid fear of germs. Ironically enough, following the end of the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam had chemical weapons buried in areas of the vast Iraqi desert where allied forces would inevitably find them and destroy them, unleashing lethal spores of germs on themselves...and on Iraqi citizens, indefinitely contaminating soil where spores would thrive. The ruthlessness of Saddam's regime is evident in Hamza's memoirs, making it all the more believable that Iraq under Saddam does constitute what George W. Bush would call an \\"axis of evil.\\"Physicists and science-buffs will likewise find this work fascinating, as Hamza describes his role in the nuclear and biological weapons agenda, often giving details as to how components for a bomb were constructed and obtained. Criminal collusion on the part of many other countries - France, Germany, the US, Russia, Poland, Yugoslavia, to name only a few - is also made clear in Hamza's memoirs, as Saddam's reliance on foreign intelligence and technology in his agenda is striking because it was and still remains his weakness. Yet at the time, no one took notice, even though it was obvious that the dual-use components Iraq was receiving was only going toward the construction of weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, responsibility for the threat Saddam poses is largely the result of forces outside Iraq.In the current US-led war on terrorism, Iraq has been cited as a possible - and very likely - future target. It will probably bear the same treatment as Afghanistan when it was purged of the Taliban regime. But bombing Iraq \\"into submission\\" is no viable solution, as it has never worked in stopping Saddam's nuclear program; it has only slowed down his efforts. Up to the tragic terror attacks of September 11, 2001, this was US (and British) policy on \\"containment\\" of Iraq's harmful potential. It remains to be seen what the future has in store for this hot spot, but Hamza's proposal, like his memoirs, is illuminating and serves as a much-needed eye-opener: sponsor a brain-drain operation and make it possible for the hundreds of other scientists to get out of Iraq. \\"Stripped of his brain trust, Saddam would no longer be able to build and maintain his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction\\" (p. 330).In the meantime, policy-makers and citizens of the world alike should read the memoirs of Dr. Khidhir Hamza, a tale not only of the horrific workings of an efficient military dictatorship, but also a tale of morals, risk, sacrifice and personal courage, all of which is to be commended."},{"Title":"The incredible life story of Sister Elena Aiello ;: The Calabrian holy nun (1895-1961)","review":"What will most strike you about the life of Sister Elena Aiello is her charity (meaning caring) for other persons.

It has a magical feel to it that really will intrigue the child as well as the adult. It is perfect for girl or boy readers because of its classic fairy tale storyline. Loved it, and so did my son!"},{"Title":"The Tale of Tsar Saltan","review":"In the first few decades of the 19th Century, the great Russian Poet Alexander Pushkin wrote a number of fairy stories in verse, among them a gem called The Tale of Tsar Saltan. The story has remained popular for nearly two hundred years, and was staged as an opera in 1900 by Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov. However, few American children have had the pleasure of hearing or reading this beloved Russian story.Dial Books has adapted an English version of the tale from a translation by Pauline Hejl, and illuminated it with illustrations by the Russian-born artist Gennady Spirin.Tsar Saltan is a mini-epic that begins with three sisters, the youngest of whom marries the Tsar himself. Her sisters become jealous of her, however; and when she gives birth to a son, the Prince Guidon, her sisters arrange to have mother and child sealed up in a barrel and cast into the sea. Fortunately, an enchanted swan appears who helps the castaways to reclaim their lives.Spirin's luminous illustrations are full of energy and detail. At the top of each page is an arc-shaped picture, usually portraying a curved landscape, which usually supports the narration or illustration below. At times it crowns an illustration framed by the shape of a window with an arched top. This device reminds one of traditional Russian iconography, and suits the \\"once upon a time\\" flavor of the story very well. The use of color and texture is quite impressive as well, from the soft quilted and embroidered cloth of the sisters' outfits to the cold steel of the knights' weapons. I found myself staring at the end papers, which show the barrel washing up on the shore of an island in the night - the sand and spray seem to glow through the dark water, as if the island were a candle dispelling the darkness.The Tale of Tsar Saltan makes an excellent bedtime story for young children, and a wonderful addition to anyone's collection of lavishly-illustrated fairy tales."},{"Title":"Love, Love, Love","review":"The pages pour out with emotion!

This is a great book both for both Warhol devotees and for general readers."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas","review":"I don't know, the book is a bit too wordy to read to a class, but it gives me memories of a wonderful TV special.

We used to paint the Charlie Brown characters in a typical setting from the comic strip, on the front windows of our quarters, each of our children choosing which of the character to paint. Therefore, I wanted a book that would give them ideas for a setting and characters to paint in their own homes. This little book was perfect!"},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas","review":"I bought this book for my 4 1/2 year old Snoopy obsessed daughter and she loves it.

For some reason he doesn't get it, at this particular point in time. Luckily, the rest of the Peanuts gang have a bit more of a clue, and then there is the faithful dog Snoopy, to help pull him through the midsummer morass of melancholy he is meandering his mug through."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas","review":"&quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; is one of the greatest television shows of all time, thanks to a classic script by one of the greatest cartoonists of all time.But this book just does not capture its flavor. The art is not by Schulz, and though loyal to his style, does not FEEL like Schulz. Couldn't they have used images from the actual show?Worse, important moments are lost, probably due to space constraints. For instance, Linus's stirring soliloquy, performed solo in the show, here takes place in a crowded room for storytelling purposes.I got this book for an office mate because she loves Schulz and because it was the only color Peanuts book I could find that was in the $5-10 price range dictated by our office Christmas pool.People may well love this book because they love the TV show (and there's nothing wrong with that), but I don't think anyone would ever love it for itself."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas","review":"Pay attention to the reviews on this book - it is not the real thing and fails to capture the magic of the special you saw on TV as a kid. It does clearly state on the title page that this is adapted from the special. I failed to comprehend what that meant. It means the story is abrigded - incredibly abrigded. Unfortunately at the same time it is also wordy. Nothing along the lines of reading the Peanut comic strips. The drawings also look off. Again nothing like the comic strip. A true adaptation of this special would be appropriate for children and adults. This book may work for kids but if you plan to give it to an adult friend to capture the magic of Christmas(as was my intention) don't bother. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas","review":"This book had a great cover and good quality paper for the pages, however the binding was not sturdy. One had to open the book wide to see all of the wording, but doing that created the string-binding to be stretched too much. I could tell that the pages would fall out after just a few readings. I love the story, but wish the binding was more substantial, especially as kids will be reading it."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas","review":"I thought Mr. Schulz's lawyer said \\"no\\" to any depiction of his characters ever to be done by the other artists after his death? As a result, this is a rather pale copy of the original art style and thus it looks a bit weird. So I think I'll go tell the lawyer on Paige Braddock."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas","review":"I love &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; and so was completely disappointed by this paperback book edition of the story.The &quot;By Charles M. Schulz&quot; on the cover and in the listing hides the fact that the text is not by Schulz, but is &quot;adapted&quot; by other people. The text adaptation is painfully bad -- I could barely force myself to read it to my child the other night. The text is way too wordy, which contradicts the whole style of Schulz's comic strip, and changes key dialog of characters.The illustrations are okay, but why not just use the original drawings by Schulz himself?A book version of A Charlie Brown Christmas was printed in the 1960's; the publishers would have been smarter to reissue the original book rather than create this new version.If you want to have a book version of A Charlie Brown Christmas, I highly recommend that you spend a bit more money and buy the hardcover book, &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas: the Making of a Tradition&quot;. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas","review":"This book is just like the TV version in so many ways. I love this book. Great for addition to anyones collection."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas","review":"This delightful book successfully adapts the wonderful, classic television special of A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS to the page.

Children of all ages love this book and it is sure to be a family holiday favorite to read every year."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas","review":"This book was delivered in good condition and within the estimated delivery window.

There are not pictures on every page, so your kids need to be able to pay attention to the words while you are reading until you get to a page with pictures.

After the fall of France, Britain simply lacked the military resources to decisivly defeat Germany. Of necessity, Britain endorsed a peripheral strategy of subversion, blockade, and strategic bombing while waiting for better times. The Mediterranean was the only theater where British arms could engage the Axis on land.When the United States entered the war in late 1941, the Allies achieved quick consensus that the decisive battle with Germany would take place in Northwest Europe. However, that confrontation would be repeatedly postponed, first by the time required to build up a trained US Army in Europe, then by the prudent strategic desire to disperse and attrite Nazi defenses. The political need to get into the fight in Europe drove the US decision to enter North Africa in 1942. Political and military considerations compelled the subsequent allied operations in Sicily and Italy.The idea that the UK wanted a Mediterranean strategy to head off Russian occupation of Eastern Europe finds little support here. Instead, Howard finds that continuing British interest in the Mediterranean in 1944 as a major theater of operations was motivated by a desire for prestige in the one theater where British arms predominated and by an understandable reluctance to begin the expected bloodbath in Northwest Europe until victory was assured. The single-minded US focus on Northwest Europe provided a necessary corrective to British concerns at this late date in the war.Howard's analysis is consistent with that of later historians such as Callahan and Porch. This slim volume is a superb read for students of strategy in the Second World War."},{"Title":"Fat-Burner Foods: Eat Yourself Slimmer in 14 Days","review":"This is a great book.

But that is the journey that Bert Tilden, nicknamed the Corpse by his decadent city friends, decides to attempt.Accidentally lost on the prairie, Tilden stumbles into a cowboy camp. The skills and values that he finds there awaken him to a whole new world. Tales of a beautiful and uncatchable wild black stallion raise the determination in his mind and heart to be the one to capture the legendary horse.This is the story of one man's internal odyssey, and of his quest for a horse - and love. But the journey turns out to be far more important than the goal.Of course, the story is told in Will James' inimitable Western prairie jargon, giving it the ring of the wide open spaces.

Red wine in moderation is part of the heart-healthy Mediterranean diet. Plus, while I do not drink wine, I do include red wine vinegar in my overall healthful way of eating, from salads to sandwiches.P.S. I certainly advise people who do love wine and Mediterranean cuisine to get to know everything about savoring wine with good, good for you natural food--fish to whole grain pasta dishes and desserts--(and Anita is a superb teacher!) because like vinegar, olive oil, and dark chocolate it contains disease-fighting antioxidants which can help stave off heart disease--the number one killer in both women and men.

The author visited one winery in Chile. He has no background in evaluating wine, he gives no description of the overall industry or wine regions of Chile, and no real discussion of Chilean wines. Given this lack of substance you might expect at least a charming travelogue.

Many if not most students of philosophy over the past 50 years have had their beginning logic training from an edition of this book, 'Introduction to Logic' by Irving M. Copi, now in its twelfth edition, also now with a co-author listed, Carl Cohen.I first learned logic in a two-semester sequence through the philosophy department at my university from the fifth edition of Copi's text in the early 1980s, supplemented by other material from Copi and a few others on symbolic logic. Logic was required of philosophy majors; it was strongly recommended of majors in sciences and mathematics; it was preferred for students in social sciences. Indeed, the principles of logic contained in Copi's text would not be out of place in most any discipline.This introductory text is also recommended reading for those preparing for major placement examinations, such as the LSAT and the MCAT. Learning how to think, and recognising typical and non-so-typical flaws in argumentation and reasoning are vital in many professions; the applications for law and medicine are fairly clear.This new twelfth edition of the text includes a lot of extras, including LogicNotes with Practice Problems, which occasionally comes bundled with the text. The Overviews, marginalia with definitions and clarifications, and Visual Logic features are all things I wish I'd had in the earlier text I used.The text is divided into different sections, including Language, Induction, and Deduction. Each part is then subdivided into two parts, A and B (logical, isn't it?). Language issues look at aspects such as definitions, informal fallacies in language, the question of meaning, truth and validity, and how to recognise argument forms. Deduction, what Sherlock Holmes always claims to be engaging, is a method whereby the validity of the premises provide the truth of the conclusion. In fact, Holmes usually engages in Inductive reasoning, including arguments by analogy and establishing probabilities, but not certainties. Also, the first two chapters are now separated out to introduce key concepts earlier and more directly.This book beyond the introductory chapters on language arguments engages in symbolic logic -- rather like mathematics, it uses non-linguistic tools to work out the framework. The pieces of symbolic logic (fairly standard across the discipline, like mathematics) are introduced in various stages as inductive and deductive reasoning are developed. Copi and Cohen look at both classical and modern symbolic logic systems.Copi and Cohen look at real-life applications, particularly as logic relates to scientific reasoning and social science reasoning. While this is not a mathematics text, it introduces some elements useful in mathematics, particularly in probability and in elements used in statistical reasoning.This text can be used for self-study, as some of the exercises are worked out in the back. There are also study guides available that have been produced for earlier editions; they are nonetheless useful, as much of the material remains the same from one edition to another.A great text!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Logic","review":"Copi's introduction to both inductive and deductive logic is one of the best surveys of philosophical logic in print. It's highly accessible and covers a lot of territory, more than any other introduction I've encountered. It's only drawback is its superficiality, as it doesn't fully cover probability, mathematical calculus, boolean logic, decision trees, or theorems and proofs..The book begins with the uses of language, fallacies, arguments in ordinary language, Venn Diagrams, and then proceeds to symbolic logic, Aristotlean and a cursory overview of predicate calculus, quantification, science and hypothesis, analogy and probability (especially Mill's four rules of causal inference), and concludes with logic and the law (as a practical example of the application of logic).This book would make an excellent text for an introduction to philosophical logic and arguments. There are definitely superior books that deal with each of the above subjects individually, but none that I know that covers such broad terrain in a short amount of space. As more and more colleges and universities mandate some course in critical thinking, I cannot think of a better text for an introductory overview. If this is the text, take the course. (Eighth Edition)"},{"Title":"Introduction to Logic","review":"This book hasn't 'stood the test of time'. It's simply been re-issued by the publishers a dozen times so as to force students to buy new copies and make them more money.The book itself is poor. Yet, for some reason, in my experience, it's the textbook of choice at colleges that think of their students as not smart enough for a 'real' logic book like theBergmann and Moor. This is actually a disservice (not to mention a subtle insult) to students. I've been forced to use the Copi and found that students get bogged down in irrelevancies and never quite get a clear sense of how logic works. The book spends far too much time being 'erudite' at the cost of what really matters: clarity and accuracy. It also covers topics that no real logic professor or beginning student should be worrying about - notably, Aristotle's syllogisms. (If you really want to understand those, read the last chapter ofLogic as Algebra. Otherwise stop torturing yourself and learn the basics.)There are much better-written introductions to elementary symbolic logic out there. I mentioned one already. Here's another one that students seem to find intuitive and helpful:Understanding Symbolic Logic (5th Edition)."},{"Title":"Introduction to Logic","review":"A bit of background on myself, I am a Philosophy PhD student who focuses primarily on Logic and Philosophy of Mathematics. I have taught numerous Intro Logic courses and have never once chosen this book. I was exposed to this book when I was 12 in a course I took at Johns Hopkins University with a Professor from Georgetown. I still have the book.Ok, so my main beefs with this book are that it doesn't prepare you for \\"real\\" logic and it contains a whole bunch of material that is terribly outdated and not studied at all these days.The irrelevant material: essentially everything except for the section on Modern Logic (classical logic is of no interest to anyone except for Aristotle scholars these days; the section on fallacies may be helpful for writing papers and analyzing ordinary, everyday arguments, but not for formal logic; the section on induction is way too informal (i.e. not at all rigorous) and doesn't reflect what people who work on induction talk/think about; the section on logic and language is almost entirely useless, the reasoning sub-section IS entirely useless and informal logic sub-section is useless except for the mild utility of the fallacy chapter)Even the section on Modern Logic is a bit unorthodox. Their system of natural deduction is clunky and cumbersome, especially for the intro logic student. 19 rules of inference instead of simply the standard introduction and elimination rules for the connectives. Also, IMO no intro logic course should allow their students to use equivalences beyond the intro and elimination rules...you get a much better appreciation of the equivalences (e.g. DeMorgan's Law, Hypothetical Syllogism, Disjunctive Syllogism) if you are forced to prove them instead of assuming them up front. Also having so many rules makes proofs confusing to the student beginning his studies in logic.Finally, perhaps the most damning thing about the book for me, is that it doesn't prepare you for continuing studies in logic. If you wish to learn more logic, you'll be forced to unlearn the Copi stuff and instead pick up a book in Mathematical Logic or at least a more mathematically minded book (some examples: The Logic Book by Marie and Bergmann, Language, Proof and Logic by Barwise and Etchemendy, and A Mathematical Introduction to Logic by Herbert Enderton).Essentially, the book is a very lightweight introduction to logic. Useful for unambitious students with no interest in the subject, but unlikely to foster an interest or fuel the interest of already interested students."},{"Title":"Introduction to Logic","review":"I am extremely impressed with Copi's \\"Introduction to Logic\\".

Although straightforwardness is certainly preferable to anything else, I felt there could have been a greater quantity and more interesting real-world applications to help explain more difficult concepts. (not just in the exercises, where most problems are not answered.)"},{"Title":"Introduction to Logic","review":"I have been studying logic using this text and discussion with a professor who used to teach with the 1st edition of the book.

There are more recent treatments of the subject, no doubt, and a lot of scholarship has taken place in medieval thought since that time. Nevertheless, I recommend that you buy this book (find a used copy if you can) because it is still one of the best places to get so many primary sources between the covers of one book. The introductory essays are very well done, but the value of this tome (761 pages) is the selection and depth of primary texts. This in no mere medieval cafeteria--the texts here are all selected for their importance to the overall content of each thinker's work. The selections are generous, too. With this book, you get Augustine, Boethius, Erigena, Anselm (with Gaunilo), Abelard, John of Salisbury, al-Farabi, Avicenna, al-Gazali, Averroes, Sa'adia, Solomon Ibn Gabirol, Maimonides, Bonaventure, Grosseteste, Bacon, Siger of Brabant, Aquinas (Spiritual Creatures, Summa Part I, II [first part], and the text of the 1277 condemnation), Scotus, William of Ockham, Nicholas of Autrecourt, Marsilius of Padua, and John Buridan (on Aristotle).If you are concerned that there is no way you could get good information on so many writers in one book, let me assure you that you can. For example, you may not read all of Aquinas, but you ought to be familiar with the first part of the Summa. Similarly, you may not read all of Augustine, but some of the best of his work is here (good sections from The Teacher, Retractions, Confessions, City of God, The Trinity, and On Free Will). The important additions of Islamic and Jewish philosophy (Christian medieval thought depends upon the Aristotelian work of Muslim thinkers to a great extent) to this work make it a very nice one to have."},{"Title":"Philosophy in the Middle Ages: The Christian, Islamic and Jewish Traditions","review":"Here is an exhaustive and authoritative, Medieval philosophical sourcebook which contains excerpts of primary importance from key thinkers within the Christian, Islamic and Jewish traditions.

The editors were quite generous with the excerpts, and you really get a lot of information to become familiar with the subject. The editors also include short biographical accounts of each of the authors in the text which adds to the insight to their writings/understanding. I also like the way they included the bibliographic material at the end of each excerpt of an author which really makes it easy to find those sources used if one wants to investigate further into the writings of the various authors.The excerpted philosophers include quite an extensive list. Some of them included in this anthology are; Augustine, Boethius, Anselm of Canterbury, Peter Abailard and John of Salisbury, Avicenna, Al-Gazali, Averroes, Saadia, Hasdai Crescas, Bonaventure, Aquinas, Nicholas of Autrecourt, among many others.Al-Gazali has two interesting essays, Deliverance from Error and another (Concerning the Natural Sciences) from the bookThe Incoherence of the Philosophers, 2nd Edition (Brigham Young University - Islamic Translation Series). However I wish the editors would have included his summery of the division of labor which he used the example of a needle factory and 25 workers (if I remember correctly) around 700 years prior to Adam Smith.

Once again we are immersed in blues music lore, legend and attitude as we are taken to nightclubs, are fed lines from blues numbers and left to appreciate the depth of emotion that goes into the blues. At the same time, there are some pretty tense and violent moments as Travers investigates an old murder.Nick Travers is a blues historian living in New Orleans who works at Tulane University while compiling the research necessary to write his biography of Eddie Jones, better known as Guitar Slim. As part of his all-encompassing interest in the blues he has been sending letters to Ruby Walker, a former blues singer, requesting an interview with her. Ruby is currently in prison and has so far served a 40 year sentence for the murder of her lover and manager, Billy Lyons. She has agreed to speak to Nick and this prompts him to leave New Orleans and head to Chicago. After talking to Ruby and later, when interviewing more old-time blues players around Chicago, Nick gets the impression that there is a strong possibility that she is innocent and has spent the last 40 years paying for a crime she didn't commit.Nick begins tracking down the old blues artists around Chicago in a bid to find out what they remembered about the night Billy Lyons died. His presence and his line of questioning don't go unnoticed however and it's not long before Stagger Lee gets to hear of him. Stagger Lee is the ruler of Chicago's South Side projects, ruling through terror and an abundance of crack. He is ably assisted by a couple of prostitutes, Annie and Fannie, who are as deadly as they are alluring, a fact that is demonstrated to us a number of times. When Stagger Lee decides he wants Travers stopped, it's these two he sends to do the dirty work.The story turns into a tense hunter/stalker scenario, with Travers playing the part of both the hunter and the hunted. While he hunts for information, contacting famous musicians and forgotten recording artists, he is unknowingly being stalked by a couple of killers with an impressive track record. Backing them up is the frighteningly imposing figure of Stagger Lee who, like his namesake of legend, is also a man to be feared.I found that the actual identity of the murderer really becomes of secondary importance as the story progresses, particularly because it is made perfectly obvious who it is so very early on. Instead, it's the tension built into Travers' search that really dragged me in. The reason behind why Billy Lyons was killed dominates our attention too and is the source of a number of surprises along the way.There are a lot of characters used throughout the book and they ranged from the crazy, off-beat Annie and Fannie who never really progressed beyond the role of killers who wanted to escape the life they led, to the wonderfully captured irreverence of Dirty Jimmy. Jimmy had the demeanor one would expect of an ex-musician who has already seen it all and the harp-blowing little man livened up every scene in which he was included. As for Nick Travers, he is a fine character with the tough background as an ex-NFL footballer with the New Orleans Saints offset by the music geek enthusiasm he displays when he meets the odd blues legend. He comes with just the right mix of strength and vulnerability.LEAVIN' TRUNK BLUES is a dark, moody story that showcases Chicago's rich history of blues music while providing an enthralling thriller. With the lure of more Nick Travers mysteries to come, I'm sure to be diving into the blues scene courtesy of Ace Atkins in the future."},{"Title":"Leavin' Trunk Blues (Nick Travers)","review":"&quot;Leavin Trunk Blues&quot; by Ace Atkins kept my attention. Especially when I got half-way through. Despite the book's minor shortcomings, the plot and concept are brilliant. I will definitely get his first novel Cross Road Blues. FYI, I love the blues and play sax in a couple of bands. Blues music is an American art form that has many shapes and faces and Ace thankfully, is one of them. Reading the book made me appreciate the blues that much more. The story is based on Ruby Walker, a famous blues singer who was wrongfully sent to prison for a crime she did not commit. When she said, &quot;Iam the Blues,&quot; I was hooked. In comes Nick Travers, blues historian and all-around good guy. Whose faced against a famous fictional evil character named Stagger Lee, made to be very real and throroughly hateful. As our hero digs up the past, bodies start dropping.

His trip north not only allows him to have that interview with a former blues great, whose career was cutterribly short by a conviction of murdering her lover, but italso allows him to re-united with that warm ex-, Kate.When he attempts to learn the truth about the death of the long-gone musician, for which Ruby was convicted, he encountersone of the most nasty of fictional killers, and he alsoruns into obstacles put up, mysteriously, by former friendsand fellow-musicians of the dead blues man.The obstacles and problems only encourage Nick to furtherexplore the decades-old murder, as well as the story told himby the inmate convicted of killing him.It's a moving and warm story, both intricate and straightforward, and Atkins does a very nice job of combiningthe elements of a good read."},{"Title":"Leavin' Trunk Blues (Nick Travers)","review":"This is the first installment in a franchise that is very different from others found in the mysteries isle of the bookstore. It features a history professor, who studies blues music, as the main protagonist. He keeps busy by solving mysteries involving long dead blue musicians. This is a very good idea, but the implementation is off a little because it is too much detail in sports, which bogs down the story entirely. Still, it is smart, entertaining, and vivid. So it is a good read, but one that dies in spots."},{"Title":"Leavin' Trunk Blues (Nick Travers)","review":"Ace Atkins' novels are labors of love for the blues, about which he evidences deep knowledge and overwhelming affection.

When convicted murderer Ruby &quot;The Sweet Black Angel&quot; Walker agrees to Nick interviewing her, he can hardly wait. Four decades ago, Ruby was sent to jail for killing her lover Billy Lyons, owner of King Snake Records, in what was considered a &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot; murder.In Chicago, Nick meets Ruby, who insists she is innocent. She pleads with Nick, who had recent success solving a mystery, to prove her innocence. Unable to resist the lure of Ruby, who was one step away from music legend, Nick begins to investigate the death of Lyons back in 1959. However, his inquires leads to the maniacal Stagger Lee and his assortment of lunatics wanting the case remaining closed and Nick dead.The second Nick Travers' blues mystery, LEAVIN' TRUNK BLUES, is a well written, but much darker tale than its predecessor (see CROSSROAD BLUES) is. The story line still sings with a rhythm not often seen in an amateur sleuth tale. The setting seems ghostly in an abandoned urban way and supplemented by the arctic Christmas weather that together adds up to the overall feeling of gloom. However, the light that shines through the bleak landscape is the heroic Nick, who tries to do the right thing even, as he feels like his enemy's blitz has sacked him several times. Ace Atkins scores with his second mystery that provides readers an entertaining tale that educates the audience on a part of Americana.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Leavin' Trunk Blues (Nick Travers)","review":"In \\"Crossroad Blues\\", Ace Atkins examined the legend and music of Robert Johnson, essentially taking a real man and making him fictional. In \\"Leavin' Trunk Blues\\", Atkins, casts blues myth Stagger Lee as a character, essentially taking a fictional man and making him real.Stagger Lee is the name of a number of blues and jazz standards about a tough Chicago man who gambles with, then murders, a fellow named Billy (usually Lyons). The stories are always the same, though a number of different artists, from Lloyd Price to Wilson Pickett, from the Grateful Dead to Nick Cave, have taken ownership of the song by switching around events, tempos, names, details. But the centerpiece is still the evil, dangerous, magnetic Stagger Lee.In Ace Atkins' version, Stagger Lee is all the evil in Chicago's south side rolled into a single man, and Billy Lyons was the manager of a female blues artist, Ruby Walker, known as \\"the Sweet Black Angel\\". When Billy turned up dead, the Black Angel was accused of his murder and went to prison for life.Enter Nick Travers, blues historian, amateur detective and old softy. When Ruby asks Nick to help her find out who killed Billy and get her out of jail, Nick jumps right in, meeting famous blues musicians, beautiful, knife-wielding assassins and Stagger Lee himself, taking time along the way to take a dig at that little blond kid who thinks he plays the blues but isn't old enough to know what they are.Ace Atkins writes well. He's toned down a lot of the purple prose that marred \\"Crossroad Blues\\" and here concentrates on good, solid description and storytelling. His evocation of the blues, the life, the players, are all spot on and he makes you feel the desperation in the hearts of the people who migrated to Chicago in order to find a better life, only to find the projects and poverty. He makes you want to listen to every name that he drops. When he's good, he's very, very good.But his hold on good is a little spotty. Atkins depends too heavily on internal monologue, too often writing in sentence fragments that he seems thinks make sense and allow the reader into the mind of the character. They don't. Instead, they seem like the author was too lazy to finish his sentences and the editor was too lazy to correct him.The two female assassins, who could have been the most interesting characters, are written as comedy relief, with Annie carrying on a love affair with her butcher knife \\"Willie\\" and fantasizing about moving to Riverdale, home of Archie & pals. Petie Wheatstraw, a blues hanger-on is also written a little on the cartoon-ey side. And I find it hard, even when suspending disbelief, to accept that the police can't find and catch the \\"biggest black man [Nick] had ever seen\\", Stagger Lee, especially when he commits murders in broad daylight and everyone knows where he lives. Large parts of this book could not have happened if the laws of logic had not been repealed.That said, Nick himself is a fine character, written with the right touch of vulnerability and strength, music geek knowledge and girl stupidity. His amour, Kate, is brash and smart, with just the right amount of softness. And Dirty Jimmy is one of the most fun characters I've come across in a while.Atkins' mysteries won't win any awards for originality and they won't knock your socks off as literature. But they are a wonderful way to pass some hours and learn about old blues while being entertained."},{"Title":"Leavin' Trunk Blues (Nick Travers)","review":"Oh, baby don't you want to goBack to the land of California, to my sweet home ChicagoIt seemed like everyone in the Mississippi delta country could hear that sweet song that Robert Johnson sang calling them north to Chicago. It fell on there ears like a sweet lullaby, a promise of a better life to the north. Young Ruby Walker was no exception. As a teenager she haunted the roadhouses and blues joints hoping that one day she could sing the blues in the sweet home up north \\"Chicago.\\"Well, Ruby did make it north and for a while it was a good and sweet home. Ruby hit the big time and became known for her song Leavin' Trunk Blues. But it seemed predestined that Ruby was to live a life of the blues. One morning she woke up soaked in the blood of her manager and lover, Billy Lyons and before she knew it she was serving life in the big house for his murder.That was in 1959 and as the years pass slowly by, Ruby steadfastly maintained that she is innocent. She begins to write to professor and blues historian Nick Travers. Nick agrees to research the circumstances surrounding the murder, because he hopes to do research on Ruby, her life and the people she knew at the time. Nick feels that historians are missing the opportunity to record living history by forgetting the people who participated in the great migration and focusing on the 1930's and the delta.Ace Atkins has created a tasty mystery with Leavin' Trunk Blues, the second of his Nick Travers series. It is nicely atmospheric taking place in Chicago with Nick visiting blues clubs as well as Chicago's seedy underbelly to dig up information. Fast paced with action and adventure to spare, it draws the reader quickly into Nicks world.Nick is an unlikely sleuth. A former football player who fell in love with the blues and became a blues historian from Tulane University. We find out that he can get down and dirty with the best of them and there are times in Leavin' Trunk Blues that he has to.For a fan of mysteries or a fan of the blues, Leavin' Trunk Blues is a great read. If you are both it is even better."},{"Title":"Leavin' Trunk Blues (Nick Travers)","review":"This is a darker and more complex novel -emotionally and in plot terms -than its predecessor in thr series \\" Crossroad Blues\\".The protagonist is once again blues historian and academic ,the ex pro footballer \\"Nick \\" .He is lured by an invitation to interview \\" Ruby Walker \\" who,recording under the name \\"Sweet Black Angel \\" had scored a major hit record in the early 50's and was seemingly set fair to build a lasting and solid career as a blues singer .She was then convicted of murdering her manager,one Billy Lyons. and given a life sentence ,one she is still serving .In their meeting she insists on her innocence and asks Nick to trace the real killer -no mean feat if accomplished since the crime is over 50 years old.He begins digging into the past and finds that some of her band members of the time had died in mysterious circumstances but his investigations are hampered and his life threatened when the local drugs lord Stagger Lee sets out to block his investigations .Stagger Lee is not a man to be trifled with -powerfully built and utterly without scruple he uses two coked out hookers with a mean streak a mile wide to enforce his will .The case is one that unfolds in dark and stagnant backwaters of the spirit and even good guys ,those striving to bring hope into the blighted ghetto world ,are found to be compromised and tainted by contact with evil and moral equivocation.The plot is worked out adequately but what sets the book apart from its competitors is its atmosphere -the weather plays a key role in setting mood .It is a bone freezing Chicago winter with a wind like a lacerating knife that chills to the bone and numbs the spirit ;the rain slices the air and numbs the spirit -a living counterpoint to the slums and despair which forms the book's physical dimension .The book is also a love story -a paen of praise and an economium to the blues -and its bitter sweet ending lifts the spirit and says love can endure .Read it for the mystery elements -they are good -but the blues lovers will get more from the book than will the mystery mavens"},{"Title":"Leavin' Trunk Blues (Nick Travers)","review":"\\"Leavin' Trunk Blues\\" is Ace Atkins follow up to his highly acclaimed \\"Crossroad Blues\\". In this adventure, blues historian Nick Travers seeks the truth about a fictitious murder of record producer Billy Lyons and the conviction of Lyon's lover, Ruby Walker. During the investigation, Travers becomes convinced of the innocence of Ruby Walker and encounters some obstacles to finding the truth in the form of villains Stagger Lee and his two psychopaths, Fast Lovin' Fannie and Butcher knife totin', Annie. Set in the streets of Chicago around Christmas time, Atkins does a great job of breathing life into his characters and holding the readers attention to the very end. A worthy follow up to \\"Crossroad Blues\\" and a worthwhile read for blues fans everywhere."},{"Title":"Leavin' Trunk Blues (Nick Travers)","review":"In his job as Professor of Blues History, Nick Travers has learned enough to suspect that something is wrong with Blues legend Ruby Walker's conviction for murdering her lover. When Ruby invites him to visit her in prison, he grabs the chance. When she tells him she didn't commit the 50 year old murder, he vows to investigate.The novel is set in the dark underside of Chicago. Where once Chicago was the city of hope for sharecroppers fleeing the South, now that hope has vanished. Is Stagger Lee really an urban legend, or did one man have so much to do with Black Chicago's self-destruction? If he does exist, how does he relate to Ruby. Although a bunch of old Blues artists living in the memories of their accomplishments fifty years ago hardly sounds dangerous, Travers finds himself threatened.The novel reeks of the blues--both in its characters and in its themes. The slums of Chicago, the ruins of old Blues clubs, and the ruins of old Blues artists all form part of the tapestry in Atkin's novel. Although there are a few light moments, even these serve to reinforce the message of the blues."},{"Title":"Leavin' Trunk Blues (Nick Travers)","review":"Ace Atkin's second Nick Travers mystery is an absolute great read. The book finds former pro football player now blues professor Nick travers going to Chicago to interview a woman convicted of killing her lover over forty years ago. Sounds simple? Its not when there are people who want this former Blue's singers story to remain buried in the jail cell. Atkin's gets better with each book and Nick Travers could become a classic mystery/ blues tracker.

So, I ordered Leavin' Trunk Blues and it is GREAT! Just ordered the rest of the series and can't put them down. This guy can really write."},{"Title":"Leavin' Trunk Blues (Nick Travers)","review":"There's nothing profound in noting that there's no way to enjoy the blues by reading them, but credit Ace Adkins and his encyclopedic knowledge of blues history for getting as close to the mournful chords of Muddy Waters or Robert Johnson or Son House as you can get without a slide guitar. \\"Leaving Trunk Blues\\" is Adkins' second in the series featuring Nick Travers, the ex-New Orleans Saint terrorizer-of-quarterbacks, now a professor of musicology at Tulane and tracker of the origins of this uniquely American genre of music. While \\"Crossroads Blues\\" speculates around the murky facts marking the end of Robert Johnson's tragically shortened life and recording career, this one revolves around the fictitious Ruby Walker, who, like many in the day, made their way from the Mississippi delta to Chicago, from field work to factory work, taking the simple acoustic guitar and harmonica and adding amps, a base, drums, and microphones to create the legendary Chicago blues sound. But the reclusive Ruby has been languishing in prison for over 40 years, convicted of the murder of her lover. She agrees to meet with Nick, as long as he agrees to investigate the crime she swears she never committed. As with \\"Crossroads\\" before it, Adkins packs his story full of richly drawn characters, from ancient blues men - real and imaginary - to Stagger Lee - a brutal and vindictive pimp of mythical and mystical proportion running a pair of murderous whores.Adkins makes the jump from the steamy delta to Chicago's blustery December with ease, capturing the city with Carl Sandberg-like power and grace. Adkins' Chicago is like \\"a big family you desperately wanted to join, a big aunt with her meaty arms spread out in wide welcome.\\" While the pace slows at times, and Nick's feeble attempts to rekindle an affair with once-flame Kate doesn't add much to the action, this is beautifully told fiction laced with history and insight - an engaging novel worthy of its predecessor and more than enough to have one looking forward to the sequel, \\"The Dark End of the Street.\\" Put on some Muddy Waters and settle back with this fine crime series. - you'll not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Six Seconds in Dallas 1ST Edition","review":"A marvelous study for the time it was written.

I've also read about five books that tout various conspiracies in the JFK case, and _Six Seconds in Dallas_ is the best of them. Thompson appears to be one of the more honest conspiracy researchers who attempt to find an answer to the mystery rather than just endlessly find fault with the Warren Commission. His theory of the shot that hit JFK in the back (or throat, depending on how you see things) is particularly interesting and almost compelling. I recommend this book whether or not you believe Oswald acted alone. It's very readable and to the point."},{"Title":"Six Seconds in Dallas 1ST Edition","review":"The copy I received was very worn out, well thumbed, severely creased from obviously being read over and over again, but all that did not matter a jot, as I was desperate to get my hands on this excellent, immediate expose on JFK's assassination in Dallas, by Prof Josiah Thompson for the past fifteen years from every source that I could think of, but was unsuccessful until now, as it was out of print. I am my self writing a book on JFK's assassination and being able to eventually purchase this invaluable book is like gold dust to me. I will be eternally grateful to the seller of this well used, well read paperback. Thoroughly recommended and well worth the price. Bones"},{"Title":"Six Seconds in Dallas 1ST Edition","review":"There are some real wacky conspiracies out there. A lot written just to make a fast buck. There are books out there that claim as many as 15 gunmen, and over 20 shots fired. Some people will believe anything they read, thats why The National Inquirer makes millions upon millions each year. However, I honestly think Thompson really wanted to find the truth, and even though his book is a first generation conspriracy book, it is an essential book to read if interested in the Kennedy Assassination. I would start with reading 1.The Warren Report, then get a copy of 2.The Zapruder film on DVD to study. Then I would suggest reading 3. Accessories After the fact (or another well written) book that blast the Commissions way they mishandled the case from the beginning. I would then suggest an early period Conspiracy book before 1970, that doesn't go into UFO's killing Kennedy. 4. Six Seconds In Dallas, is the best book that I've found for being open minded to some degree, and looking at both sides. Some of the things he states has been proven incorrect. However, considering the first edition came out over 35 years ago, it stands the test of time well. I was impressed with the charts, and maps of where the witnessess were shown to be located, and what they saw, and when they said, and what they told the commission, and why the commission didn't bother to interview key witnesses. I will probably get some criticism here, but I would then pick up a copy of 5. Case Closed - it's almost like a rewrite of the Commissions report, showing that their conclusions were correct - However, the fact findings they used were flawed, and they dismissed a lot of important information or ignored what they didn't wish to hear. But the strong point of this book, is that it tells the story, and in the footnotes it criticizes all the crazy (and some not so crazy) ideas that the modern day pro-conspirators have. From that point, you should be able to figure which route to go. I have not read Crossfire, but have been told it covers just about all the main conspiracies. There are some more books out there I could suggest, but I would have to say that most researchers into the Kennedy assassination, would have Six Seconds In Dallas on their bookshelf."},{"Title":"Six Seconds in Dallas 1ST Edition","review":"Despite its serious, scholarly tone, Thompson's book is not really very good.For one thing, he espouses the ridiculous theory that the neck wound came from the head shot two seconds later. This is impossible.As if this weren't enough, Thompson demonstrates that the stretcher bullet, 399, has nothing to do with the case, then does an about face and says that 399 hit Kennedy in the back. This makes no sense.One thing that annoys me about all the books and documentaries about the Kennedy assassination is that the commentators take note of the bullet that penetrated Kennedy's back by one inch, and have nothing more to say about this.What kind of high-powered rifle could daintily deposit a bullet one inch into a man's back, the same rifle that is supposed to have blown his head off two seconds later?The head shot we all know came from in front and was a hollow-point exploding bullet. Skeptics notwithstanding. But what about the magically ineffectual bullet that penetrated Kennedy's back exactly one inch? How was that possible?Like everyone else, Thompson takes note of it and moves on with no further comment, as though the back wound was not a mystery. But it is a mystery, perhaps the most enigmatic of the four or five shots that were fired.Above all, the one-inch back wound disproves once and for all the single-bullet theory, because a bullet that stopped one inch into Kennedy's back could not have passed through him into Connally.The single-bullet theory, a confection of Arlen Specter, should have been dismissed decades ago. Yet it continues to be invoked in almost every documentary about the Kennedy Assassination. This demonstrates that the enigma of Kennedy's murder has instilled a sort of intellectual entropy in those who write about the case."},{"Title":"A Doctor Like Papa","review":"Margaret wants is a sister, a dog, and, most important of all, her mama's permission to study medicine so she can be a doctor like her papa.

Get Fuzzy targets an older audience, look at some of the stuff that Bucky says? It speaks for its self.This 'reader' also comented that Get Fuzzy didn't use any political, historical, religious, and philisophical outtakes to make them work. I don't this he was paying attention to the takes on Caesar that were made, or poetic alterations of Robert Frost, or political jabs at Dan Quail!You should do your homework before bashing something.As for the book its self, I purchased it the second I had the money and as far as comics go it was the best purchase I've made.

Darby Conley may be a very competent draughtsman but a writer he is NOT. From time to time, without warning, the strip turns maudlin. (e.g., the colon cancer scare or Satchel getting run over by a bicyclist). I guess the biggest problem is that Conley is very literal minded and has too acute a flair for the obvious. I mean, if you've lived a sheltered life, don't get out much, and haven't been exposed to what's known, sui generis, as 'alternative' culture, then maybe Conley and his creation are ahead of your curve. Otherwise, this strip and this collection can get pretty old pretty fast. Conley seems mired in indecision: one day he wants the strip to be 'awwwww' cute; the next, he wants to be 'profound.' The result is a hybrid: 'awwwwww, how profoundly AWFUL!' Want obnoxious cats, simpleminded dogs and nerdy owners? Pick up a 'Garfield' collection at a neighborhood garage sale.

But you just can't buy this book you need to get the first book, The dog is not a toy and the newest one Groovitude."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"Darby has done it again! Almost unthinkable but better than the first! Hide your credit cards and break out the band-aids for this hillarious second book of Bucky.

So don't buy this one if you already have &quot;Groovitude.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"Berke Breathed and Bill Watterson may not be around anymore, but not to worry, we have Darby Conley. If you're into dogs, cats, rugby, Harry Potter, or puns and wordplay, this book is for you. Even the Introduction is worth the price alone. Conley is a breath of fresh air on the comic strip scene, and the only artist/writer around who makes me laugh out loud at his strips.If you're unfortunate enough to live in a city which does not carry the daily antics of Satchel and Bucky in its paper, all the more reason to get this and see what you're missing."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"My paper started running Get Fuzzy about a year ago and now every day I look forward to reading it more that any other comic. Ever. To not laugh at Bucky Katt is impossible. This is the quintessential portrait of a cat. It's not that he doesn't care about the others in his life. He's just completely self-absorbed. Satchel is his perfect foil. A dog who is totally loyal and caring. Almost to a fault. And then there's Rob, the referee. I really don't know how to write a proper review for the strip. Do yourself a favor and check it out for yourself."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"This book is hysterical! \\"Get Fuzzy\\" is the best comic strip to come along since \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\". Anyone who has a cat with personality can appreciate Bucky Katt's sassy attitude, which is complemented by Satchel the dog's sweet and naive demeanor. These two pets and their owner Rob are wonderfully endearing. Darby Conley's writing is never stale and is guaranteed to make you laugh. His second book is just as wonderful as his first."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"If you think that Get Fuzzy is a Garfield rip-off, you are wrong. True, we do have the single, desparate man, the powerful cat, and the stupid dog, but it is entirely different. Rob (owner) isn't close to being nerdy, has a friend (Joe), and is more powerful than Jon. Satchel (dog) has a voice, isn't a kick-thingy (even though it may be a book title). Bucky (cat) does destroy things, but has a more cruel mind than Garfield, sleeps in a drawer (instead of a box) isn't as lazy as Garfield (which is hard to be) and wrecks something about every day.Rob's mom doesn't live on a farm, and Christmas isn't that big of a deal as it is in Garfield.But, Garfield-lovers, this is still a truly halarious pet comic that will have you rolling one the floor in laughter repeatedly. A must-have to a comic-lover's collection."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"Conley's latest offering presents another look at about a year's worth of strips. If you aren't familiar with the strip, it chronicles the life of Rob Wilco, his dog-with-a-heart-of-gold-and-mind-of-clay Satchel, and his self-centered, mostly evil and quite pointy cat, Bucky B. Katt. Conley's writing style is irreverent and packs its biggest punches in its nuances. RW:\\"You're delusional, you know that?\\" BK:\\"Well, I'm a little vague on your 'Nerd Terminology', but if 'Delusional' means 'Gorgeous,' then YES. Yes I did know that.\\"His art is unbelievably good... he explores his world of tuna obsessions, catnip highs and broken furnishings with 3d hand-rendering and glorious detail...."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"Get Fuzzy is the best strip alive today and may well be one of the top five strips of all time. It is original, quirky, and sometimes laugh out loud funny. The beauty of it is, the content appeals to both pet owners and non-pet owners alike. After devouring Get Fuzzy in the paper for months (often completely ignoring all other strips), I happened to pick up The Dog is Not a Toy, Mr. Conley's first collection. It was tremendously entertaining and the sort of work I continue to pick up and peruse months later. Since then, I have been anxiously been awaiting his second effort. It surpasses the first in charm, humor, and the artists understated and often wry social and political satire. Mr. Conley possesses a truly fresh voice, talented and hand, and keen insight and I hope he continues to produce such engaging works well into the future."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"Fuzzy Logic:Get Fuzzy 2 is even better than the first get fuzzy book. It's about the same size as the first but picks up farther in than the first. If you don't have any Get Fuzzy books I'd recommend getting Groovitude rather than this because it covers both the first and second books, but the Sundays are in color."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"Get Fuzzy is a well done, intelligent comic strip, always good for an honest laugh. Compared with the first Get Fuzzy book, Fuzzy Logic is a major step forward. The art matures visibly from the beginning of the book to the end, for example. All of the jokes in this book are funny, and a fair number are bust-a-gut, fall-out-of-your-chair hilarious. I eagerly await the third book."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"I have been an avid reader of the Get Fuzzy comic strip, and an even bigger fan of the first Get Fuzzy book. The newest installment of the Get Fuzzy series is no exception. The only thing I find unsatisfying with Get Fuzzy 2 is how much emphasis the book puts on Bucky the cat. That is because I enjoy Satchel the dog much more. However this book will be a delight if you enjoy a lot of Bucky. My hope for the next Get Fuzzy book (and God willing there will be) is that it's focus sways toward Satchel."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"I admit it - I'm hooked on Darby Conley's comedy, Bucky, Satchel and Rob. I buy the books for myself. I have the Get Fuzzy calendars. I buy the books for friends and relatives and I'm absolutely sure everyone who reads and sees Get Fuzzy will become a die hard fan."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"The Get Fuzzy comic strip is definitely one of my favorites. The two book collections of the strip released so far have provided immense enjoyment for me. Being a cat owner, I can relate to the situations and \\"attitude\\" of Bucky, the feline member of this little family group. Most of the predicaments are typical of cat behavior I have seen from two cats. If mine could talk, they would certainly express many of Bucky's views I'm sure."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"I must agree with the other reviews on this book. Fuzzy Logic: Get Fuzzy 2 is a wonderful follow-up to Darby Conley's first book, Get Fuzzy; House Rule #4: A Dog Is Not a Toy.I can not start my day without reading it in the local paper in my area. This is truly a great book for the cat or dog lover in your life or you!!Just the interactions between Rob, Bucky Katt and Satchel dog are hilarious!! This is a great collection of comics put together in one book.Let me say this much, the first book, I have had to have read it atleast 100 times. And this book, I was able to finish the in one night because I could not put it down. The best part about is that you can read it over and over and never get tired of it.I highly recommend this book to animal lovers and non animal lovers. Any animal lover will remember having a pet like Bucky and/or Satchel at one point in their life. And Non animal lovers will laugh at the reasons on why they don't have pets.Honestly, I can't wait for the third one to come out, if there is a third one!!!And if you get the book, tell Smacky I said Hi!"},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"...I absolutely love Get Fuzzy and think it's the best comic out there right now. It's just hilarious to see some of the conflict brought on by Bucky the cat and Satchel the dog. Get this book and it will provide you with many many laughs."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"This is the best stuff since Calvin & Hobbes gave up the ghost years ago.The premise of the strip is that Rob (a fairly pleasant rugby enthusiast) shares his home with a nice, but dimwitted dog named Satchel (believe me, Satchel is no golden retriever) and an evil one-toothed Siamese cat named Bucky (but Bucky, deciding that he needs a tougher nickname asks to be called Shirley).The reason this strip works is that while the animals converse with Rob, they say things that an actual pet might say if it had vocal cords:Bucky on Rob--\\"Aaa, what do you know, you big, pink, water-loving freak!\\"Bucky on getting in trouble--\\"Oh, sure, blame the cat! That is such a chipmunk mentality.\\"Bucky on life as a cat--\\"Hey, my life isn't all warm cream and dead rats either, man.\\"Then there is Satchel the big loveable doofus dog, who has about a five second attention span. When dressing up for Halloween he makes a Dirt Devil costume--it was the scariest thing he could think of.The drawing is well-done. You can't miss this one if you have pets, or grew up with pets or just like animals. Guarenteed to make you laugh out loud at least half-a-dozen times."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"Get Fuzzy is the best comic strip out there! It cracks me up everyday! Any Siamese cat lover will instantly identify with this strip - Bucky the is the ultimate personification of the Siamese attitude. Satchel the dog provides balance - he's very sweet and naive. Rob is a friend to his pets rather than their master. Get Fuzzy is extremely original, and very funny!"},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"This is the best and funniest comic strip. I don't understand all these people writing things like &quot;this represents everything that is wrong in America.&quot; These are characters. Personifications of animals with a brilliant outlook.

You should too!!!!"},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"I am addicted to Get Fuzzy. To me this book was laugh out loud funny (as was the first).

Not since Calvin and Hobbes have I enjoyed a comic so much."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"Darby Conley does it again in his follow up to the first \\"Get Fuzzy\\" collection 'The Dog Is Not A Toy'.For those unfamiliar with the daily strip, it brings the pet perspective to life. Envision your cat sneaking the charge cards or your dog choosing the main dish for the evening meal. 'Get Fuzzy' allows Bucky (the one fanged cat) and Satchel (the loveable loaf of a pup) to express themselves in a human manner that anyone who has ever wondered what their cat or dog were thinking will love.The pets and their owner, Rob, function as a family and there is a wonderful human quality to the scenes that could only be brought about by a real pet lover.For pet lovers everywhere or anyone who enjoys Dilbert, Peanuts, or Frumpy the Clown - the 'Get Fuzzy' collections will be sure to bring a smile to your day. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"I'm a big fan of comic books (I previously made two new series) and I can say now that \\"Get Fuzzy\\" is a quality comic strip. The art is wonderful, the jokes are terrific and there is a wide variety open for the characters...it differs from Garfield in some ways: 1. The animals talk and the owner can understand them and hear what they're saying 2. The dog can talk and the cat is a bit hyper and active in some ways 3. The owner isn't as nerdy as you think. Actually, Garfield is good for people who like humor that occurs with talk backs and slapstick; whilst Get Fuzzy is a strip for people who like cunning and half-witted humor...All in all, read Get Fuzzy. You'll love its humor if you own a Siamese cat, any cat, or a dog, and the art will blow you away. If you love Garfield, you'll love this--I know I did."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"I can sum up this book in four words. HA HA HA HA! Be careful, reading this will make you laugh out loud and get you funny looks. Then people will try to take this book from you and read it. This is my favorite comic I've ever read. The only regret I had about this book is that it wasn't longer or didn't come with Get Fuzzy 3!"},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"If you are cat owner (or just know of a cat) it will not be long before you see your furry four legged friend in the pages of this book. A sacrastic little animal who looks out for number one and is demanding of all those around them; yet despite this attitude they manage to work their way into your heart and make you smile and laugh from time to time. It is this universal quality of the cat species that is so well captured by Mr. Conley's daily strips and is one the few reason that I turn to the comic section since the unfortunate disappearance of Calvin and Hobbes. Pick it up and be prepared to laugh."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"I laughed so hard! I received this book yesterday, and I finished it yesterday, I couldn't put it down. I love the strip where they dress up for Halloween and Satchel's \\"Scariest\\"costume idea is a cardboard version of a vacuum cleaner. I can't wait for the next book. I have the comic strip sent to my email everyday, I just can't get enough."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"I caught this while browsing through the other comics listed on the Dilbert site and have been hooked ever since.

Her classic line 'Can you say, &quot;PLAGERISM&quot;?' absolutely killed me (there were tears) and it is now my email sig. Good stuff, she's as funny as Darby just for slighty different reasons..."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"When my friend and I have tried to explain the characters in this comic strip collection, a frequent response was, \\"Oh, like Garfield.\\" Nope. Bucky, Satchel, and Rob are not like Garfield, Otis, and Jon. Honestly, they are much funnier.I learned of this strip when Scott Adams, who writes Dilbert, recommended it on his website as \\"the funniest comic strip about talking pets.\\" It took me a few days to get into it, but now I look for it everyday.Bucky (the cat) is a self-centered, mean-spirited animal who won't confess to having a softer side. He's often trying to scam money out of who he believes to be the gullible public (or Satchel) or make the next hot seller. His grasp of English is never perfect, so he may say a word he thinks is cool, but actually insults him. Satchel, on the other hand, often proves that he's simple and dim-witted, but he can come up with some great puns and verbal zingers.I love the series that explains why each of the animals aren't allowed outside alone, Satchel because he's so innocent he'd take up with anyone who fed him, Bucky because his sassy mouth would get him killed. (This from the cat who's never won a fight in his life.)A classic strip shows Bucky watching a TV that's not on. Rob asks, \\"You know that TV is off, don't you Buck?\\" \\"No, I don't, and how do you know it isn't one of those reality shows that just makes it look like a blank TV screen?\\" To which Satchel says, \\"Wow! That's the best one I've seen! The screen _really looks_ off!\\"Another one I love shows the two pets watching late-night TV info-mercials with a phone in hand. The caption reads, \\"Why late-night TV ads are so effective.\\" A wide-eyed Satchel exclaims, \\"Man! I need that. I don't know what it is, but boy, do I need it.\\" Bucky hands him a credit card and tells him to put in on the yellow one, since the green one stopped working over an hour ago.Ha! I know. You probably had to be there, but seeing these guys is much better than reading about them.Darby Conley is brilliantly funny! Get Fuzzy is one of the best comic strips in print."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"I loved this book and it was nearly in perfect condition.

The level of excellence and humor is always in place. One can't go wrong getting a Fuzzy book. A great present for the entire household and important for those who collect Get Fuzzy and want to be able to return to Fuzzy world just by opening a book."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Logic Get Fuzzy 2","review":"This is an extremely funny comic strip, especially if you're a cat or dog owner. The strip revolves around Rob, the obligatory human owner, Bucky, the neurotic and difficult cat, and Satchel, the sweet, naive, and much picked-on dog. I love reading this strip in the funnies. It's good in this book collections, as well, but it doesn't always flow well in book form. For one thing, when it's collected in a book like this, it's much easier to see where Conley decides to just quit some plots and start new ones, without much warning. I never really noticed it when I was reading it in the newspaper, but it's a little jarring in the book. However, it's still a fun read, and not that expensive."},{"Title":"Penthouse Adult Magazine: May 1993","review":"I ordered this magazine because of the fact my boat was used in this issue.

There is something for everyone in this novel. It is both a family saga and an historial novel recounting the Danish Resistance Movement in World War II. The author does an artful job of weaving the two elements together. Often in a book of this scope, the author reaches a point where he has to tie up the loose ends and the finale disappoints. Not so here. Gutcheon finishes on a strong note. The book is well-researched, well-written, poignant, insightful and laugh-out-loud funny. It doesn't get any better than this."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"I rarely if ever read other Amazon reviews before writing my own, but this morning in preparation for writing a review of Leeway Cottage by Beth Gutcheon, I did peek at one or two and am afraid I wasn't quite as taken with this book as I thought I would be. A long time reader of Beth Gutcheon's since her first book, Still Missing to her latest one More than You Know, I have always found her novels to be refreshing even taking on different themes and almost different writing styles each time. But after finishing Leeway Cottage, I wondered if Ms. Gutcheon took on more than she should have in one book. And now looking back on this title, I do wonder what point the author was trying to make since there were two very distinct storylines and they never seemed to mesh that well to me.The story begins with the well to do background of one of the main characters, Sydney, and how her ancestors built and lived in a cottage in a summer community. When Sydney is a young woman, good friends of her family live in Leeway Cottage which will be her home one day. Life is good for Sydney or so it appears. A Kennedy type life Sydney sails during the day and parties at night with her crowd of friends. Sydney is destined to come out at a debutante ball, attend college for a year or two, marry a wealthy man, bear children and hopefully live a happy life. But when her father abruptly dies and Sydney is left in her mother's demanding and at times abusive hands Sydney's home life changes considerably. And than a chance encounter with a Danish pianist, Laurus, and meeting him again in New York City when Sydney leaves home at 18, sets in motion two very different worlds which will soon collide.The first part of the book describes to readers Sydney's dilettante lifestyle. And while her life with just her mother is considerably difficult, Sydney also inherits a great deal of money from her father which when she's 18 allows her to leave her mother's home. This money also allows her to buy Leeway Cottage when it goes on the market. And shortly after the birth of their first child and war breaks out, Sydney retreats to Leeway Cottage renewing her old friendships but this time on her own terms as a wealthy woman in her own right. But Laurus does not return to Leeway Cottage with Sydney. As a Dane and a Jew, Laurus feels compelled to return to Europe and serve in the underground jeopardizing his life and marriage. And now we have a shift in the book as Sydney is at home o once again living the high life among society despite the war while Laurus is hard at work not only trying to save members of his own family from Hitler, but the lives of other Danish Jews as well.While I was familiar with some of the stories surrounding the Danish Resistance during WW II, I did learn more about this and enjoyed reading the historical information provided in this book. But then I began to wonder why I never felt the two distinct parts of the book never fully came together to tell one large story. While there were parts that were very well written I was left disappointed by the efforts of a writer who has done much better in the past. And just as I was about to finish the book I was further confounded by the last chapter and wondered if it was misplaced in the publishing process. After we learn about an illicit love affair which seemed to be written for shock value and the end of Sydney and Laurus' lives, Ms. Gutcheon returns to the war and describes Laurus' sister's life and release from a concentration camp. I still wonder why the author chose to end the book with these events since they seemed to come from left field.I really wanted to enjoy this book and recommend it to others as I have done in the past with other books by this author. I do think that Ms. Gutcheon was trying to chronicle a marriage between two people from different worlds and not necessarily suite for a happy life together. Or perhaps she tried to show the different lifestyles of two characters and how their desires ultimately affected their lives together. In the end, though, I thought that the author might have done better to write two books rather than the one she did. That way we would have had a much larger story of the Danish Resistance and the life of a socialite.If after reading this review you are still interested in reading worthwhile Beth Gutcheon books, I suggest you read her first book Still Missing or her wonderful paralleling story set over a period of 100 years, More than You Know."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"\\"Leeway Cottage\\" is so good that I tried to SLOW DOWN so I wouldn't finish it too fast...but I couldn't! All the characters are so vivid and interesting and Gutcheon does a fabulous job showing us their growth and change. There was a wonderful wealth of historical information about the Danish experience in WWII that I had never read about before in such rich, if disturbing, detail.To call this novel \\"great beach reading\\" is to trivialize its impact and depth...but it certainly is the book to select if you want to be transported this summer."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"I get the feeling that Beth Gutcheon knew a bit about the Danish resistance during WWII and created a story to fit around it. After doing extensive research of the role of the Danes in saving their Jewish population, she wrote the book. Unfortunately, the stories just don't mesh.I found Sydney to be an interesting and complicated character. I didn't care for her for most of the book, but I understood how she became the woman she was. All she's looking for is acceptance and strives her whole life for her mom's approval, even while taking joy in irritating her. The fact that Sydney herself alienates her daughters as her mother alienated her makes perfect sense. After all, her mother's behavior toward her guarantees that Sydney will never feel loved enough. In her mind she's under-appreciated and for once wants to be the center of attention. She achieves that with her frequent angry outbursts and by being difficult with everyone. She finally gets a measure of acceptance from her troublesome son, Jimmy, but only as long as she lets him do whatever he wants and defends him, no matter what the charges are and how guilty he is. Yes, Sydney drinks too much, is self-absorbed and spoiled and has no concept of the enormity of what happened to Jews in Europe during WWII, but she herself mentions how small her world is. Her experiences are simply too narrow. How many of us would have been the same way if we lived during that time?I was disappointed with the lack of info on Berthe's suicide after Sydney found out about it. What happened? And what about Sydney being found in the embrace of an obviously gay woman? What happened? After Candace and whats-his-face die, what happened to The Plywoods?The portion of the book spent in Europe was absolutely compelling. I would like to read an entire book on that alone. It was well written and inspiring. I put myself in Nina and Per's position and wondered if I would've risen to the challenge. The last chapter, which I presume to be part of Laurus's life movie, was brutal and I'm glad there wasn't more of that in the book, to be honest. But in the other parts of the book, Nina is no more a major character than her parents, Gladdy, etc. So, how strange that the only portion of the movie we see is about her, and not all of Laurus's life, like why he stayed with Sydney.One more thing - I reread the first chapter of the book, as I frequently do when a book starts in the present and then goes back in time. I'd forgotten about the big deal the kids made about The Dress they found in an upstairs closet. I had to really think about it and then realized it was the dress that Sydney wore at her Coming Out, when her mother came down in the exact same dress. I don't know. While it was a turning point in that it pushed Sydney out of the house, it just didn't seem memorable enough to warrant the treatment it got in the first chapter as if we were supposed to expect some big scene with the dress.Aaaanyway, I know I had some other issues with the book and would love to sit in a room with the rest of the people who wrote reviews, esp. the 5-star reviews, but I'll have to be content with reading further reviews to see if anyone can give me the insight I missed.One more thing, I read More Than You Know recently and didn't find it to be the Tour de Force that everyone seems to think it is. I obviously missed something!"},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"I came to Amazon after finishing the book hoping to find discussion of its many puzzles.As I read the book, I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop: was Annabee/Sydney the daughter of Berthe Hanenberger Brant, or of Candace? How did Berthe really die, in childbirth or suicide? How did James meet Candace, and why did he marry her?After going back through the book, I see that Berthe was supposed to have died in 1910, and Sydney was born in 1919. So that shoots that theory, but when Sydney began studying music after leaving home I thought for sure she was Berthe's daughter.I loved the Moss family story. I think I understand why Nina's camp horror chapter comes at the end: Laurus has died, and he is seeing the \\"movie in heaven\\" that shows \\"the scenes you missed and the parts you never understood.\\"The reader gets to understand some things, too: during Nina's visit to Leeward Cottage in 1947, she refuses to go pick up the crying baby, much to Sydney's irritation, and now we know why.I was hoping for more, after Nina's chapter. I wanted the missing parts of Candace's and Berthe's lives.After some brilliant childhood descriptions, the daughters' later lives were not well drawn in my opinion. I couldn't tell them apart, and lost track of who they, and Jimmie, married.One mystery, the affair between Sydney and Neville, was well dealt with. Another, the brief embrace between Sydney and another woman in 1943, remains completely veiled.Sydney was a puzzle all right.This would make a great book club discussion book, with collaborative minds to comb through all the little hints scattered throughout the narrative that are so easy to overlook."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"What a shambles this book is! There are three parts, basically. The first part is somewhat interesting as a family relationship builds, though it is weak overall. The center part about the Danish involvement in World War II is utterly fascinating and written to entice. The last part is a completely boring pedestrian mess! It's as if the writer just gave up after the WWII section and was forced to just keep writing about family members, basically listing a bunch of things that happened without any interest in the characters themselves. Then the last three chapters, which are completely out of sync with the storyline, are just thrown at us...attempting to explain a few bland statements made throughout the book.As an avid reader of about 20 books a year, I normally pass books on to others to read when I'm done, but I would NEVER torture anyone I care about by handing them this book to read. So I threw it out when I finished. What a waste of time and paper! And the sad thing is, if you got rid of the first part and the last part of the book, you'd have a thoroughly fascinating novel about the Danish involvement in WWII. THAT by itself would be the only thing worth reading. How sad that THAT intriguing story got bogged down surrounded by a bunch of rubbish!"},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. I enjoyed the beginning, reading about Sydney's unhappy childhood. She desperately wanted to be loved and approved of, especially by her stepmother Candace. She finally had enough and was strong enough to take her chances and pursue her dreams in New York. I also enjoyed the middle of the book about what it was like in Denmark during WWII. I don't know much about Danish history during the war. The stories of the Allies and Danish attempts to transport the Danish Jews and Resistant forces was inspiring. Reading what Nina went through in the camps was so heartbreaking.What I did not enjoy was the last half of the book after the end of the war. The book jumped around too much about Sydney & Laurus's complex relationship and the lives of their children and Laurus's family. I was disappointed that Sydney, who once seemed strong and independent enough to leave her home and seek New York, who took up carpentry and painting their new home, ended up turning into this neurotic person. I felt the author did not explain this change enough in the book. Laurus remained devoted to Sydney but I was left wondering why? Guilt perhaps? The children were one dimensional and the book jumped from their childhood to their marriage, and then their own children too quickly."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"When I first started reading this book, I thought it was going to be a family saga about debutantes with a summer house in Maine. Fortunately, that was not the case. The book actually revolves around WWII, especially the Danes' feat of protecting the lives of almost all of their 7000 Jews. Sydney, an aspiring teenage singer in the U.S., leaves her jealous mother, takes her trust fund, and moves to New York. There she meets Laurus, a half-Jewish Dane who becomes her accompanist. Shortly after they're married, he goes to Europe to assist in the war effort. The harrowing experiences of Jews in Denmark, including Laurus's parents, attempting to escape to Sweden, is the most gripping section of the book. The situation in Europe is sharply contrasted with Sydney's life, where she is remodeling Leeway Cottage, the summer home she has purchased in Maine, and giving birth to her first child. This book is largely about Laurus's and Sydney's marriage and their relationships with their children. Sydney begins to harbor animosity toward her daughters, just as her mother did toward her, and dotes on her son Jimmy, who can't stay out of trouble. The marriage itself is a big question mark. Laurus believes that in heaven you'll see a movie of your life in which everything is explained, and the author reveals the essence of the marriage in the finale."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"I liked this book on audio better that the written story.This is perfect car ride story that will gift you some historical mind candy about the Danish in WW2, we see how a young girl grows up to more like her mother that she would like to admit, get a mere peek into the like of a wealthy family and the rules that surround it, how a family just sprouts up, and how our parents seem to be more that we could have imagined. I loved that we never really got the idea smashed into our face that each character is in some way a hero in their own right. Each character has a journey that we could call a heroes tale. But I agree with the other reviewers: Yes there are unfinished storylines that keep us wondering and THAT is the point- all questions will be answered in the end when we meet our own \\"movie\\" in the sky. The author DID offer on a platter what was the unfinished story line of one character that was in the concentration camp and why she never married. It was not what we expected and that was gift."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"This book needs an editor to either pull the two distinct stories together -- or, even better, delete the beginning and end and build the book around the middle. The middle is absolutely fascinating. I have read many books about WWII and the Holocaust, and this is the first time I've read about the Danish resistance and efforts to save the Jews. If the book was built around that, it would have been fascinating.Unfortunately, the beginning and end focus on an uninteresting family saga, with too many characters, and far too few compelling events. The connection between these two sections and the middle is virtually nonexistent. Even the style of writing is different, with some chapters starting with years and others not; some written in past tense, some written in present tense. There is no logic to any of it.And the end is a nightmare, going from the family, flashing back to experiences in a concentration camp, and then back to a love affair. None of it is clearly explained. I was planning to lend the book to a friend simply because the middle was so good. Now that I've finished it, I know I can't inflict it on anyone else because the end is so bad."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"My wife recommended it to me; I read it and bought a copy for my sister. What strikes me, in brief, is that it is pitch perfect, depicts a range of very, very believable personal relationships, and also moves out from its local focus (a summer community on the coast of Maine) to take in circumstances of much greater scale and broad significance. In the end, a wrenchingly moving story."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"While I found the storie to be overall enjoyable it took a bit of time to get the feel of the authors intent. Would recommend the book but remember it takes a few pages to get into the heart of it."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"I'm still amazed that Beth Gutcheon's editor would allow this book to be released. There are two completely different stories here that do not work together, despite the fact that the main characters are touched by both. On the one hand, this is a novel of a twentieth century marriage, with its ups and downs. (And, as part of that story, there is the impact of a indifferent mother on her daughter's own ability to be a loving mother when it is her turn to raise a family.) And then there is the very moving story of Danish Jews during World War II. There is a recurring theme that Sidney, of the \\"first story\\" doesn't have any understanding for Nina's harrowing experiences during the war in the \\"second story.\\" The author cannot even find a way to reveal Nina's experiences and so throws it in at the end of the book, perhaps to make the reader feel that the book had more of an impact that it actually had. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"Leeway Cottage tells a family saga through many years. The story involves social changes as well as involvement in, and results of, WWII. It is easy to read, and the characters are interesting, if somewhat inconsistent. Some of the segments describing the war did not seem particularly integral to the story as a whole, but the author does make the point that wartime tragedy remains a specter that affects individuals and families forever."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed Leeway Cottage and will look for more novels by Beth Gutcheon. I especially enjoyed her character development of Sydney. I started out feeling a bit sorry for her and then came to find her very spoiled and annoying and certainly out of touch with the realities of the war and what Nina must have gone thru (revealed rather oddly at the end of the book). I can appreciate the complexities of putting such a story together, but I too felt like I would have liked to know more about certain issues that were just brushed by. I do agree that the last part of the book was rather rushed towards the ending (beginning?) of Sydney and Laurus's deaths and their children's reactions. This was a book that could have been another 100 pages or so longer. It was very interesting and enjoyable reading though and I do enjoy this author. I also learned a lot about Denmark's handling of the Nazi invasion. They were very brave souls!"},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"I really loved this book. I was captivated by the story of the Danish Resistance and how the whole country worked together to save the Jews. I have already started reading websites and searching for other books to learn more about this subject. I thought the author described the Danish characters and stories just beautifully. The other story line (Sidney and her mother) was a bit weaker, but still enjoyable. I was pulled into the world the author created in Maine, but I just didn't like Sidney very much. I suppose we weren't really supposed to, as over time she seemed to become more and more like her domineering mother. Overall, a really special book that I just couldn't stop reading."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"First, this is two books in one. One skims over the surface of Sydney's life and family in Maine and the other deals with the plight of Jews in Denmark during WWII. Of the two parts, the Denmark section is by far the more compelling. However, the linkage between the two stories is very weak--beyond the obvious marriage/family connections. As I read the book, I kept thinking \\"And what...?\\" and \\"So...?\\" The interview with the author in my copy didn't help much: \\"America and Europe.\\" OK. Sure. Whatever. I assume that there was a reason this novel was called \\"Leeway Cottage\\" and not \\"The Resistance in Denmark\\" but I am not sure what it is.Sydney and her family are boring people. We learn next to nothing about them beyond what is on the surface. They have money and a house in Maine and go there and have a wonderful time sailing and socializing. OK. She changes her name from Annabelle to Sydney. OK. She has a selfish, egocentric, not-very-nice mother, who tries unsuccessfully to be controlling, but who is nonetheless far from a life-spoiling \\"monster mother.\\" OK. She has a spoiled brat of a son who seems to have turned out more-or-less well in the end after much minor trouble. OK. She has a long marriage that works and doesn't work in equal parts, but this is never really explained or explored. OK. She has a sister-in-law with whom she initially wants a warm relationship but can't establish one because their life experiences are too different and then resents her. (Are we supposed to understand this novel as a contrast between Sydney and Nina and their experience of life? Between America and Europe? If so, what nonsense!) She has an affair of some sort with a longtime friend and neighbor. OK. She doesn't understand other people at all and doesn't care. OK. As a old lady, she is bitchy to the hairdresser. OK. It goes on and on.The book often seems like no more than a list of biographical facts as the characters march through time. It is flat and one dimensional mostly.But just what does the author think that all this means? Who are these people? What do their experiences tell us about the human condition? What can we learn from them? Not much, I think. In the best novels, the characters live on the page and teach us about what it means to live. In the best novels, we are educated as well as diverted and entertained, often without realizing teaching is going on. In the best novels, we see the world in new ways and our experience is expanded. We come to understand the characters, their successes and failures, their essential humanness.To my mind, this novel does not do any of this. To my mind, this novel is a failure. I think the author would have done much better writing a thriller about the Danish resistance. Why is it that a theme that is removed in time and place--the subject of \\"research\\"--is more vivid and real than the theme that is \\"closer to home.\\" It does seem to turn the advice to write what you know on its head. It does make one wonder what the point of it all is."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"i ordered this book long before it was released in eager anticipation of another beth gutcheon book to add to my cherished collection. each of her novels is unique in setting, scope, and subject matter, and this one is no exception. i'm savoring leeway cottage slowly, like a hot cup of tea on a cold, rainy afternoon, and recommending it to anyone who love a well-written story with memorable characters and an entralling plot."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"I loved this book.

The story ranges from Sydney's childhood to her death and the road from being an emotionally scarred child to a an emotionally scarring mother and grandmother. Unfortunately, so often we become the very people we have despised earlier. The plot involving the Danish resistance during WWII was very interesting and one that I have not run across in any other historical fiction. The writing was readable, precise, and compelling.The only reason I gave this a four star rather than five was the rushed feeling I got during approximately the last fourth of the book. It almost felt as we were fast-forwarding just to get to the end. And, although the chapter of Nina's horrific experiences in a German concentration camp helped explain her personality, it almost seemed a bit gratuitous, but it did provide a sharp contrast to the selfish and shallow yet sad Sydney.I would recommend this to any lover of historical fiction especially during WWII and after."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"Leeway Cottage by Beth Gutcheon is a wonderfully written story that is a blend of her vivid storytelling and obvious research. She paints such a clear picture of life in summer village in Maine, as well as the contrast between the summer residents and the lives of those upstairs and downstairs. The other portion the novel reveals a part of history that is unknown by many of the readers--wartime Denmark. I was familiar with the version of history where Denmark handed over the nation the Nazis but was certainly not aware of the nation's struggle to protect and preserve its Jewish population, and that it was done with such a massive success.Through the course of these two landscapes, Gutcheon details the life of a marriage and how that changes and evolves between two people, especially between two people from such different worlds. Her characters will have you switching allegiances throughout the book, an impressive feat.I finished reading this book with a feeling of love for Leeway Cottage as deep as that of the characters who spent their lives there. It is certainly a book that I will continue to recommend. It was purchased by my mother, who purchased a copy for me, and I then purchased a copy for my father-in-law."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"This book depicts the plight of Danish Jews as they went through the Holocaust experience. This book describes the horrible conditions in the concentration camps. You will learn what happened to the Jews and the people that helped save their lives. At the same time; Americans summered in Leeway Cottage on the coast of Maine virtually living in a different world during the war years. The book also describes the toxic relationship of a daughter and a mother. You will discover whether the daughter transfers her miserable experiences with her mother or becomes a wonderful wife and mother. It also talks about five seperate and different marriages and the children born of these unions There is a very surprising ending that will shock you.You will become familiar with the characters lives before, during and after the war years. You will love some of the characters and despise others.I couldn't wait to turn the pages of this book as I lived the experiences that were so well described in this book.

The loose ends really bother me. Early on we learn that Sydney's father's first wife died from complications of childbirth. Later we are told she committed suicide and then nothing more. Very frustrating! It is hinted that Sydney may have been in love with a woman while Laurus is in Europe. We never learn more. Is this just a crumb to titillate or to indicate a change in Sydney? If so it is too inconclusive and leaves the reader feeling of dissatisfied. Jimmy, Sydney's son, drops out and does drugs for ten years. Other than Laurus getting him a job on a lobster boat early on to straighten him out--nobody seems to care. Wouldn't there be some parental hair pulling over this? So while it is a readable book I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"This is an amazing book! Starting with a light-hearted description of life among the privileged Maine summer people circa 1920s, one is plunged into the wartime years on both sides of the Atlantic. The two stories--one of fun and games at the Maine cottages, the other of desparate efforts to save Denmark's Jews from extinction--play against each other like the masks of comedy and tragedy. Beth Gutcheon has written a masterful novel based on what must have been personal familiarity with the Maine scene and careful research into the history of Denmark during World War II. I learned a great deal about both locales in a format that is well-paced, beautifully written, and a joy to read. This book shows Gutcheon at her absolute best and should be a real contender for national literary prizes. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"I am going to disagree with the other two reviews here about Leeway Cottage. The story was very good at the start and then seriously slowed down when we got to the war. It was hard to follow at times, and I certainly did not read anything that was laugh out loud funny. This was a serious story about family dysfunction and the effects of war.I honestly found myself skimming the book towards the middle and end just to be let down in the last two chapters. Talk about a quick ending.If you want to read a good book by this author, try More Than You Know."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"The only other book I've read by Ms. Gutcheon was 'More Than You Know', and I loved it. This book however was not nearly as entertaining or interesting.I'm not going to summarize this book, as many here have already done...but my opinion is that the characters were all one-dimensional. Sidney started out OK, with the father she loved passing away too soon, and left with her awful mother. She really wanted to be someone different then what she grew up with, but as she ages, she just turns into another run-of-the-mill demanding rich woman who summers in Maine.I gave this three stars because the idea of the story was interesting, I just don't think it was executed as well as it could have been. The two stories just didn't fit together, and the ending was confusing. What's with that last chapter?In the end...I'll still read Ms. Gutcheon's future novels, but I've learned not to expect as much as I did with this book, because I was definitely disappointed."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage: A Novel","review":"I too read Gutcheon's novel More Than You Know and felt it was a wonderfully evocative story of downeast Maine, as well as a love story and ghost story. I cared about the characters, the various threads of plot intertwined in provocative ways, and I was left wanting to read more by this author.Very early on, Leeway Cottage was very a book that seemed almost pointless, with characters barely developed beyond their simplest histories. The characters run about, doing this and that, but seldom experience any understanding, unless the author tells us exactly what they understood. Characters are not revealed; they are described. The whole book reads like the To-Do lists of each character.There are inconsistencies. For instance, why, when the central character Sidney is starting out and is clearly trying to create a more humane and sensitive life for herself, does she become the nasty, self-centered person who shuns her husband's sister Nina because of her distant behavior? Nina was imprisoned in a concentration camp and endured horrors that wouldn't bear the telling; yet Sydney writes her off as snooty and her husband seems content to let it happen. Sydney's greatest sacrifice during WW II was difficulty getting good servants for her summer house. Sydney's indulgent arrogance is not consistent with her earlier struggle to become a more authentic person. We completely stop caring about her. Her life becomes a mere recitation of her shopping lists. Why attach poor Nina's story at the end? Why not as part of the narrative? Who cares about rich, dissatisfied people like Sydney? You will find nothing that enriches your life in the telling of Sydney's.Even the children's stories are oddly stunted. Sydney's son Jimmy is a delinquent and ne'er-do-well. One moment he is a miserable teenaged twerp who is given a tough last-chance job working as a sternman on a lobster boat but the next time we seen him, he has a wife, children, and a successful online gaming company. How exactly did he arrive at this point in his life? We are to guess at the intervening 10 years. You could have subtracted his character completely and it wouldn't have made any difference to the story. We learn nothing about him other than his mother spoils him and his sisters are jealous of that. Nothing more. I kept waiting for some character development other than descriptions of their days sailing on the coast of Maine and their inevitable aging. I was still waiting at the end of the book.Gutcheon has a gift for writing a good narrative and good descriptions. Because I know that part of Maine, I enjoyed at least that part of the book but that was all. Everything that made More Than You Know a good read was absent in this novel, except for her narrative skills. But if you are looking for anything approaching character development, conflict and resolution - all the things that make for good literature - forget it. It's not here."},{"Title":"Mastering the New Testament, Vol. 12: 1,2,3, John & Revelation","review":"Palmer comes at the text with decades of experience as one of America's leading preachers, pastoring at the end of his career the largest Presbyterian Church (USA) congregation. He writes for those who preach.The theme to which he calls our attention is John's emphasis on the centrality of Christ. Palmer notes in both the work on 1John and on Revelation that the cults of the last century went most wrong where they pulled some peripheral element of their faith into the center, where only Jesus belonged.The only weakness of the text comes from the work on Revelation. Here Palmer reminds us repeatedly that the images of suffering in the text are always bounded. The suffering is never total, because Christ brackets the suffering. However, the curious reader of Revelation wants to know something of why John uses the images that he does. It's hard to walk away from the text knowing that only in some metaphorical way that suffering is limited, when what I wanted to know was: why horses? why scrolls? why trumpets? why animals? If nothing else, a more thorough analysis of the Old Testament sources of the imagery and context of the Roman Empire would have elucidated the text.Nonetheless, Palmer's work is accessible, practical, and orthodox.

The 12 academics and authors that Dawes selected are known for being pioneers in one sense or another in the study of the historiocity of the New and Old Testaments.Each of these researchers/writers are introduced with a brief biography and overview of their work and thought, with an excerpt following of some of their more famous works. Unfortunately, the introductions are pretty brief and the information cursory. The excerpts leave a bit to be desired as well, as the editor is trying to compress a lifetime of study and perhaps thousands of written pages by each of these noted scholars into a few pages.If you are new to the topic, the book may provide an OK introduction, but in general, there is not enough depth to interest the more knowledgeable reader, and the excerpted information and the introductions are going to be tough for a novice to really absorb and understand."},{"Title":"Leaves of Gold","review":"I received a copy of Leaves of Gold as a graduation gift from high school in 1964.

She represents the regular, real live people who call us for help when something burns, or something hurts, or something breaks.\\" Brunacini believes that a lot of her immediate and long-term future depends not only on how fire departments respond to her call for help, but also on how she is treated during this very emotional time for her.An important reason for this book, he says, is that \\"I believe she (the customer) should begin to play the central role in both our personal and professional (occupational) mentality and in our organizational service delivery game plan.\\"He adds that most firefighters have a strong action orientation and a natural inclination to focus more on the hard technical-tactical part of the job, \\"rather than on the \`soft' human stuff.Keeping a sense of humor throughout, Brunacini says that this manual is the result of \\"a series of thoughts, ideas, hallucinations, and reflections relating to fire department customer service.\\"The book's chapters elaborate on the following eight themes:1. Our essential mission and number-one priority is to deliver the best possible service to our customers. 2. Always be nice and treat everyone with respect, kindness, patience, and consideration. 3. Always attempt to execute a standard problem-solving outcome that is quick, effective, skillful, safe, caring, managed. 4. Regard everyone as a customer. 5. Consider how you and what you are doing looks to others. 6. Don't disqualify the customer with your qualifications. 7. Basic organizational behavior must become customer-centered. 8. We must continually improve our customer service performance.Examples of various incidents show members of the Smith family in distressing situations. Any fire department would handle the emergency itself in short order, but the distress can be long lasting. Brunacini advocates attending to all of the details of the distress, including explaining what the firefighters are doing and why, taking care of the pets if necessary, driving a spouse to the hospital if necessary, or securing the contents of a car after the driver is transported to the hospital.One incident features a traveler (Mr. Smith) passing through the airport for a connecting flight home but who instead slips, falls, and injures his leg. Fire department personnel secure the passenger's baggage from the airline (he may need it if he has to stay in the hospital overnight), transport him to the hospital, get the spouse's phone number and call her with a report, communicate with the hospital about a release time, check with the airline about replacement flights, transport the man back to the airport, and call his spouse to let her know of his arrival time.Brunacini asks, What was the cost of the value the crew added to the service delivery? Not much, but the victim may remember the outstanding service longer than the pain of the injury. The fire department crew simply treated Mr. Smith \\"the way they would like to be treated if they landed in a strange place with a smushed ankle.\\"Here is the Golden Rule in action."},{"Title":"Essentials of Fire Department Customer Service","review":"This book is entertaining and fun to read wih great stories and fun cartoons. The book provides a sound basis for implementing change at every level of the fire service. It helps departments put the &quot;service&quot; back in fire service. I especially enjoyed the way that the book relates to personnel on the street, those that have the customer contact. It shows how everone wins when we provide customer service: the department, the individual firefighters, and the citizens. While the focus is on the service provided by emergency crews, the message can be adapted for other individuals in the fire service, from fire inspectors to administration.This book should be required reading at the academy - maybe the first topic."},{"Title":"Essentials of Fire Department Customer Service","review":"As a relative newcomer to the fire service (volunteer of two years) I was inspired by this book which covers a fire departments' duty to the public. Cheif Brunacini urges firemen and fire departments to go beyond the traditional duty of extenguishing fires to one that recognizes that often there is extra time during and after an incident to go the extra mile to get a &quot;WOW!&quot; recation from &quot;customers&quot; (taxpayers). He also points out the subtleties of increased morale and image of the department with such an approach. This book is very easy reading, laced with lots of good humor, anecdotes and illustrations."},{"Title":"Essentials of Fire Department Customer Service","review":"Brunacini covers customer service in a to the point witty way.

I was analyzing and concentrating too much on the wrong things. I put off reading it for a while because I felt I didn't have time with practicing and school. HUGE mistake! Once I read it, though, it changed my performance within DAYS, and I became really stable and won my last major competition after a terrible senior year.

And, I think his message got diluted.But, his first book is extraordinary. It changed the way people approached their lives.The author is an excellent tennis player, and his knowledge and love for the game also come through big time in this book.

It shifted my focus into positive thinking, or non-thinking. I stopped figiting with myself and focused on the ball. I began to experience \\"being in the zone\\" in one particular double tournament. My opponents couldn't believe how they could let the game slipped away when they were ahead 5-3. I went back and read the book from time to time and had given a few of them away to my friends.

I scaled back my practicing and just kept the book with me on the road. While I didn't win any tournaments, I placed second in four of them!This is NOT just a tennis book.

Simply put it, this book teaches you how to learn. Gallwey seems to be a highly introspective, deep-thinking individual, and his reflective statements are proof of that.

This battle between the two selves can be found in many psychological, philosophical, and religious literature s.

The book contains a number of exercises on how to really pay attention to what is happening on the court (both with the ball and one's body), allow one's body and temperament to withhold judgement and find what works for oneself. In truth, many of the excellent bits of advice that are described here specifically for tennis could be easily generalized to other physical or even intellectual activities where one's preconceived notion of an ideal gets judgementally in the way of mastery.

It is never too late to learn!"},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"\\"The Inner game Of Tennis\\" talks about 2 identities within the player. Identity 1 is the mind - the one who scolds identity 2 for not making a point or blowing a good opportunity. That identity is actually the ego - wanting to win for the \\"I'm better than you\\" prize. Identity 2 is the one doing the grunt work - the body. The thrust of the book teaches the concept of improving the relationship between identity 1 & 2 so that the mental static from 1 no longer interferes with 2's ability to achieve excellence in playing the game. The author makes the point that the body can learn and correct mistakes on it's own without being told by the mind everything the body is doing wrong. The author has discovered this by giving his tennis students less instruction and finding that they actually do better when they are not bogged down with lots of things to remember. He encourages to just let the body feel what it needs to do. He suggests letting identity 1 ask the body to picture a shot, then make it. Once 1 asks this, he \\"leaves the room\\" so to speak and TRUSTS the body to carry out the request. This means the ego part has little to boast about, or cry about once the shot is attempted since his opinion is no longer relevant. He just TRUSTS the body to get the job done. i don't know if this is making sense to you, but after applying this on the court it is making a lot of sense to me. It really seems to make a difference. I'm totally calm during the game and I'm no longer mad at myself when my shots don't quite accomplish what I intend. I accept that i am in the 'developing' process. I say all of that just so I can share this comical observation with you. The sad part about achieving what the book teaches is, you win more...but you don't care! LOLOL. Since you've gotten your ego out of the mix, winning doesn't mean diddly squat! ...and that's just not as much fun! LOLOL its weird!!! When you play with a detached ego, you may be scoring points, but there's no adrenaline rush....that all belonged to the ego! I think it's really comical how that works. Sure it's still fun going out there and winning a set, but when there's no ego around, there's no drama either...and that's part of the fun of any sport. LOL.After applying what I learned in this book, I am definitely winning more games...I'm just not having as much fun doing it! LOL. Weird how that works!

Even though the book is titled for tennis but the techniques presented aren't really tennis specific but are general to sports performance. After applying the techniques in the book my game took a quantum leap. It really did wonders to my on-court performance. I'm generally a person that's very demanding of myself. But even so I was extremely pleased with the result.Later on I transitioned into playing tennis. I had to give up racquetball because the two sports are interfering with each other. But I have no complaints. New sport, new challenges. After a number of years of progressing my games in the new sport of tennis, my skill level stopped improving and just stalled. So I decided to apply what's in the book to my tennis games just like what I did with racquetball. Guess what ? The result is disastrous. Not only does it not work, often times it's even detrimental. It's almost like every time I tried to apply it to my tennis game I end up losing everything on the court. Granted seemingly I'm a lot calmer now after losing, compared to say when I win half of my sets not trying to apply the book's techniques before. But the book failed miserably in its aim to help me perform at my peak on the court.I have no idea why the book worked wonders for my racquetball game but did the opposite for my tennis. The funny thing is, the author wrote it specifically for the sport of tennis in mind, even though it can be applied to other sports just the same as I noted above. And yet it is in that target sport of tennis it failed to deliver for me."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"I read this many years ago and loved it."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"I liked this book more and more, the farther I got!"},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"this book sucks. it only talks about one thing, to not think when your playing tennis. then it goes around over and over just rephrasing itself. i think the author may have took drugs to be this tripped out."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"This book started off making sense but then it kept talking about Self A and Self B....

I started tennis late but being athletic quickly could play above my experience. Eventually I hit the wall, getting beat repeatedly and having the complete inability to be a human on the court. This book simply showed me what was really going on in my mind. And, more importantly, that it goes on in everyone's mind to some extent. Not being a philosophical person nor a follower of Eastern Spirituality, these very basic concepts were Greek to me. But they make certain logical sense.Having said all that, I'm still not sure exactly what I need to do for a complete change. I know I need to stop the Self 1 and 2 conflicts occurring in my mind and I need to concentrate on minor things like breathing rather than let my mind wander to failure. But how I will be able to apply this is still somewhat of a quandary as I am so regimented in my approach. One thing is for sure, I need to make the attempt.Overall, I recommend this book highly whether a tennis player or not to look at your activity from a totally different light. To me the most compelling statement is that this book was written due to a \\"dumped\\" volley on match point to win the Boys National Championship. Having \\"dumped\\" and choked many points on a much lower level, I can understand the inspiration for the book. Read this book for a different perspective."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"Tennis has been one of my favorite sports for many years, although I've never been that good at it (3.5 USTA rating, which is sorta intermediate). I had never heard about this book until it caught my eye at the library, and it intrigued me. I'm not that big on instructional books, because sports are so visual it's almost impossible to describe (for example) all the things your body needs to do to hit a decent serve. In my own game, my serve has actually deteriorated quite a bit over the years, and all my attempts at &quot;fixing&quot; it only seemed to make it worse.Then, I happened to watch Andy Roddick play on TV at the 2003 US Open. As you probably know, Mr. Roddick has hit the fastest serve ever recorded (150+MPH), and is one of the best tennis players in the world. What really amazed me about his serve is that his motion isn't very complicated (like Pete Sampras or John McEnroe, to date myself). What I noticed is that his main focus when serving is simply to make perfect, solid contact with the ball and send it on its way over the net. Somehow, I was able to lock in on a mental image of Roddick getting his racket, arm and shoulder into perfect position to hit a killer serve. Then, just goofing around really, I took some balls to my local park and started whacking serves the way I thought Roddick would if he was in my body. The results were immediate and impressive. My velocity went up dramatically, and I just felt so much more comfortable than I had for years.In this book, the author says he noticed that if he watched Frankie Albert play QB for the SF 49ers and then played street football with his friends (pretending he was Albert), he could throw much better than usual. I totally agree with what he's saying, and my Roddick experience above is another example. In fact, what got me started playing tennis was the total style, class, and enjoyment that was Bjorn Borg's game in the 70's-80's.So, I agree with most if not all of the author's lessons, especially finding someone to &quot;be like&quot; and then &quot;being like&quot; that person. I also agree with the importance of getting your analytical, critical mind (Self 1) to focus on things like the spin of the ball or the sound it makes when your opponent hits a shot. Where I think the author sells the reader short is by not making two points:1. TENNIS IS NOT EASY. While keeping your Self 1 under control will definitely help, everyone has physical limitations, and tennis is a difficult hand-eye coordination exercise. In my opinion, the main reason tennis has fizzled in popularity in recent years is because it's basically a hard game to learn. The author probably skips this point to avoid scaring people off, but he could counter by mentioning that the Inner Game will make tennis less difficult and more enjoyable.2. TENNIS REQUIRES LOTS OF PRACTICE. This book is somewhat Zen-like in its approach, but any Zen book will tell you that the most important part of your practice is, well, practice. By this I don't mean hours of boring drills and instruction, I just mean playing on a consistent basis with a variety of levels, watching matches on TV or in person, and spending some time hitting by yourself or with a friend.I still gave the book 5 stars, because I think it can help anyone's game and other aspects of life as well. I'm also reading his books on work and golf, but to me the author's forte is tennis so I'm glad I started with this one."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"I am not a tennis player. I am a pool player and everything said in this book applies to the inner game (except chapter five.) As I read this book I thought to myself-I do that, I do this. My nine ball game has improved dramatically. I went from just finishing out of the money to placing at least third in my last eight events (which has made me about three thousand dollars.) What a great book and highly recommended for any competitive player in any non-team sport."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"Does it matter how and what we think about while we are playing tennis ? Yes, it matters so much that it affects our tennis performance significantly and could even affect our mental well being. W. Timothy Gallwey obviously understands both tennis and psychology very well and has written an excellent book that very clearly explains why it matters how we think about our tennis performance. As a long time tennis player I enjoyed reading the book and learned very much from it. I am eager to start applying Gallwey's advice as soon as possible. If you often scold yourself everytime you make a \\" mistake \\" and / or you are trying too hard but not quite achieving the performance you aim in tennis then you can not afford to not read this book. I read it twice and I recommend that everybody read it again and again every few months.Many tennis instructors do not know the psychological aspect of the game that is so well explained in the book. Their ignorance is obvious from the incessant verbal instructions they give their students.The harmful and correct ways of thinking explained in the book are not limited to tennis ; they can be applied to our self talk about anything and to any interaction between humans such as parenting, marriage, social, work and other relationships.The types of scolding comments and even positive instructions and praise we make to ourselves either silently or aloud when we are playing tennis are self defeating ; they re- enforce the performance that we label unsatisfactory. Then the negative comments we make to ourselves about our tennis performance become self fulfilling prophecies.Timothy Gallwey demonstrates that it is no use to replace negative self talk with positive self talk neither. Because positive thinking is actually negative thinking in disguise ; it communicates the demand for good performance and is therefore manipulative. Thus positive self talk and manipulative self praise also have an unfavorable effect on our tennis performance although not as much as negative self talk. Any instructions we give ourselves such as : \\" tilt the face of the racket a little more \\" or \\" I hit it very well this time \\" also interfere with the natural method of learning which is much more effective. We have the potential to learn naturally which is possible only when we let go, that is when we shut up and stop criticizing or praising our performance, stop giving instructions to ourselves and stop trying too hard to correct our mistakes.So what is the correct and effective method of improvement in tennis ? It is visualization in our mind of the desired strokes and consistent practice on the court. This practice must be without interference from the disruptive way of thinking and self talk. Gallwey does not propose that we do not pay attention to our tennis strokes. On the contrary, he says we must feel and be aware of our strokes without judgement i.e. without labelling our strokes as bad or good. If you think you are making mistakes eg : the ball keeps on getting caught in the net when you hit it, instead of saying to yourself things such as : \\" You loser ! you couldn't hit even one ball over the net ! \\" just observe how you play non - judgementally and visualize in your mind's eye the ball clearing the net and landing inside your opponent's court and continue to play. Do this consistently without giving yourself verbal instructions about how to hit the ball ( aloud or silent ), be patient and observe the eventual correction in your strokes.He says that each human being has two selves ; Self 1 who continually makes judgements about the performance of Self 2 and scolds or praises it. In the meantime Self 2 is trying to play tennis under nagging and much less often praising from Self 1.Self 2 has the natural ability to learn and improve, like a toddler learns to walk naturally without any lessons nor comments from parents about how to walk. But Self 2 can not learn naturally nor effectively as long as Self 1 judges and comments negatively or positively about Self 2's tennis performance and rolls out instructions to it. What we need to do is to silence Self 1 , visualize in our mind the desired strokes, continue practicing on the court and trust our body and mind's natural ability to learn. The power of visualization in the mind with open or closed eyes ( with open eyes when you are playing of course ) of the desired performance to improve it in sports and other aspects of life is mentioned in many other psychology books too. As I mentioned above this principle is valid whatever we are learning and in our communication with other humans not just in tennis. In fact Gallwey says that Self 1 could be a critical parent and self 2 his / her child.Achieving these will involve unlearning the bad habit of self judgement whether it is negative or positive. Gallwey says that if we fight the bad habit it will get stronger. Instead of fighting the existing bad habit, develop the new habit to replace it. In fact don't even see the bad habit as a habit. Like a toddler who promotes from crawling to walking does not see crawling as a bad habit to get rid of but rather as a stage in development.I observe that in many cases in addition to the disruption from their Self 1s many children taking tennis lessons also have to cope with additional negative comments sometimes even insults, yelling and unproductive praises from their tennis teachers, in front of their parents who bring them to the tennis lessons. The parents think that the tennis teachers are doing the right thing when they scold and yell at their children everytime they make a mistake. The result ; the mistakes get worse instead of being corrected. I have observed the same destructive attitude in swimming, basketball, gymnastics and classrom teachers at schools. It is a pity that most parents, teachers and bosses at the workplace do not know the psychology in this book titled \\" The inner game of tennis \\". Certainly there are tennis and other sports teachers, parents, bosses who are effective communicators but unfortunately they constitute the minority ; most teachers, parents and bosses are of the Self 1 type even if they have no bad intentions. Some of them are aware of the inefficacy of their methods and wish they could replace them with better methods but they can not help it. These teachers, parents bosses their students, children and employees would benefit greatly if the teachers, parents and bosses read and applied this book.In the book the author also gives a detailed action plan about how you can become more aware of your various tennis strokes without thinking about them in the wrong way. Just observe various parts of your strokes non - judgementally, become aware of them, by feeling and hearing them as they are without labelling them as good or bad. If you decide there is a need for improvement visualize your desired correct strokes as you may have observed from competent players. Avoid Self 1 from giving instructions to Self 2 and let it happen. He also gives examples of how dogmas regarding the correct way of hitting various types of strokes have changed overtime ; tennis teachers were scolding their students about some \\" mistakes \\" until tennis pros challenged the dogmas and started playing like the long time believed mistakes. Only then did the non - traditional strokes become generally accepted.Another very important issue the author talks about is the wrong and correct reasons for playing tennis ; if you play tennis because you like the game, want to be healthy and fit, want to make friends and at the same time you want to win from time to time etc. you are on the right track. But if the only reason you play tennis is to win, beat everyone else, prove to yourself and to everybody how great you are then you are playing tennis for the wrong reasons. Tennis is a very good stress reliever when played for the correct reasons. But it becomes a source of stress if played with such selfish motives. There is nothing wrong with wanting to win but if you are playing tennis only to prove your supremacy over other tennis players it is very likely that your motive is to compensate for low self esteem even if you are unaware of this.You may have low self esteem regarding your failures in other aspects of your life ; your social, work, marriage, parenting relationships or other feelings of inferiority. I know tennis players who play very well, but are very unpopular and annoying because they always brag about their tennis and are unhappy about other aspects of their lives. It is OK to want to win and improve in tennis provided that our self esteem does not depend solely on our tennis performance and we do not belittle other tennis players. If currently, knowingly or unknowingly we are relying only on tennis to bail us out of our low self esteem due to other problems in our lives, it makes sense to deal with our low self esteem by reading and applying a good self help book on the subject such as \\" The six pillars of self - esteem \\" written by a psychologist named Nathaniel Branden. If reading and applying that book is not sufficient to improve our self esteem we should seek professional help. Let's play tennis for the correct reasons, not to liberate us from our low self esteem.Like any tennis player I am also pleased with myself when I win after a good game of tennis but I personally do not have the negative, the positive self talk nor the \\" I must be the greatest in tennis otherwise I am no good \\" attitude to the extent described in the book. Still, I found some mental and attitude corrections I need to make about my own tennis. I also realized that I am frocing my 10 year old son too much in tennis. I will ease the pressure on him. It would be nice if he won in the tournaments but not at the expense of his happiness.To summarize I highly recommend that you read \\" The Inner Game of Tennis \\" by W. Timothy Gallwey."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"This book is excellent.As a great believer in learning new things, this book interested me greatly.My tennis has improved enormously,on the mental front firstly.Because of this i can make changes to my game rapidly and without frustration.This advice in the book also helps in other areas of learning.Recently i started to learn spanish and using the inner way of learning i have progressed quickly.Great book you must read it."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"This book not only improved my tennis game, it made the game infinitely more enjoyable for me. Gallwey explores the psychology of tennis, focusing on how most players hurt their game by thinking too much, and offers detailed, common-sense advice to combat that problem. You won't find a lot of specific tips like \\"watch the ball\\" and \\"follow through\\", instead you'll learn how to observe your body and your game in an enlightening way that at the very least will give you a greater appreciation for your abilities, and at most, forever change the way you play tennis - for the better. If you're looking for a book to improve your tennis game, you can't go wrong with the Inner Game of Tennis."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"I bought this book to strenghten my mental game, but it also opened up a new world for me. It showed the path to enlightment by using the concept of self1 and self2. The author has been doing a very good job in explaining the relation of self1 and self2. I have read books written by Krisnamurti and Zen gurus but I never quite grasped the ideas. I wished those gurus using the concept of self1 and self2 as a key to depict their ideas. Now I know if I let self1 control self2 my life will be miserable, but if I use self2 to control self1 I will be in harmony with people and the world I am living in."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"I read this book four years ago on the recommendation of a World Champion in the sport in which I compete - Fast Draw. I had often ranked high at major contests, but had never been able to make it to the winners circle at major competitions during 18 years of shooting. I was pretty sure that the only thing holding me back was the mental game.While reading this book I was amazed at Gallwey's description of mental aspects of competition, and how I had experienced the exact same things. His explanations of how a competitor sabotages his own outcomes showed me what I had been doing wrong. His tips for getting into the correct mindframe made perfect sense, although were probably not the sort of things I would have come up with on my own.After putting these tips into action I really saw a big improvement in my shooting. I won my first major championship within four months, and have been the overall world champion in my sport for three of the last four years.

Concepts are presented which are simple to understand but powerful in their implications. Of course, the &#34;Inner Game&#34; principles can be applied to any area of performance. One of the key ideas which I found helpful applies to managing distracting thoughts. Escaping such thoughts does not involve trying to push them away, but rather, first accepting that they will be there and second, actively putting one's focus on a different point of reference, which typically involves reconnection with physical reality (such as concentrating on breathing, or, if playing tennis, watching the seams of the tennis ball).

It makes a lot of sense to me. It also works well with the way I learned to practice the piano. I try to keep things slow and simple at first, and repeatedly play the same short section of a song until it becomes easy, then increase the speed gradually.What I'm saying is, this book makes sense to me and I think it's useful and practical.I don't play tennis. I was reading reviews about a music book, and one reviewer mentioned that the ideas in that book were based on this one, so I figured I'd just go straight to the source. I think it's true that you can apply most of what you learn in this book to the process of learning other skills, more efficiently and with less frustration.All that said, it does take me some patience to read this book. I stopped reading it maybe 2/3 through. But what I did read was useful.

The inner approach of the tennis game supported me to significantly improve especially on serve and drive shot; the concepts around the inner game of mind in general supported me to add a few powerfull tools to my coaching tool box ( like for example the concept of \\"true competition\\" which confirmed and inforced the context I consider as most functional in the business world too ).Costel Coravu ACC ICFHarmony & Business Coach"},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"The best part about this book is that it is directly applicable to about every situation, project, and endeavor you undertake.

And if so, have you ever wondered why, and what happened? Chances are, you let your \\"inner self\\" do what it does best: be present, relaxed, and be in the moment. Whenever you fixate on trying to dictate the actions you want to take, you tend to tense up, overanalyze, and setup a recurring negative loop. Sounds like another motivational title?

He is certainly as gifted a writer as he is a tennis player - probably more. And his writing comes not from arm chair postulations, but many years of lessons he learned from teaching tennis. I appreciate this dedication to life-long learning and a desire for self improvement. What comes across is a humble sincerity in advice, targeted to help the average player improve himself. In this sense, it really diminishes the relevancy of lessons. For the readers that wanted more practical advice - tennis lessons are for them. One more thing should be said: there are some people who through prejudice are suspicious or resentful of anyone who has claimed to have benefitted from eastern philosophy the way Gallway has. They will dishonestly criticize him for other reasons. I believe in doing what works. This book works for me and everyone I've talked to who has read it. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"This books explains how fully enjoying tennis and excelling at tennis are synonymous. Go figure!

The ideas behind the book seemed right on and I can completely understand why it is seen as such an insightful book. That being said the premise is play with out thinking, react, and play on your sense. In the first two chapters this strategies is laid out in front of you then the rest of the book is dedicated to try to make sure you don't think. That's a lot of reading about not over thinking.

Even a player who is normally quiet should use this book as a tool to stay even more focused.

So, I have read everything out there about the subject. This was one of my first books because it has such a great reputation as the bible of mental tennis mastery.The book is definitely worth a read. First, it explains the WHY of the mental game and the WHY has helped me put things into perspective. Second, it contains gems and valuable tips to employ both in practice and in games to increase mental effectiveness . . . and to avoid the mental traps that keep you from playing your best.Another ebook that I recommend is from Jamie Andrews. In the interest of full disclosure, I know Jamie - we have played tennis together and against each other for years. His mental game is his biggest weapon!

After reading this book, I'll have to say, I did not have the slightest regret for purchasing this book.I had a few doubts about the book before I bought it. Among them were these questions- Will this work for me?- Will it improve my forehand, backhand, serves, ect?- Will this help me win?- Are those negative reviews true?- Is this worth a try?And so on.Although I've only read it once so far, I can already answer several questions that I previously had. YES, it will work for pretty much everybody, although it wouldn't work exactly the same way. Everybody is different, and how this applies to everyone is different as well. But in the end, YES, it will improve your game. It will also improve your forehand, backhand, and other strokes - instead of being constantly worried, trying to hit the ball with all your will but failing to do so, you will be hitting clean shots with a relaxed mind and body. That in turn, will significantly (or even dramatically, like for me) increase your skills on the tennis courts.As for the negative reviewers, I don't know what they were talking about. If you had an average education and could read, then you would have no trouble reading this book! Simple as that. And whereas they claim the book is mindless psychology, it is just exactly the opposite - THIS is how your mind works, and this WILL make your game more efficient.In conclusion, I want to say that I am not paid to write this. Nor am I writing this for profit, praise, etc. I am writing this because it worked for me, and it WILL work for most of us out there. Even if you are part of the people for whom this book does not really effect, buy it anyways. It will change the way you look at tennis forever. 5/5 stars."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"I purchased this book hoping to find information on correct strokes and technique, and though I was somewhat disappointed in this regard (Gallwey offers quite little in this department), what I got out of this book was far greater than I could have hoped. In short, Gallwey advocates a new approach to tennis (and indeed to life) which involves the untangling of the instinctual mind (which he terms Self 2) from the invasive thoughts of the overly self-conscious self (Self 1). In tennis, the incessant demands of Self 1 must be set aside so that the mind can be quieted and the sense of uncomplicated action that defines Self 2 can be released without inhibition. Which is to say that judgments, both positive and negative, are let go entirely, and the mind is focused entirely on the elemental nature of the game, watching the ball and striking without reflection on technique.The greater applications of Gallwey's Zen-like approach to tennis are clear: life is not about exalting one's ego in a zero-sum game of competition, but rather should be structured on achieving personal excellence and trust in one's natural ability. Gallwey is of course not maintaining that any old fellow can pick up a racket and become like Federer by achieving total pacification of Self 1, but he does offer the optimistic belief in actualization of potential not through conscious committment to rules and technique in practice but rather the gradual assimilation of correct technique through a process of trial and error."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"I swear this book will totally change your game.

However, as a long time tennis player and golfer, I could not deny some of the basic views he put forward. Read it but note cult thinking as well."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"As most people can guess by the title, the \\"inner game\\" of tennis is the game that takes place iin the mind of the player and is played against barriers such as nervousness, self-doubt, etc.To gain clarity on the mental problems in tennis, the book looks at the concepts of \\"Self 1\\" and \\"Self 2\\". Self 1 is the name that is given to the conscious ego-mind which likes the tell Self 2, you and your potential, how to hit the ball and play the game. Or, to put it another way, Self 1 is the \\"teller\\" and Self 2 the \\"doer\\". I found this to be an interesting idea, as we have all caught ourselves talking to ourselves or have seen others talking to themselves during a game. If you ask someone who they are talking to, they will usually say \\"I'm talking to myself.\\" This, of course, implies that there are 2 \\"selves\\", \\"I\\" and \\"myself\\"- and so is born the idea of Self 1 and Self 2. Pretty astutue observation in my opinion.Now according to the book, to achieve peak performance, the key is to resolve any lack of harmony between the two selves, as it is the contrary thinking of Self 1 which causes interference with the natural abilities of Self 2. This requires the learning of several inner skills, such as the art of letting go of self-judgements, letting Self 2 do the hitting, recognizing and trusting the natural learning process, and so on- which is what much of the books spends discussing.I highly recommend this book for anyone who plays tennis (or any other sport for that matter) as it does a great job in dealing with the fact that many of our difficulties in tennis are indeed mental in origin. Other helpful books for tennis players I've come across includeTreat Your Own Tennis Elbow."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"This book cuts right through to what all tennis players inherantly know, your success on the court is directly related to what is going on in your mind. You realize that your body knows how to play, and needs no gratification or instructions by your inner critic. The less you interfere, the better your body will perform. When your mind is quiet and trusts your body's abilities is when it is has the freedom to perform.My game improved dramatically since my first match after I read the book, one technique is to occupy your mind into silence by focusing it on something. The thing I focused on was the spin of the ball as it came to me. When I began to concentrate on that, my mind was silent and focused on the ball. When I do this, the ball seems slower and bigger. All of my strokes improved by doing this. Another thing I got out of this book is to let go of all of your lessons and ideas of how to move your feet, how to hit the ball, how to angle your raquet head. A match is no time to ponder these things it is a time to do them. When in a match, just let your body do what it knows how to do. Don't focus on details, just focus on the goal of making a good tennis shot.All of this is wonderful, but the best thing this book has to offer, is giving the reader the understanding of how to learn in a natural way without your inner voice giving approval or disaproval. And that is a skill that will apply to all things in your life.I can't wait to read the Inner Game of Work."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"I remember clearly the first time I read this book. It was the summer before 9th grade, almost two decades ago. I'd been playing tennis for about a year. My trusty wooden racquet in tow, I had taken lessons, read every how-to book and tried to follow all the step-by-step pictures. Also, I was getting soundly beaten by friends who'd be playing longer than myself.I found the book in the library and was surprised at how thin it was. Then I noticed there were no pictures. I thought &quot;What kind of tennis book has no pictures? &quot; I started to read there next to the shelves and my life has never been the same. I wound up captain of my highschool tennis team, all-state selection, and along the way crushed the bums who used to beat me.Now I'm almost 30 and a tennis has-been but still play a pretty good game. And whenever I go on the court (be it tennis, basketball, squash) I apply the same principles. I stop trying, stop forcing. Quiet the mind and let it happen.As others reviewers have written in this space, this book will transform your game. It will also broaden your appreciation for what the human body can do. It will enrich your life. This is a classic and indispensible work."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"Gallwey's book was an instant classic when it first came out. It was somewhat revolutionary at the time as few sport psychology books were available for the tennis public.

However, there are currently more practical mental toughness or mental zone books out there which are easier to read and use. Still Gallwey's book is interesting philosophy more than psychology as he works with your automatic and analytic selves (self 1 and 2) which conflict each other.Gallwey addresses why negativity and self-analysis inhibits the creative, automatic self. Readers become more aware of how being in the \\"zone\\" really works. Recently, there have been advances in sport psychology which pushes some of Gallwey's ideas a bit out there although he is still on the right path. I would recommend \\"Zennis\\" (Peter Spang) over the \\"Inner Game\\" since it is more practical."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"This book is simply a gem. I would highly recommend it for anyone seeking to improve their tennis game, but the scope of its content goes far, far beyond mere tennis. In fact, I picked up this book after several of my colleagues recommended it to me. As a professional musician, I find myself confronted by the same mental games Tim Gallwey brooches here. Though \\"The Inner Game of Music\\" was inspired and written in conjunction with Tim Gallwey several years later, I find \\"The Inner Game of Tennis\\" infinitely more inspiring. It is direct in its approach, highly concentrated, and easy to make the leap from tennis to any other discipline. In no uncertain terms, this book changed the way I make music, and changed my life. For anyone who, despite all your best efforts, all of your hardest \\"trying,\\" still doesn't manage to get the ball over the net, hit the high note, or otherwise succeed at something because your own mental noise is getting in the way, this is the book for you.After reading this, I became engrossed with the philosophies behind Gallwey's experiences, and I continued to pursue other books in the same vein: \\"Zen and the Art of Archery,\\" \\"Effortless Mastery,\\" etc. None of them hold a candle to this one, however.It is earth-moving in its simplicity and has the power to change how you approach almost any discipline.I continue to re-read and refer to it on a regular basis."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"This book has had a very positive impact on my life. I have suffered with concentration problems for all my life and was recently diagnosed with ADD. I was always told at school that i was intelligent but didnt \\"try hard enough\\" and thats why I was failing. But funnily enough trying hard seemed to make things worse for me. My difficulties have led me to being fired from several jobs due to lapses of attention. After reading this book I have been putting the ideas in to practice through the medium of chess (I am an expert level player) and have noticed an improved abiltity to focus my mind. I hope now to move forward in life and repair my shatterd self esteem and gain confidence to take on new challenges. This is a great self help book!."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"The main point of the book is that neither mastery nor satisfaction can be found in the playing of any game without giving some attention to your inner game. This game is played against such obstacles as lapses in concentration, nervousness, self-doubt and self-condemnation. The goal of the inner game is to overcome these obstacles which inhibit peak performance.As my journey of a tennis coach began I started looking for more and more books on this topic. It doesn't take much searching before you find this extraordinary book. I read it in two days and many pieces of the mental puzzle finally came together.We have to agree with him that most problems with players of any level are not technical or tactical. Even a total newbie to tennis quickly realizes that when he passes the local courts and overhears many inappropriate words and emotional outbursts.Gallwey masterfully explains his concepts of Self1 and Self2; there is an inner dialogue in our mind - and it's usually not the friendliest one. When we learn to find harmony between both parts of our mind is when we discover the harmony in our mind - body connection.His next very powerful concept is letting it happen vs. trying hard. It comes very counter intuitively since that what we believe that we have to do when things are not working yet. We try harder. In tennis that translates to tension, narrow awareness and emotional hitting.I've personally discovered this fact before reading this book and called it less is more. When you learn new things in tennis whether they are a technique, tactics or movement your first tries rarely succeed. But instead of trying harder try less. Hit slower, grip your racquet lighter, move more lightly and don't try to be good or even perfect. Accept your current level and stay with it for a while. Suddenly you'll experience improvement which happens by itself.This approach is closely tied to his final concept of non-judgment. It means seeing things as they are without adding our labels of good and bad. The biggest problem is the consequent thinking which comes after the label bad. It spreads like a virus from a bad shot to the bad stroke and then to the bad player and finally to the bad person.If we investigate our thinking we realize that there is no logical connection between bad backhands and our inner self. And the best way of investigation of our thinking and making yourself free from these concepts is Loving what is by Byron Katie.Tomaz Mencingerhttp://www.tennismindgame.com"},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"Not a book of technique but one which transformed my attitude to playing tennis. Gallwey explains his transformation from a an ego-driven win-at all-cost player, to a yoga-player who played for the experience without desire to win, to a player who concentrates on making the effort to win. The latter concept, as opposed to being concerned about winning, was the most profound part of the book for me. It explained paradoxes I had felt in competing as purely social player, where often I had not wanted to win. The book has taught me to think less, to concentrate more, and to focus on playing in the present without harse self-judgement. Gallwey insists that he has not written a self-help book, but his philosophy is certainly applicable to wider spheres, not the least learning new sports such as, in my case, roller-blading. I'm trying to just 'let it happen&quot;. A book that needs to be kept and read over."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"I'm in my late 30's and have been playing tennis my whole life. I'm a self-rated (USTA) solid 4.5, maybe even a low 5.0 for singles, 4.5 for doubles.I read this book when I was 14 or 15 and it changed my tennis game first, and then it gradually impacted other areas of my life. I've just purchased this relatively new edition because I lost my original copy long ago, and also I'm teaching my daughters to play tennis now and wanted to apply the techniques for the first time as a coach.I tend to be long-winded but I'll try to put this succinctly: Before the book, I had the shots in my aresenal but they weren't frequently surfacing in my matches. I lost many matches against players with lesser skills. After applying the lessons learned from the book, I started consistently winning against these same players, and sometimes winning against superior opponents that I should not have been able to beat.More importantly, tennis became much more enjoyable for me, and at times even like an out of body experience during which it seemed like part of me was kicking back in my mind and just enjoying watching myself play. I never self-destruct anymore, and I generally have a feeling in tennis that there's nothing I can't accomplish when I'm feeling well.It's not always that perfect, and sometimes my \\"Self 1\\" imposes its will on my game, but it's fairly easy to pick up on when that's happening and there are some techniques in the book for bringing myself back on track.For competition purposes, I've been trying to find ways to merge the faith in \\"Self 2\\" that this book teaches with the strategies outlined in Brad Gilbert's book \\"Winning Ugly,\\" which is almost an opposite approach to the game. Anyone else out there have this challenge? My approach has been to think strategically like Brad suggests between points (i.e., employing Self 1), then try to apply Galwey's \\"bounce-hit\\" exercise at the beginning of each point so that Self 2 takes over during actual play. I'm having mixed results with that but improving over time."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"This is one of the pioneering books that brought about the field known as sports psychology.A great self-help book, in my opinion, because it has an action plan you can follow. Basically, it will help you achieve total self-confidence if you don't already have it. The author talks about each person having a self1 and a self2. The former is your conscious ego and the latter is your potential. Self-confidence comes when we suppress self1 and allow the excellence in self2 to come out. We should trust ourselves to do what we want to do because everything we need is in self2. It is when we allow self1 to judge, we doubt ourselves. An important concept in getting rid of self1 is the art of being able to focus. If we focus on the here and now, this place and time, self2 will have a better chance to perform. How many times have we start to wonder about our cat or our past mistakes or day-dream how nice it is for something to happen when what we should be doing is to focus on the task at hand. In a way, self1 and self2 are similar to the conscious and subconscious mind. Whichever way you choose to believe is not what's important. What is important is that by conceptualizing this way, the complexity is reduced, and results can be produced quickly. How else can humans conceptualize confidence? Confidence without doubt, is nothing. Just like you cannot have hot without cold or fast without slow.Lastly, we should cherish competition and our opponents. Our opponents are not our enemies but can be viewed as obstacles that allow us to grow and become better at what we do. Humans love to accomplish great things because they like to test their limits. Although this is fine, those who set out to overcome an obstacle should find out if the result they get is what they really want before they go about trying to overcome the obstacle."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"This is a very helpful guide that allows you to 1. recognize when the mind and your inner thoughts are conspiring against you and 2. help control the negative thoughts, so that your game can improve.

An ESSENTIAL reference for the serious coach committed to the mental aspects of competitive sports."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"This is really a nice book that enables you to approach pretty much everything (not just tennis) with a Zenlike approach. It reminds us all of the importance of being mindful in everything we do, every moment of our lives. It helps us remember that our ability to trust ourselves is the most important ability of all. When we trust ourselves, we can stay in the moment and we naturally maximize our present abilities. We all know this somewhere inside but tend to lose perspective and perform below our potential many times. Whether you are a tennis player or not, I think there is something in this book for everybody. If you'd like a book that explains how and why these experiences occur, read &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is just a superb book discussing many of our important inner experiences in life in a way that everyone can understand!"},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"Of all the books I have read on any subject, this one is among the best. I am only a fair tennis player but the insight and wisdom of Gallwey extends far beyond tennis.

Open to any page at any time and become slightly richer."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"While I strongly believe that the mental side of tennis plays a huge role in one's performance, I found this book to be too theoretical without much practical application. Mr Gallwey starts the book by explaining Self-1 verses Self-2 and how Self-1 must allow Self-2 to play the game. While I found this form of existentialism interesting, I found very little that I could use in my tennis matches. I prefer a book with more practical applications for maintaining a strong postive attitude with direct discussion of how to flow with the game so I can hit the ball both accurately and smoothly without over thinking. If you're looking for a book like this, I would recommend 'The Mental Edge' by Ken Baum instead."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who plays tennis competitively and more so to those people who would like to make it their profession"},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"Great book for understanding how we tend to sabotage our own success in tennis as well as other aspects of our lives. Gallwey presents a paradigm of the human thought process as two distinctive entities where the managing part of the brain (Self 1) can often interfere with the doing part of the brain (Self 2). The importance of living in the moment without thinking about the past or future as well as concentrating on the task at hand without judgment; is clearly explained in a simple, concise manner. I have read other books on the importance of living in the moment, but Gallwey is the only one who presented it in a way where I can truly understand the concept. The book is simple and does not get into much detail on any of the subjects discussed, which cleverly conveys the very concept Gallwey teaches. Allowing Self 2 to learn through experience and the senses. If a detailed, step by step, approach is what you desire, this book is not for you. If you feel that you are not living up to your potential but are not sure why, than The Inner Game of Tennis is a must read."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"Galway's Inner Game books are the best for golf and tennis.Helps you get the inner voice in your mind out of your way so you can get in the zone."},{"Title":"The Inner game of tennis","review":"This book is about way more than tennis.

This is not a self-help book, but gives great insight on how your frame of mind can be used against yourself if applied the wrong way, or can bring out the best in your abilities if applied the right way.

Most people with a minimal amount of psychology in their background are familar with the five stages of Dying, but there is so much more to the book.The five stages of dying only comprise about 1/3 of the book. The rest of the book is composed of interviews with dying patients and an exploration of the cultural phobia of death. It is a real eye opening experience to see the lengths which people will go to avoid discussing death. Even members of the medical profession exercise some measure of avoidance. Their treatment of patients often involves sparse and impersonal contact with the dying patients and often times refusal to be honest. Kubler-Ross's research caused change through her study, making it known how the dying want to be treated.\\"On Death and Dying\\" was the first work to study the process of dying.

Unfortunately, many of the evils the author discovered in her interviews and observations still exist. Her proposal of the stages of dying was based on a limited sample of patients mainly from a single culture, but it remains useful nevertheless for therapists and counselors, and it enables them to facilitate communication among family members and hospital workers.Her work has been criticized because near the end of her life she became somewhat obsessed with after-death experiences and whether it would be possible to contact the dead. This only points out that this is a difficult area to take on, and it should not substract value from her first and most influential book, \\"On Death and Dying\\".Anyone with a seriously ill loved one would find illumination in her book, especially with a careful reading, because the author warns against the dogmatic application of her ideas to individuals.

This book helped me through a lot of it. It is very well written and did a lot to help me accept how the recent events have unfolded. Thank you."},{"Title":"On death and dying","review":"For most of us, the area of thanatology is something quite new, despite the fact that death is such an intimate \\"companion\\" that can come at any moment of our lives, whether by degrees or instantaneously, irrelevant of our ethnic, social and economic backgrounds. It is a plain truth that can not be avoided, and no technological advancements can make it go away. I would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you, despite what your feelings may be. And as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier, the adult must equally do so with death, not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means: the total cessation of physical life, for if one denys its existence and its inevitability, the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache, but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental, spiritual and religious grief as well. Submission to and acceptance of the truth, no matter how difficult it would be to hear, could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing. In Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's classic study of the dying process, she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them. But even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person, the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all. Hence, how do you take the sting from the wound? In On Death and Dying, you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say, to let them vent, and at their own pace, go through the classic defined stages of the dying process: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The patients become our teachers. We learn of their fears, their possible financial burdens, in one woman's case, the fear of the worms, et cetera. But we also learn about what the families go through, their own anger and disbelief and guilt. It is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved. Sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger, other times not. The United States is one of the most death-denying countries out there, a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process, for going foward means only one thing: death. Ross's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is, the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe.

She described the five stages of dying, while never maintaining that one had to go through the stages in perfect order or that one couldn't have other emotions along with, e.g, anger. No one would argue that death is loss--loss of one's self, or loss of someone dear to us. Many of us have other kinds of loss, i.e., a missing child--a child we have no hope of ever seeing. Is that not death of another kind?

Other than the introductory chapters on the stages of denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance, this volume is devoted to the interviews given by severely ill and dying patients to a class of medical and pastoral care professionals and those studying to fill these roles. The course was a collaboration between the medical school and college for the clergy; thus there is a strong Christian element. First, this grated on me a bit because of its exclusivity, but I soon realised that patients who chose to be interviewed by a psychiatrist and a chaplain would probably do so because of an already existing faith, which put things in perspective.Munch of the information provided is enlightening and eminently current; much of the rest is dated - after all, this book was written in the late 60s.I was particularly interested in the reactions of staff and other professionals to course and its results - I would hope that, with the evolution of medical teaching, there would not be a little less resitance, but I cannot judge that.The second revelation were the family relationships and patterns revealed by the patient interviews - I'm currently studying family therapy [\\"Families and How to survive them\\" Skynnewr/Cleese] and this was highly relevant."},{"Title":"On death and dying","review":"This book is very helpful to understand the overall grieving process.

Life is natural, so is death. In fact in some eastern religions (Tibetan Buddhism comes to mind) one is asked to meditate up on death to drive home the significance of impermanence of all things.Another important point this book makes which I think the society, as a whole needs to pay attention is to let people die with as much dignity as possible. The current drama unfolding in the case of Terri Schiavo proves the point. Though no one can know for sure what she would want, the so called \\"culture of life\\" issue people keep bringing up to keep her alive is denying her a dignified death. Can you imagine anything more inhumane if she really wants to be let go in peace? I don't propose to know the solution, but we all need to put that living will in place.An interesting empirical point this book makes is people who have religious beliefs as to what happens to them after death find have an easier time when the end comes. (I for one don't believe there is any after life after death and hence may need to better prepare myself to face death).Would like to finish with these verses from RubaiyatThere was the Door to which I found no Key:There was the Veil through which I could not see:Some little talk awhile of ME and THEEThere was--and then no more of THEE and ME"},{"Title":"On death and dying","review":"I have always wondered about offering this book to people.

I have been on a run of reading about NDE's and 'afterlife'. This book starts off well - in the understanding of the emotions, dynamics and psychology of the patient and the treatment(s) by medical staff of the terminally ill, then drifts off into UNedited interviews with the ill (ZZzzz!!). She could have just written about the lessons without the boring details. I figure for 1966 when she wrote this - it was cutting edge, now it is a bit dated. 40% of this book is FANTASTIC - but the 60% that dawdles in chatty talk - ruins much of it. This book could be reduced from 276 pages to about 175 pages - and be better. In 2004 - Kubler-Ross took her research to the ultimate level and passed away (sorry I couldn't resist). Given all I have said, I know of no better book on this topic and deem this a must-read for anyone in direct contact with the terminally ill. - I just wish someone could get access to the copyrights - and give this book the overhall it needs.Scott MacNeil Nov - 2012"},{"Title":"On death and dying","review":"I got a \\"used\\" copy for me and this new one for my sister.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"On death and dying","review":"Elisabeth Kubler-Ross is undoubtedly the world's foremost expert on the subject of death and dying. I learned about her stages of grief as an undergraduate majoring in psychology some 20 years ago, and later was re-acquainted with her ideas when I did a ten-year stint working in nursing. Now I am a teacher of psychology and history, and I finally came around to reading her most important book, and perhaps the most important and revolutionary book ever written on the subject of death.Kubler-Ross's ideas regarding the grieving process are quite profound. As I read her book, I remembered many times while caring for the dying, that a staff or family interaction could have been better understood if the people involved had taken the time to read this book. Knowing the stages are not nearly as effective as reading this book and getting to know Kubler-Ross's mind and heart which she shares with you in the pages of this book. Moreover, the examples she brings forth are wonderful illustrations into getting to know the more subtle clues that give insight to the subject.I'll provide an example: while in nursing, I cared for a man who was near death. It wasn't until the daughter told her father \\"It's OK to let go\\" that the man was able to reach a stage of acceptance. He died the next day. What I didn't understand until I read Kubler-Ross's book is that it wasn't the father who was in denial; it was the rather the daughter. Once the father knew that the daughter was ready to part with her dear father; he was able to rest in peace.This is a powerful book. I wish I had read it while I worked in nursing. I strongly advise anybody who works around death and dying to read this book."},{"Title":"On death and dying","review":"Though written back in the 60's, this was a very interesting, thought provoking read on treatment of and interaction with people who are terminally ill.

K&uuml;bler-Ross did extensive research in the field by actually talking to those in the process of dying, something that had hitherto been considered taboo and an unthinkable, uncaring thing to do. K&uuml;bler-Ross asked for volunteers, and never pressured people to do or say anything they didn't want to. One of her unexpected discoveries was that the medical professionals were more reluctant to participate than were the patients, who quite often felt gratitude and relief at being able to be heard.K&uuml;bler-Ross also spoke to families, and followed people through their ailments, sometimes to recovery, but most often to their death. She let the people guide her in her research: 'We do not always state explicitly [to the patient] that the patient is actually terminally ill. We attempt to elicit the patients' needs first, try to become aware of their strengths and weaknesses, and look for overt or hidden communications to determine how much a patient wants to face reality at a given moment.'This caring approach was often an aggravation for K&uuml;bler-Ross and her staff, because they would know what the patient had been told but was not yet ready to face. K&uuml;bler-Ross recounts stories of attempts to deal with death in different ways; denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance -- in fact, the various stages of grief were first recognised in K&uuml;bler-Ross's research.There are those who dislike the \`stages' theory of grief, but it is important to know (as the quote above indicates) that these are not set-in-stone processes, but rather dialectical and perichoretic in nature, ebbing and flowing like the tide, so that where a person was \`stage-wise' would vary from meeting to meeting.K&uuml;bler-Ross explained her interest in this research by saying that \`if a whole nation, a whole society suffers from such a fear and denial of death, it has to use defenses which can only be destructive.' Her work is primarily geared to health-care providers, and provides verbatim transcripts of conversations with a wide range of people in different classes, races, family situations, education levels, and ages. The reader can then get a sense of how to better communicate with someone in a terminal situation.'Early in my work with dying patients I observed the desperate need of the hospital staff to deny the existence of terminally ill patients on their ward. In another hospital I once spent hours looking for a patient capable to be interviewed, only to be told that there was no one fatally ill and able to talk. On my walk through the ward I saw an old man reading a paper with the headline &quot;Old Soldiers Never Die&quot;. He looked seriously ill and I asked him if it did not scare him to \`read about that'. He looked at me with anger and disgust, telling me that I must be one of those physicians who can only care for a patient as long as he is well but when it comes to dying, then we all shy away from them. This was my man! I told him about my seminar on death and dying and my wish to interview someone in front the students in order to teach them not to shy away from these patients. He happily agreed to come, and gave us one of the most unforgettable interviews I have ever attended.'She concludes with a chapter explaining the reactions of doctors, nurses, counsellors and chaplains, professionals who deal with the dying every day, on how the kinds of listening and care she outlines can change their work and lives as well. It is remarkable to see some of the transformations which take place among these people.I have used the advice and insight given by this book in my own ministry, and heartily recommend it to everyone, regardless of medical or ministerial intent, for it can give guidance on how to deal with the deaths of friends or family members and, ultimately, our own death.Death will never be a happy subject, but it needn't be a dark mystery devoid of meaning and guidance."},{"Title":"On death and dying","review":"Loved the book. I think there are only two types of people who need not bother with this book: a) those who are not mortal, and b) those who can't read. All the rest of us should look into it. Rather than duplicate the excellent book description and synopsis above, I will try something else to let you know if this book will interest you at all. Early on in the first chapter, the author makes three statements, and I quote:1) &quot;In simple terms, in our unconscious mind we can only be killed; it is inconceivable to die of a natural cause or of old age.&quot;2) &quot;The more we are making advancements in science, the more we seem to fear and deny the reality of death.&quot;3) &quot;When a patient is severely ill, he is often treated like a person with no right to an opinion.&quot;If those type of blanket statements provoke your interest, or make you want to hear more, then this book is for you, because the author never leaves them in blanket form. The book is an enfleshment of those ideas. The author states her objective very clearly midway through the book by saying &quot;If this book serves no other purpose but to sensitize family members of terminally ill patients and hospital personnel to the implicit communications of dying patients, then it has fulfilled its task.&quot;The book is clearly written, no technical jargon to trip over. I found the whole genesis and history of Kubler Ross's interdisciplinary seminar on death and dying fascinating. The actual patient interviews revealed that (more often than not) the people most willing to TALK about dying are... the dying. I found these interviews for the most part very ennobling. They exalted the human spirit and showed the importance of faith and hope.Above all, the book will make you &quot;think&quot;. I've finished reading it, but I certainly haven't finished thinking about it. And that is always my criteria for the fifth star!"},{"Title":"On death and dying","review":"A brilliant book by E. Rubler-Ross who has dedicated her life to researching the needs of terminally ill patients &amp; their families. This is essential reading for everyone, whether you have had to face death (either your own or a loved one) or not. It is common for Westerners to deny death by not discussing it, or even thinking about it. This book illustrates the many problems that can arise from this attitude &amp; the heartache it can cause the terminally ill &amp; their families. Thanks to E. Kubler-Ross for an amazing lifetime achievement."},{"Title":"On death and dying","review":"&quot;On Death and Dying&quot; is an excellent resource book for someone who has or is about to lose someone close to them. As a counsellor I have counselled many individuals through grief and while each family/individual is unique, the patterns are generally the same. The book deals with the five stages that accompany grief: 1)Denial and isolation, that is shutting yourself off from family and friends, social or work related activities and refusing to accept the reality of what has happened. 2)Anger, &quot;the why did this have to happen to me&quot; stage and the need to blame. 3)Bargaining, for example, if I could just have this person back, I would not do this, or I would do that. 5)Depression, the feeling there is no reason to go on and a sense of being constantly overwhelmed, often feeling loss of control over their life. 5)Acceptance, of the way things really are and choosing to live the best possible life you can, anyway.While these stages can be applied to death under any circumstance, I found the book primarily revolved around the terminally ill as opposed to someone who has died suddenly without prior warning. However, it is important to remember that even though death may not be anticipated at a particular moment in time, most of us go through the same stages of grief regardless of whether or not the death is anticipated or unanticipated. The book will NOT lessen the grief, but the words found here may help readers to understand the grieving process and that grieving is a natural life process, even though it feels very un-natural, confusing and totally devastating at the time."},{"Title":"On death and dying","review":"When my mother was dying, I was confronted with a *lot* of issues to which I had never given much thought, having never been in that kind of position before. So, even the attitudes and beliefs about death I had carried for some time were brought into question, and I really needed some kind of simple guidance into how to approach all the very painful and confusing issues, both externally and internally. After I read this book, I was very much more confident about my own reactions, and had a lot more insight into how to handle the various communication and interpersonal difficulties inherent in this very stressful time.It's a simple book, easy to understand, and addresses all of the most important issues in a kind but factual manner."},{"Title":"On death and dying","review":"I read this book 10 years ago when I was coping with my father's suicide.

So this is a well written and convincing book to those who want to feel good and want to feel in control of death. But death can be a profoundly transformative force in peoples lives when we do not seek simple answers and answers that act as prozac.

Although I'm not terminally ill, this book turned my stomach reading it. I had to read this as part of my coursework toward my Ph.D. Basically, Kubler-Ross states that if a person is dying, he/she needs to come to terms with his/her finality. Also, the patient should not be encouraged to think of happier times. Why ever not? Patients labeled as terminal should be able to deal with it any way they choose, even if their choice is one of denial. Kubler-Ross also discusses a certain Christian Scientist woman in one of her case studies. Although I'm not a Christian Scientist, it is clear that Kubler-Ross has no idea what this is about. Being a true Christian Scientist means that one knows (and not simply believes) that he/she can be healed. It does not mean a person denies dis-ease and leaves the rest entirely up to God. There must be a change in outlook as well. With so many health care workers focused on dis-ease, it is very difficult for anyone to maintain a healthy mentality in the hospital environment. Labeling a person as terminal or dying only helps to reinforce this condition. This is especially negative when he/she does not wish this as opposed to someone who is ready to pass on."},{"Title":"On death and dying","review":"When I first started teaching an undergraduate course in Death &amp; Dying in 1972, I could correctly assume that every student had already read Kubler-Ross. Now, they've never heard of her, which is a pity. Despite the total lack of evidence to support her five-stage paradigm, she did us all a favor by pulling the shroud off of the topic. She was the first popular writer to deal with feelings of the dying patient. Her book, which cost $1.95 back then, was hot stuff. She actually talked to terminally ill people and didn't beat around the bush. Now we've got any number of pop psychologists applying her five -stage theory to all sorts of things she never even thought of: grief, marriage problems, alcohol treatment, you name it. I tell my students that the staging theory has been around for 32 years now. If it is going to have any experimental support, perhaps it might have emerged by now. The fact is that people are much more complex than any five stages can account for, and people can hold more than one emotion at a time. I've heard Kubler-Ross herself say this many times. But, we can remember five ideas, so there you have it. If she'd proposed a 16-stage hierarchy, she would have never gotten big. At any rate, there are no real scientists in thanatology that now credit her much at all any more, but for historical purposes this is still a valuable book."},{"Title":"On death and dying","review":"Elisabeth Kubler-Ross' On Death And Dying provides an abridged version of this psychology classic, read by Carol Bilger and providing an examination of the attitudes on dying and death in modern society.

Ritual abuse it intrinsically linked to Illuminati conspiracy theory such as the propaganda of Bowers. \\"Beneath the Tide\\" is typical Illuminati conspiracy theory propaganda, full of lies and twisted truths. If Lyndon LaRouche was scary, Bowers is a poor copy. BEWARE of \\"Ego Stripping\\". Don't get caught up in this cult. Bowers holds secret meetings to push his seditious propaganda. Illuminati conspiracy theory, such as that of Bowers, is the work of right-wing Christian fanatics pushing the notion that the founding fathers intended Christianity to be the national religion, or rather their particular fanatic version of it, just like the Nazi Party platform of 1927. The First Amendment can go hang.Bowers promotes the idea that the global elite are plotting world domination and are all a part of the Luciferian order of the Illuminati. Bowers claims the Constitution has been preverted by the global elite. The Constitution has been perverted by Bowers. Illuminati conspiracy theorists pass their easily debunked lies, and old hoaxes, on to one another by referencing one another. The infamous \\"Taxil hoax\\" is one example. Bowers tells about a thesis of \\"Dr. Glenn Kimber\\" and claims a source for this thesis included Columbus' journal and ship's log. \\"Kimber's thesis\\" claims that angels spoke to Columbus instructing him to bring along a Jewish Rabbi, Louis de Torres, because the people of the Americas would speak a language similar to ancient Hebrew because they would be Israelites. Bowers is pandering to the Mormon hope of support for their belief that the Book of Mormon was written by Israelites who were the ancestors of the Native Americans. Bowers lies. There is no reference for \\"Dr. Kimber's thesis\\", because there is no thesis. Mormons are an intended audience, for Bowers. Columbus thought he would land in India. That's why we call the Native American's, Indians. Mormon's are an infiltrated group of the underground criminal organization responsible for ritual abuse. My research keeps pointing to the more likely possibility that these Illuminati conspiracy \\"theorists\\" are the Illuminati. These groups are not advocates of ritual abuse survivors, but wolves in sheeps clothing. Especially if you are Mormon, STAY AWAY!In fact, the Illuminati was a very real seditious criminal underground that infiltrated the Masons in 1776, a secret society. The death penelty was imposed against the Illuminati in 1790. They were NOT the \\"global elite\\" however, and they were NOT the Masons proper. They used the Masonic rites as secret code for their secret society.Aleister Crowley bragged that the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), the organization he was made head of, held the secrets of the Illuminati. The O.T.O. was not founded by Crowely. The O.T.O. was founded by Carl Kellner, a high ranking member of the freemasons. Theodor Ruess was the leader of the O.T.O. who invited Crowely. Ruess was also a German Spy. The connections to Nazi war criminals is also linked to ritual abuse. I would not dismiss the existence of the Illuminati today, but if the Illuminati are still a threat, they are not the global elite, they are a threat to the global elite. The Illuminati are more likely to be the Illuminati conspiracy theorist making sure that those abused by the Illuminati sound like right-wing Christian fanatic kooks, like Bowers.I gave a middle rating to Bowers propaganda because if you are studying ritual abuse, an understanding of the thought process of Illuminati conspiracy theorists, such as \\"Bowers\\", is an absolute must read. Know thy enemy.For further research on the subject of ritual abuse and the Illuminati I recommend:Symonds, J. & Grant, K. (1979/1989).

I have read Bunin in other translations, but they, by comparison to this one, were awkward and stiff. Here Bunin's sentences move with true elegance."},{"Title":"The Elagin Affair: And Other Stories","review":"Until I picked up this book, I was not aware that Ivan Bunin was a Nobel Prize Winner for his literary work. This is the first piece of his work I read and I absolutely loved it. The collection has three novellas and three short stories. They are all about doomed love affairs that end in death - either physical or spiritual. Writing is very sophisticated and I imagine that readers who love fine writing will be delighted. All characters are very complex, their emotions typical of Russian sensibilities. However, the story plots remind me somewhat of romatic period when love of one person for another changes the course of events. It is a set of stories of people who are closely connected to each other through family, friendship or work. They are co-dependant so it seems that once one of them looses another, there is nothing else left in the world.My favorite story from this collection is called \\"Cleansing Monday\\". It is a story about two young, beautiful people who turn heads everywhere they go. But their lavish lifestyle, outings to the theatres, restaurants and other public places are not enough to sustain their relationship. Until one day, a young woman announces shortly after making love for the first time with a man who is madly in love with her that she has decided to become a nun and is moving to a monastery.The life biography of Ivan Bunin is heartbreaking. It is almost as if in the life of his own characters he has seen his own unfortunate destiny.

Yet, truth to be told, I find Ivan Bunin to have more soul and courage than the famous Russian doctor turned writer. Sinking into the world of Bunin is quite easy, there is a lush, albeit rustic elegance to his descriptions of the Russian countryside. His women are often ideals, distinguished by their distance, their beauty, charm and distinct resolve. Still, I found myself falling in love with them.I don't understand why Chekhov is so important. After reading \\"The Elagin Affair\\" and \\"Sunstroke\\" (both of them masterfully translated), reading Chekhov seemed almost unnecessary. Bunin is an author warmly in love with his fading world; Chekhov nervous and jittery.

Stories by the masters (Wharton, Twain, Borges, James, Maupassant to name but a few) stay with you as vivid experiences. Bunin, we are told, was one of these. A Nobel laureate. The inheritor of the mantle of Tolstoy and Turgenev. The artist who carried Russian Literature into the 20th Century. There is little evidence of that in this volume."},{"Title":"Prodigals and Pilgrims: The American Revolution against Patriarchal Authority 1750-1800","review":"This book contributes in a very important way to substantiating thus refining the transatlantic connection around the American Revolution. It does so by describing what I want to call the &quot;epistemic&quot; presence of Lockean thoughts on education throughout the process. Fliegelman's rehabilitative investigation impinges on discontinuities as much as on continuities between the Old World and the New World. As what buttresses the whole Enlightenment, the continued strain is Locke's sensationalist epistemology that encourages moral and political independence, but it transforms while differentiating across the Atlantic and through the period of the Revolution. Still, the entire antipatriarchal movement is, as Fliegelman traces it, an interaction between and combination of various factors among which literary texts are conspicuous and active players. Therefore, as the author makes it clear, &quot;Much emphasis is placed on relating eighteenth-century literary history to social, theological, and political events in America.&quot;(5)What unfolds through the interconnection is a movement toward maturity in all its forms. As the title implies, there is a progress signaled by iconographic conversion from prodigals to pilgrims and transition from childhood to adulthood. And the positive side of this development will culminate in the growing advocacy of geopolitical self-reliance during the Revolution. Fliegelman's strength seems to be proved by the felicity of connections he makes among seemingly discrete facts in addition to the extensiveness of his investigation. This alignment is achieved diachronically as well as synchronically so that a progressive pattern takes shape. Overall, it is fleshing out the primordial framework of a nation. &quot;The rising glory of America had proven to be the fortune long promised and now provided the earliest European prodigals, the first fallen. America was the Canaan to which God's providence had led. It was a macrocosm of the rehabilitated nuclear family, that original ideal of the antipatriarchal revolution, that great compensation for the fall from universal sociability.&quot;(267)As Fliegelman understands it, Lockean pedagogy which was essentially &quot;rational and sensationalistic...morphological...stoical...tolerant and utilitarian...moral....&quot;(14) These are the characters treated by Chesterfield, Gregory, F&eacute;nelon, Marmontel, Richardson, Sterne, and others. It is interesting to see how the American reception of these writers shows the way Locke's ideas were assimilated into revolutionary America. &quot;Taken together they articulate an ideology and paradigm that by 1776 had become, in effect, a new cultural orthodoxy, one that provided the terms in which men and women thought about political, moral, and social issues.&quot;(66) _Robinson Crusoe_ and _Clarissa_ are two outstanding examples. The former is significant in offering an acceptable model for the American reading public. &quot;By literalizing Calvinist or Puritan doctrine, Defoe has both wittingly and unwittingly succeeded in turning what began as a story of a prodigal into a radical fable of the fortunate fall. The circle of the prodigal's return has snapped; it has become again the straight line of the pilgrim's progress.&quot;(72)And the American edition of _Clarissa_ was redacted in such a way that it showed &quot;the rejection of a too narrowly consanguineous understanding of family.&quot;(88) Added to the two major English novels that were understood as not only describing but also prescribing the spirit of the age, Franklin's _Autobiography_ (Part I) represents &quot;the literary Americanization of the themes and structures of the sentimental and Puritan picaresque traditions.&quot;(107) And these are just some examples of numerous literary expressions of one and the same ideal. &quot;Those prodigal pilgrims fleeing parental tyranny, popery, and the extorted debt of nature turned to their hearts for guidance and sought the promise of a new kind of relationship. Filial freedom was but the prelude to the dream of great voluntaristic union and the reordering of society it suggested when writ large.&quot;(122)While these texts reveal the promising and adventurous careers projected by the bright side, Sterne's writing contains &quot;the dark implications&quot;(15) of Locke's epistemology. Skepticism is another palpable presence throughout the formative period of American mind. And Fliegelman finds one more strong expression of such uncertainty and disillusion with Brown. &quot;_Wieland_ is, in effect, the dark flip side of Franklin's _Autobiography_.\\"(240) Brown's novel is &quot;a terrifying post-French Revolutionary account of the fallibility of the human mind and, by extension, of democracy itself.&quot;(239) And it is one of those fearful moments of a greater transformation under way. It is interesting that skeptical fictionalization by Sterne and Brown adds much to the entire picture of the age as it reflects the ambivalence inherent in the making of a new framework. One crucial icon of American Revolution is George Washington. Fliegelman believes that &quot;the glorification of Washington was intimately related to the glorification of the new parenthood.&quot;(199) He was also &quot;made representative of the spirit of the Lockean age.&quot;(222) While having to go through the political vicissitudes, American public could rely on him as its pivotal point. He is described as a national hero who provided a critical ballast to the newly-born nation. After all, &quot;his idealization as the nation's father served to complete the transformation of the antipatriarchal ideology into a national dogma.&quot;(225) But he is also portrayed as a subtle personality who was consciously carrying out an insightful appraisal of the pros and cons of the political and moral project. At certain moments, Fliegelman seems to depend so much on the role Washington played in the national commitment to the grand reconfiguring work that I wonder what America should have done without this fatherly character.If Washington is still representative of the harmonious and auspicious convergence of all the novel but risky visions, it's also true that there were other comparable personages like Paine who as a trailblazer cut some tricky Gordian knots with some aggressiveness and audacity. Fliegelman's real merit would be such an impartial coverage he gives of the widest possible expanse of history. He keeps inserting highly relevant facts and events to reinforce the significance of the texts he surveys. As he makes it clear, &quot;this work is fundamentally a study in intellectual and cultural history.&quot;(6) One of its goals is apparently to widen the scope with the aid of &quot;interdisciplinary&quot; approach. From the beginning, Fliegelman wants to address this issue. &quot;Our received notions as to who were the most important transmitters of Enlightenment ideas central to the American Revolution are in need of revising as much as our understanding of what constitutes a &quot;political&quot; text is in need of broadening.&quot;(4-5)From the lionizing of Washington up to the promulgation of Monroe doctrine, there is an intermediate stage of triumphant &quot;neutrality&quot; which &quot;proved self-destructive.&quot;(257) For this awkward policy of isolation, Fliegelman has his diagnosis: 'Adolescence and America, those kindred eighteenth-century &quot;inventions,&quot; had perhaps in some fundamental manner become overidentified with each another.&quot;(258) He thinks that Washington had his cure for this ignorance of &quot;a world where trade agreements necessitated political agreements.&quot;(256)Also involved in the political process were the clergy who responded in their own terms to what they felt was urgent. It was &quot;a revolutionary reconsideration of the basic elements of Protestant orthodoxy.&quot;(154) The theological self-reflection finally reached a wholly different Christian belief that was widely received in America. &quot;Central to the Unitarian purpose is to prove that the source of love and the source of authority could be one; indeed, that true authority was conferred by the power to love.&quot;(193)I see more interesting points in this book, interesting because they give me a sense of a dynamic holism that the Lockean &quot;episteme&quot; holds together. But there are too many of them even to mention briefly. Nevertheless, particularly revealing are his arguments on Defoe, Richardson, Sterne, Brown. I don't mean they alone are good. But the author's exertion to illuminate the relevance of these writers and their fiction to revolutionary America accounts for more than just a part of what he aims to achieve: &quot;to clarify the crucial thematic connections between key historical events and the important literary, pedagogical, theological, and political texts of the period under consideration.&quot;(6) Perhaps, his rediscovery of the historical significance of those literary works is another accurate portrayal of reality."},{"Title":"Irish History and The Irish Question","review":"It's always nice to get something free, and it's even nicer when the product is fairly good. 3 star book 5 star price."},{"Title":"Hustler Magazine March 1998","review":"Hustler July 1993 Volume 20 Number 1.

Here he writes the \\"biography\\" of Teresa Mendoza, a young woman from Sinaloa, Mexico, who becomes the mastermind of a multimillion dollar drug empire operating from Marbella, Spain. This novel's challenge lies not in an intellectual puzzle, but in understanding the business networks Teresa builds with drug lords from Russia, Italy, Morocco, and Colombia, along with various agents of government whom she buys off. As she becomes a successful businesswoman, known as \\"The Queen of the South,\\" the suspense develops: Will she stay alive? And how?The story begins in Mexico when Teresa is twenty-three. Uneducated but attractive, she is in love with Guero Davila, a Chicano pilot involved in shipping coca. When she suddenly receives a phone call telling her to run for her life, she does so, escaping through Mexico City into Spain, and then Morocco. Putting her knowledge of drug transportation to work by involving herself in hash-running between Morocco and Spain, she ends up with a short jail sentence but an important friendship with another inmate, Patty O'Farrell, the rebellious daughter of a wealthy Spanish family. When they are released, they set up a big-time drug trafficking business, with Teresa running the show and becoming, eventually, the person with whom everyone in the business must deal.Teresa's story is not told in linear fashion. An unnamed speaker/narrator, presumably Perez-Reverte himself, has come to Sinaloa to investigate and describe Teresa Mendoza's life and business. Interviewing everyone with any information, he inserts himself and his interviews into the narrative. Soon the line begins to blur between fiction and fact, since some of the people he interviews, such as the three people to whom he dedicates the novel, are, in fact, real people who are included as characters in the novel. These add depth and a fine sense of realism to the novel.Although Teresa Mendoza is not a character with whom the reader will identify, the author develops a certain amount of sympathy for her. Teresa is an entrepreneur of great intelligence, and this, combined with her ability to avoid creating any sort of trail that will implicate her legally, keeps her going in her dog-eat-dog world. The novel is episodic but fast paced, despite the sometimes unwelcome intrusions of the narrator/speaker, and Perez-Reverte succeeds in presenting a broad, intriguing picture of the business of drug smuggling and those who make it their careers. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I remember reading an article in the New York Times a little while ago in which a writer said that he decided whether or not to read a book based on the first sentence. He would continue reading only if he was hooked by this small sample. When I started reading this novel I thought to myself that Perez-Reverte must be of similar beliefs. The start of this work is so strong that it is hard to put it down after reading its first sentence, \\"The telephone rang, and she knew she was going to die\\".The phone call Teresa Mendoza receives is a signal that Guero Davila, her lover, is dead and that she needs to run away. Thus starts a spectacular adventure full of twists and turns that will have the reader looking forward to the next development every step of the way. Guero was a drug dealer that was betraying his bosses, so when they discovered him, he was murdered and they proceeded to go after Teresa.An anonymous writer who is doing research and writing a book on the life of this mysterious woman tells part of the story. As usual, Perez-Reverte goes back and forth in the story, mixing elements from different time periods relating to the main character's life. In this case, we soon learn that the writer meets Teresa twelve years after Guero's death when she is involved in a difficult situation with the Federales in Culiacan, Mexico. Therefore, the author is letting us know that the ending may be in line with his usual pattern: bitter-sweet.After that interlude, Perez-Reverte goes back to the moment in which Teresa is forced to run and we are taken along in a magnificent roller-coaster ride that will show us how this character changes and evolves, fighting with her destiny and trying to survive. The author's great writing skills help in making us feel as if we were right in the middle of the action, and we find ourselves rooting for a woman that ends up involved in the world of drugs. Perez-Reverte also does a very good job in describing settings and people in places like Mexico and the US, immersing the reader in the ambiance of these locations.As to our main character, one thing is certain, Teresa learned her lesson from her experience with Guero, and now she decides to take control of her life: \\"She was never going to wait for anybody again, watching telenovelas in some house in some city somewhere\\". This is the essence behind this main character, and whether you like the book or not will depend on how much you like Teresa, a strong and focused woman, who takes life as it was dealt to her and who has a significant amount of inner conflicts. As far as I am concerned, this character has enough interest by itself so as to make this one of the best books of 2004."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I have read every Perez-Reverte novel . . . because he brought to life the worlds of antiquarian books, paintings, old fencing masters, chess, crumbling churches and treasure maps. All except one -- The Queen of the South. I balked because it was about drug running-- a subject I have never been interested in. (I think the closest I got to anything related to recreational drugs was growing a \\"false aralia\\" houseplant at work and fooling people into thinking I was growing \\"weed\\" right in front of the boss.)It was months after it came out when I finally decided to pick it up. (My problem, as a reader, is that I ALWAYS FINISH a book, no matter how bad or boring it is. Because I was never going to let the 8 bucks I spent on it -- go to waste.) So I was afraid I was going to be stuck with a book that would put me to sleep for weeks. I was WRONG.Arturo Perez-Reverte has done it again! He has enthralled me with the story of Teresa Mendoza. She starts out as the girlfriend of Guero Davila, a small plane pilot who flew drug shipments between Colombia and the U.S. He is killed (in flashback) and her story begins when she flees Sinaloa.Reverte's writing is riveting. He tells of her incredible rise in the world of drug trafficking . . . she finds love (of sorts)again with Santiago, a boat driver; fate, Edmond Dantes and a lost \\"treasure\\" finds her in the form of a wealthy prison inmate, Patty O'Farrell. Teresa leverages her new-found wealth into power among the drug traffickers. And there's more betrayal and tragedy. It just doesn't stop. Not a dull moment!There's a subtle parallel to the novel called The Count of Monte Cristo but not much because while the Monte Cristo book is almost entirely about revenge, Teresa's story will end with a \\"settling of debts.\\" In the most spectacular fashion.I got particularly attached to her bodyguard--- Pote Galvez whose fate was almost poetic and gut-wrenching and a 3-hanky event.Read the Song of Teresa! You won't regret it. I found myself using the colorful phrases that Teresa used . . . while I was reading. (Although I recommend not muttering it during a staff meeting. Thankfully my boss only knows German.)"},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"After carving out a solid niche for himself in the \\"intellectual thriller\\" genre by writing a number of entertainments (some good, some not) revolving around the arcane and esoteric, bestselling Spanish novelist Perez-Reverte shifts gears here with a book that is neither thriller nor obsessed with high culture paraphernalia. Quite the contrary, this is the tale of a poor, uneducated Mexican girl who, over the course of twelve years, manages to become a hugely wealthy narcotics transporter. The story of Theresa Mendoza is told partially from her perspective as events happen, and partially by an investigative reporter who is trying to write a book about her and is interviewing anyone once connected to her. Before becoming a novelist, Perez-Reverte was a well-known journalist, and his former profession informs the entire book as his fictional journalist connects the dots, from Sinaloa, Mexico to Morocco to Marbella, Spain. Some readers seem not to care for the alternating voices, but it adds much needed depth and texture to what is otherwise a fairly flat and straightforward rags to riches story.However, unlike most gutter to penthouse tales, Theresa is not a character who always had large dreams and wanted to be \\"king of the world\\". Rather, her story shows her to be an emotionally dead soul who does whatever it takes to survive in the harsh environment she inhabits. While this is a nice change of pace from the usual Scarface hysterics, her cool reserve also means that there's no way for the reader to connect with her (unless you, too, have been on the run from hitmen). Which is not to say that she isn't believable, it's just that she's a character with a single motivation, survival, and this one track detachment gets kind of lame as she grows more and more powerful. While one can sympathize with her plight, she's not particularly sympathetic or unsympathetic--she's simply...present. Not that Perez-Reverte doesn't gamely try to make her sympathetic by showing her grant mercy more than once, and exhibit rather foolish loyalty, as well as refusing to transport heroin (since it's socially destructive, as opposed to hash and cocaine!), but this is all rather disingenuous. And contrary to what some reviewers have written, he definitely does play up her past: her dirt-poor childhood and alcoholic mother are alluded to more than once, as is her sexual abuse as a small girl. But none of this is really enough to make the reader care about a character who spends the entire story not understanding her own choices.The book is at its best when it wallows in the details of the international drug trade, all the intricacies and logistics of getting drug A to point B--small planes, speedboats, customs helicopters, dummy ships--it all reeks of heavy research. And at the heart of it all is epic corruption on all sides. The various locales are also well rendered, from the Mexican state capital of Culiacan to the sleazy ports of Spain and Morocco, and finally the gleaming high life of Marbella. The supporting cast of characters is quite good, from Theresa's various boyfriends, to her stoic bodyguard, and the amiable Russian gangster who acts as mentor. But as in the movies, it's never a good thing when the bit players have more personality than the lead. Stylistically, Perez-Reverte does try a few tricks, such as weaving \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" into the plot, and making Mexican narcocorridos a recurring (and tiresome) element. (Those interested in narcocorridos should check out Elijah Wald's aptly titled book Narcocorridos.) So, there's a lot to like in the book, however the central character and storyline are flat and lifeless."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I wrote it once and I will write it again: the perfect novel is one that combines literary aspirations with an engaging plot, thus mixing the high-brow (the tone) with the low-brow (the cheap thrills of a great best-seller).

And it did pull me into the first chapter.Then I paused. What, he's making drug-scum into heroes and heroines? I didn't really want to go on. Yet, I couldn't resist the appeal of Perez-Reverte's prose. I'm glad I didn't. Because \\"The Queen of the South\\" is another winner by an author I'm really beginning to like.\\"Queen\\" is a look into the sordid world of drug smugglers on two continents and, despite my distaste for the real thing, it's an engrossing romp. As I did, you may not find Teresa Mendoza appealing at first. But, she'll grow on you as you watch her grow from a teenaged narco's morra into a sophisticated woman worthy of her own corrido as she and her faithful bodyguard Pote facedown their enemies alone.Perez-Reverte even throws in a surprise late in the book, which puts another light on his hero and heroine. But, I can't get into that without spoiling the story for others.The author employs a technique in which the tale is told in alternate chapters by Teresa and an anonymous reporter, a method which adds a sense of reality to the tale."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"In Perez-Reverte's earlier work he studied a subject throughly and then used that knowledge to build the story within the subject giving the reader great subject detail along with the story. It worked well in The Flanders Panel, Club Dumas, The Seville Communion, worked horribly against him in the Fencing Master, was distracting in The Nautical Chart. In The Queen of The South the author has studied the drug trade, its sex, violence, business ways, and music but this time instead he has a novel that takes off running and keeps moving, driven by a strong female lead character and well drawn supporting figures that displays his knowledge without slowing down. This book has a different translator than the others, and maybe that makes some of the difference in conveying the action and roughness of the story. It goes front to back without ever stumbling, faster paced than his other novels. If he was inspired by Dan Brown he took the inspiration and made it his own, and definitely for the better."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I have read Perez-Reverte's &quot;The Fencing Master&quot; and &quot;TheNautical Chart&quot;. I consider these books intellectual noir,whose plot revolves, in part, around a feme fatal. Thebeautiful faithless women in these book are one dimensional.Even in &quot;The Nautical Chart&quot;, where the book revolves aroundthe beautiful Tanger, we never really get a feeling for whoshe is. Coy, the man who loves her, spends the book tryingto understand her. But in the end Coy only has a collectionof observations that never really add up to a whole.Having read two books by Perez-Reverte where the women werebeautiful and dangerous characters without full dimensionI wondered if Perez-Reverte could actually write about athree dimensional women. The answer has been provided in&quot;The Queen of the South&quot;.The central character is Teresa, a complex woman with acomplex history. By the end of the book I felt thatPerez-Reverte has created a character that could have livedbeyond the pages of the book. Before becoming a novelistPerez-Reverte was a new reporter and it shows in this book.When I finished reading the last page, I had the strangefeeling that the events recounted really could have happenedexactly as outlined. This was reinforced by the fact thatPerez-Reverte has incorporated some actual people into hisstory.Teresa as a dark character and by the end ofthe book she has blood on her hands. Perhaps becausePerez-Reverte provides such an intimate portrait of TeresaI was unable to see her as evil, despite some of her actions.We see Teresa grow from a scared young woman to full adulthoodinto a sophisticated woman.The story of &quot;The Queen of the South&quot; is told by a reporterand the detail in which the world of drug running isdescribed in amazing detail. Like Fredrick Forsyth's &quot;OdessaFile&quot;, one is reading a novelization of actual reality.The story is gripping. From the start we feel that Teresais living on borrowed time. There is nothing of the slowbuildup that exists in &quot;The Fencing Master&quot;. This bookis a page turner from the start."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"In Queen of the South, Arturo Perez Reverte has moved from the rarified world of antique book sellers (Club Dumas), art historians,(Flanders Panel) and duelists (Fencing Master) to the gritty world of international drug trafficking. With this novel, Perez Reverte capitalizes in our fascination with crime. Not crime as practiced by the legions of petty criminals but high crime as practiced by international drug smugglers and mafia dons.The novel's hero, Teresa Mendoza begins her story as the girl friend of a small time Mexican narco. With his murder, she is forced to flee Mexico. She works her way up from a barkeep in Spanish Morocco to the \\"Queen of the South\\", the most important smuggler of drugs in the Mediterranean. All this, in only twelve years.Perez Reverte is an old fashioned story teller in the 19th Century tradition of Dumas or Hugo. He is very talented writer and uses all of his consierable skill to keep this story moving. There are plenty of well written scenes that get the heart beating and the hairs on the back of the neck to stand up. If I were rating this story on sheer writing talent, the Queen of the South would get five plus stars.However, what keeps the Queen of the South from being a really good novel is the sense that the story is not plausable. For this type of story to work, Perez Reverte should take his cue from Mexico's Narco Corridos. At the end of a ballad by Los Tigres del Norte, you can always turn to the person sitting next to you and say, \\"Dicen que fue cierto\\" or They say it really happened.The first two thirds of the novel are terrific. Perez Reverte has the feel of Sinaloa and the Straights of Gibralter just right. He started to lose me once Teresa begins her meteoric rise to the top of the drug trade. It is as though she goes from being a three dimensional character to a stereotype of a drug lord. It is as though Perez Reverte lost his story telling nerve.In the greatest novel of this genre \\"The Godfather\\", Mario Puzo understood the importance of taking his time to tell the story of the rise of Vito Corleone. Like Teresa Mendoza, Vito Corleone must flee his homeland to escape assasins. Through cunning, hard work and violence, he rises from obscurity to become the head of a crime organization. Don Corleone's rise to power takes decades and his wholly believable. He is a believable character from start to finish. The Godfather in both its novel and movie form will be around for generations. While a good read, The Queen of the South's destiny is to be an ephemeral novel. Unfortunately, Perez Reverte did not have the nerve to make this a great novel."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"This is not Perez-Reverte's best novel, rather it reads more like an homage to the rags-to-riches story and the Al Pacino movie Scarface. There are two narrators in the book - the supposed \\"author\\" of a book on the main character and then the impartial, 3rd-party narrator - and the story switches back and forth between them. And this highlights two weaknesses of the book: the characters are all well-sketched, but aside from the main character, Teresa Mendoza, none are filled in; and then the unevenness of the plotting - at several points the story is rapid-fire and well done, and then at others, you'll find yourself skimming paragraphs.I would've liked more of the characters to be fleshed out; I found myself wanting to know more about the \\"author\\" of the book on Teresa while I related less and less to Teresa - the more powerful she grows, the less likable she becomes and I wondered where that came from.That said, the book has a number of incredibly well-written passages, including a single paragraph on a suicide that is so sharp and precise that you will remember it far more than you'll remember the book's ending.J.

EVERY SINGLE DAY ON THE BOOK IS DIFFERENT BUT IS VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND DO TO HIS GOOD WRITING, YOU CAN NOT SKIP PAGES BECAUSE IF YOU DO YOU WILL MIS A LOT. WHILE READING YOU WILL NOTICE THAT IT MAKES YOUR IMAGINATION TO TAKE YOU TO EVERY SCENE MAKING YOU FEEL AS IF YOU WERE THERE, IT MAKES YOU ESCAPE FROM YOUR REALITY TAKING YOU TO THE REALITY OF TERESA MENDOZA'S PAST. THE STORY IS VERY REALISTIC AND ALL THE THOUSANDS OF CHANGES THAT HAPPEN ARE ALREADY EXPECTED. IT IS NOT INTERNALLY CONSISTENT.

I kind of like Mr Perez's writing. Truth be told, this one seems like to have been written for a Euro style movie, and whoa! I am right. They did try to make a movie out of it, which is on hold due to some problems with real Sianola cartel in Mexico. Anyway, the book has a lot of beautiful lines, paradoxical aphorisms and \\"eternal-truth\\" type sentences. It makes one think. As for me, I kind of felt sorry for some characters. This book is different from traditional Italian Mafia movies--different vibe and it carries a sort of fatalism that is very common in writings like this.The author could use less pages in details--the geographical description, the local scenes etc, often seemed to be superfluous, made the book unnecessarily long. However, he writes well often throughout the book and that allows the reader to hold on, and go on reading, albeit with a wish that he could use less pages.You will enjoy it as a first reading, but feel free to skim few pages every now and then."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I READ THIS NOVEL IN SPANISH WHICH WAS THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE IT WAS WRITTEN AND JUST LOVED IT.

Dirt poor barefoot Mexican girl rises to be the largest drug runner in the Mediterranean. I did learn a lot of useful smuggling tips but at this late date I'm probably not going to switch careers.The book suffers due to its translation. It's pretty obvious that whoever translated this was a native Spanish speaker. That's fine as far as it goes, but the next step should have been to get a native English writer (not translator) to smooth out some of the rough edges. My guess is that Perez-Reverte's original Spanish text was fine even poetic and I would pick up another of his books next time I'm traveling in Spain, but while I am now back stateside I'll stick with Alan Furst and Martin Cruz-Smith."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"A must read!

I picked it up having never read anything by Perez-Reverte and hoped for the best. (I've had some bad experiences with authors I don't know...*shivers*) Well, \\"The Queen\\" certainly delivered!The is the story of Teresa Mendoza who went from being the girlfriend of a small time drug smuggler in Sinaloa, Mexico with no more than a sixth grade education, to a woman who graced the covers of society pages worldwide while running one of the most sucessful cociane and hashish traffiking chains in the world at the same time. This book is somewhat of a modern retelling of \\"The Counte of Monte Cristo\\" by Alexandre Dumas, complete with jail time, treasure hunting and an Abbe Faria (Patty \\"Lieutenant\\" O'Farrell). Oh, and a hefty dose of revenge."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"If you can plod through the first half, the second half gets much better. After we meet Theresa Mendoza preparing to run for her life after the killing of her drug-runner boyfriend, the story continues as we follow her flight from Mexico to Southern Spain, new drug-runner boyfriend, prison time, etc. Finally, the second half improves as we see Theresa weave a complex web of corporate structures designed to cover her own drug transport business that would make any corporate tycoon proud. While there are some exciting moments, the story is mostly predictable and ends up an unsatisfying read. Put this at the bottom of the pile on your bedside table."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"This is one of those books that make me glad my native tongue is Spanish. A warning, tough: This book makes extensive use of Mexican Slang (Being Mexican I had trouble understanding one word!) So, even if your Spanish (as second language) is good, I would recommend reading the translated work; other than that, I understand the English translation is very good.

This is a work of fiction which reads like fact and will hold the reader from page one to page four hundred thirty six. The story revolves around the international drug trade with all of its seaminess, danger and excess. It is about loyalty, betrayal, and intrigue and is as good a book as you will read all year. As the story opens a cell phone is ringing and the fact that it is tells Mendoza that she has to run for her life. The phone was given to her by her boyfriend who was called \\"the king of the short runways\\" due to his ability to take a small plane loaded with cocaine off a runway of less than a thousand feet. He told her if it ever rings, he is dead and she must run for her life. She does and what a run it is.

I listened to the audio version (wonderfully done, btw) and found myself reluctant to leave my car so tranfixed was I. I plan on adding this book to my library & recommend that you do,too."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"Southern Queen is not a mystery - which this author writes so well. Mr. Perez-Reverte's mysteries are intellectual and fascinating. This book is neither. Nor is it a thriller, despite the thrilling nature of the first ten pages. It is an account of a woman who starts as the girlfriend of a pilot for a drug ring, moves to be girlfriend of a drug-runner who uses a boat and then, after prison, builds her own fortune in the drug trade thus becoming the Queen of the South.The boats and planes must have gone fast, but boy, this novel did not. Maybe it was the translator (who changed from P-R's first works), but I doubt it. As much as the writing was slow, so was the plot.The layout of the book is in two intermingling parts. The author of the Queen's biography interviews characters associated with the Queen. Then it bounces back into a direct account of the Queen's life as related by that tangential character.The Queen never became a sympathetic character. The reader never could understand her motivation, wants or desires. She was not likeable; nor was she unlikeable. She was just \\"there\\". That was also her view of her own life. Too many pages were devoted to recounting her inability to expalin why she was doing what she was doing. There was no attempt at explaining her motivations. It is difficult to travel through 434 pages with someone that provokes absolutely no feelings.The plot, as noted, is thin. She goes from girlfriend to girlfriend/runner, to prisoner to mogul of an enterprise. The mogul part comes at the speed of light. The small bit of tension in the novel is in the first twenty or so pages and then the last 30 or so. The rest is slow and blah.Mr. Perez-Reverte should return to the mystery genre. Fans of his should avoid this book."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"After reading just over a quarter of this book, I've decided to stop reading it. I'm a voracious reader, and have only abandoned a book once before. The best I can say about \\"The Queen of the South\\" is that it contains some pleasing descriptive phrases. The narrator is unidentified, as is his interest in/connection to the main character, as is his ability to know the main characters thoughts, despite having met her only once. The book would be a hundred pages shorter if Teresa Mendoza had spent less time mentally cursing her dead lover. Yeesh. I hear it gets pretty interesting if you can keep wading through the muck.

Drugs. Desire. The story of a beautiful young Mexican woman named Teresa Mendoza comes to life in this stunning novel. In \\"Queen of the South\\" by Arturo Perez-Reverte, the lives of drug lords and their acquaintances are revealed in a personal way. Struggling, un-educated and alone, Teresa must face life without her boyfriend and protector, Guero, who was murdered by fellow drug lords. In an attempt to free herself from his web of deception and crime, Teresa flees from Mexico. However, her new life in Morocco is taking a familiar turn. A new boyfriend with a strangely familiar job re-complicates her life and Teresa is once again thrust into the world of drug lords and danger.After a tragic accident and a short time in prison, Teresa is alone again, and in grave danger. Dogging her enemies is harder than ever, with people searching for her from Mexico to Morocco. Friends are now enemies, and enemies grow closer to becoming friends. Teresa's remarkable journey through the world of drug and gang violence will captivate readers from any background and change they way they think about the drug dealing masterminds around the world.Though the style of writing and the grammar used was spectacular, I felt that the plot line was lacking. Flash backs and flash forwards between Teresa's life before and after do not seem to flow easily together for me. The repetition of situations over time does make the storyline more interesting, but after a while the comparison becomes too similar and becomes dull in my opinion. Teresa's character was, however, believable and captivating. Her past life and educational setbacks make her development as a character more interesting and the outcome more amazing.I learned a lot about the effort and danger inflicted on drug dealers and their acquaintances from the book \\"The Queen of the South\\". The rich culture and strong religious backgrounds of the people in Mexico is represented extremely well and I would recommend this book to just about anyone of High School age and over."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

They are unique, intelligent and clever.This book deviates from the format of many of his other novels. Rather than parallel stories set in the historical past and the present - with an artifact connecting them, this story tells Teresa's story from the perspective of witnessing her story first hand as well as from the perspective of a reporter/novelist who is researching her story.The book itself moves slowly and just didn't grab me. The story is interesting enough - I enjoy it while I'm reading it. But I can put it down and not come back to it for days or weeks. It took me months to complete, rather than the few solid days of non-stop reading when I had free moments that his other books have inspired in me.

Essentially it is a variation upon the story of Count of Monte Cristo, with the heroine who possess some skills and experience in the drug trade being schooled in prison by a more educated and refined older prisoner who has a secret treasure, in this case half a ton of cocaine, which serves as the basis for the Queens later success. However success and richness does not bring happiness and surrounded by betrayal and increasing risk, Teresa finds it necessary to return to Mexico to face the past which put her on the path of crime.As I said in a previous review I read Perez- Reverte for his research and understanding of the setting of his story. In this case Perez-Reverte setting is the drug trade and he presents a convincing portrait of the trade, the players and their methods and their code of unique code of honour and behavior.Overall the Queen of the South is an enjoyable take on an old classic."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I have read his other books and liked this one as well.

I wish it were the only thing that was repeated excessively. Virtually anything that bores you reading once is guaranteed to come up again in the following chapter. With no development, mind you, just repeated. Does Perez-Reverte have no one in his life to tell him honestly how insufferable this tome is? I was really looking forward to reading it because I have a personal connection to many of the locations he writes about, but, alas, I probably will not be able to finish it.

Typically, his female lead is gutsy, gritty, gorgeous and ruminates on the eternal 'whys' of fate, love, mercy and cruelty.The Queen of the South is tightly paced compared to many of Perez-Reverte's other novels and perhaps because of this the depth of nuance found in The Fencing Master or The Nautical Chart, is missing here. Still we cannot help but want more.Perez-Reverte writes with a touch that is personal to everyone and accessable to many. The Queen of the South may also be the best-translated of his novels.

I listened to the audio book (though I can't recall who read it), and I found it to be a riveting story. It was complex and multi-layered, and I found that hearing the story read by a Spanish speaker allowed me to really sink into the story, as it sounded authentic and real (as opposed to how I may have narrated in my head). I would highly recommend this book, and would urge readers to listen to this story instead of (or in addition to) actually reading it. For word pronunciation alone, it was worth it, but the who audio experience added a additional level of enjoyment for me.Also, for what it's worth, the ending left a huge opportunity for a sequel, should Reverte ever be inclined, and that is a very tantalizing way to end a book & have the reader (listener) searching for more titles by the same author."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"Perez Reverte's fact based novel about Teresa Mendoza, who not only survives but dominates the world of drug traffic, had me glued to the pages from start to finish. I could never have imagined the extent and power of the drug trade until I read this book. Reverte, a member of the Real Academia Espa&ntilde;ola, which publishes the authorized Spanish dictionary, is one of the great novelists of our time. This may be his finest work. I have read the book in the original Spanish as well as in English, and the translation is excellent. The book was serialized into a tele-novela in Spanish which had a huge audience. Barrels of tears were shed world wide at the concluding episode.I can't keep a copy of the book on my shelves. I want all my friends to read it, but don't wait until we meet for your copy. You will never regret your purchase of this book."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"Perhaps it was audiobook performer/reader Lina Patel's interpretation of The Queen of the South that made me feel Reverte's survivor-riser tale was a middling accomplishment. And the story is a rather conventional for the rising criminal drama, except here the protagonist is a woman, a character strategy that gives \\"Queen\\" an edge of uniqueness - Ms. Scarface if you will. From a teenage street merchant, to girlfriend of a raffish, risk-taking fly-boy drug runner, and on to controlling drug trafficking in the Mediterranean, Teresa Mendoza by her late 30s becomes one tough mujer .... and a multimillionairess after all the AK-47 smoke clears and she walks unscathed (just a cut on the wrist) off the page and into a life of anonymous luxury under a witness protection program. Roll the credits.But WHO is she? Reverte's character does this, does that, learns to think one step ahead of her rivals and enemies, but most of the time there is little interiority to Mendoza, aside from desperation, anger, determination and a sense of rough honor among violent narco-criminals. Someone this canny and street smart ought to have some reflective capacity that would give the character more depth. Instead, she is \\"fleshed out\\" by reacting and acting to various situations.Reverte compensates for this by creating an investigative journalist who \\"wants Mendoza's story,\\" and is periodically inserted into the narrative to interview lawyers, policemen, etc. who knew her on her rise to becoming the Queen of the South. This approach eventually made Mendoza a less attractive character for me, my sympathy evaporating as the tale wore on. These interviewees are little more than stand-ins for the author, telling us about Mendoza's reacting and acting, too -- adding to the chorus. In a psychologically adept novel, even criminal protagonists can gain the reader's empathy, if their creator renders them with enough humanity for the reader to identify with them.The book is at its strongest in its descriptions of the drug trade -- the actual transportation of narcotics under hazardous conditions and threat of getting caught or killed. And some of the scenes of the confrontations between participants negotiating terms of the drug trade are pretty well drawn and have an element of convincing suspense.However, in the audiobook version I \\"read,\\" the book tends toward a flatness in Patel's rendering. She fails to give life to the main Russian character, and can't imbue routine dialogue with any saving oomph, and this shows the weakness of Reverte's artistry in Queen. Average books by average authors can transcend themselves under the reading of a gifted interpreter. Alas, Ms. Patel is not that."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"This book is a bit too long, but it's an absorbing and revelatory novel that seems almost like a \\"docudrama.\\" It follows the career of Teresa Mendoza. At the beginning of the novel she's the passive, bewildered, terrified girlfriend of a Mexican drug runner, but by the end, she's among the most feared and admired drug smugglers in the world.The novel charts her rise through an alternative universe- a complex web of people and organizations, including governments, all of them involved or complicit in drug smuggling. The only law these people respect, the author reminds us, is the law of supply and demand. This is the core of the novel: these people are simply responding to a massive, worldwide demand for cocaine, hashish, marijuana, etc; if nobody wanted this stuff, nobody would be smuggling it. And if so many governments did not contain puritanical moralists intent on wiping out the drug trade and/or keeping it illegal, this outlaw network wouldn't have any reason to exist.The crude, shootout ending of the novel is unexpected and not very effective, especially after the painstaking detail of the foregoing book. Teresa Mendoza isn't a likable character, but you can't help having a sneaking admiration for this tough little female survivor in the most brutal of male worlds."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I appreciate that Reverte was probably trying to do a kind of modern-day Count of Monte Cristo with this book, but it doesn't really hold up. All that came through for me was a story about the drug trade, and one that we've seen before.Where, at the beginning of the novel, Teresa Mendoza is sympathetic -- you want to see her escape from her nasty predicament -- by the end of the book she's a cold, unlikeable cipher. Along the way we meet various other characters in her life: The men, to whom she's loyal but largely indifferent; her supposed best frend and mentor, who receds into the distance and is eventually written out of the plot with a nasty end; her implausibly faithful servant and bodyguard, whose loyalty is repaid with death, allowing Teresa to escape; business associates, who come and go. Who cares about any of them?The events of the plot are pretty stock, too. A lucky break sees Teresa rise to the top of the drug game. We're told that she's the best in the business -- and yet, why? As an international drug kingpin she's barely believable. At times her actions seem irrational to the point of ridicule, but she meanders through the plot, never too close to any real danger. When confronted by cops who have been tailing her, digging into her past and who threaten to expose her operations, the only emotion she shows is a vague irritation: Why won't they go away? We're told she amasses countless millions, stashed away in Swiss bank accounts, and yet all we ever see her doing with her free time is sitting by herself, sipping a tequila and moping. Almost as an aside, we're reminded that she's a figure of incredible prominence, the \\"Queen of the South\\" -- but where's the evidence?Surely if it were that easy we'd all be doing it.It's almost as if Reverte glossed over the key events of Teresa's rise because he knows that we, too, have seen Scarface; so why sweat the details? Ultimately, however, this lack of coherence makes the book unfulfilling, and by the time I got to the bloody shootout at the end I had shrugged off the idea of looking for any logic in it. The shootout is there because it has to be there. It was there in Scarface, it was there in Menace 2 Society, it was there in New Jack City ... need I go on? This is a drug story, like so many others.The difference in this one is that Reverte sets it in the south of Spain and north Africa, and partially in Mexico. Judging from the dedication at the front of the book, what happened is that Reverte fell in love with the idea of Mexican corridos, traditional folks songs that, in modern times, often glorify the drug trade and the characters in it. At times you feel as though he's hearing those songs in his head as he writes the book. Maybe he was listening to them on a little boombox as he typed. But I wasn't hearing them while I tried to read it, and as a result, it seems like something was missing from the experience.I enjoyed The Nautical Chart and The Club Dumas much better."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"If you haven't read anything by Mr. Perez-Reverte and are coming into this one because of his deservedly excellent reputation, you might find yourself disappointed. Although the story would seem to have all the right ingredients, it remains flat, and in the end it's not really clear what his purpose was in writing it.It is the story of the career of a young and attractive but otherwise non-descript Mexican woman who becomes a very powerful and influential drug lord after moving to Spain. The opening pages are quite exciting. She is taking a shower, in her pleasant home, on an otherwise normal day, when her phone rings. This is a pre-arranged signal between her and her drug-running boyfriend, and which means that he has probably been killed--or soon will be--and that she will be next. She must clear out of there, and fast.She escapes, with help, and ends up working as a cashier in a nightclub on the southern tip of Spain. Soon she meets another drug-smuggler type who becomes her boyfriend only this time, she takes part in his activities. Disaster strikes, and she ends up being jailed, a not so unfortunate event in that she meets an inmate who is taken with her and who is keeping a marvelous secret. This is her lucky break. From there it is a meeting with a Russian gangster, a rise in status, and eventually deals and transgressions with the most powerful Italian, Colombian, and Spanish drug cartels.It's almost like a primer. First, she learns about the drug business, then she learns about money, then she learns about smuggling, then she makes connections. And while all this is going on, several tragic events befall her which turn her into the stoic, single-minded, cold-hearted person she needs to be in order to achieve success.It all makes sense. Too much sense, in fact, and this is the problem. We've heard this story before. What makes the story of Theresa Mendoza so special that we have to hear it again? Other than the fact that she is an attractive woman, not much. And, of course, she's fictional. She's not even real.Compounding the problem is the novel's framing device, which are the first-person interjections of a journalist who's writing her story. The plot is interrupted often as he tells of interviews he has with various people who knew or knew of Theresa, what they think of her, and what he thinks of them. This device gives a documentary-type feel to the proceedings that only add to the, \\"why am I reading this?\\" attitude already nagging at the reader. Unfortunately, it slows things down and could have been excised entirely.This isn't a bad novel. The characters, setting and situation are all believable and detailed and the story is at least moderately interesting. Mr. Perez-Reverte is certainly competent. But there's no spark, no sense of excitement, no deep intrigue to keep you awake late into the night. For that, try The Club Dumas, The Fencing Master, or The Nautical Chart. If you haven't read any of his novels yet, start with one of those."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"Queen of the South may be in my top ten of all novels ever. From the first few pages to the last paragraph, Perez-Reverte had me mesmerized. I literally couldn't put it down. His style paints pictures in such detail that I felt like I was there. I could almost taste the night sea air between Spain, Gibraltar, and Morocco; I could almost hear the Mexican songs seeking to immortalize the drug runners.From the cover, I had complete misceptions about the protagonist, whose character Perez-Reverte built chapter-by-chapter into a woman as powerful and intriguing and unsettling as any I could imagine. His story is a portrait of a fascinating woman, but it is 180 degrees from being a chick book..."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"Hispanic literature has been severely underrepresented in the United States, given the size of the Latino population in the United States. That said, Arturo P&eacute;rez-Reverte's \\"The Queen of the South\\" is a most welcome and unconventional addition to the literature.\\"Queen of the South\\" is a story about Teresa Mendoza, a working class Mexicana that makes the most of her smarts and savvy in the hazardous and brutal drug trade. There's plenty of violence and the sort of suspense one associates with spy novels. The novel is also a story about meritocracy, feminism, and globalization; one told from a totally different perspective.The novel makes me wonder, how many Teresa Mendoza's are out there in Sinaloa or Ciudad Juarez who choose a different path in life because of obstacles, whether real or perceived. What if Teresa Mendoza had come from an upper class or upper middle class Mexican family and obtained an education? Would she have been a captain in an industry such as banking? Find out for yourself. My recommendation is that you read and reread \\"Queen of the South.\\" Read the novel and savor it like a fine wine. Perhaps you'll doing something other than reading or listening to a novel and Teresa Mendoza's extraordinary tale will bring something from the novel to mind. It might be a particular scene or a passage. Whatever it is, Perez-Reverte has written a novel that delivers.Perez-Reverte, a Spanish writer popular among European readers, has written a novel with the most substantive and unique twist on the drug trade I've ever come across. It's a story that most American novelists would probably never bothered to tackle given the cultural mindset they seem locked into. Just as Spanish actors like Javier Bardem and Antonio Banderas have helped open doors to Latinos in Hollywood, perhaps it might be Perez-Reverte or another Spanish novelist that hastens New York publishers to market more Latino literature to American readers."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"Teresa Mendoza reminds me a little of Matty Walker in Body Heat, the searing, thrilling, sensual movie of 1980's fame. We're not really sure of how Matty got to where she is when we first see her, and like that, we really aren't certain of where we start with Teresa.Certainly, Perez-Reverte seems to paint a picture of innocence when 'the phone rings.' Sexy innocence. I can't recall any novel of such intense excitement beginning with the heroine shaving her legs. But maybe Perez-Reverte is having a joke on us. Perhaps he's saying, 'not innocence my friend, but naivete. Untested. Unaware.' Once she gets to her safe house a few pages later she takes a hit of coke. All is not as we first perceived. Come to think of it, most if not all of Perez-Reverte's characters are never as first observed.He is a remarkable author, a combination of all of our \\"name\\" brands writing in Spain, certainly popular all over Europe and now with a substantial following in the US. And this is a remarkable book with heavy doses of greed, sexism, crime, desire, retribution and redemption.When her lover, Guero Davilla, a pilot smuggling drugs is killed, she knows she will be next. Such is the way it will be in Sinola, Mexico, he warns her repeatedly, as he left a cell phone for her with only one purpose, to tell her that he has been killed. Or tortured and killed. Then the Mexican narcotic traffickers, the narcos, will kill the entire family of the traitor. Guero says he will hold out as long as he can but eventually he will tell them where to find her. He says \\"the phone will ring and if you don't run, soon you will see someone you know. He will smile at you. And then you are a dead woman.\\"The only thing that Guero left besides $20,000 and a Colt Double Eagle pistol was a diary of events and places, and of course, names. He tells her under no circumstances should she read the diary but to turn it over to his old narco boss, don Epfanio Vargas. She does this, and the don spares her life and gives her a 24 hour start.The other thing about Perez-Reverte is that his diction and description and dialogue are all just beautiful. He reminds me of Alan Furst who writes about pre World War Europe, detailing violent events in a rich, deep style.The journey takes Mendoza one step away from death to one of the most powerful drug lords in the world. She's a strong, beautiful character. The story is detailed in narrative style told to and through a journalist. The characters are rich and three dimensional. A great story rivaling in intensity some of the greatest crime tales in America. 5 Stars, could have been twice as many. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I've been of fan of Perez-Reverte for years, starting with The Club Dumas, which Roman Polanski turned into a movie starring Johnny Depp. He is Spain's most beloved author, and after reading The Queen of the South, I hope more American readers catch on.In subject, this book is a bit of a departure from his earlier books, but still as riveting. It features a fierce, savvy woman named Teresa Mendoza who must flee Mexico when her drug dealer boyfriend is taken out. She goes onto Morocco, and after several years, learns the drug trade. Eventually, she becomes one of the most powerful drug traffickers in all Europe. She is a startling character.Her tale is narrated by a reporter who has heard of her legend years after Teresa's rise. Like everyone who hears her story, he is mesmerized by this woman.You will be too. Typically, I read more literary fiction. Arturo Perez-Reverte combines the best of the both worlds--beautiful, intelligent writing and a riveting plot. Think Patrick O'Brien, Graham Greene, Carlos Ruiz Zafron (although I read Shadow of the Wind too and this is much better)."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"Shame on the gaggle of people who pigeonhole an author into one genre and then cry when he expands his horizions. If you are looking for a formula in Arturo Perez-Reverte, you are bound to be sorely disappoined. If you want to read the formulaic crap that most U.S. author's fall into, then go pick up a Patterson or a Grisham. If you detest comfort, tear through Arturo's published works and savor every book as a unique and enticing experience.Queen of the South is certainly no exception to this rule. Here the author departs from what little formula he ever follows and this book reads more like a journalistic effort than a prose work. Perez-Reverte was a reporter in a former life, and this book shows off his skills beautifully. Sometimes it is hard to believe that this story is not a fabrication. It smacks of total authenticity. It is so different from his other works that it may take a while for the reader to settle into the story being told, but it certainly isn't boring or flat.Far from Teresita being a character that a reader can't connect with and empathize with and find themselves in, I found her to be extremely believeable. From the moment her drug running boyfriend is killed and she is forced to run for her life, she is a lost soul. And she does the things that she has to do to survive, that are necessary, good, bad and ugly. So she never really finds herself. She remains, in effect, a lost soul. So she doesn't have this wonderful epiphany that turns all things right again. So what? Some of us, after being confronted with \\"The Situation\\" never do. Far from making her actions and reactions inauthentic, they seem to make them all the more real. One of the complaints about the author in the past has been a certain weakness in his portrayal of female characters, but Perez-Reverte has proven with this tale that these allegations have been totally unfounded.In the past, the author's books have been driven by beautiful language and technical mastery of a specific subject--fencing, sailing, bookmaking, etc. But one of the joys of this tale is that, although it does delve with some depth into the drug trade, the story is totally character and conversation driven. Some of the beautiful language and turn of phrase that he is known for certainly exists here and there are some wonderful poetic moments, but they all come out of the mouths of characters rather than flowery prose. It is the people in this book, rather than the chosen topic of the novel, that is captivating. The characters of Theresa herself and Pinto, the hitman turned bodyguard, are especially well fleshed out.I'm sorry if you don't agree. I'm sorry if all of the action and journalistic tone and the massive amounts of character interaction turned you off to this story. But if you haven't done so yet, finish the book. If you don't you will miss one of the biggest payoffs in recent literature. The last forty pages are some of the most heart stopping passages you will ever be subjected to. There isn't a Hollywood ending tacked on here. The events that take place are fully foreshadowed in the tone and theme of the book. But, man, are they extremely exciting and extremely gripping and extremely satisfying. Shame on you if you miss it."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"For those of us who enjoy being totally lost in a fictional world for hours, even days, the six hundred pages of Queen of the South, is the ideal prescription. From the opening lines: \\"The telephone rang, and she knew she was going to die,\\" we are caught up in the fascinating life of Teresa Mendoza, a young and vulnerable Mexicana, in love with a blond-haired Chicano pilot, G&uuml;ero D&aacute;vila, who is flying drugs from Colombia to San Antonio and El Paso. There are the dangers of arrest and imprisonment from customs and from drug enforcement agents, of course. But there are also worse dangers from the narcotraficantes themselves should G&uuml;ero D&aacute;vila lose a shipment, compromise the drugs or the money, or inform on his bosses. It is a high-risk business based in Sinaloa where the people he works for will not simply settle for his death if he betrays them. He will be tortured for hours until he gives up everyone and everything he knows. Then he will be killed, and his relatives and associates will be hunted down and murdered as well. G&uuml;ero tells Teresa this and also that he has stashed money, some cocaine, a mysterious notebook and a SIG-Sauer in a safe apartment where she is to go if she ever receives word that he has been killed.When word of his death comes, she is in the bathtub. She gets out of the tub feeling the chill of the night air, and the premonition of danger, as she answers the phone and learns of G&uuml;ero's fate. The Tigres del Norte are singing a narco-corrido on the radio and the words of the song, the tragic end of a doomed drug dealer, put Teresa into a panic. She manages to pack a few things, and goes to the safe apartment where the money, drugs, and pistol are stashed. Once there, she puts them into a gym bag and sits down on the bed. She opens the notebook, and reads the dates and names of the shipments G&uuml;ero has been involved in and realizes that he may have been working for the DEA. As she gets ready to leave, two hit men arrive and block her way. One is determined to simply put a bullet in her brain and leave. The other wants to \\"have a bit of fun\\" first, and proceeds to rape her while his companion yells at him in disgust and then turns to go into an adjoining room. This distraction gives Teresa time to reach into the gym bag and shoot her assailant in the face. She holds the other man off at gunpoint, and then escapes to the streets of Culiac&aacute;n where she contacts G&uuml;ero's padrino who is also in the drug business. She gives him the notebook, and he provides her with safe passage to Europe.She goes to Spain where she hooks up with another young smuggler. This one drives speedboats transporting drugs from North Africa across the straits of Gibraltar into Spain. Unlike her relationship with G&uuml;ero, where she was little more than a morra, or narco girlfriend, this time she participates more actively in the business, keeping the books, learning to repair the speedboats, and she even accompanies him on occasional smuggling missions. On one such venture, forced by coast guard patrol boats and a helicopter toward a dangerous beach, the speedboat crashes, killing her lover instantly, while she is seriously injured and almost drowns. She is rescued and taken to a hospital and, when she recovers, tried as an accessory and sentenced to a short prison term. There, she meets another young woman, this one from a wealthy family, also serving a short sentence for drugs. It seems that her former boyfriend had stashed over 50 kilos of high grade cocaine stolen from the Russian mafia. Now he was dead, the cocaine long gone, and the mafia assumed she was just a spoiled rich girl who knew nothing about it.When they get out of prison a year later, they recover the cocaine, and take it to the Russian mafia, who give them a finder's fee. With Teresa's knowledge of boats, shipping routes and finance, she convinces them to allow her to use her proceeds to set up a major transport business for the transshipment of drugs to Russia and Eastern Europe via sea-going vessels. Meanwhile the Mexican drug lord, discovering where she was, had sends two hit men to kill her in Spain. Enlisting the help of the Russians she is able to outwit the killers. She shoots one of them herself, and the other (the good half of the original pair who refused to take part in her rape in Culiac&aacute;n) she invites to be her bodyguard.Within a few years Teresa has become the \\"Queen of the South,\\" controlling transportation routes from Cartegena to Spain for cocaine, and from West Africa through Gibraltar to Eastern Europe and Russia for hashish. By the time she is thirty years old she is worth more than ten million dollars.One day she is approached by a representative of the Spanish government and a DEA agent. He tells her that, while her first lover was killed by hit men from a rival gang (one of whom she killed in retaliation), the hit was ordered not by a rival drug lord--but by the padrino who engineered her escape to Europe. Later, when he found out that she was successfully involved in the transport business in Europe, he himself sent the two hit men there. He had retired a wealthy man from his drug activity, gone into politics, and decided to eliminate any loose ends which might connect him to his narco past. He was now about to become a senator in Mexico, and the DEA and Mexican government wanted him brought down. They tell her that they are aware of her activities in Europe, and offer her immunity if she returns to Mexico and testifies against the padrino. Her response, and the events that follow from it, reveal not only the inner workings of the drug trade in the U.S., Europe and Mexico, but are also packed with action, double betrayals, and more violence than the best scenes of \\"Dirty Harry\\" or \\"Amores Perros.\\"The physical details in the writing, the intricacies of the narcotics trade, and the careful research as well as the names of former and current politicos, drug lords and officials, make this novel read more like a non-fiction thriller, a genre first developed by Truman Capote with In Cold Blood. The omniscient narrator is a former investigative reporter who now only produces \\"works of four hundred pages or more.\\" The journalistic background is a perfect disguise for the Spanish author, Arturo P&eacute;rez-Reverte, whose books have sold over three million copies worldwide, been translated into nineteen languages and published in thirty countries. In this excellent translation by Andrew Hurley, the reader is introduced to popular ballads and norte&ntilde;o music from the past thirty years: Los Tigres del Norte, Los Invasores de Nuevo Le&oacute;n, Los Broncos, Los Huricanes, El As de la Sierra and more. The lyrics of the corridos provide a musical counterpoint to the violence and terror of high speed chases, narrow escapes, double-crosses, shot-outs, mutilations and killings.It is a dark and ugly world, and through it all Teresa not only survives but manages to grow from a terrified little mexicana fleeing Sinaloa for her life, into a tough sophisticated European entrepreneur prospering in a dangerous business, not only controlled by men but by dangerous machos. She is a character with whom the reader cannot help but identify, despite the nature of her business, and the violence and betrayal to which she becomes accustomed, and ultimately an active participant in. She is the epitome of contemporary crime figures in the new millennium, the dark heroine: la heroina morena."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"If you read a page, you won't be able to stop.I have never seen any novelist pull off the three person narrative, so effectively.Brilliant work."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"The book is very interesting and very well written, but I do not like the subject matter-drugs, torture, rape, prostitution, murder, etc. I read it for book club, but had a hard time with all the violence, especially when you know it's true to life, and especially the mistreatment of women.

Once finished,though I was sad. The book is haunting with excellent descriptions of the heroine's history,motivation and culture. The parallel story lines-one from the protagonist,another from a reporter investigating her history are very complimentary. Finally, the rich description of Mexican and Spanish cultures,as pertaining to narco-trafficking was fascinating."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"If you want to read something really believable read \\" El Narco \\" by British authorIoan Grillo. It reads like a novel while it is a real investigative report."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"Perez-Reverte is a master novelist, but this is not among my favorites. I found the shifting points of view too jerky and hindered my comprehension of the complex story of the poor girl rising to become \\"The Queen of the South.\\" The tale takes us to all the exotic locales one comes to love in a Perez-Reverte novel, and introduces us to his usual cast of equally colorful and unique characters. Like a good thriller on the screen, Perez-Reverte's gets tremendous mileage out of his secondary and supporting characters. Some will love this tale of the men and women in the world of narco-trafficantes, but \\"The Queen\\" was just not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I have previously read \\"The Flanders Panel\\", \\"The Seville Communion\\", and \\"The Club Dumas\\" by Perez-Reverte. If you've read the three of them, and you haven't read this, you are in for a surprise.As I began this book, I was wondering what, precisely, it was supposed to be. It is very different from the three books mentioned above, and I very much enjoyed them. I was hoping for another book in that vein.I didn't get one. What I got instead was a novel about drug trafficking in Mexico and in the Mediterranean. Well researched and interesting, the book never failed to have important details and to leave out the unimportant ones. The plot was good, and traveled the course that it should. The characters seemed like real people (which made sense when I got to the end and found out that it was based on a true story and about true people).But, I am left with questions. What happened to Theresa Mendoza? What happened to Don Epifanio? Etc. Were the Cesar Guemes mentioned in the book and that the book was dedicated to the same person, really? And why does Arturo Perez-Reverte, who seems so literate and complex, enjoy corridos, which are so often given over to the celebration of violence and illegal behavior?There were parts of the book that disappointed me, and a short dictionary of Mexican slang at the back would have been helpful (or more lengthy translations).Overall, though, it was very well written and an enjoyable read. I thought that the characters were complex and real. And they were both. I thought that the plot was good, and it was real, too. And I think that the writing was done well. The questions left in my mind were what really detracted from the book.Recommended for those who want something a little different from their average reads.B-Harkius"},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"From Mexican towns ruled by drug Lords to the southern coast of Spain, Perez Reverte takes us on a wild ride.

I particularly enjoyed, Reverte's description of the Spanish coast near Gibraltar. Great characters, great story and a dramatic ending."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"With Reverte, you feel lke you're living it. An exciting, though a bit raw (an I don't know if I can recommend it to my mother kind of raw), whirlwind through a dangerous life filled with action and longing.

Grab ANY of his books. But be forwarned: this breaks his usual mold of historicana-style plots. Before he became a novelist, Perez Reverte was one of Spain's greatest political and war corespondents, and in this book he really shows his stuff. He did his very dangerous research to find the facts for this book -- but clearly, had he written nonfiction, the author would have been assasinated. In novel form that is gripping he tells the tale of how the cocaine and illegal drug trades changed, with Mexican and Columbian gangs now dominating world trade. And thru the character of a young Mexican woman (who should be played by Salma Hayack if there is a movie made of this -- WHY ISN'T SOMEBODY MAKING THE FILM?)we see how the Latin Anmericans took over the European drug trade, muscled out the Marseilles gangs, and use the dubious legal status of Gibralter as a cover for their operations. If you want to both learn how the global narcotics market really works, AND have a whopping great read, this is for you."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I'm surprised more people haven't reviewed this book by now. This is a \\"straight forward\\" story. But what a story! I can't that I really liked the \\"Queen\\" but she is a fascinating character with an amazing story. The end of the story was a little disappointing but the rest of the story (and other characters) is well worth your time. I'll read this again."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"This was a great adventure story, one which gave me escape for several hours. However, as I read the review from the Washington Post, I was reminded of something that had bothered me while I read the book. It was the journalist's point of view which had knowledge of the heroine's most intimate moments and even her thoughts! Since Arturo Perez-Reverte is a Spanish author, I thought that perhaps this was deemed acceptable in some European novels, but surely there is at least this degree of sophistication in Spain, eh? It surely seems that an American editor would have made certain that this was corrected before publication.Having said all that, I DO reccommend the book. The first scene is gripping, the escape harrowing, and the adventure never gets tired. If you can accept the suspension of disbelief, as Gardner called it, you will enjoy the exciting narrative and the characters. Especially the heroine. She is unlike any other female protagonist, and deeply absorbing."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"There was abundant action, and characters who developed and changed as the story progressed; indeed, this was one of the themes of the book. I found this book to be excellent from cover to cover, though I had hesitated to begin it due to some poor reviews.

It is not, so don't let that stop you."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"This story is told in two styles; from an omniscient perspective following the main character, and from the first-person point of view of a journalist researching her story. At first I was quite bored by the latter story. Later on, however, I began to feel like Perez-Reverte was trying to coax me into a state of mind whereby I would begin to use Teresa Mendoza's story as a truer reality. Throughout the book Teresa discovers that through books she can live more fully, and understand her life more by applying stories as filters to her own life. I began to feel that Perez-Reverte was trying to create a mindset so that I would apply Teresa's story as a filter to my own life in order to gain greater understanding from it. Maybe this is too deep, but that's what I've been getting from it. I'll go into greater depth later, but suffice it say I found a lot of truth about humanity in this story. I very much enjoyed it, and will read more by this author."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"The drug trade throughout Mexico, Latin America, and the Mediterranean come alive in this Arturo Perez-Reverte novel, quite different from his intellectual mysteries. Here he writes the \\"biography\\" of Teresa Mendoza, a young woman from Sinaloa, Mexico, who becomes the mastermind of a multimillion dollar drug empire operating from Marbella, Spain. This novel's challenge lies not in an intellectual puzzle, but in understanding the business networks Teresa builds with drug lords from Russia, Italy, Morocco, and Colombia, along with various agents of government whom she buys off. As she becomes a successful businesswoman, known as \\"The Queen of the South,\\" the suspense develops: Will she stay alive? And how?The story begins in Mexico when Teresa is twenty-three. Uneducated but attractive, she is in love with Guero Davila, a Chicano pilot involved in shipping coca. When she suddenly receives a phone call telling her to run for her life, she does so, escaping through Mexico City into Spain, and then Morocco. Putting her knowledge of drug transportation to work by involving herself in hash-running between Morocco and Spain, she ends up with a short jail sentence but an important friendship with another inmate, Patty O'Farrell, the rebellious daughter of a wealthy Spanish family. When they are released, they set up a big-time drug trafficking business, with Teresa running the show and becoming, eventually, the person with whom everyone in the business must deal.Teresa's story is not told in linear fashion. An unnamed speaker/narrator, presumably Perez-Reverte himself, has come to Sinaloa to investigate and describe Teresa Mendoza's life and business. Interviewing everyone with any information, he inserts himself and his interviews into the narrative. Soon the line begins to blur between fiction and fact, since some of the people he interviews, such as the three people to whom he dedicates the novel, are, in fact, real people who are included as characters in the novel. These add depth and a fine sense of realism to the novel.Although Teresa Mendoza is not a character with whom the reader will identify, the author develops a certain amount of sympathy for her. Teresa is an entrepreneur of great intelligence, and this, combined with her ability to avoid creating any sort of trail that will implicate her legally, keeps her going in her dog-eat-dog world. The novel is episodic but fast paced, despite the sometimes unwelcome intrusions of the narrator/speaker, and Perez-Reverte succeeds in presenting a broad, intriguing picture of the business of drug smuggling and those who make it their careers. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"From her life as a waitress to her downfall as a drug czarina, this book reveals scenes from the life of Teresa Mendoza, the Queen of the South. I had a professor who said that great novels had great beginnings, great endings and great titles. Queen of the South has two out of three, a great beginning and ending. In between it is always interesting, frequently fascinating.This is presented as a romans a clef but given Perez-Reverte's literary gamesmanship I'm not sure what we're supposed to believe that, but believe it or not, you'll enjoy the hell out of this deliciously written book."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"The reportage style of \\"Queen of the South\\" fits Arturo Perez Reverte like a glove. Creating female characters has never been his strong point, and using an observer's eye to tell most of Teresa Mendoza's story works very well. Where you usually hear that good non-fiction \\"reads like a novel\\" here we have a fiction that reads like an investigative report in a quality magazine-one of those addictive pieces you think would make a great book.And it has. The Spanish novelist's latest is the story of Teresa Mendoza, who rose from being a drug smuggler's sweetie in Mexico's narco-capital of Culiacan, Sinaloa, to running one of the largest and most successful drug enterprises on the Mediterranean. There's no play for sympathy for Teresa, no descriptions of her childhood (except for Teresa's brief recall of her mother \\"washing dirty dishes in a tub in the backyard and sleeping with drunken neighbors\\"). Teresa does not ask for sympathy or expect it. She is never innocent. In Culiacan there is no mercy, no consideration. The place has evolved into a Colombian-style society of sociopaths, and she has learned to take what's offered and keep her eyes peeled. The inevitable happens at the start of \\"Queen of the South\\" and Teresa is on the run from page one.There are no heroes in this book; it is an unflinching portrait of an ugly world. The paranoia, manipulation, and joylessness of the drug enterprise is fascinating, with only one character in it for the thrill. Threaded through with the lyrics of Mexican narco-corridos, \\"Queen of the South\\" peels back the skin of modern drug cartels. This is an exciting, creepy read."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"This is the first of Perez-Reverte's books that I have struggled to finish. The ham-handed interviewer slows the story down to a crawl every time he enters. And the story itself has none of the fascinating complications and turns that make the author's other novels (Club Dumas, Flanders Panel) so fascinating. No queen, just a lady in waiting. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"Mexican drug-running pilot Guero Davila warned his girlfriend that if the cell phone he gave her ever rings, she must flee because he is dead and she is next. When the call came, the voice calmly told her that \\"They wasted Guero\\", killed his cousin, and she was high on the clean up list. Listening to the voice of Guero in her head, the panicked Teresa Mendoza runs for her life.Teresa knows that they will find her eventually so she must change from the innocent upbeat girl who a coke delivery pilot rescued from poverty to a major player. She chooses Spain to start out, but she is raped and incarcerated for her efforts. However, over the next dozen years, Teresa learns and begins to rise through the ranks until she becomes Narco's QUEEN OF THE SOUTH with a confrontation awaiting her with the Don of Mexican druglords.Though the men in Teresa's life are evanescent and never fully developed yet somehow seem fascinating (what if), readers receive an insightful look at drug trafficking through the exploits of the terrific protagonist. The story line actually plays out along two plots with the main theme being the rise to power of Teresa; the other subplot focuses on a reporter doing research into Teresa's life by interviewing felons and law enforcement officials who have known her. Thus, the audience obtains a second and at times a third perspective on events that shaped this intriguing anti-heroine. This strong novel falls a bit flat due to the weak support cast, but Arturo P&eacute;rez-Reverte still provides an intriguing thriller."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"Perez-Reverte was a reporter and a good one, and we know he's a superb novelist. In this book describing the international drug trade however he's both. He writes as a reporter interviewing people - some real, some fictitious, some a bit of both - and as a novelist about the career of Teresa Mendoza Chavez who rose in a few short years from obscurity in Culiacan on the eastern shore of the Gulf of California to Queen of the South, the undisputed and deadly efficient head and sole owner of the organization which, based on the Costa Del Sol, controlled for several years the transportation of all illegal drugs (except heroin) in the eastern Mediterranean.It's not a pretty book. Nor is Teresa a pretty character, no matter how youthful, no matter how beautiful. At the age of 22 when her lover, the dashing, devil-may-care King of the Short Runway is assassinated by other drug people while he's landing a cargo of cocaine on a short runway, she grieves a moment and flees, sure she's next to be targeted. And she's right. She escapes to Spanish North Africa, however, and from there over the next 12 years establishes her network, a network over which she has absolute life or death control. Particularly death - because once you're in the business violent death seems to be the usual way out of it; and she has no qualms about making those arrangements for those who betray her or who might betray her. That includes her handsome, patrician Spanish lawyer who is the father of the unborn child she is carrying in her womb as the book ends.Nor is the books is particularly well written or well organized. I think Perez-Reverte decided to do a serious number on the drug trade and got caught up in reporting on it vs. writing a novel on it. It needs editing. Perez-Reverte gets carried away by the sight of his own words. And I wish - Oh, how I wish! - that Spanish obscenities and Spanish slang would either be translated or omitted. It's aggravating for those of us who rely on a translator to be faced with unknowable Spanish phrases on every page and in every conversation.I was particularly disappointed in the way Perez-Reverte handled the character of Teresa. After the death of her dashing aviator she seems to have annealed over her feelings with some kind of mental metal which not only prevented these human emotions - these feelings which we all have - from leaking out and which also prevented us from seeing them. She was a zombie with respect to love. She was a character needing redemption in the worst way, one who needed to regret, to come alive, to deal with a future - something she was certainly able to do. But Perez-Reverte denied all this to her, denied her redemption and left us at the end of the book watching her walk out the door of a government safe house in Culiacan midst gunfire and violence, walk out rich, famous completely alone and pregnant and walk out into her future, whatever it might be, leaving us to guess about it.In short every story like this needs resolution, needs an ending, needs an emotional catharsis so we can put the book down and say either it was a good book or it didn't do the job and know why we say it. But I couldn't do this with this one. I was disappointed, left in the air at the end, wanting to know what happens or happened next. Here it was that the novelist failed; here it was that the reporter simply wrote finis."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"This was a very entertaining book (B+).This story chronicles the rise of Teresa Mendoza from the girl friend (in Mexico) of a low level drug transporter to a woman who is the head of one of the largest transporters of narcotics in Europe. Along the way Teresa has love affaires , disposes of traitors and enemies,and reinvents herself. She was not someone I admired but she was never dull. I enjoyed reading about southern Spain,Gibralta, and Spanish Morocco. I would like to read other books by the author."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I've been your adoring fan all through your other classy, elegant books, which are among my favorite fiction---especially \\"The Seville Communion.\\" But \\"Queen of the South\\" is too much a departure, for me, from your usual stylish novels. I'm surprised at the rave reviews of many readers. I and my more discriminating reading friends don't understand why you wasted your talents on writing a book that borders on pulp trash about a sleazy woman in the sleazy drug world. There are already too many authors churning out pulp, disposable fiction. Did you just want to do something different? Okay, you've done that now, so please return to the Perez-Reverte that I knew and loved...and I'll return to adoring you."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"This is the most riveting and my favorite of all novels written by Arturo Perez-Reverte. Deftly plotted and quick-paced, it features a protagonist who is feisty, obnoxious, and very real. The settings are all fascinating and beautifully detailed. In short, this is a novel that I will definitely read again!"},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"The author was recommended to me by a friend whose opinion I respect. Perhaps Perez-Reverte's other books are better, but this one was very dull and the characters were lifeless. I can see that the author has a good writing style, but here his technique was wasted on characters and circumstances that I simply couldn't care about. I rarely give up on a book, but after plodding through the first 100 pages I decided I'd read enough. The was no snap, no sparkle, no mystery, no suspense, no fun. Even the death of a character was essentially \\"ho-hum, the (Spanish expletive) was dead.\\" Yawn."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I agree with your previous reviewer that in terms of quality of writing 'Queen of the South' deserves 5 stars. I disagree with the moral stance though - I don't think the drug trade is glamourised at all, but portrayed as a hell on earth where sudden death is an occupational hazard. The participants at the cutting edge of the trade are far less culpable and hypocritical than the mass of politicians, judges and customs officials who hang on to their coat tails. I found Teresa Mendoza a fascinating, almost likeable character whose actions were prompted purely by survival instinct - kill or be killed. That was the only world she knew. A wonderful book which kept me up all night, unable to put it down. Recommended."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"The author of this novel presents us with a beautiful, intelligent heroine who loves reading literature. Well she might drink a tad too much sometimes, but, hey, she is my kind of gal. Author Perez-Reverte's talent lies in getting you to root for a woman who is hugely into the drug transportation business, and by that I don't mean driving trucks full of Bayer aspirin. She moves vast amounts of illicit merchandise, by boat, around the Mediterranean coast. Slipping abroad to northern Africa after her drug transporting boy friend is murdered in Mexico by the Mexican drug lords, she works her way up into the business by her exceptional wits and physical capabilities.Teresa Mendoza becomes a corporate executive model, buying off politicians, and the police while making friends with a Russian drug leader in the area. Soon she is eliminating people she considers offensive by sending them to the local cemetery. And all this time we are saying \\"go, Teresa, go!!\\" What is the matter with us readers? She is a very nasty person. Well I tell you, I finally saw the light when one day she was down on the seashore, and tossed an empty liquor bottle into the surf. Who would do such a thing? Certainly no-one I would emulate.There is one annoying flaw to this otherwise interesting tale. Some never identified reporter is going around getting background information on Teresa, and brief sections of his endeavors keep being inserted into the story. Why? The book could have been written without his tedious interruptions. He is not only nameless, but is totally undeveloped as a character. We learn nothing about him.It's a fun story if you don't mind identifying with drug runners and murderers. And does she live happily ever after? Read and see."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I was very pleased with shipping and how informative Amazon was with me as to when my purchase would arrive. The book is AMAZING! I am now a definite fan of Arturo Perez- Reverte!"},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I've read all the English-version books written by Perez-Reverte. I seem to be addicted to the plots and sense of realism, despite frequently being very annoyed with his pedantic descriptions of details. For me the realism is in the plot and the dark twists and endings, not in endless detail that seems almost self-congratulatory (sort of \\"see how much I learned about this particular arcane subject\\"). I sympathize with the people who found Queen of the South frustrating to read, and, yes, I occasionally found the narrator's unrealistic accounts to be a distraction (that kind of narration was done much better in the Alexandria Quartet). I listened to the audio version of Queen of the South over the course of several long car trips - I was close to mesmerized by it, and felt it to be one his best books ever, but I think significant credit goes to the audio format and to the narrator."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I enjoyed this audiobook. My only complaint about the book is that some of the descriptions about the drug deals and boats on the water is long and so descriptive, that it's hard to follow. The book is also very long and at times moves a bit slow. But still overall I enjoyed it and recommend it."},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I'm a huge fan of Perez-Reverte generally, but - like a couple of previous reviewers - am very disappointed with this one so far. I was warned that it's very slow to get going and I'm only on Pg 100 but I think I'm going to have to put this down for a while and try again later. Somehow it manages to be both sleazy and deadly dull. And why do all the characters and many of the bars and restaurants need so many different names and nicknames? It may be authentic, but it doesn't move the narrative forward and sure makes for tedious reading. The characters, including the heroine Theresa, seem flat, unreal and unattractive. Perez-Reverte has failed to breathe life into any of them. He does paint a vivid picture of the world of drug trafficking but that isn't enough to sustain this peculiarly lifeless story. If I change my mind when I come back and finish the book, I'll amend my review!"},{"Title":"Queen of the South","review":"I've read all his previously translated novels, and felt they all had something in commmon...a sense, or aura, of mystery. Who are these people, what is really going on? At the heart of each of his previous novels were questions you could not wait to have answered.This novel read as a straightforward story. There was no mystery, you always knew exactly what was going on. To me, this was a disapointment. The story itself was fine, and as all his books are, very well written. There was just nothing special about it.I gave it three stars because it was beautifully written, but for Perez-Reverte, 3 stars is a major disappointment. If you read this, do not expect a typical story by him, expect something much more mainstream, something any of hundreds of authors could write."},{"Title":"Make-up Techniques for Photography","review":"I have over 40 books on make up and this is surely the worst one I have bought.The title is completely misleading and there is very little of substance.Basic make up techniques with reference to various lighting techniques as well as color light relationship is not mentioned.Fundamental things like colour theory which is so essential to make up and photography is not mentioned in the book.This book is just one of the many mediocre titles available on make up.I would not recommend this book to anyone but if you wish to waste [price] feel free to order the title."},{"Title":"Make-up Techniques for Photography","review":"This is, at best, a poorly done book. As a professional photographer, I thought it would be helpful for me to know a little more about makeup. This book has the basics, but the example photos don't look particularly impressive and the writing seems carelessly or hastily written.There don't seem to be a lot of books on makeup for photographers, but I didn't think this book was worth the price."},{"Title":"Make-up Techniques for Photography","review":"I recently checked this book out at the library. Thank God I did before I bought it. It should instead be titled, \\"Makeup application for little girls that think lipstick all over the face is a good look.\\" It would have been more accurate.If I was the author of this book, I would be ashamed of some of the images. He obviously didn't look closely at the photos that were supposed to be representative of what he was writing about. The eyeliner is jagged and not close to the eye. The foundation is oily and dirty looking. The child's clown makeup looks like she probably put it on herself.This book is a waste."},{"Title":"Make-up Techniques for Photography","review":"As a professional portrait photographer, I thought it would be helpful to have a better understanding of the differences in applying make-up for a normal social setting, and a photography shoot. What a disappointment this book was! In addition to being poorly written and redundant from page to page, it didn't offer any information that any female over the age of 12 doesn't already know. I think we all know that we should wash our faces every day. And the make-up depicted in the photographs was very poorly done--my 14 year-old daughter does a better job of applying eyliner than their so-called expert. Even the photography itself was not impressive. And most of the make-up styles shown were very dated. All in all, it was a complete waste of my money, and of the 30 minutes of my time it took to read it."},{"Title":"Make-up Techniques for Photography","review":"This book was empty as far as knowlege and techniques for a makeup artist.

Funny to realise that Darwin himself did not like Southwest Australia when he had a stop over there with his Beagle voyage. He detested Albany, I love it. Southwest Australia has been recognised as one of the top biodiversity hotspots worldwide. Read and enjoy the book and share the author's enthousiasm and expert knowledge.As I have been botanizing in many places where the author has been, I enjoyed the descriptions of his discoveries during his fieldtrips. It also revived my holidays. I share his thrills and was also intrigued by the Hammer Orchid and its pollination. The books gives excellent explanations.

What will we do? How will we handle the situation and life itself?Robert Molsberry is the senior pastor of the United Church of Christ-Congregational in Grinnell, Iowa. In Blindsided by Grace he tells his story of learning to live with a life altering physical challenge: paraplegia.In 1997, Molsberry almost died following a hit and run accident where he was permanently left without the use of his legs. Molsberry, a pastor, husband, father and athlete had been bicycling on May 31 when he was hit by a truck from behind. Witnesses described the driver swerving as though hitting Molsberry was intentional.Molsberry confronts and explores his disability from his perspective as the disabled person and as someone who responds to the people and situations he encounters around him. And he does this with insight and humor.Blindsided by Grace is one man's thoughtful journey who's determined to live the life God gave him with as much grace as he can muster. His honesty is compelling. I found the poignancy overwhelming of his admission of what he would give up to be able to make love to his wife one more time. I laughed when he described a picture of him in the hospital. He was wearing a Groucho Marx glasses and nose and declared his family must have been bored.As the mother of a child who has lived with blindness, I greatly appreciated Molsberry's account of his life before and following his accident. I so wish, as someone who has 'old eyes', that the print had been larger.

No ser feliz en Cuba o en cualquier otro pa&iacute;s de latinoamerica, es algo que la gente comprende, pero no ser feliz en los Estados Unidos, es considerado un acto fuera de toda l&oacute;gica.

It is certainly an interesting account of the life of a dermatologist and some interesting case studies. However, if you are looking for a book on the effects of sunlight on human health I would urge you to look elsewhere. The authors exclusive focus on pathology gives them a kind of tunnel vision which misses the larger health picture and their resulting advice (in a nutshell, wear SPF 30 sunscreen and stay out of the sun) may be harmful. While they give a passing nod to the health benefits of sunlight (allows the skin to synthesize Vit D), they seem to have not read the literature on the effects of sunlight in lowering blood pressure, lowering blood sugar, decreasing cholesterol, building lean tissue, increasing the production of sex hormones, and actually increasing the resistance to infection and cancer. None of these benefits are available to the person slathered in SPF 30 sunscreen. I would urge you to read Zane Kime, MD's book &quot;Sunlight Could Save Your Life&quot; or Dr. Downing's book &quot;Daylight Robbery&quot; before you decide to follow the advice in this book. Of course, caution IS well advised. The two books just mentioned help the reader to determine how to get the benefits without undue risks. Unlike the Balin's, Dr. Dowling says that sunlight actually stimulates production of antibodies and strenghtens the body's defenses which actually help suppress the growth of melanoma. The Balin's seem to totally ignore a several thousand year history of sunlight therapy in medicine and the fact that many human cultures haved lived under intense sunlight all their lives without the constant care of dematologists and SPF 30 sunscreens and without dying of melanomas. The Balin's should pay more attention to the abnormal conditions of modern life (indoor living, ozone depletion, high use of polyunsaturated fats &amp; refined foods) which seem more to blame than sunlight for the current epidemic of melanomas. Sunlight can be a blessing to our health if we use it wisely but you would never know it from reading this book."},{"Title":"Saladin and the Saracens (Men-at-Arms)","review":"Part of the Osprey's series covering various troops and soldiers from important historical periods, this book takes a (very) brief look at the armies in the Middle East during the time of the Crusades. Over all, its a short, somewhat general read. The emphasis is, of course, on Middle Eastern soldiers, so much of it is devoted to Saladin and the Arab and Kurdish armies, but there is also some stuff on the tribal Turks and the Armenians and Cilicians, which I found interesting. Information is given on all the troops, how they fought, what sort of arms and armor they used, where they came from and so forth. Some things were skipped over, or left out entirely, but considering the limited scope of this book, that can be forgivven. Personally, I was amazed by how much they did manage to fit in at any rate! Of particular interest are the wonderful color plates, which go into magnificent details on specific troops and their equipment.Its a pretty decent book. Not too detailed, perhaps, but it has some excellent visuals and can easily put the Crusades into context and sum things up. If this time period interests you, then by all means look into this book."},{"Title":"Saladin and the Saracens (Men-at-Arms)","review":"A very detailed source on the Islamic armies of the Second and Third Crusades, focusing on the Ayyubids of Salah al-Din but also examining the Fatimids, the Seljuks, and other Turkish factions. Helps dispel some myths and stereotypes about medieval Eastern warfare and shows how, in many respects it was connected to that of Europe."},{"Title":"Saladin and the Saracens (Men-at-Arms)","review":"This is another relatively good title from the pair David Nicolle-Angus McBride. At the outset however, potential buyers should be made aware that the book's title - \\"Saladin and the Saracens\\" is not really accurate. This men-at-arms book is the rough equivalent of the series for Christian armies between 1000 and 1300 (French, Italian, German...), so it starts in the mid-eleventh century, with the Seljuk Turks and Turkomans arriving in what is now Iran, Irak and the Caucasus, and stops in 1291 with the fall of Acre.Having mentioned this, the contents are rather good, if you can bear the author's bias to which I will come back shortly, and McBride's plates are rather gorgeous, as per usual. Armies covered are those of the Seljuk Sultanate and its successor states in Syria and the Djezirah (the \\"atabegs\\", meaning the regents, if I am correct), including those of Zengi atabeg of Mossoul and his son Nur al Din (initially Saladin's lord), the Fatimids in Egypt until 1169, the armies of Saladin and of his Ayubid successors from 1169 to 1250, followed by the Mamluks and then the armies in Iran, the Causasus and Anatolia in the 13th century. There is even a little piece on the Assassins and on the Caliph and their respective forces, just for the sake of being comprehensive. Then we have the illustrations. Some of the photos may be of limited interest, largely because they are in black and white and are therefore not always clear. The schematics of a castle, the citadel of Damascus and the Red Tower of Alanya are, on the contrary, quite fascinating and I would have wanted more of them, and more of the drawings of arms and helmets.Finally, we have the book's main text and this is where the bias appears. David Nicolle quite clearly has a \\"soft spot\\" for Saladin who was certainly a very remarkable and quite outstanding character, although I would have stop short from qualifying him as being perceived as \\"the chief hero of these events\\" (the Third Crusade), \\"even in Europe\\". There was a healthy respect among Christians for Saladin, both in Outremer and in Europe, but to suggest hero worshiping might be going a bit far. When explaining the success of the First Crusade - against all odds - Nicolle quite rightly mentions that there timing could not have been better for it took place as the Seljuk Sultanate was raked by civil war after the death of Malik Shah in 1092. However, he sometimes gives the disagreeable impression of belittling the military achievements of the First Crusaders. There is, for instance, nothing indicating a fall in training standards of Turkish horse archers, contrary to the author's statement who uses such an assertion to \\"explain\\" that this \\"seems the most obvious reason for their failure against the First Crusade.\\" This tends to omit the mixture of luck and superb generalship and leadership displayed by the Crusaders in general, and Bohemond in particular. It also underestimates the impact that a charge of knights could have on a troop of horse archers unused to such aggressiveness (it would be enough to spoil anyone's aim, I would guess!) or even more simply caught on the back foot, as at Doryleum, or by surprise, as happened at least once to one of the Muslim relief armies (the one for Alep) during the siege of Antioch. Another \\"missing\\" element about Saladin the \\"hero\\" is any mention of the fact that he essentially rebelled against his lord, Nur al Din and set out for himself by becoming the independent ruler of Egypt which was by far the richest of all of the Muslim states at the time. In fact, Nur al Din seems to have been preparing an expedition to bring his rebellious vassal to heel (and probably execute him in the process) when he died in 1174. So, in a way, Saladin was NOT the paragon of virtue he is presented to be and was quite lucky that his lord died in such a timely manner, allowing him to take over one by one his other lands and cities over the next nine years.Despite these little grips, this book certainly achieves its objective: it does make you (or at least, it did make me) \\"want for more\\". So, four stars for me, although I did hesitate a bit between three and four stars..."},{"Title":"Saladin and the Saracens (Men-at-Arms)","review":"Wie bei einigen Osprey-Heften, so fehlt auch hier der Platz f&uuml;r ein so spannendes und umfangreiches Thema.

It concentrates primarily on the Fatimid and Ayyubids and Abbasid dynasties of the moslem middle east. A thumbnail sketch of the Mamelukes is also thrown in for good measure.As with most Osprey titles it is only meant to be used as a starting point, a general overview from which more serious study can then be undertaken.The prints are certainly of high quality, much, much better than some of Osprey's other crusader era titles.Again, as a jumping off point this book is a decent enough effort."},{"Title":"Saladin and the Saracens (Men-at-Arms)","review":"The Saracens were not the whole picture of Shalahuddin's army.

Perhaps not quite as over-saturated and \\"wet\\" as in that other review, but still blurry. Perhaps the result of too much enlargement?This cheap paperback comes with cheap thin covers and cheap stapled binding. Still, it cost a buck. (We may have bought it from Target's Dollar Spot.)

And even those encyclopedic ones don't cover some of the engines he has in here.I can't recommend it enough -- if you're interested in the history of jet power, just buy it, you won't be disappointed.Now, I wonder if I can convince him to publish a follow-up volume on British engines?"},{"Title":"German Jet Engine and Gas Turbine Development, 1930-45","review":"\\"German Jet Engine and Gas Turbine Development 1930-1945\\" by Antony L. Kay offers a highly detailed and comprehensive account of the development of jet engines in Germany before and during the Second World War. The book starts with a forward and introduction before moving on to chapters including gas turbines (jets) for air, land, and sea applications, jets for industry, jet helicopters, pulsejets, and ramjets. For example in the area of gas turbines for aviation, it includes sections on the Junkers Jumo 004 that made it to operational status powering the infamous Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, besides other engines that were just shy of operational deployment such as the BMW 003, Heinkel-Hirth HS 011, and Daimler-Benz 109-007. It also features a chronology of German jet and gas turbine development, and concludes with a bibliography and an appendix of preserved engines. The research is excellent, and includes lots of photographs, drawings, cutaways and other illustrations. Overall this work is unmatched, and is required reading for aviation enthusiasts who are interested in learning more about Germany's cutting edge technological developments at the close of the Second World War."},{"Title":"The Fortunes of Astrology: A New Complete Treatment of the Arabic Parts","review":"From book's back cover:\\" It was the Arabic astrologer, Al-Biruni who in 1029 AD gave the most exhaustive existing list of the Fortunes, often also known as the \\"Arabic Parts.\\" He collected them from all over the world, from past civilizations and even from some mysterious people referred to as \\"the Ancients.\\" Al-Biruni is to be considered the foremost authority on this subject.

This is just my opinion of course where it certainly is a introduction book by not delving too specific into any one subject and instead covers a breadth of issues. Since I am new to this field, I found the further readings section at the end of the chapter helpful where I recently purchased a book on political theory because of it.

Not only students but also attentive and educated citizens have turned away from politics.\\"Here's another, a paragraph down.......\\"Perhaps terrorism and recession are needed to renew interest in politics.\\" This guy is an ass!!Do no waste your money on this rubbish.

As far as content and layout, the book is not great, and is downright confusing at times. The author mixes in gross generalizations and his own opinion into fact and tries to pass it off as such. He makes sarcastic comments such as posted by another reviewer about needing terrorist attacks and such to ignite interest in politics. I mean honestly, who really says things like that? And we should be learning from this guy? No thank you.The only \\"good\\" parts of this book are the tips on writing papers which are actually helpful. Ironic that the best parts of the book are not actually about politics at all."},{"Title":"Political Science: An Introduction","review":"Let me start by admitting I have the Seventh Edition (2000), not the 2002 version. However, I doubt that there could be much improvement. This \\"textbook\\" can only be the product of gross incompetence or extreme bias, I will let you decide which.For example, page 340 reads \\"It is true that some regimes commit acts of great evil; military regimes in Argentina, Chile, and Guatemala killed thousands on the slightest suspicion of leftism. But how is it that these military regimes came to power? Why does system breakdown recur repeatedly in such contries?\\"So, does the author not know that we, the US, overthrew the democratically elected Arbenz in Guatemalla, and Allende in Chile? Everyone else knows this...and does the author not know that Chile, prior to this installation of Pinochet, was the one stable democracy in Latin America? So how then is Chile a case of this \\"recur(ing) repeatedly? (sic)\\" It happened once. Does the fact that two of his three examples of internal \\"system breakdown\\" leading to regime change actualy represent partially, or largely, the external actions of a superpower interfering in the internal affairs of weaker soveriegn countries not seem to be problematic? How can these be used as examples of internal processes when everyone knows what really happened, and that is not it? The author, in order to assert this, must be grossly ignorant of history (thereby disqualifying him as a viable authority in the field) or, knowing history, must be intentionally and knowingly distorting it for political reasons (thereby making him unquestionably biased, intellectually dishonest, and also therefore unsuited for the field).On top of that we have the unfortunately normal systemic incompetence of the Political Science field in general. \\"Theory\\" and \\"causation\\" are words which they have no grasp of the meaning of in academic discourse. Methodology is a joke; a pile of correlations mushed together with assertions and assumptions (some already disproven for a few decades elsewhere) to create just-so stories does not make a legitimate theory or even hypothesis. We know too much about human nature, via studies done in Psychology, Neurobiology, and Evolutionary Psychology, and empirical information from anthropology, primatology, and ethology, and theoretical and empirical knowledge supplied by evolutionary biology, to just \\"assume\\" that humans are rational and go merrily on our way as Political Science is still doing. There is a huge body of knowledge on this question now, entire books debate it back and forth. It is in no way legitimate to simply plead ignorance and continue to build huge mental constructs of how the world works based on assumptions we in no way can justify making given what is known.If this field were in any way deserving of the word \\"science,\\" the knowledge that a fundamental \\"assumption\\" was seriously in doubt would result in massive questioning of the veracity of the ideas based on that assumption. That has not happened.I urge you all not to waste your money on this book, I could give many more equally damning examples but the above should suffice. I also suggest that Evolutionary Psychology would be a far more profitable course of study if you want to know about human political behavior."},{"Title":"Political Science: An Introduction","review":"I took a political science class and when I got my initial syllabus this was the book I needed, however once school started I realized I got the wrong edition.

Then again, it's difficult to understand what the author's point was in writing the book, as most of it plays out as a disjointed and frustrating text by someone who is struggling with repressed ideological alignments.When the book starts it discusses the percolating up and down models, where either society is a reflection of the state or vice versa. While our good author mentions this, he never really explains what position the book takes, so when I did an online quiz for the chapter it puzzled me considerably. Then it drowns on about different social theories in a very eloquent style that looks good until you realize it doesn't help for study and fails to convey anything meaningful that the author is thinking. One might argue that this was used to eliminate bias, but it undermines firm study points and makes the author look like a man for all seasons without saying anything worthwhile about his beliefs.At the end, the text comes off as a convoluted mesh of partisanship and pseudo science that made me waste time when completing assignments in a class that could have been more enjoyable. I would have much preferred an unabashed socialist(or whichever ideology the author is) text that makes me think based upon that opinion, thus allowing for compelling arguments and workable exam study.Not recommended to students at all.

I gave this two stars rather than one because for a reader new to the period the book at least encapsulates the basic facts and trends.

If you've studied Math, Physics, or Computer Science and are at all fond of any of Huxley's other works, you'll like this. There's a good synopsis on wikipedia. Check it out."},{"Title":"The Genius and the Goddess","review":"Being an Aldous Huxley fan, when I found this at the library I picked it up. It's a recollection of a man who lived in the house of an absent-minded genius with a gorgeous wife and dramatic daughter. The philosophies the man spits out at the beginning are interesting, and the story is worth a read. I wasn't blown away by the book, but it fared fine. It's a quick read, so check it out at the library like I did if you are a Huxley fan, if not, don't go out searching for it."},{"Title":"The Genius and the Goddess","review":"I have never really read much of Huxley's fiction and always had the sense of him as a quiet thin, and light writer. He is generally considered more a 'novelist of ideas' than one capable of creating powerful characters. My expectations were pleasantly upset by this work which is much better than I thought it would be.This book has a frame- story in which two old friends , suitors of the same woman meet again. The woman has since died, and her husband tells of an earlier involvement. This involvement is the main story of the work. The son of a deceased Lutheran Minister and an over- possessive mother John Rivers is invited as a young scientist to be the assistant of the 'genius of the story, Henry Marteens. Marteens is married to Kathy, the goddess of the story, who is described as the most beautiful woman the narrator has ever seen. The senior scientist is a kind of crazy genius who lives in his own inner world and is sustained by the loving care of his wife. They have two children a teenage girl and a younger son. The narrator Rivers becomes a member of the household. The teenage girl falls in love with him but he refuses her advances. The beautiful Kathy 's mother becomes ill and she travels to see and care for her. During the vigil Marteens who cannot live without the help of his wife also becomes critically sick. He has done this before as a way of blackmailing his wife to come back to him. He has wild imaginings when she is away about her sexual infidelities. When he is at the point of death finally, his wife leaves her dying mother to come back to him. He does not immediately respond. In the meantime the virgin very Christian conscienced Rivers is fallen upon by Kathy, who emotionally lonely desperate, and empty needs to have her soul restored though passionate love. Rivers succumbs and it is his sexual awakening on April 23, the day of Shakespeare's birthday. The two conduct briefly a clandestine affair which is sensed by the jealous rejected daughter who all along has resented her mother. The lovers decide that for the good of all they must part. On the day of his departure on the way to the station the mother and daughter in the same car quarrel and while the mother is distracted they are in a fatal accident, which only injures the young brother who later dies a more horrible death in the war at Okinawa. Rivers goes on a short time later to meet Helen, who will his wife and was also loved by the writer he is telling the story to. Marteens will marry in a short time his wife's quite unattractive sister, and after she dies marry yet again. Another carer who will nurse him out of the world when he is in his late eighties.The book in the opening contrasts the writer's ethic of living by the muse of memory, as opposed to the narrator's ethic of being wholly absorbed and living in the 'Now'. One senses this latter view corresponds more to that of Huxley if his late- life parapsychological and drug experiments are indicative.The work is carefully crafted . It has a seeming message of deriding Christian conscience and promoting a pagan ethic of surrending to the immediateness of sensual experience. The goddess of the story is taken to be an embodiment of the pagan spirit of living sensual life to the full.Despite my own personal objection to the what is for me immoral 'moral' of the story I find the work an excellent and intelligent fiction."},{"Title":"Teen girlfriends (Girlfriends Series)","review":"\\"Teen Girlfriends\\" rocks.

This book may stand out from the rest because it actually quotes what others teens themselves have to say on various topics. However, it lacks content and appears to be like many other teen books, addressing similar issues in similar ways. It won't bore you but it definitely won't leave you breathless. If you want a book with the same edge but filled with content try \\"Stories for a Teen's Heart\\" by Alice Gray or even Wade F. Horn's \\"New Teen Book.\\" I can't think of many other books of this nature but the lack of content spoils a lot of the originality of this book."},{"Title":"Teen girlfriends (Girlfriends Series)","review":"from Blue Jean Online (www.bluejeanonline.com)by Truc Doan, 14, Teen EditorThe media loves portraying how difficult and angst-ridden the teenage years are for girls. Very few times, however, do they mention what helps these girls survive: their friends. In Teen Girlfriends, Julia DeVillers puts together a compilation of different situations among friends. The book goes through all topics, from popularity to road trips. The stories are cute, if slightly off the reality slide. Friendship is a unique thing, different in every situation, and the major flaw of the book is that it tries to generalize and explain too much. The purpose of the book is slightly confusing. It is very similar to one long essay, and though it services those needing illumination of the term 'friendship,' it hardly captures the interests of real teenagers who know what true friendship is about.Reading this book made me feel as if I were getting a lecture about how I should feel in certain situations. DeVillers brings up an event that could have happened and justifies it with a quote from a girl the reader most likely does not know. I never felt that I was truly introduced to the girls who contributed to the book. DeVillers often uses the term 'we' to include the reader, which I found disconcerting because it reminded me of a parent clarifying the world for me. The whole book just gave me an awkward feel.The book does have some redeeming qualities, though. It acts similarly to a self-help book in that it tells readers that they are not the only ones to experience a certain situation. Though not a big fan of self-help books myself, I can understand DeVillers' purpose and admire her for it. Very few books pay close attention to teenage girls. This one at least makes an effort.Copyright 2003 Blue Jean Online"},{"Title":"Teen girlfriends (Girlfriends Series)","review":"I thought the Teen Girlfriends Book was great.

It is an in depth illustration of the lives of many adolescent girls and their interactions with their peers. Having a friendship is extremely important to all of us and this book describes many different ways through which you can meet friends and build strong, long-lasting friendships. It is one thing for an author to observe many girls and then just write her thoughts on them, but it is very different for an author to write word for word what the girls had said and their thoughts. It makes the reader feel a lot closer to the characters and their feelings. I hope that teenagers and adults as well all over the country will have a chance to read such a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Teen girlfriends (Girlfriends Series)","review":"&quot;Teen Girlfriends&quot; is so touching in every way.

I wanted to secure it and use it to run a web server and an app server. By trade I am an enterprise Java developer. Prior to reading this book, I had had zero experience securing any kind of server, and nearly zero experience administering Linux boxes at all. I was pretty intimidated by the concepts of computer security in general. Also, you should know that I actually read 90% of this book.Let me say without hesitation that this book has changed my life. I have secured my network, protected my data, detected attempted hacks, and learned a TON. This knowledge has also helped me tremendously in my day job, as an awareness of the overall network security environment is essential to being a good enterprise developer. I give 100% of the credit to Mr. Bauer, whose writing is complete, comprehensible, succinct, and lively. He progresses logically through the material, covering firewall architecture, server hardening, use of ssh for all administration, log watching, web and DNS security, threat detection, and many other topics. His coverage is a judicious mixture of utilitarian and theoretical - he gives you just the right instructions to accomplish your goals, and just enough background to make it interesting and understandable. This approach makes his chapters on bastion hosts, ssh, and tripwire especially definitive. His humor, unlike that of many other technical authors, actually is funny and helpful. When he refers to the complex Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm as a \\"large-prime-number hoe-down,\\" he succeeds in both entertaining and providing an adequate summary for the average network administrator. Bauer's sense of organization and style enables him to take the mystique and complexity out of computer security and empower the reader.I take extreme exception to the negative reviewer who claims that Bauer relies too heavily on graphical tools, which is bad since one should not even have X11 running on a secure server. Obviously this other reviewer never read the book. In his chapter on hardening Linux, Bauer EXPRESSLY SAYS not to install X11 on a secure server. Almost NOWHERE in the book does he use graphical tools. What the other reviewer has written is unfair and untrue. Maybe he read a different book.One minor quibble I have is that the log monitoring software Bauer suggests, \\"swatch,\\" is adequate but has really been superseded by \\"logwatcher,\\" which comes with Red Hat Linux. Logwatcher has built-in smarts, and does not need to rely on downloading modules from CPAN onto your secure server. But consider this: the fact that I can even raise this issue, after previously knowing absolutely nothing about computer security, is further testament to the greatness of this book."},{"Title":"Building Secure Servers with Linux","review":"Several months ago I decided to setup my personal weblog on one of my home based Linux box. I knew, that counting on cheap DSL router \\"firewall\\" capability, to keep real hackers out of the system is simply not enough (and counting on the fact, that hacker wannabes and script kiddies outnumber real hackers in real life, is not reassuring either).Sure, soon after, I opened necessary ports on DSL router for web, mail and ftp service I regularly noticed port scanning probes in router log. I questioned myself if I really built secure Linux box or not? What should I do next time, to strengthen security right from the beginning, and not later, when server is already in use? Where to place Linux server and how to protect my internal network? Of course, I realized that my general knowledge about security (especially on Linux) is insufficient. I'm following Mr. Bauer excellent articles in Linux Journal for some time, appreciating not only the author knowledge in the field of security, but also his writing skills. It was a logical choice for me to begin learning about security on Linux with the help of his book.It's not some kind of \\"super\\" book on the security subject that'll give you answers on all your questions and the same time cover all security aspects.On contrary, it covers the most important security issues concerning the services and tools that you'll probably use or support on average Linux box connected to the net. This book really helped me a lot in that respect, not only with home project but also on my daily job that is only occasionally related with network security.If my case sounds familiar to you then you're definitely the prime candidate for this book."},{"Title":"Building Secure Servers with Linux","review":"Mick's book is the first Linux title since Matt Welsh's first edition of &quot;Running Linux&quot; that I believe is worth reading cover-to-cover. Most security books are either 1) just rehashes of the basics (turn of unused ports, don't let sendmail be an open relay, use ssh, etc) or 2) lengthy descriptions of how to prevent known types of attacks. The latter type is useful, but most of that information can be found (more up-to-date, too) on a number of websites.&quot;Building Secure Servers with Linux&quot; instead take the approach of describing the various tools available to secure Linux-based hosts and networks, what they do, and how best to configure them. He covers both standard Linux packages: sendmail, openssh, syslog and apache, and less-commonly-installed tools like djbdns, nessus, Bastille, and postfix. Explanations are clear, the writing style is easy to read, and, like good technical books do, he points out places where the normal documentation is lacking or unclear, and warns you of pitfalls before you experience them. Many powerful linux security packages are written for hackers by hackers and leave a lot of blanks to fill in.The two things that people might find lacking about this book--I believe are actually advantages. The first is that there are many security tools available that this book does not cover. I'm sure as time progresses someone will post here &quot;This book doesn't cover X.&quot; However, most of the time, Bauer mentions those tools' availability and points you in the direction of places where you can learn how to use them. This is a good compromise, because the alternative is for him to try to cover _every_ tool, including those for which he's had little experience. Instead he sticks to those packages he can confidently recommend and help you configure. Secondly, he does inject a good dose of personal opinion and experience: I'm sure he'll push one or two buttons with his statements. However, I find those opinions valuable, even if you personally disagree, and he backs them all up with good evidence.I hope that the author is able to keep this book up-to-date as the years progress (practical security books have a half-life of about 18 months) and continues to keep us informed with his very excellent column in Linux Journal."},{"Title":"Building Secure Servers with Linux","review":"There are many ways to do things right and many ways to do things wrong.

However, I will mention that the information provided in this book are meant to fulfil the needs of intermediate users. Most advanced users would need this book only as an easy-to-carry reminder.

Now, the articles are great. When expanded into book form, there's more space available for detail. However this book doesn't have the breadth to be a good security book on it's own. Since it only pulls from the articles, it misses many key points that would be necessary for someone to really secure their machine. Many of the topics here are not geared toward securing your machine, or building a secure server at all - they're more &quot;how to do things securely&quot;. Now that is a good thing, but the book title makes it sound like you need only this book to build a secure machine, and that is definately not the case."},{"Title":"Building Secure Servers with Linux","review":"With several years of network and server experience but very little Linux knowledge, this book is the perfect stepping stone to getting some practical experience.

In this case, straight ahead is the assumption that you need only worry about the topics the author decides to cover.Now what Bauer discusses is explained well and very throroughly, as well as any other book on the subject. However there are many pieces of your overall security situation that need to be included in a security book. For example the utter lack of anything about physical security is unforgivable, given how many people will be colocating Linux servers.The book relies on graphical tools too often - if you're building a server, you should *NOT* be installing X11 on it! More command line activities would be better."},{"Title":"Company","review":"&quot;Company&quot; is a haunting tale of one man about whom nothing is known, who spends his final hours alone in a pitch black room. His sanity is questionable at best in this sensory-deprived state, and he tells himself stories and even makes up imaginary friends with whom he converses to pass the time (this is the titular company he seeks). Beautifully written, this piece flows like a prose poem and is as easy a read as one will find in Beckett's works. Bringing up important questions of rationality and the concept of the self, &quot;Company&quot; is not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Phenomenal World","review":"The original photographs are large, about 12 feet long and five feet high, as seen in the Koch Gallery in San Francisco. The images feature natural arches, sea arches at an undisclosed location and land arches, obviously in Utah. The photos are black and white. The contast level is moderate or soft, unlike the hard contrast found in the prints of Bruce Barnbaum or A.Adams. It is doubtful if use of a higher contrast paper would have increased the impact of the photos, the photos satisfying as they are. The photographer's goal is not to immerse the viewer in textures and detail, as is the case for Barnbaum and A.Adams, but to provide a large, sculptural shape. Humans are found in many of Parker's landscape images. Humans are also used in landscapes by Roger Minnick and Mark Klett, and here the people are seen as people, and the artist's goal is to use people as a counterpoint, to provide a subtle jab of humor. In contrast, David Parker's people are meant to be part of the natural landscape, the people are like the lava trees found on the flanks of Mt. Kilauea, the people also serve as a yardstick to provide a sense of scale to the large arches. Perhaps, David Parker's people are androids. Mr. Parker's most exciting photograph, which features an arch extending from the land into the ocean, with a man standing on the flank of the arch that is inserted into the sea, does not appear in the book. Too bad. Mr. Parker's photographs are similar to those of Lynn Davis, as seen at the John Berggruen Gallery in San Francisco. Lynn Davis' photographs are about 8 feet by 8 feet square. Lynn Davis' original prints are subdued and of grade one or grade two contrast. The reproductions in Lynn Davis' book Monuments are also of low contrast. A higher contrast would have made the photographs much more appealing. Lynn Davis has been doing icebergs for a long, long time. I notice that one of her iceberg photos, a color print from 1986, appears in the catalogue &quot;The Indomitable Spirit&quot; published by Friends United Against AIDS. What is missing from her book Monuments is her most interesting recent landscape print, which can be seen on the card from the November 2001 exhibition at the John Berggruen Gallery. The print on the card is of a dramatic grade 3 contrast. This exciting print features an iceberg in the top left quadrant, with a dramatic inverted arch on the top surface of the ice, a nice reflection of the iceberg in the water appearing between the berg and the viewer, a thin horizon line consisting of a distant ice cliff, and in the sky, an archlike shape in the gentle cloudcover that roughly duplicates (or continues) the arch &quot;scooped out&quot; from the top of the berg. How excited the photographer must have been when she made the exposure. Too bad this print isn't in Monuments."},{"Title":"Fleecing the Lambs","review":"Christopher Elias graduated from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. As editor of the magazine of the New York Stock Exchange he observed the manipulations of this private corporation in plotting and conspiring to violate the Exchange's rules and national laws in order to grab more wealth and maintain control over the financial world. Elias was fired when they found out he was writing this very readable book. This is a shocking report on the many firms of Wall Street, and will alert the public to the frauds that victimize them. Is the NYSE the most powerful and dangerous organization in the United States? You should read this book before buying stock.Wall Street is full of arrogant people who regard the average investor as a \\"sucker\\" to be swindled or defrauded by selling them stock that the rich and powerful don't want (p.ix). Their main rule is \\"never give a sucker an even break\\" (p.x). The power of the Exchange is shown by the fear of those who work there (p.xi). This power prevents criticism and honest reform. Millions of Americans own shares indirectly through pension plans. Most Wall Street firms are partnerships or privately held corporations and have no public accounting (p.5). They are greedy, incompetent, shortsighted, and even dishonest. Page 8 notes the mismanagement of the later 1960s, and their pay-offs to Nixon (p.9); page 10 tells of their crookedness. Wall Street's biggest fear is not regulation, but competition from institutional investors (p.11). Are large institutions given inside information before individual investors (p.14)? Is the average investor gullible and greedy because of an urge to get rich quick? Does Wall Street \\"create wealth\\" by taking from the poor to give to the rich?Chapter 3 provides a short history of Wall Street, and why \\"It Was Always That Way\\". It explains the origins of the short sale, the corner, watering stock (pp.32-34). Between 1919 to 1933 the public bought $25 billion in worthless stocks (p.35)! Page 38 tells of another bank swindle. The Exchange enabled swindlers by listing stocks to make them appear legitimate (p.46). The battle against Federal regulation in the 1930s collapsed when the President of the Exchange was caught stealing (p.43)! Chapter 4 tells of the mismanagement and back office losses in the late 1960s. The average investor should stay out of the market and buy shares in an investment plan (p.77). In 1963 the SEC concluded that Wall Street's research was merely a selling tool (p.78). Page 82 explains how selling new issues results in lucrative profits for insiders and underwriters (p.88). The market price of a stock does not represent its value (p.92).The collapse of the back offices in 1968 shows why Wall Street can't regulate itself. Greed, mismanagement, or other errors were to blame (p.96). There were many problems (pp.98-99). Thefts added to the disorder (p.103). Proficient and honest management are needed for a well-run system (p.104). The author advises people to hold on to their stock certificates (p.105); a receipt is not a tangible asset. Chapter 8 discusses the loose ethics and dishonesty among salesmen (p.107). They sold stock not suited to the investors' needs; they churned accounts, and made unauthorized trades (p.108). Complaints by customers are called \\"idiot mail\\" (p.112). This book was written before the devaluation of the dollar in 1971, so dollar figures are outdated. The first half was more interesting."},{"Title":"Miller's Movie Collectibles","review":"Lavishly illustrated guide to movie posters and associated film collectibles. Informative text.

Many of them are no more than price guides - this one is actually a pleasure to READ. Tons of great nuggets of fascinating info. I read it from cover to cover, even the sections on items I have no interest in collecting.Yes, it is heavy on posters, lobby cards and other paper items, but so is the whole world of movie memorabilia collecting, so I think it only reflects what people most likely want to know about.My only criticism of this book is that it could have been a lot longer and more comprehensive. Maybe someday there will be a sequel. Also, some of the photos are great and I would have preferred a larger format to show them off."},{"Title":"Miller's Movie Collectibles","review":"As usual, a typical book that focuses on just movie posters and throws small scraps to the rest of movie memorabilia material.

This kind of book is rare BUT NECESSARY first step of the thinking person's exploration of Judaism because it tells what Jews believe.The only other book out there like it that I can think of is &quot;Book of Our Heritage&quot; by Kitov, but reading &quot;Heritage&quot; is already a pretty serious investment in study, usually made only by an avid reader. This book is an easier read but no less significant an achievement.It is also different from &quot;Heritage&quot; in its approach. It is more straight on with a specific goal of saving the earnest intellectual who is curious about Judaism but confused - confused from all of the myths about Judaism, and popular schools of thought today which contradict or at least seem to contradict Judaism. In his way, the rabbi is trying to achieve a work which is not unlike what the Rambam was trying to do with Guide for the Perplexed and eliviate the confusion. This is an update to that idea for the current time and a much much easier read.For the initiated:The title of this book might scare some people away because it has the words &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;contemporary&quot;, but it shouldn't. Although it is obviously written by a Modern Orthodox rabbi, it favors no particular hashkafah of Orthodox Judaism. If your kids are in Bnei Brock, they're not going to run out and go to the movies or become astronomers after reading this book, and modern kids aren't going to start keeping yashan either. Those who are learned will find this book has mostly basic material, but it is distilled and summarized in such a way which will clarify many things and make them clearer to us. Having said that, there are many things even the learned will learn from it."},{"Title":"Contemporary Orthodox Judaism's Response to Modernity","review":"explaining the basics and debunking myths that seem to be altogether too common (e.g. that Jewish law is 100% anti-abortion or 100% pro-abortion, or that Jews don't believe in an afterlife, that Jewish mysticism began with Kabbalah, or that the most traditional Jews are always the most pro-Zionist). Although once in a while Freundel mentions other Jewish movements, his tone towards non-Orthodox movements is reasonably respectful, and he writes much more about differences within Orthodoxy.A few points I thought were especially noteworthy or surprising:*The key difference between the Five Books of Moses and the rest of the Tanach: the first are sources of law, the second generally not.*Freundel admits the existence of possible corruptions in the biblical text, noting that 8th-century scholars sought to correct such corruptions and that even now, there is a one-letter deviation between Ashkenazic and Sephardic versions of the Torah. But Freundel argues that any small errors in the text are \\"not legally consequential\\" because Judaism rejects literal interpretation of the Bible, and Jewish law is based instead on centuries of rabbinic analysis.*Freundel asserts that Judaism is optimistic about man's capacities, and gives an interesting example of this: human cloning. Catholics oppose cloning because cloning constitutes \\"playing God in the work of creation\\" while many Orthodox Jews support cloning in principle because \\"becoming a partner with God in the works of creation\\" is essentially noble. A Protestant theologican argued against cloning in a Congression hearing because \\"people have a right not to be created in this way\\". By contrast, Freundel asserts that human existence is sufficiently noble that existence is better than nonexistence regardless of how it is created.*Freundel's detailed explanations of the relationship between God and Evil. Unlike some fringe characters, Freundel rejects the notion that evil is always a punishment for sin (though of course it might be). Orthodox Jews have also endorsed other explanations, since as human free will, Divine self-limitation, evil as a challenge that humans were created to remedy, and possible compensation (to good people who suffer and bad people who do not) in the next world.Freundel does occasionally lapse into overly technical language; he once asserts that Israel \\"is a cutting edge issue in the debate between more modern and yeshivish expressions of Orthodoxy.\\" I suspect that many readers who are not Jewish or who grew up outside Orthodoxy won't understand what \\"yeshivish\\" means - but thankfully, such lapses are few and far between."},{"Title":"Contemporary Orthodox Judaism's Response to Modernity","review":"From Publisher's WeeklyThe International News Source of Book Publishing and BooksellingFebruary 23, 2004CONTEMPORARY ORTHODOX JUDAISM'S RESPONSE TO MODERNITYRabbi Barry Freundel. KTAV,Freundel, who counts former presidential candidate Joe Lieberman among his Washington, D.C., congregants, invites readers, Jewish and non-Jewish, to gain a better understanding of Jewish law, tradition and belief in his succinct but thorough analyses of 31 different topics crucial to Orthodox Judaism, such as teshuvah (repentance), Israel, prayer and Shabbat and Kashrut. Each chapter summarizes the central sources upon which the Halakhah (Jewish law) is based in clear, understandable terms and explains the development of the tradition as well as its practical application in today's world. Additionally, Freundel provides all the relevant Orthodox opinions on the matter, including those that he or the law ultimately rejects, and elucidates how and why Jewish law maintains its ancient positions even as modernity infringes on them. He does not shy away from or gloss over sensitive or controversial issues; instead he seems eager to take them on and debunk popular myths, including the widespread notions that Judaism considers women inferior and that Jews do not believe In an afterlife. Even though most chapters number only a few pages, his essays are accurate, entirely to the point, easy to finish without losing interest and convenient to pick up or put down at any time. Freundel's evident mastery of the vast breadth of materials within Jewish thought and law combined with his eloquent and cogent writing makes for an exceptionally worthwhile, inspirational and instructive work that no informed person should be without.

Freundel shows the development of Jewish tradition and practices, and shows how the philosophy that makes up Judaism has changed over time. Particularly of interest are the ways in which he ties changes in Jewish thought to global changes in thought over time, and how the overarching idea of a given era affected Jewish views.This book takes the approach of being a quick overview of a variety of topics rather than an in-depth study on any of them, but it still provides the reader with enough information to give them a cursory understanding of the selected topics.

Unfortunately there are very few laws to protect victims, consequently few statistics. Often times the victim isn't aware they are being verbally abused. This book sheds light on this unfortunate topic and helps create a necessary awareness. The stories are as compelling as they are sad. Verbal abuse transcends all socio-economic boundaries.

But life changes and I sought answers on what would make an individual become abusive when they hadn't been so to you before. This book tells many versions of bad people manipulating people they love for many reasons, but among the stories are common threads that will give all who believe they are suffering at the hands of an abuser, strength to stand up to them and freedom to leave them behind. Finally I saw patterns of abuse in his marriage and and the signs of illness that had not been visible through my rose-colored eyes of love. This books support to move forward to positivism was a great motivator. How we change when abused is frightening. Whatever rantionalizations, lies, and blame laid at your feet the abuser uses to justify the abuse, it is not anyone's fault but their own for their cruelty. I often scoffed at self-help books, but this is a topic that is needed.

GET THIS BOOK. I can't even explain how much this book helped me. Love, or what we think is love, can be very blind. Ok, maybe not blind, but doesn't always see straight.Even though you may feel like it is wrong how you are being treated, or someone has told you it is wrong, the abusive partner has told you so many times it is YOU that has or is the problem that you doubt your own thoughts and feelings!You remain hopeful for years, maybe even decades. Then when you are at the point you can't take it anymore (again) they are sorry, don't know why they acted like that, or blame the reason they act like that on stress, work or something external. You don't really know if you want a divorce, fearing it may be worse on the 'other side', after all he's not mean ALL the time right? Maybe you're staying for the kids' sake. I mean where you are now might stink, but at least you know it & are used to it - no matter how bad it might be, it is predictable... you have no clue what it would be like on the other side (without him/her)! You wonder if it is really that bad, but you know you can't keep living this way.This book will help you figure out if it is that bad, if how you are being treated is wrong, and the patterns that keep repeating over and over. This book will help you to see you are not alone, not crazy, and help you understand the crazy-making that is going on. You will know in fact that you are not stupid, that you are smart, you CAN make it, and it can get better! YES, THERE IS HOPE!As for staying with the abusive partner for the kids sake, my sister said something to me that made me realize how it could affect my children's future, who were 10 and 6 at the time. She said, \\"What would you do if someone were treating (insert your daughter's name here) like that?\\" Naturally, I said I would do everything in my power to get her to know she is worth more than letting someone treat her like that. She then said, \\"And (your son) is going to grow up thinking it is normal to treat women the way you are being treated, do you want that?\\" Of course, \\"Absolutely not!\\" was my answer.After 16 years of marriage and now 12 years divorced, my self-confidence is still not completely recovered. What I am saying is if you are going through this now, it isn't just now that it may be affecting, it can affect several things also in your future.I hope that what I have wrote here helps one person or especially one teenager not to go through what I have. THIS book showed me in black and white what I could not completely accept as true from those who told me personally. I came across it in the book store, and after reading just a bit I realized it was NOT just the way I was seeing things, it was real.Along with someone else who posted a review of this book, I too wished he would just hit me, because everyone knows that is wrong, but emotional verbal abuse is not so easy to detect or quantify, but it is just as, if not more damaging to you, and possibly your children.

I am going through a divorce with someone who was in the top 10 of verbally abusive men. He turned my children away from me, created self-doubt within me (in a way that you would hardly notice), and verbally degraded me in front of them until I had very little relationship left with my children. Get a background check done on your mate...even if you think you know him -- you owe it to yourself to really know the truth. (Hopefully you will do it BEFORE you marry him!!!) You may find things such as I did, such as another wife I didn't know he had before me, and an extensive criminal history.Beware of a man who you met in church who seems so perfect when he introduces himself to you, because like him, other men go into the church trying to find women such that are kind -- and they have an easy target. It's even a bonus if you have money. All of the money you have worked for will be all gone in a matter of weeks or months. They look for good Christian women with a trust in God, and a non-judgemental spirit. Because of who I was, I overlooked the very \\"little\\" he told me about himself (my Christian heart said what right do I have to judge him?I'm not perfect, and God wants me to forgive and not have judgement in my heart for him, right?.I stayed with him through years of marraige praying for things to get better because I had children with him -- and I wanted a family that stayed together. They will tell you you need counseling then will turn on you and tell them YOU are the abuser. It's all behind a very sick mind, and there will be no healing in your marraige because it's who they are. They believe the world owes them. Very doubtfully, will you ever have a chance for things to really change. Search the internet on Psycopath and Narcissist and gain understanding of who they really are. They can be executives and successful. They will manipulate, lie and talk themselves out of any situation with ease. If they are verbally abusive men, they are also likely skilled in manipulation and lies.

It is a horror story disguised as passioned observations of victims and perpetrators. Abuse is an integral, inseparable part of the Narcissistic Personality Disorder. The narcissist idealizes and then DEVALUES and discards the object of his initial idealization. This abrupt, heartless devaluation IS abuse. ALL narcissists idealize and then devalue. This is THE core of pathological narcissism. The narcissist exploits, lies, insults, demeans, ignores (the &quot;silent treatment&quot;), manipulates, controls. All these are forms of abuse. There are a million ways to abuse. To love too much is to abuse. It is tantamount to treating someone as an extension, an object, or an instrument of gratification. To be over-protective, not to respect privacy, to be brutally honest, or consistently tactless - is to abuse. To expect too much, to denigrate, to ignore - are all modes of abuse. There is physical abuse, verbal abuse, psychological abuse, sexual abuse. The list is long. Narcissists are masters of abusing surreptitiously. They are &quot;stealth abusers&quot;.

She outlines what abuse is in great detail, and that is very valuable, but she ignores the fact that men are as much subject to abuse (verbal and otherwise) as women are. they do not report it, and hence it is assumed that they are not victims to the same extent as women are. Studies have shown that almost an equal percentage of men suffer abuse. In my own counselling practice I have as many men as women who are victims of abuse. it takes them a long time to admit it, as they fear being labelled as weak or wimpish! I suggest that Patricia Evans amends her titles and includes women to show that she is writing about the abuse of women, and admits in her introduction the men are also abused to at least as great an extent. Indeed, my experience shows that the violence suffered by men can be greater, because women often resort to using weapons to make up for their relative lack of physical strength. Were Miss Evans to make these changes I would give her book a 5 star rating.Dr Jim O'Shea"},{"Title":"Verbal Abuse: Survivors Speak Out on Releationship and Recovery","review":"A book that helps the reader to find some very valuable answers."},{"Title":"Verbal Abuse: Survivors Speak Out on Releationship and Recovery","review":"Almost working as a lengthy footnote to her original book, \\"The Verbally Abusive Relationship\\", \\"Survivors Speak Out\\" is 100% geared toward women; a quality which the author freely admits in the introduction, and which is the very quality that makes it ultimately questionable and sometimes downright dangerous.The segments which are primarily quotes from survivors of verbal/emotional abuse are both sad and moving. We hear of women who are just beginning to start their lives again after living with a bully for 40 years. Others are much too young, only beginning to discover a sense of self and inner strength after marrying to essentially escape parental rule. Their pain and misery comes across on paper like bolts.What hurts more here, are the constant sexist, male-bashing comments attended thereto by Evans. She still refuses to back away from her stance that abuse is perpetrated 99% of the time by men against women, and still asserts that abusive behavior is not borne of psychological issues or childhood dysfunction in which gender is not an issue, but of a patriarchal plot to destroy all women, and after awhile it is as laughable as it is annoying.She claims in this book that it's abusive when a man asks aloud to no one in particular, \\"Where are my keys?\\". It gets to the point where no sentence uttered by a man is without abusive, controlling intent, whereas Evans's ideals of mutuality in relationships adds up to nothing more than a completely unrealistic, enmeshed love fantasy. By her theories, all men have an innate, uncontrollable desire to oppress and control women, and this is patently abusrd, as well as highly misandrous.Evans seems to present a very good model and description, and categorization of what abuse is, albeit highly peppered with a lethal dose of venemous 1970's radical feminism, the kind of feminism that empowers women by blaming men. At no point in the book does she ever examine a man's opinion of the relationship, unless they are writing in to \\"confess\\" that they have been abusive.No, no one brings abuse upon themselves, and no victim is to blame for having suffered it. But Evans preaches hate, teaches to rage back (\\"Stop It NOW!\\"), and remain stuck in victimhood forever, rather than discovering personal power and self-esteem.A quick surf through the FAQ in this book (and her own online message board) reveals that Evans is incapable of, or refuses to address any legitimate challenge to her theories, and any dissenting opinion or close examination of her theories (which crumble easily under close inspection) are quickly deemed \\"abuse\\".By this book, Evans has in a way created her very own language, where everyone has to carefully measure every word chosen, and where no man can open his mouth once without being accused of abuse. Her drooling followers are legion; angry, aggressive, blaming.I would encourage extreme caution in reading this book. It tells very clearly what abuse is, but hasn't a clue as to what to do about it."},{"Title":"Verbal Abuse: Survivors Speak Out on Releationship and Recovery","review":"This book would be much more helpful if it had more facts in the examples."},{"Title":"Verbal Abuse: Survivors Speak Out on Releationship and Recovery","review":"Almost a year ago I realized that what I had been experiencing from my husband was emotional, phsycological, abuse and later on, I happened upon this book. I ordered it and while awaiting it's arrival, I was questioning myself as to was this book really aimed at what I had been going through, after all, there was NO name calling. I immediately went to the back cover for more insight to the content of the book, when it came, and it asked several questions concerning your relationship. I knew after the first two, this book was for me and still is. There are so many types of and methods of verbal abuse that are so subtle, you wonder if the abuser is even smart enough to know what they are doing, but to my amazement and relief, I saw myself on almost every page. I am now proceeding in going through with a divorce, not as a result of this book, that my husband has eluded to wanting for the past year but won't follow through because he never wants to look like the &quot;bad guy&quot;, too late. This book has been very useful in helping me to realize that I had lost my &quot;self&quot; and respect for and that in no way could I ever hope to regain any self respect or find me again as long as I stayed in this situation, not to mention what I was modeling to my children, which was in no way healthy. I must say, since I started standing up for myself and calling my husband on every lie he told, the abuse worsened as the need to control what was slipping away became stronger, he has been mad at me ever since I stopped believing all his put downs and promises I knew would never come to pass...........Oh well, I feel great about myself again even though divorce is never fun. This book gave me the courage to stand up for what was right and true by putting my life in print for me to see. The realization was phenominal and I'll be forever grateful.

Because this was mixed with fun, adventure and &quot;love&quot;, the total effect was confusion and - by the end of it - a complete dismantling of spirit. Patricia Evans' two books have guided me through a long (now 3 years) healing period, which even now is marked with a deep, unidentifiable pain - especially on encountering my ex-husband. The power of Patricia Evans' books lies in their specific outlining of what is actually happening in a relationship where one's deepest self is not honored or cherished.

Abuse is such a subtle thing, and most of us never realize what we are doing to other people.

It has opened my eyes in more ways than one. I highly recommend this book. Another reason that I bought this book is that since being in this controlling relationship for 5 years, I have had migraines and muscle aches 5 times per week or more that kept me bedridden! My self-esteem went from a healthy 10 to a minus 2 these past 5 years. Moreover, because I was \\"ill\\" so much, I did not exercise and gained 35 pounds. Eating had become my comfort, even sickness became my comfort. This book has helped to discoverer:By ALLOWING this person to verbually abuse me and control me, it caused illness in my body and very often! I was tired of being ill most of the time. You see, I used my \\"illness\\" to gain control by:1) Getting him to feel sorry for me so I could have my way for a change--I would not be forced to do what he wanted when I was \\"ill\\". (This \\"illness\\" method has stopped working in the last year).2) I told my \\"illness\\" BYE BYE because it was controlling me! Now, I choose the healthy and honest way to control my life: \\"Stand up for myself with no need to explain myself.\\"3) I used the \\"illness\\" as an excuse to go to bed and \\"hide\\" from this person. Also, it was an excuse to not have to go to work so this person would continue to \\"take care of me.\\" Now, I am walking 2 miles a day and physically and mentally I am healthier. I am getting in shape mentally and physically--I can go to work with no problem. And take care of myself with no problem.2) After reading this book, I realized that I had ALLOWED this person to control me for 5 years and be verbally abusive to me when we were alone and in public. I have taken back my power now and I am now in control. Today, for the first time, I stood up to him and said \\"No\\" about something I did not want to do and told him what I CHOOSE to do instead. And I felt wonderful inside, my self-esteem went up quite a lot! YES!!!If you are in a relationship or taking any kind of verbal abuse or control, I highly suggest that you purchase this book. I has truly been an eye-opener and life-saver for me as I learned that I had allowed this person to verbally abuse and control me, I gave him this power because I let him do these things. No more, now, I am in control of my life and my thoughts. This book is so very highly recommended and I believe it will help you. Also, may I suggest that you consider Louise Hay CD's\\" Self-Esteem, Stress-Free, 101-Power Thoughts\\", these have also been a big help to me and I listen to them often.

Malzberg was one of the most prolific and brilliant science fiction writers of the 1970's and early 1980's, cranking out an amazing 75 novels and hundreds of short stories in a relatively short time while still maintaining remarkably high literary standards. His output has slowed way down since his most fruitful period although he does manage to produce the occasional excellent short story in major anthologies. Most of his best novels, including great works such as DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLE, HEROVIT'S WORLD and GUERNICA NIGHT, are frustratingly out of print at the moment. Even Malzberg's most acclaimed and popular book, BEYOND APOLLO, is currently unavailable. In some ways, APOLLO is the greatest loss of all, as most critics agree that this novel was a signature genre title of the 1970's, certainly an important starting point for any reader interested in sampling this often grimly powerful writer's works.BEYOND APOLLO tells the story of the doomed first manned exploratory mission to the planet Venus. As usual, Malzberg takes such a commonplace and horribly cliched premise and twists it beyond all possible expectations. The mission's lone, and possibly completely crazed, survivor recounts the details of the disastrous expedition as a novel-in-progress. Written with Malzberg's customary heavy irony and outlandish black humor, APOLLO features some of the writer's sharpest and funniest dialogue ever.The winner of the John W. Campbell award as best science fiction novel of 1972, APOLLO is part of an angry and obsessive trilogy of thematically related novels Malzberg wrote about NASA, all published within months of each other. Although APOLLO is surely the most critically championed of the three books, I actually prefer both THE FALLING ASTRONAUTS and REVELATIONS. This is probably simply because BEYOND APOLLO has received such near-unanimous praise throughout the years, while the other two titles remain lost in relative obscurity, that the natural result is APOLLO does seem to be somewhat unfairly overrated in comparison. Nonetheless, it is a great novel, and like all of Malzberg's best work it is powerful, richly detailed and often wickedly hilarious. Until its eventual much deserved republication, it will be very much worth your time and effort to search for a decent used copy."},{"Title":"Beyond Apollo","review":"There's something deceptive in the way Barry Malzberg books are marketed. Publishers seem unable to describe what the book is actually about and what they settle on seems to fall very wide of the mark. Both with this book and \\"Galaxies\\", the descriptions on the back cover emphasize aspects of the book that are really insignificant in the story itself and give sort of a false impression of what the book is really about. This even extends to the cover, which can be called \\"trippy\\" at the very least and seems to hint that enjoyment of the book involves a psychedelic experience. It's not necessary to do these things, since Malzberg's books don't really need any extra selling, even if they are hard to classify. This novel takes a fairly simple premise (men venturing into an unexplored planet) and uses it as a launching point to both belittle SF and the space program. Two astronauts go out on a trip to Venus, only one comes back. What happened to the other, the survivor will not say, nor will he say what happened on the planet itself. Malzberg dodges the issue expertly, never letting on if the main character is crazy (and if he is, did he start out that way?) and it's impossible to say which of his narrative is true, if any. The ultimate truth is elusive, a rarity in writing, where readers like everything to be spelled out. Told in brief bursts of short chapters this is a book that reads quickly and like most of Malzberg's books there's not a wasted word, he makes his point and moves on, leaving the reader to figure out the rest. Nor does he makes his comments in broad strokes, his criticisms are always incisive and focused and in a sense are still relevant today. Absolutely unlike any of the SF of the day, it was a deserved winner of the John W Campbell award when it came out, that didn't help it remain in print and used is the way to go with this one even today. But regardless of what the cover art looks like or what the stuff on the back cover tells you, this is one of his greatest novels and a fascinating example of thought-provoking SF in its own right."},{"Title":"Beyond Apollo","review":"Barry N Malzberg is one of the most criminally underrated metafiction writers in America and possibly the most underrated writer in the American literary fraternity. This is largely because he was lazily categorised as a science fiction writer by critics who didn't know what to make of his genre transcending novels at the time that he rose to prominence. 'Beyond Apollo' is probably his most well known novel and really is a fascinating schmorgasboard of his concerns, themes and obsessions. Essentially, the novel documents the psyche of Harry M Evans, astronaut and sole survivor of an abortive mission to explore Venus, as he struggles to deal with a schizoid break, imprisonment in a lunatic asylum, repeated interrogations by the authorities to establish what happened to the only other occupant of the craft and the dissolution of his marriage. Its almost impossible to describe Malzberg's style - though it shares much in common with the likes of Kurt Vonnegut, J.G. Ballard, Ken Kesey and Chuck Palahniuk while retaining an authorial voice that is all his own. The book achieves in a scant one hundred and thirty eight pages the kind of dizzying multifaceted metatext which writers such as Don Delillo have been unable to achieve in one thousand. Though references to the Apollo program date it somewhat, I highly recommend it and if you find Malzberg to your taste, I also recommendHerovits Worldby the same author and James Blinn's superbThe Aardvark Is Ready for War."},{"Title":"Beyond Apollo","review":"I read the book back in ca. 1974, as a kid, and liked it.

But anyone with an MFA knows from the get-go to stay away from the topics of dogs and dreams! I'm too type A not to finish a book (this was on the shelf at a beach cottage) but it was tedious. Bizarre and boring on the topic of teaching a dog to talk, long-winded on tarot cards (unless you're into that... if you're not, a reader just wants to know the outcome), the tension is drawn out too long about the so-called &quot;mystery&quot; surrounding Lexy's death, and she herself is an unlikeable character. Read Joanna Trollope's Brother and Sister instead."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"After reading some of the other reviews, I have to wonder if we were all reading the same book or did some of us just skip &amp; skim...It may sound almost insane that a man would try to teach his dog to speak but one would have to look at it from Paul's point of view: he was grief-stricken. He had just lost his wife &amp; wanted what anyone of us would have wanted had a loved one's death occurred &amp; literally NO ONE was there to retell the events. He wanted closure.Yes, this book does contain acts of animal abuse but Paul does not condone the acts by the group mentioned in the book. In fact, he finds them reprehensible. Perhaps it's that part of him that's in all of us that has to slow down at the site of an accident that draws him to initially explore their ideals.I think that it's a very good book that ties up all of the loose ends without having an overly happy/unrealistic ending."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"If the narrator tells his story chrnologically, there's no mystery.

By the end he does accept Lexy's suicide, but never acknowledges his self-deception, nervous breakdown, or mistreatment of poor Lorelei.It's not badly written, although the criticisms of the narrator sounding too feminine are valid.

I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is one of the most creative and intelligent literary novels I have read in ages. Carolyn Parkhurst manages to create memorable characters, a complex plot, and a mysterious psychological journey all in one novel. The book is a tragic tale as most narratives involving mental illness or depression are, but Parkhurst creates such a vivid psychological terrain that the exquisite sadness of the story is balanced by all the other successfully employed literary devices that the reader feels he/she has grown from the experience of placing oneself in the hands of such a deft writer.Lexy, the protagonist, seems to have wanted a white knight of a man who would rescue her from her dark impulses but then came to realize there wasn't any human being who could ultimately sustain the effort required to make her whole or happy. It seems she married a man who was essentially clueless about the darkness Lexy experienced and at the same time he was not completely unconditional in his love for her either, although he did love her. It is his emotionally laden psychological journey into her complicated personality through the clues she left behind that allows him to come to grips with her terrible and seeming senseless death. He is finally left, as all studious seekers are, with the sense that none of us, even devoted husbands and wives, know the other person completely. Lexy was mysterious in her withholding of self and devious in her deceptions, but she was also vibrantly artistic and curious about life in an intellectual sense. Perhaps she was too intelligent to accept life on the terms her husband did. For her, life had to have substance and meaning so she turned her laser-like mind into the depths of it only to fail in making her life meaningful enough for her to deal with her own sorrow and disappointment. For Lexy much was expected of herself, and so much was expected of life. Life simply could not live up to her expectations, nor could any man, most likely.Like the biblical symbol of Babel, Lexy's metaphorical language reveals truths about the human condition that people intuitively understand, but people restrained by logic or complete rationality would miss the genius of her own observations camouflaged so well in the metaphors she chooses, mainly titles of books she enjoyed but also tapestries of insight rendered in her carefully wrought death masks.Lexy was a person of intense feeling; her husband Paul was low key, living on a more superficial level that wasn't so self-threatening. Because she lacked someone in her life capable of her psychological depth, she flew into rages that neither she nor Paul understood. In fact, people could never understand her because she possessed a twisted psyche borne of her intellect, imagination and past upheaval. Her suicidal tendencies notwithstanding, hers was a fragile psyche, needing the steady support of a dogged friend, a dog, for starters. She needed unconditional love, something most people are incapable of, and the reader thinks at first that that is just what Paul is, but a closer reading reveals him incapable of the complexity necessary to understand Lexy's needs. For her, the future held suicide but she continued through most of her life to try to avoid that ending until the hopelessness overwhelmed her and she submitted to the dark, hellish fate her masks symbolized. Death lured her to its frozen banks, through the gates guarded by the infamous Cerberus, and she followed, into the darkness of her own imagination. Part of her reason for allowing the darkness to swallow her was that she knew her extreme emotional sensitivity would destroy Paul, and she didn't want to be the cause of his destruction.The book is a powerful examination of pathology and heightened and extraordinary artistic powers of an unusually gifted and sensitive human being. I highly recommend this fascinating book.By Marjorie Meyerle, Colorado Author: Bread of Shame (literary fiction)Bread of Shame"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Wasn't sure I would like it, but it turned out to be a great read."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book is the epitome of good fiction.

You learn about Paul's love for Lexy and how that love leads him to have blinders about so many aspects of his wife's personality. However, Lexy made it so easy for him to turn a blind eye through her wonderful, adoring and vibrant personality.The characters in this book are wonderfully developed and it's easy to fall into their story. There are some bizarre twists and turns along the way that go out of the norm of life but emotional whirlwind that the characters put you through in this story more than makes up for it.I highly recommend this book.

This book succeeds at creating a highly symbolic and interpretive landscape without loosing the reader for a second."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I bought this book because I thought the title was interesting. After reading it it all made perfect sense.&quot;The Dogs of Babel&quot; is a unique story about a man who attempts to solve the mystery of his wife's death through the knowledge of his dog. Although the story is far-fetched it is appealing simply for the originality behind the plot. But the story is also sometimes too predicitable as well. How a linguist professor happens to own a dog who is smart enough to be the first talking dog....life isn't that easy. The dog story is entertaining if you like dogs and it sure will make you look at your dog a bit differently at the same time. I didn't like the animal abuse but I suppose if there ever was a real talking dog and scientists got ahold of it, &quot;real&quot; dogs would probably no longer exist. So not only do the dogs &quot;babble&quot; they also represent the story of Babel by attempting to cross communication gaps between species, in the Bible it was between tribes.So curl up with your favorite pooch and start your own babble for what it's worth. A nice read and something different for a change."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"We actually listened to this book on CD as we drove across the country a few weeks ago, and I guess you could say we enjoyed it.I confess to hating the characters. But if I think past the characters, this is a tragic, heartbreaking story. The grief and loss he feels is so profound, and you, as the reader, can really feel that in his actions and his memories.I would not want to read it again however. But worth reading the first time."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I bought this book as a result of hearing the author on NPR and my love of dogs. Listening to the comments it sounded like my kind of book. However, the commentator did remark that it was not a book for young readers, hinting at the sisister conclusion.I actually liked the first half of the book, but it seemed that somewhere around the last third or so a decidedly dark side emerges and I think its fair that prospective readers should be aware of it.The book is well written and the plot is well thought out. Several other reviewers have compared this book to THOSE LOVELY BONES and its a ligitimate comparison. There are some similarities as to the flow of the book and the underlying evil that is the basis of the plot.Half way through the book I would have recommended it. By the end, I'm not so sure. For some reason, the conclusion just didn't work for me. The enchaniting Lexy of the first part of the book turns in to a deceitful person by the end. I'm very leary of these &quot;perfect relationships&quot; and maybe that's one of the things that bothered me about Lexy and the narrator. Perhaps their relationship was too perfect. And it was certainly too perfect for the husband to recognize Lexy's intentions.For a book club, it's probably a good choice because it raises many topics for discussion. There is a lot of symbolism in the plot with the masks. Even the thing with the square eggs which started the relationship. Eggs are not square. The attempt to change them is very symbolic in terms of the entire plot. When Lexy and the narrator first meet, she doesn't want to end their first date, but yet she ends the relationship by her death. All this makes for great discussion.But I believe the basic message is that you have to accept people and animals for what they are. Lexy was not going to change. Her husband should have seen that. Dogs don't talk and the narrator should have seen that also. Life is the way it comes. When you try to change the basic building blocks of life you screw up big time."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"While the prose of this book was quite nice, the subject was far more suited to a listing of 'Science Fiction' than mystery. Yes, there was a death. And yes, the circumstances of the death were questioned by books hero. Just because a main character doesn't understand the circumstances of someone's death does not make a book a mystery.It was a good read, and I would recommend it to those of you with an open mind, but don't expect anything resembling a mystery, as you won't find it within these pages."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I absolutely loved this book....until I got to the part about the dogs. I still can't get it out of my mind and have been feeling the urge to hug my dog ever since. It's a shame the author ruined what could have been a wonderful love story.Oh, and by the way, I wonder if Ms. Parkhurst is aware that neither dogs nor humans have the ability to swallow (and therefore eat) without a larynx????? I think she neglected some important research. Not only is the dog mutilation part of this book distasteful, it is also not factual."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I only wish there were options to give \\"minus stars\\". In 58 years I have never thrown a book in the trash (much less a brand new hardcover) but I was so disgusted with this book it went into the trash compactor when I was two-thirds through. I wouldn't even consider putting it in a booksale for fear a nut similar to the author would find the book instructive. If you are interested in finding new ways to torture animals, have at it. But you will have to plow your way through idiotic, inexplicable and annoying behavior of a dead wife and a husband with a jellyish spine and mind. There was absolutely no redeeming value in this book. It is incredibly insulting to Alice S. to compare this [book] to her \\"lovely bones\\"."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"until now. I feel so strongly about letting people know this was the worst book I've ever read. The character of Lexy was pathetic. And her husband Paul, was no better if worse! He idolized and worshipped this woman, whom he supposedly loved, when he should have been getting her some serious help. It seemed that Paul was extremely apathetic and kind of just accepted his wife's suicide! I should hope a husband would grieve a little more for his wife.. The plot was flimsy and the love story was non-existent!And those are just the human characters. The only character I liked in the book was the dog, Lorelei. Unfortunately due to her owner's self-absorption, she meets some unfortunate events. There are some graphic scenes of animal mutilation in this book, and if you're sensitive to such subject matter, I warn you to steer clear. I've actually had nightmares of scenes this book put into my head. I've never been more let down by a book in my life."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"When I started reading this book I hoped it would be a cool mystery about how the narrator uncovers the truth of his wife's death with clues given by the only witness, their dog. Unfortunately the book was not nearly as neat as I thought it would be. The fact that the professor literally tries to get the dog to talk is just plain dumb. This book focuses way too much on that, and not enough on solving the mystery...which by the way turns out to be not mysterious at all. There is some stuff in the book about animal abuse, and as a huge animal lover, I was somewhat bothered, but it really isn't that bad. Also, I did not end up feeling anything for the characters. Lexy, the wife who dies, is self centered and basically psycho and Paul, the husband, is just plain boring.I finished this book, because I hate the idea of not finishing books, but it really wasn't worth my time."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I checked out this book with great anticipation after reading the rave reviews. The premise of the grieving husband wanting to teach their dog to talk to find out how his wife died was innovative and interesting. It then poses the question to the reader - Will Paul be able to accomplish this? How will he accomplish it?- and when he does, will the answer enhance the plot and lead him in some way to avenge his wife? However, the story line does not follow this premise. Is this story about a grieving widower and how he deals with the death of his wife? Is it about mental illnes? How can an intelligent, educated man, with as much insight into his marriage as he seems to have had not figure out immediately what brought about his wife's demise?? With the information that he reveals about Lexy, it should have been an open and shut case!I felt the ordeal with the dogs to be gratuitous and in poor taste. Lorelie never should have been put through all that misery.Parkhurst does have a tremendous immagination and the story was well written. Maybe the next attempt will be more believable.A disappointing read!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend who knows about my love of the noble Rhodesian Ridgeback (I rescued mine 4 years ago). While the author starts with a compelling premise, by the middle of the novel I had no feelings at all for the outlandish Lexy. Her husband, Paul, has the patience of saint but he's also a poorly drawn character with little substance. The star of the book is Lorelei, and Parkhurst does a great job of capturing the idiosyncrasies of this loyal breed. Naturally I'm biased, but the book cruises only when Lorelei makes an appearance, or when she's being invoked. There are whole sections that would bring tears to any Ridgeback owner's eyes, and probably to any dog lover's."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"My wife and I enjoyed this interesting read about love and grief.

The family dog, Lorelei, was the only witness to the tragedy. All indications point to an accidental fall, but Paul, the bereft husband can't rid himself of the impression that his wife, Lexy, left clues about what really happened. Paul, risking seeming unhinged to his linguist colleagues, but desperate to know the truth, embarks on a quest to teach his dog to communicate. \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" explores the sometimes-troubled relationship between Paul and Lexy, and the sense of incompleteness and unworthiness that drives them. There are hints of dark forces at work, including a gruesome (and improbable) subtext about a group of evil dognappers. An interesting read, with fairly complex characters and situations."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I majored in Linguistics, so after reading the premise of this novel, and discovering the main character was a Linguist, I of course had to read it. Well it turns out that there's not much about linguistics in this novel, but it was still a very good read.Paul Iverson falls for Lexy pretty quickly. Having been married before, he doesn't think she'll be interested in him, but he decides that whimsical artist Lexy is for him. And surprisingly, she likes him back. So when one fateful day, he comes home to find police in his home and Lexy dead in the backyard, having fallen from an apple tree, his world is set into chaos. But there's little things changed about the house that he notices and it leads him to believe that there was more to her fall than he thought. But the only witness was their dog Lorelei, and she can't tell him what happened, at least not right now when he hasn't begun to teach her to speak to him.Paul is a pretty tragic character. You can see his mind working through the grief and even the grief making him change and do things he might not consider doing otherwise. It's very realistic. He also shows an amazing amount of patience with Lexy and it actually restores my faith in humanity a little more to know there are people out there that accept their significant others for who they are. Granted this is a character in a book, but I'm sure there are real life people like him out there. Lexy, I found very selfish. Even though we only really view her through Paul's memories she was kind of manic and it just really instilled how much patience he actually had. There are other side characters in this book, but none I really connected to; it was just Paul and the dog Lorelei for the most of it. And that was fine, they were all that was needed to tell the story.The whole plot was the mystery of Lexy's death, but I think that it also included the emotions and grieving process Paul was going through. And for the most part it was realistic, a person that upset would want to find out what happened, even if it means that he wants to teach his dog to talk. Desperation makes people do strange things. I should note that there are some tough subjects in this book; suicide, animal cruelty, violence. And the animal cruelty is sad and sometimes described vividly, it was hard to stomach the thought of it. But the overall story was well told and it definitely made you feel something as you were reading it.I would read more by this author. This book, while sad, was very well written and explored a lot of emotions.The Dogs of BabelCopyright 2003261 pagesReview by M.

Mind you he was no innocent either....he had some responsibility with at least one of their heated exchanges.She was certainly a character with many facets. I tend to agree that she likely took the plunge because she found herself pregnant & couldn't cope.The book was a fairly easy read & only got a bit bogged down towards the end."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I read this book when it was first released. It was the most unusual story I have ever read, very poignant and left a permanent impression. It was a story of a man, haunted by loss, and determined to get to the bottom of that loss in a very unusual way that causes him to be suspect by his stuffy professional colleagues. The story of the loss of his wife, via peeling away of multiple onion-skinned layers by a very fascinating and unusual process involving their sweet dog, is one adventure that will tear at your heart and leave an impression for life. This book reminded me of how involved I was with the characters in Deep End of the Ocean.

A unique take on a tragic love story with a sub-plot diversion. Very well written, very introspective. Narrator and main character Paul was very well developed, so well that I could imagine him as a real person. I think I appreciated that he was flawed but not so flawed that he became a caricature. He stayed very believable and very accessible. A recommended read during a trip or your summer vacation."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"We sleep, we eat, we laugh, we play, we fight and we cry and through all of that our pets stand by us. This is the case with Lorelei, Paul Iverson's dog who first belonged to his wife Lexy. Lorelei alert neighbors to Lexy's plunge to her death from the apple tree in the back yard. Paul who is a linguistics professor, turns to Lorelei in his grief and wonders if perhaps if she can tell him how and why Lexy died. This is the premise that drew me to The Dogs of Babel by Carolyn Parkhurst.Those of us with pets understand the special place in a family which they hold and often wonder what secrets they might have to share with us. Paul lost in his grief hopes that he can teach Lorelei some means of communication so he can understand the futile death of his wife. He explains that canine communication is not unheard of and gives scholarly examples of its occurrence. How can one not pull for Paul and his success with Lorelei no matter how futile.Parkhurst does an excellent job in fleshing out the dead Lexy and making the reader care for her. Lexy is a spontaneous, creative and fun-loving woman of 35 who makes masks for a living. The reader easily understands how the divorced middle aged Paul could fall in love with her, but we discover she has a darker side. She is hot tempered and mercurial. As a teenager Lexy first pulled out her hair and then shaved her head and tattooed it with Medusa snakes.The story is told from Paul's perspective and while his voice did not always feel strongly masculine, I loved it:\\"Break open Lexy Ransome and you find omen and sexy and soar. Lost and rose. Yearn and near and anymore. See how i works? It doesn't bear thinking about. It couldn't be clearer. Only one letter away from remorse, and one letter away from answer.\\"I will give one word of warning for the animal lover, there was a moment in this book in which I had such an awful feeling of foreboding that I wasn't sure if I wanted to go on reading. I won't go into detail, because I do not want to spoil, but I am glad I had the fortitude to continue. It is indeed a wonderful story of man and beast and a story of love."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"It has been a few years since I read this book but I will read it again.

Cried for what seemed like hours. I was drawn FULLY into the story. If you are an animal-lover, especially dog-lover, you will be heartbroken at times. The writing is good...the author's description of what Lexy is going through, emotionally, is right on. I thought the \\"underground dog story\\" added a dash of intrigue. A must read, but definitely not your average \\"Susie Sunshine\\" kind of novel."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book is essentially about a man dealing with grief over his wife's death, and in many ways, over his wife's life. I've heard people complain about the writing style, but I found it enhanced the feel of the book and the point the author was making. It's very conversational, which makes it more powerful. I think Carolyn Parkhurst does a nice job of dealing with a heavy subject without making the book overly heavy - it is effective, but since the main plot revolves around a dog, it brings it to a manageable weight on your mind.I recommend it."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Women write books about staying, surviving, recreating, and men write books about going, exploring, war. In general, when men try to write as women, they write about women on journeys, and when women try to write as men, they write about men in domestic settings. I know there are exceptions, but this novel is not one of them.This is a very domestic novel about a man at home, trying to reconstruct what's left after his wife dies. The language crosses from poetic to florid a few times, especially considering that we are supposed to be reading a man's thoughts (an example would be his thoughts on packing for New Orleans, which verge right on romance novel). Still I found this book haunting and beautiful. Poetic wordplay is scattered throughout.Reviewers complaining about the \\"bizarre subplots\\" seem to have missed a crucial aspect of the book's message. There's a larger point in this book about prying into secrets and how destructive that can be. The main character tries to open up the secrets of language, of artistic inspiration, of private pain, and of love. He tries to make creatures speak in languages they don't know, rather than listening to what they can say, with saddening results.Lorelei, the Rhodesian Ridgeback, is a great character, who is, well, a dog, not a person. I enjoyed getting to know her. But one part of this book is so sad I could hardly stand it. If you're a dog lover, beware."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I admit that the cover art---the one with the mask---is what first drew me to this book. Next was the title: The Dogs of Babel. I love dogs, and the Tower of Babel story (as well as the idea of language) has always intrigued me. Together, the cover and title promise wonder and discovery, sensations which are delivered in full throughout the text.While some parts of the plot are less-than-believable, the storyline keeps the reader moving forward as the main character struggles not to slide backward. The dog, Lorelei, is perhaps the sturdiest character. Lexy's unpredictable and whimsical character is especially fascinating, partly because many aspects of her reside within me.This book has its ups-and-downs, both in writing style and in the plot. Altogether, it impresses a lasting indentation upon the reader's mind---it certainly left me contemplating for days after I closed the back cover."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"\\"The Dogs of Babel\\" is a very good novel about grief and the mystery that is at the heart of many love stories. How well do we really know those we love? The narrator, Paul, loses his wife, Lexy, in what appears at first to be a freak accident, a fall from an apple tree in the back yard. Paul isn't sure how or why Lexy died, so he becomes obsessed with what their dog, Lorelei, might remember of the incident. What follows is about as unconventional a plot as I've ever read... Paul becomes convinced he can teach Lorelei to talk and tell what happened that day.The story bears a mild resemblance to \\"The Accidental Tourist\\" which is also a story of lonely man in grief and his relationship with his dog. But where \\"Accidental\\" was a whimsical love story, \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" is a darker and more mysterious tale. There is an additional subplot that may disturb some dog lovers, which reads as if it is based on a real life case. I don't know that it is. I had never heard of it before reading this.Overall, this is an engrossing novel with many things going for it."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This novel, the story of an intelligent and organized man coping with the loss of his delightfully chaotic, emotionally unbalanced wife, is amazing. Although its quirky plot - a linguistics professor trying to teach his dog to talk so she can tell the truth, which only she witnessed, about his wife's death - takes a number of improbable turns, these events are interspersed with the narrator's recollections of his wife and the progress of his mourning, and the emotional weight of the story is strong enough to carry the diversions of its twists. The wife's character is beautifully rendered in a series of flashbacks, and although the story is told entirely through her husband's eyes the author succeeds in a believable and three-dimensional portrait.\\"Dogs of Babel\\" is a short novel, and much is considered that is not fully explored. The place of animals and pets in their human companions' lives, language and its imprecision, what it means to know somebody. As a whole the novel seems to be about the impossibility of barrierless communication with another being, no matter how proximate, as portrayed literally through the narrator's failed attempts to teach his dog to speak and symbolically through his imperfect understanding of his wife. The book's ending shrinks from this a bit, resorting instead to the sort of acceptance-and-moving-on jargon typical of grief stories, and that is disappointing.Although this timid ending dilutes the book's power, that may be a mercy. The author's writing is so beautiful, her subject so inherently tragic, and her characters so powerfully drawn, that the story is almost unbearably intense. I read it in an attenuated manner, in a series of sitting in a crowded coffee shop over a period of two weeks, amidst many other distractions; still, in the final sixty or so pages, I was twice moved to tears. Not because I was moved by the novel's outcome - the plot, bizarre as it sometimes seems, is not central to the story - but because the sense of the novel, its situation and its eloquence, the powerlessness of the narrator and the heartbreaking persona of his dead wife, were so tragic, and so beautiful, and so true."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I loved this book. I picked it up on a bargain table of books at Walmart. The premise sounded very interesting and it was only $6. The first paragraph had me hooked so I bought it.I thought I'd read a few pages shortly after bringing it home. Well, I couldn't stop reading. I wanted to slow down and not read it so fast because it was so well written....but I couldn't help myself. I found myself crying, sobbing out loud...much to the confusion of my three dogs who lay beside me while I read it. I have dealt with very painful loss in my life and this book describes the feelings experienced very very well. The compulsion of the living to try to solve the reason for the death. The dreams of the living of the dead person. It was all very very true.This book is similar in feeling to \\"The Lovely Bones\\" which I have to say is a perfect book. This book \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" is not as perfect at \\"The Lovely Bones\\" But it gets so many things right, you can forgive any faults.So much of this book is so compelling and heartbreaking. Well, I stayed up till 3:30a.m. reading the book in five hours. I could not put it down and was very tired for work the next day because of it.I do think that the Lexy character is not as likeable as you wish she would be and you never get a good explanation as to why she had the emotional problems she had but then there are many men in love with women just like her....constant drama. So it is very believable that he loves her so much even though she is high maintenance in some ways.I thought their first date, though a little sappy....rang very true...reminded me of first magic days with the important romances in my life before the real world and the real us come to light.I thought this was a brilliant first novel and I can't wait to read more by this author."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I have yet to be disappointed with the Today Show Book Club selections, Dogs of Babel is no exception.When I read the description of this book, I wondered what it would be like, would we be reading the dog's perspective? Would it have a bit of fantasy and would the dog really learn to talk? How would this author handle this premise, of a man whose wife has died and is now training his dog to speak?? Well, she actually handled it very well! She took a quirky premise and made it believable, understandable and real. She showed us a man grieving, who was willing to do anything to find out why his wife has died. She made you understand where he was coming from, and made you root for him a bit.I would definitely recommend this book to a friend.

The only reason I don't give it 4 stars was the whole underground dog-speech thing was a bit weird and didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the book. Other than that, though, I thought it was excellent."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Admittedly it's a clever concept to attempt communication with a dog that was the only eyewitness to its owner's death. I had the same thought during the O.J. Simpson and Lacy Peterson trials: if only the dogs could talk, they could reveal the identities of the murderers. In this instance, it's widower Paul who decides to teach his dog Lorelei to speak. Lorelei was the only one present when Paul's wife died, and he has a compelling need to know if her death was accidental or a suicide.I expected the story would be more of a forensic mystery with some actual scientific proof of a dog providing the solution. Instead, it is largely Paul's memoir of his marriage to Lexy, the love of his life despite her emotional highs and lows. As I progressed through the book I couldn't help thinking that if Lexy had received some treatment for depression or bi-polar disorder, there would have been no story to tell. However, this is not a pragmatic read but more of a fairy tale. The story is dense with symbolism involving masks, dreams, death, fables, mythology, and exquisite visual descriptions. All are testaments to the author's creativity and imagination.As a memoir, it is by necessity written in first person past tense which lends the story a slightly stagnant quality. However, the story is stimulated by an unusual twist when Paul, desperate with grief and willing to try anything, attends a meeting of the Cerberus Society. It turns out to be a group of malevolent men who perform unspeakable scientific experiments on dogs to get them to speak garbled sounds - hence the title, \\"The Dogs of Babel\\". This portion of the story has dramatic tension and really creates a sense of apprehension about the outcome.The story ultimately leads to the resolution of Paul's grief, as he progresses through the stages of mourning: shock, disbelief, grief, anger, and acceptance. Through it all Lorelei, a beautiful Rhodesian Ridgeback, demonstrates that love can be expressed in many ways."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is one of the only books that I have ever read that made me cry... several times, in fact.

Carolyn Parkhurst does a wonderful job of making you care for Paul Iverson, a linguistics professor who's wife died when she fell from an apple tree. Paul Iverson reminds me of a neighbor or good friend, a person everyone knows. Paul believes his wife, Lexy, has alterior motives for climbing the apple tree and so tries to get his dog to talk, hoping she can decribe Lexy's last few hours. Throughout the novel you find yourself rooting for Paul to succeed and teach his dog to communicate as well as overcome his grief. I would strongly recommend everyone even slightly interested in this book read it, because it will draw you in. (The short chapters won't hurt either.)"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Like The Lovely Bones, this work tackles the challenge of turning devastating loss into life-affirming resolve. The main character, Paul, seeks to understand what caused his wife's death. Did she climb their apple tree and fall accidentally, or did she climb the tree to commit suicide? There was one witness only, their dog Lorelei.We follow Paul's efforts to teach his dog to talk. If he can succeed, then his pet can help him make sense of the incongruous details of his wife's death. He takes a sabbatical from teaching linguistics, triggering concern and taunts in equal measure from colleagues. He then seeks help from others who have tackled the same challenge. These others, however, have surgically altered the jaws and throats of dogs. While Paul has no intention of such inhumane treatment, he is desperate. Fortunately, Paul pulls back soon enough to save Lorelei.Without divulging more of the story, I would like to say that I recommend this book to anyone who liked The Lovely Bones, and anyone who understands that adversity strengthens us, and that such adversity can be rendered beautifully in literature.We watch a man struggle back through memory to the signposts of of his wife's illness. He shows us that she suffered from unpredictable waves of depression and an unusual interest in death. We also learn that the masks she crafted, often colorful and comic, are eerie represenations of the mask of cheer and hope she tried to wear. As he reaches a regrettable understanding, so do we.This is an impressive debut novel. Parkhurst's writing is smooth and graceful. She moves the story along gently and compassionately. She slowly reveals the mystery of Lexy's thinking. That we don't get a greater measure of understanding at the end is appropriate; Paul's wishes for more, too. He is forced to accept his wife's suicide, as are we, what she deemed an unavoidable sacrifice."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"First off, I am not what you would call a dog lover, that said you don't have to be one to love this book. This story is ultimately a love story and about lost love. It is also about a man's grief and his attempt at escaping that grief in an intellectual way. In the process of reading this we learn of Paul and Lexy his young wife who dies unexpectedly. Without giving away the story, I found that while I could relate to both characters I was particularly drawn to Lexy, the troubled and sensitive artist. In an attempt to do anything to rationally explain his wifes death, Paul's quest leads him to some rather irrational if not bizarre means of doing so. However along the way this takes us through the heartbreaking story of their meeting and falling in love and life together; one that is unusual and yet familiar. This in the end will lead him to some truths he has perhaps known all along and others he has forgotten. Your heart will ache for both of these people. In the end I found myself caring for and missing someone I had never known. It is truly good that someone can write something that make you feel so much."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The thoroughly original premise of this book drew me right in, and after that I couldn't put it down. As a shelter volunteer I often ask &quot;my&quot; dogs - &quot;What's your story?&quot; The idea that you could conceivably find out by teaching a dog to talk is preposterious but oh-so intriguing, and in Paul's situation attempting it seems utterly necessary.Like others, I did find the Lexy character somewhat unfleshed, but I think those readers who condemn Lexy for being unpleasant are missing the author's point, which is, mental illness can be subversive and yet comprehensive. Paul is wholeheartedly committed before he begins to realize something is very wrong, and by then he is reluctant to believe it for fear of what that means. In the end, Paul's somewhat desperate love for Lexy was enough for me to feel affection for her too, despite the faults that make her seem a poor risk for love. There are people like this in our own lives.I'm a bit perplexed by the &quot;animal abuse&quot; comments. There are some graphic scenes and descriptions of dogs being abused, but animal abuse (and the resons behind it) shouldn't be a taboo subject for an author just because it makes the reader uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I look forward to other books by Carolyn Parkhurst. I am hooked for she is an amazing new talent. Her writing is so authoratative and no-nonsense while at the same time being sensitive and poignant.Paul Iverson has lost his beloved wife, Lexy in an apparent accident. Their dog Lorelei was the only witness; so being a linguist by trade, Paul is desperate to teach the dog to talk, or at least communicate with him more effectively so that he can make sense of the strange &quot;clues&quot; that Lexy left him. I don't believe this novel is a true mystery, although it is continuously surprising and darkly haunting. It is a novel that most accurately describes the facets of love and grief. At it's core, this beautiful story is about finding meaning and it tells us that we are not always what we seem, that we are masked from one another, even from the ones we love the most. Perhaps that is where the mystery of this story lies.I read this book over the weekend in two large sittings. Parts of it were disturbing, but also very insightful and wise. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"If you read the reviews of this book, you might be forgiven for thinking you'll get a laugh out of it. I mean, come on! A man trying to teach his dog to talk so the dog can tell him what really happened the day his wife died of a freak accident. Sounds more like a fairy tale, right? Wrong. It's a morality play, a story that probes the deepest recesses of grief, marriage, relationships, and all that lies beneath the surface of the ties that bind.Don't miss this spectacular debut novel. In fact, buy a signed first edition; it'll be worth something 20 years from now."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I just finished this book which I found to be an absolute page turner after chapter 2. At first I was a little worried that this was not going to be what I had anticipated but once I got into the story, I couldn't put it down. It's primarily about grief and working through the grief process but we have a front row seat to the workings inside the heart and mind of someone who has experienced a devestating loss. I have been there so I could strongly relate to what this man was going through. I found it extremely touching and loving but with a feeling of mystery that just keeps you wanting to know how things will turn out. Relationships and life are just not easy but the process of growth is well developed in this book. It's a book that will stay with me for sometime. Thank you Carolyn for sharing it with us."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book is wonderful. I read it in one sitting. I couldn't put it down--not because it's a thrilling page-turner--but because it's so real. It paints an accurate, if ugly, picture of grief and depression. It's also well-written; the author's use of short chapters allievates the density of the topic and makes it an easy read. I've seen lots of criticism, in various reviews, of the plot--specifically the introduction of an animal cruelty group. In my opinion, however, that plot incident shows the true madness of grief--a grieving person often does things that make little sense to others to others, and as the narrator says, never EVER judge someone's grief, and never take away what the grieving person needs to get through. Give this book a chance. It doesn't make grief pretty as some books, including a New York Times Bestseller, \\"Good Grief\\" (by Lolly Winston) does. Grief isn't pretty. Depression isn't pretty. It's strange and ugly and this book shows it in all its glory."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I liked the book.There are lots of people who hide behind masks - in fact most of us do. Lexi was beautiful, creative, fun, talented, loving - that was her 99% of the time mask. But it wasn't really a \\"put-on\\" mask; it was the really her most of the time mask. Once in awhile another part of her, a hidden part, peeked out. It was a part of her that she did not like, a part that she could not control.Paul chose to ignore the ugly mask that Lexi would put on from time to time. He loved her every day mask too much.This was a real life kind of story. We all have masks. The people we love have masks. The question the story sets before is, how do we deal with our own masks and those of the ones we love?"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel offers a very original plot and the character development is remarkable. I agree with amazon's review that the events in the 2nd half of the book are so startling that you stop sympathizing with both Lexie and Paul. The metaphor of how impossible it is to try to play God is very well sculpted. I believe that most people would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"It's kind of sad that the most vivid scenes of this novel are set in Disney World, but &quot;Dogs of Babel&quot; is a moving and compelling story nonetheless. Parkhurst makes little effort to make her characters realistic or ground this novel in a sense of place, but her expert plotting and pacing had me burning through pages. She also crafts an idealized and poignant love affair that captures the imagination yet seems doomed from the very first. A parallel plot on teaching dogs to talk adds to the dreamlike and moving atmosphere. Recommended as a speedy and deftly written summer read."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Parkhurst's debut is a stunner, and I cried all the way on a flight home from Europe as I read it. Yes, the premise is weird--a linguistics professor tries to teach his dog to talk so he can unravel the mystery of his wife's death. Paul is a normal guy who married a lovely, passionate, but ultimately disturbed young woman, and the tale of their marriage and Lexy's struggle with her demons is romantic and painful at the same time.Paul's own descent into isolation and craziness after Lexy's death is scary. His grief is so real, and the scene where he sends Lorelai, the dog, into a frenzy of searching when he cries &quot;Find Lexy&quot; is painful to read. Told from his point of view, Paul's actions seem almost logical, and it is only when Paul gets a rare visit from a friend and we see him through another's eyes do we realize how unbalanced he's become. Things take an unreal turn when Paul gets mixed up with a group of men who seem to be pursuing the same goal Paul is, and dog lovers will cringe at what happens to Lorelai.Ultimately, this is a love story, and a wonderful one. I hope we hear from Parkhurst again soon."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Wonderful, takes you into Paul's love and grief. I read this book in hours and am glad I spend the time doing so."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel is a tremendously moving book, for those who love dogs and appreciate a degree of fantasy. This book tells parallel stories. Narrated by Paul, who lost his wife, we watch his grieving process at the same time we see Lorelei's (the dog) life as defined by those who care for her. Lorelei's expressions of grief for the loss of her mistress are akin to that of a small child, and provide some of the most poignant moments of the book.Several readers complain that the ostensible plot,'teaching a dog to talk',is ridiculous. A few are put off by Lexy's character and the fortuneteller/magical aspect of the book, complaining that they are &quot;cliched&quot;. This book, however, is not meant to be read literally. It is a book of the heart, not logic. For me, this book's combination of reality and fantasy makes a compelling story."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I had this book recommended to me as a powerful record of the problems faced by a person who is living with someone who is depressed. This triggered my enthusiasm for reading the book because I have some experience with depression - although I am not myself depressed. But the book is not really about depression at all. In fact the depressed person is dead right at the outset of the novel and we only learn about them through the memories of the grieving partner. But these memories are fragile uncertain things, and as he gets closer and closer in his memories to the day of death he becomes more and more confused and doubtful. What has he missed? What signs did he not see?So this book is not about depression - about its signs, about indicators, about failure to see, about failing management.....This book is about grief and grieving - about how unsettled the grieving person can be - perhaps even mad to a degree. It is a wonderfully inventive book but many of the steps taken by the grieving person I could not myself imagine taking - but then I have yet to grieve in this way so maybe I should not be so sure. I also think that the writing is far superior in the telling of troubled times - so many writers seem to struggle with their descriptions and explanations of good times."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Not quite the story that book jacket describes, The Dogs of Babel is still a fantastic story. It's more about the life of the two lovers before the wife dies, but the simple complexity of their relationship is touching. The end of almost every chapter made it impossible not to turn the page and keep going. This is one of my new favorite books."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I'll admit that the premise of this book sounds silly. Some weirdo Linguist sets out to teach his dog to talk so it can tell him if his wife's death was a suicide or not. Is he crazy? Desperate?What I really loved about this book was the way things were written. This was good writing, and I really liked how the author put in all of these little whimsical incidents in the relationship between Paul and his wife Lexy that really showed that they loved eachother and were a good fit. I think that without those, Paul would be just another grieving widower, and Lexy would be a crazy woman who jumped to her death from a tree. By knowing all of the little things these two went through and did for eachother, it made their relationship something special, and so I felt for Paul and Lexy more than I would have if the author didn't do such a good job of portraying them as two people with a deep (a little bit odd yes,) love. I really wanted Paul to find out the truth, poor guy.I also liked the twists in this book, there are only a few chapters left and I was like &quot;What's going to happen next?&quot; From the very dark to the light, to the plain weird, Parkhurst has constructed a story that will not leave you bored.As for the animal abuse issues, I do think that they were very graphic and disturbing. But WITHOUT them I don't think this book would have the weight that it does. I don't think this book would make its readers feel. The dark side of animal linguists that Paul goes in to are an example of how desperate he really is.The only thing I wasn't clear about was the book's title. So that bugs me a little that I can't make the connection there, but anyway I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I enjoyed every page of this book. It is a tale of grief and how one man copes in the aftermath of his wife's rather mysterious death. From the premise-an educated linguist attempts to teach his dog, the only witness to his wife's demise, to speak in order to explain to him how it happened-one might assume it's a comedy. It is anything but. It is a tragic love story, the outcome of which we know from page one, but the author cleverly allows the story of this doomed relationship to unfold so that we fall in love with the main characters: Paul the husband/linguist, Lexi the wife/mask artist and Loralei, the Rhodesian Ridgeback and true hero.While his friends and colleagues think Paul is crazy, and to some degree he is, the reader has the benefit of knowing that he is, in actual fact, temporarily consumed with his grief. I think reading this story helped me to understand how each person who grieves over the death of a loved one does so in his or her own way. We want to protect and we can't help but judge, but well, we're all flawed. Who is to say how we would react to the death of our dearly beloved and to what means we'd go to have unanswerable questions answered?I highly recommend this book. In addition to outstanding storytelling, the writing is tight and very readable. Five Stars.From the author of \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life,\\" McKenna Publishing Group"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel is one of the most emotionally riveting books in recent memory. Don't be put off by the quirky pretense of the talking dog; this book is about never really knowing someone despite believing the opposite. A difficult read in terms of gut wrenching content but well worth the angst. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The point of this book is to find out whether or not the wife's fall from a tree was accidental or suicidal. It is only at the very end that we're told that the husband knew two EXTREMELY important facts from the very beginning that were never shared with the audience. Had we known these facts when the husband did, there would be no mystery, and absolutely no story of any kind. It was an extremely manipulative thing to do and cheapened the entire story."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"When I first began reading this book I couldn't put it down. I fell in love with the characters and with the concept, with the perspective and the author's descriptions, and I felt as if I knew these characters and could almost live vicariously through them. If I had only read the first 90 or so pages of this book I certainly would have given it five stars, despite the all-too-perfect romance (but hey, they were only married a few years so I figure their passion could stay pretty fresh) and the obviousness that a woman, not a man, had created this story (but I do like sensitive men, so...).Then I started reading further and Parkhurst inserted the cheap-shot plot bunnies. The secret society. What was a captivating, realistic story turned into an absurd, overly simplistic plot reminiscent of R.L. Stine's children's books. I may have been able to stomach this had the character of Remo and the other members of the Cerberus Society been portrayed as more than mere stereotypes, or if the story hadn't suddenly completely veered into a different direction. But there was almost no set-up. Paul introduces some interesting history and then suddenly delves into it when he gets a response from Hollis, who somehow trusts him from a one-paragraph letter. And then the part where they revealed that Lorelei had escaped from them and there stole her...well, it was just too much. Not to mention it wasn't all that necessary to further the plot.I can accept that Paul's discovery of the true nature of Lexy's death had little to do with Lorelei at all, even though Parkhurst set up the book to revolve around him teaching her to speak and the book was advertised as such. I can accept that she strayed from that plot often to tell Paul and Lexy's love story, which I actually enjoyed, mostly. I can almost accept the mini-twist that Lady Arabelle divulged to Paul which I guessed she would put in after the first few pages but prayed she wouldn't. That was all okay, for a first-time author. I cannot accept that, in order to make this book \\"novel-length\\" or come to some \\"acceptable\\" conclusion, she threw in an absurd plot with completely undeveloped characters as a sort of deus-ex-machina (although it wasn't, but I can't really come up with another term to describe it) in order to get Paul to find out the true nature of dog speech and the little phrase on Lorelei's collar. Parkhurst could have cut this part out and done much better. Hey, there's nothing wrong with a 150-page book if it's good.After the middle, when the plot began to wind down, it resumed much of its original sentiment and I began to accept it again, but it wasn't as compelling as the first part, and I was disappointed that Parkhurst again resorted to the unrealistic \\"message from the beyond the grave\\" plot bunny. However, the first and last part combined would have gotten four stars. I give this book three stars because of the extremely weak and trite middle, which, had I read it alone, would have received only one or two stars.I really like the character of Paul. I like the character of Lorelei, and I realize it's probably pretty hard to make readers fall in love with a non-speaking animal. I liked Lexy, too. Parkhurst has demonstrated her ability to construct wonderful characters that sweep the reader away into a captivating story. She just needs to realize that characters are enough, and she doesn't need to throw so much plot in their for readers to enjoy the story."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I finished rather quickly and I am a very slow reader. There are some things in the book that were a little disturbing as a dog lover, but it flowed with the story. I thought this book was very moving and I agree with another reviewer that the author did such a great job writing in the view of a man. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I had really high hopes for this book and there is a lot going for it. I enjoyed the writing style very much and it was a page turner. The problem was turning to the last chapter or two. What was initially a very engaging story with a unique premise got bogged down into absurdity. I won't give anything away, but the manner in which the character discovers how his wife died was so contrived it completely ruined the book for me, and then to assume that he &quot;discovers&quot; the manner of her death from such a contrivance made me re-read that page a few times to see if I missed something. Promising start, a ridiculous ending."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"After all the rave reviews of this book, I could hardly wait to read it. Some reviewers had even compared the novel to \\"The Lovely Bones\\", which was, I thought, truly a literary delight. I was so very disappointed!The beginning of the novel is a bit strange, but promising. A learned linguistics professor who takes a sabbatical in order to teach his dog to talk? The premise stretches the \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" almost to the breaking point, but I persisted in hope of a terrific read.The purpose of the professor's experiment is to try to discover the details of his wife's death, to which only the dog was a witness. This must be where critics get the comparison to \\"The Lovely Bones\\"; both novels deal with the living trying to come to terms with a death. In my view, here is also where the comparison ends.Of course, Parkhurst doesn't waste our time with too many tales of talking dogs; the novel is really about Lexy, the professor's wife, and their marriage. A thread of interest to dog lovers is the dog's part in their lives together and their relationship. I found the characterization of the dog to be the most credible in the book, and this aspect was covered with depth, warmth and meaning.Lexy and Paul could have been be very complex characters. She is an artist with a history of depression; he, a \\"geek\\" with a bad marriage in his past. When they meet, ther possibilities for exploration of their pasts, their personalities, and their new relationship could have sucked the reader in and delighted him/her for many hours...had they been done well. As it is, the reader is left with a sense of having been cheated. Parkhurst has only skimmed the surface of the many possibilities here.Perhaps the implied likeness to \\"The Lovely Bones\\" spoiled it for me, but when I remember this novel, all I will recall is what was missing. For example, in \\"Bones\\", the deceased's passing is viewed from many aspects, as is her life. She describes scenes on earth from her perch in heaven, but shows the reader events, motives and personalities from varying points of view. One event will be probed by her father, another by her sister, still another that reveals the nature of her parents' marriage. Her own personality is revealed in many different ways; for instance, the ways she views heaven. One also has the gratification of some sense of resolution in \\"Bones\\". People come to terms with each other and with death.None of this happens in \\"Dogs of Babel\\". Everything is viewed only through the eyes of the geeky professor. While he does turn out to be a sympathetic character (I'd even like to get to know him), his viewpoint is very narrow. Where are Lexy's thoughts in all of this? Why didn't Parkhurst treat us to some depth of feeling and perspectives? Why not a chapter or two narrated by Paul's friends or colleagues, instead of the simple description of their behavior as told by Paul?By book's end, the only thing that is resolved is how Lexy died. We don't really know what went on inside her head. We never discover exactly why she died. Indeed, she is as much an enigma at the end of the novel as she was in the beginning, the only difference being that we now know a little bit (a very little bit) about her.Those who love dogs will love parts of this book. Those who love mysteries will love parts of it. If you like psychological studies of human behavior, your interest may be tweaked a bit. I can't imagine anyone who would enjoy this novel as a whole.Don't waste your money, or buy this one used."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I keep a reading journal - I rate the books I read on a scale of 1 - 10. I rated this book a 10. My friends and loved ones all consider me far too critical for my own good - that 10 space is a rarity in my journal.I dislike reviews that give away the plot - as many of the reviews of this book do.Read it.Go in blind.You will be glad that you did.Perhaps more engaging for creative people, and people who have experience with depression or depressive loved ones. Also strongly recommended to conscientious pet lovers."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The idea is unusual enough to intrigue me. But the book made me nauseated.

I felt like I was floating through this whimsical unraveling of a tragic love story. Then I hit an unexpected wall with the descriptions of animal abuse.Dog lovers will be drawn to this book and, for me, to read this section really upset me and I did not recover at the end. It was a jolt to the tone of the book; and didn't seem in character for the protagonist...without giving away the plot, there is one decision in particular that he made that seems ludicrious and you immediately know what will happen.This chapter detracted from what would have been a great novel. It turned me off the book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I cannot imagine jumping into a book without at first reading the inside flap/back page summary, so I hardly consider the one-star reviews for The Dogs of Babel to be legitimately expressed. Yes, the book is sad and at times undeniably morbid, but neither facets are, in and of themselves, reasons to downgrade a book. The novel counters sadness with love and joy and mystery, and the combination of all of these emotions is extremely powerful and, in my case, effective.Life is unfortunately unfair and rarely comes neatly packaged with the happy endings we've been raised on, and this novel reflects that beautifully. The book begins with a suicide and jumps around the event chronologically in the pages that follow, and so at no point was I suddenly surprised by some unexpected, depressing theme. The book was lush with tragedy and sadness, yet simultaneously it embodied a quirky, true love between a man, his wife and their dog that made me want nothing more than to be spontaneously surprised with a trip to Disneyworld. That's hardly a bad thing.A last note- Parkhurst does a damn good job at writing a dog character, and so I consider this worth reading if only for that. I was amazed at how easily I pictured Lorelei in my head, and how many of her small inclinations reminded me of my own puppy. It's quite a feat of writing in that aspect.-C"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"A lyrically-written novel that demands you suspend your disbelief at times. The reader is given the back story in haunting flash-back style. S/he learns how Paul and Lexy met, about their courtship and short married life and one pieces together the puzzle leading to Paul's tortured question: Did Lexy accidentally fall from the apple tree, or did she end her life purposely?With their beloved dog Lorelei as the lone witness to her fall, Paul, in his grief, tries to learn what really happened and end his torment. There are times ala _Mr Norell and Jonathan Strange_ or _The Stolen Child_ that you know you're dealing with fantasy, and just read on. Either you deal with that, or you put the book back on the shelf. But if you choose the latter, you miss a beautiful love story that deals with grief and those heartbreaking unanswered questions that survivors of suicide (or was it?) must confront on an unending basis.Scenes of dog mutilation greet the faint-hearted, but minimally. If this bothers you, skip those pages and rather learn the secrets Ms. Parkhurt liberally sprinkles into her lovely prose."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I recently bought my third copy of this book, because anyone I've loaned it to always seems to \\"misplace\\" it! The Dogs of Babel is firstly about a linguistics professor and widower who is trying to teach his dog speech to find out what happened the day she died. It ultimately is a wonderful story on love, relationships, and grief. It is told in a style that begs to be read out loud, and you can feel the author's love of language. Carolyn Parkhurst is a great storyteller and I would love to read more of her work."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"There are a lot of ways I could describe this book but as I but it back into the bookshelf after I finished I think I muttered the word \\"incredible\\" to myself three times. Based on the topic (i do love to read about dogs) but (maybe not about some of the other stuff) i would not normally have chosen this book. It starts quickly, and then build the character background. I am in love with Paul, the character. I read a review that it was hard to believe the storyteller was man, and I can see that, but remember that this is a well educated linguist, and he is very in love. The marriage of Lexy and Paul is new. Carolyn Parkhurst is a beautiful writer and the deep emotion and feeling of this book, surrounded by an entertaining and interesting story is amazing. There are moment you might think you are about to begin hating the characters and then she keeps them perfectly imperfect. I finished this book a few days ago and have not stopped thinking about it. I want to read it again right now. It's amazing.It's sad, but the language in which she writes is what I prefer, and the thoughts and feelings of the character Paul are relatable.

This book elicits emotion so real and raw that I have to remember I'm mourning over a fictional character! The dedication of Paul' quest to find out the truth of Lexy's death is a testament to true love. The plot seems a bit outlandish, but it's the story of one man's desparate search of answers to his wife's hidden world. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Yeah, yeah,yeah. Yada, yada, yada. Babel, babel,babel. We all know the story.

But since the dog can't talk to explain to Paul whether his wife's death was an accident or suicide, Paul tries to teach Lorelei to talk. But the onion, if peeled a bit more, tells of the way a husband goes about his own personal grieving process. Carolyn Parkhurst understands that we all have our own way of grieving, our own way of avoidance. And that is what this wonderful book is really about. Just might stay with you awhile, haunting you, after you read it. It is supposed to do that. That, I am sure, is why she wrote it. Very well written and a great, though odd premise, only to be wrapped up in a wonderful lesson."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is an amazing book and I've added it to my list of all-time favorites. It is funny, sweet and heartbreaking all at once.The three main characters are complex and quirky. Parkhurst's characterizations are full and 3-dimensional. She takes us on an introspective journey of mental illness and presents it so succinctly, and so matter-of-factly, that it's easy to see why the main character spirals into a madness of his own while trying to make sense out of the senseless death of his wife.

It was well written and I couldn't put it down. It's nice to read a book that is original and I found that I cared about the characters in the book. However, my book club decided that the ending didn't ring true. It's worth reading, though, especially if you are a dog lover."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book held my attention until around page 100. Until then, it was an intersting, somewhat plausible story, but once it got into talking dogs and the experiments on them, I thought, \\"This is too ridiculous!\\" It wasn't the concept so much as its execution. I almost gave up, but plodded through the next 30 pages or so, and then finished it because I wanted to see how it came out. This book got a lot of hype (which is why I got it), but I don't know why. It's mediocre, though a quick read. I did like how Parkhurst went back and forth, one chapter in the present, the next chapter in the past, and so on."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I just finished reading this book over the weekend. Granted, the overall plot was interesting enough to keep me reading until the very end. Perhaps, I thought the book would get MORE interesting as I read on. Much to my dismay, it didn't. For one thing, as many other reviewers have pointed out, there was little character development. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters...except maybe the poor dog, Lorelei. I found Lexy to be quite an annoying person and did not see HOW Paul would have wanted to be with someone like her to begin with. I thought the book was predictable and poorly executed. The author wrote in the voice of a man but with a heart of a woman. The relationship she imagined between the two characters seemed so unreal I couldn't connect with them. I guess I was hoping it would turn out to be another \\"Lovely Bones.\\" If you have to pick between this book or \\"Lovely Bones\\" and have not read either one, read \\"Lovely Bones.\\""},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Parkhurst's debut novel is INCREDIBLE.It's not just what she writes (an utterly engaging narrative in and of itself) but the way in which she does it. Each sentence is expertly crafted and this really works to elevate the tale.It's also dark - which makes it better still, lending the story a gritty realism most tales of grief and loss lack. It would have been so easy for this book to fall into melodramatic cliche, as Paul pined and cried for his dear lost Lexy. But he's gripped by a sort of madness that gives him a disturbing focus. He's sent places he has no business being (both literally and figuratively) and this makes the story both interesting and engaging.Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"There is an accident: a young married woman has fallen to her death. A husband is left alone to face this sudden and devastating loss, blindsided by the unexpected depths of his grief. Paul Iverson clings to the only witness of Lexy's last day on earth, their beloved Rhodesian Ridgeback, Lorelei.Driven to find answers, to unravel the mystery of Lexy's fatal plunge, Professor Iverson, a linguist, becomes obsessed with a plan to teach Lorelei to speak, so that she can finally tell him what happened. Requesting a sabbatical, Paul notes the distress and worry on his colleague's faces, but is unconcerned in his quest to obliterate all but his experiment. Gathering random bits of information, he scours the house for clues and makes lists, including one of all the books the couple has owned, anything to make sense of the senseless. He compiles stacks of literature, case studies of experiments where dogs have been surgically altered in an attempt to evoke canine speech. Unfortunately, all such experiments are inhumane and illegal, but Paul has no intention of resorting to such practices. He spends time with Lorelei, patiently \\"teaching\\" her the responses he wants.Of course, his experiment is a failure, as the dog is either unwilling or unable to perform. But, like anyone undergoing such a period of mourning, Paul may be forgiven this foolish attempt for emotional relief. Perusing the recent literature on dog-speak, Paul makes a somewhat suspicious contact. Desperate for more information, he attends a meeting of an unsavory group who perform experimental surgeries on dogs, supposedly with some real success. At the gathering of these uber-scientists, Paul is appalled that he could have been led so far astray as to find himself among these despicable men.With the comforting Lorelei beside him, Paul recalls the years of the marriage, the magical moments of Lexy's stunning conceptual artistry, her uniquely crafted masks, the imaginative tales she tells. Lexy loved fairy tales, mysterious phrases, one of her favorite quotes: \\"Had I known but yesterday/ what I know today/ I'd have taken out your two gray eyes/ and put in eyes of clay/ And had I known but yesterday/ you'd be no more my own/ I'd have taken out your heart of flesh/ and put in one of stone.\\" But there are many kinds of masks, and perhaps Lexy has hidden behind one as sensitive artist/wife.In contrast, there are infrequent, yet unnerving incidents, when Lexy exhibits unaccountable rage, as well as uncontrollable tears that leave her shattered and sobbing. There are stories of Lexy's troubled youth, her teenaged flirtation with suicide, an indication of the true pathology behind her behavior. This is a difficult and emotional journey for Paul, but once begun, he embarks upon a scrupulous evaluation of Lexy's precarious emotional landscape during the years of their marriage. Is there any message, any important detail he has overlooked? Paul's real dilemma: was the fall truly an accident, or did Lexy commit suicide?Parkhurst compassionately describes the early days of Iverson's grief and his impulsive project with Lorelei, her characters sympathetic. The companionable Lorelei is an endearing witness to Paul's struggle. As Paul Iverson navigates this unfamiliar territory with reluctance, his discoveries are touched with quiet grace and forgiveness, acceptance of the human frailties inherent in life. If, in those last days, Lexy has left a message for Paul, it cannot be found hidden among her emotional demons, past or present. Whatever the memories, Lexy's shining legacy to Paul, the message, is her endless capacity for joy and the daily expression of love. Luan Gaines/2003."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I read this book because of the book cover, name of the book, the name of the dog, and the premise that a linguist would try to teach a dog to talk. The book is a flashback into Paul's and Lexy's life prior to Lexy's suicide/death with Lorelei, the dog, acting as a fulcrum to the action of the story.I can't say I actually enjoyed the book. There is truly some beautiful and enjoyable imagery, especially the descriptions of Lorelei, the square eggs, and the various masks that Lexy makes. In addition, the vignettes in the book were not unbelievable- a little bizarre perhaps. Linguists have tried to determine whether animals are capable of developing language. I had crazy neighbors in a respectable little suburb in northern Illinois. The police closed down my neighborhood (even if they didn't mutilate animals). The psychic card readings were 'accurate'. When my father remarried, they drove to Florida on a whim one night. And, if you know anyone that has dealt with grief, it can devastate your life. So all of those things could happen.However, I could not stay engaged in this book. I put it down way and didn't pick it up for another 3 weeks and only after my brother in law made the following comment about Paul: \\"Well, maybe if he paid attention to his wife\\". The final turn off for me was after Paul 'lost' Lorelie, he did not frantically look for the dog. Anyone that has lost a pet they love combs the neighborhood looking for it. Where was Paul? In the house being morose and sad and still fixated on the why of Lexy's death.There is no cohesion to this book. It is choppy and Parkhurst cannot seem to settle on a style of writing. It is very clear from the beginning that Lexy is a CLINICALLY depressed person that should be on medication. Although Paul convinces us that he loves her and that they were in love, there were several times in the book where I kept asking myself why he wasn't suggesting therapy. He didn't take action with Lexy, and whereas he could of with Lorelie, he gave up on that too.If I'm asking questions like that about the book, I'm not enjoying it or buying into it conceptually."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"...I...bought this book because I am a huge fan of Anna Quindlen. After finishing the book, I also wondered why in the world Quindlen would recommend this novel. The characters are unsympathetic and unbelievable, particularly Lexy. Frankly, I found myself not caring that Lexy had died. My reaction to this book was totally different from Lovely Bones, another novel about death that Quindlen recommended. Read Lovely Bones instead."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Wow. I wish I'd read this when it first came out.As a science fiction scholar and as a lay scholar of linguistics, I was pleased to start reading what I thought was a work of \\"soft science fiction\\" -- that is, I thought the novel would focus primarily on the supremely wonderful idea of a linguist's teaching a dog to communicate, for crushingly sad reasons. That misunderstanding was what made me start to read the book.When I realized I was mistaken, I was too hooked, too emotionally involved, to stop reading.Let me be clear: I adore every scene in which Paul Iverson tries to teach the Rhodesian Ridgeback, Lorelei, to communicate. These scenes fill me with joy. Iverson (that is to say, Carolyn Parkhurst) has brilliant ideas, which, alas, are more suited to teaching another primate or a deaf child to speak. Lorelei's wonderfully doggie inability to understand what Paul tries to communicate is always delightful and exactly right.But the central, painful focus is the story of Paul's grief and guilt and search for redemption.Parkhurst provides genuinely scary moments, and lovely moments of loving, and I wept over all of them. In her word-jokes, in her stories about the creation of masks, in Paul's grieving yet exalted memories of his dead wife, I felt the touch of the numinous sublime, again and again.I wholeheartedly recommend it to ... well, to everyone. There truly is something for every reader in this marvellous novel.Thank you, Carolyn, belatedly, for giving me a wonderful gift, one which I will share with my loved ones this holiday season. I'm going to start buying several copies now.Fiona KelleghanLibrarian, University of Miamisometime Book Reviews Editor of the Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I read Parkhurst's latest novel, \\"Lost and Found,\\" first, and really enjoyed that book. So when a coworker let me borrow \\"Dogs of Babel,\\" I took it very willingly. This book is truly tremendous. It's as unique as any I have read in recent past. The story telling is engaging and keeps you involved with the characters. The narrator, a man, is so realistic that at times I forgot that the author is a female. I wanted to find out what happened at the end (or the beginning, as the book bounces from real time to flashback) but at the same time,didn't really want the story to end. A great read, I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book just blew me away. Such a joy to read - the narrative voice manages to hit a tone that is charming, a little oddball, but totally engaging. I don't think I've come across a book that pulled me in as effectively and completely since \\"Bel Canto\\". This despite (or perhaps because of?) aspects which are decidedly quirky. I read it in a single three-hour sitting, and just found it completely, totally satisfying.4.5 stars, really. The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is that I found one aspect of the plot a little too implausible for comfort."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Ah, where do I begin reviewing this book? Let me start by saying that this book is not about what it's promoted to be. It's marketed as a book about a grieving widower who tries to teach his dog, the sole witness to his late wife's death, to talk. And yes, this book is about that, but it is not solely about that.This novel is an intense exploration of one man's profound and painful experience of grief - especially when it's over a mysterious death. Did she die accidentally or did she kill herself? And why? It's heart-wrenching, suspenseful, and bitter-sweet, but also warm, and romantic.Paul and Lexy are almost quite opposites of each other. He is very reserved and conservative; she is spontaneous and quirky. The two of them genuinely fall in love, but Paul learns soon that Lexy's spontaneity has its dark side. And then one day, he returns home to discover his wife has died after falling from a tree.The plot is an intricately and meticulously woven narrative that culminates in a superficially shocking conclusion. I say 'superficially' because its conclusion reminds me a lot of the film, The Sixth Sense. Many viewers were wowed by the stunning revelation at the end, but when you look at the film a second time, all the clues to solve the mystery were in plain sight all along. Every single apparently insignificant detail played a part, and this role was right on the surface for us to see. This, however, does not detract from the power of its ending, and the meaning that this holds for Paul, and how he will now have to go on with his life.I recommend this wonderful book to anyone who is prepared to go on a journey of the innermost expressions of the soul. You will not regret it. Another reviewer said this is the kind of book that stays with you, and it's true. I encourage you to discover why."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"A college professor is on a mission to teach his dog to talk. He feels that if the dog could talk, it could tell him about the last day of his wife's life when she mysteriously fell from an apple tree.It sounds ridiculous, but Parkhurst makes you feel that the professor has at least some validity in his quest other than pure grief.I enjoyed the book very much and recommend it highly. It's intelligent and fun to read."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel was a very pleasant surprise for me. I was all set to put this book down following my &quot;90 pages&quot; rule. The very idea of a talking dog seemed ludicrous to me. Am I ever glad that I kept going! I thought Paul and Lexy certainly were not a match made in heaven. Lexy was a very selfish and odd character. I could not see Paul, in all his normalcy and kindness, being even remotely interested in her. Lexy's fascination with masks was even eerier. The entire premise of this book became clear to me about halfway through the book. Paul's desperation with his &quot;Lorelei Project&quot; was simply a reaching out to attempt to make sense of the senseless. In the midst of horrendous grief, we, as humans, will go to incredible (even laughable--as Paul's co-workers found it) lengths to find comfort and answers--even when there are none. Paul risked making a fool of himself and did not care--something I know I can relate to at times of loss. The Dogs of Babel is quite simply just a beautiful love story."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Why was this book compared to The Lovely Bones? I heard that and expected this book to be about someone from the afterlife trying to communicate back to the current people on earth. I guess whenever there is a best-seller or a popular movie, people think they can promote a new book or movie by claiming that it's the next Harry Potter, or the next Big Fat Greek Wedding.Anyway, after feeling misled and actually reading the book for what it was, it wasn't too bad. In fact, there was point where I was horrified at the thought of what would happen next in the story and that added some suspense for me. It was enjoyable to slowly get to know the wife via flashback and see that there was more to the story than initially laid out - I believe they call that How The Story Unfolds."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I'm in two minds about this book. I read it in just over a day; I couldn't put it down, but I also have serious reservations about a book with such graphic depictions of cruelty to animals. I know that the book was a work of fiction, and that the scenes depicted are never gratuitous, but I question whether the rather silly sub-plot of Wendell Hollis, the underground dog society, and Dog J was really all that essential to the story.Parkhurst has a nice, economical and elegant style, and her pacing is tight. When Paul returns home and finds that her wife has died under strange circumstances, we are plunged right into the mystery, and the tale unwinds quickly at a deft pace. Although, not central to the story, the outcome of Lexy's death, however, will come as no surprise to the reader. The real story is the astute observation of a relationship full of dysfunction, and a modern marriage that is unfortunately seems to be doomed by a lack of communication.This is also a story of grief and sadness, as we realize that Lexy's needs as a wife, and possibly as a mother will never be fulfilled, and that Paul will never be able to recapture the love that he felt for Lexy. And then there is gorgeous Lorelei, the real star of the story, and the character who possibly holds the key to Lexy's death. The story effectively jumps between the present, as Paul mourns and tries to come to terms with the death of his true love, and the past, as we witness their meeting, courtship and eventual marriage. During this time learn much about Lexy; she's spontaneous - particularly when she drags Paul off on a first date to Disney World lasting a week - and she's also an artist, a lover, and loyal to Lorelei and Paul, but she's also seems to be incredibly insecure and unhappy with the world.I had problems with some of the other plot twists involving Lady Arabelle, and a ridiculous subplot involving a ghost that Lexy is obsessed with in New Orleans. And I still don't know what is the true meaning of all the symbolism, or indeed whether there is actually meant to be any symbolism! Are the masks that Lexy perpetually paints a way of shutting out reality? Are they her method of communicating with Paul? Is her obsession with the death masks towards the end of the story, her cry for help? The story ends up being kind of vague and muddled as Parkhurst tries to cram so much into this story. Consequently, I found this book kind of disappointing - read The Dogs of Babel only if you want a fast and quick read.Michael"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I really liked this book; it's unique story, has a good pace and it really made me FEEL for these characters. I had a lump in my throat and a tightness in my chest through the last 1/2 of the book. Since Lexy dies right at the beginning, I didn't feel much since I was not invested in Lexy or Paul, but as the author flips back and forth between current time and flash backs I developed a real sense of the two characters and their relationship. I'm also a dog lover, so the fact that Lorelei had a large role didn't hurt either. I was a little skeptical when I found out that Paul was going to try and teach his dog to talk in order to find out what caused his wife's sudden death. However, after reading I started to really feel his deep grief and desparation to understand WHY his wife died - what happened during her last moments. The fact that he was trying to teach his dog to talk was so poignant. I thought this was a sweet, touching story although I didn't care for the dog-mutilation society part; I'm not sure it was really necessary. I definitely would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Like many others, I read this book with high hopes and great expectations. Then, I actually read it. I agree with many others that the writing style and pacing were very good, but the story structure completely undermined it, for me.

I couldn't agree more.I did enjoy that she chose Lorelei to be a Rhodesian Ridgeback (since we have one) - but a breed especially known for NOT barking!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel is simultaneously difficult and easy to read. Paul Iverson is mourning the death of his wife-somewhere in his soul, he knows she committed suicide, but his mind can only skirt around these thoughts. A linguistics scholar, Paul decides to teach his wife's dog, Lorelei, to speak. Lorelei was with Lexy, Paul's wife, the afternoon of her death, and Paul hopes Lorelei can tell him what happened.Paul's search takes him into a nether world of psychics and animal cruelty as he abandons all semblance of a normal life. In the end, Paul confirms to himself what he knew all along, and is able to begin to reclaim his life.\\"The Dogs of Babel\\" has some upsetting references to animal cruelty and Paul' extreme grief is open to the reader. This novel may not move you to tears while reading, but the sense of longing and mourning will stay with the reader for awhile."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I picked up this book based on what a reviewer said on the CBS Sunday Morning program. Unlike others here, I did laugh while reading this book. Several times. Out loud. I guess the absurdity hit me more than for others. It is basically about a guy trying to deal with his sudden loss. He does it in an absurd way. I loved the way he pieced together what had happened. I'll admit in isn't that emotionally deep and the dog mutilation stuff is disturbing, but it's just fiction. The oddness of the book reminded me of \\"The World According To Garp\\" by John Irving, which is one of my all time favorite books."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"When I first heard about this book's plot--bereaved professor tries to teach his dog, the sole eyewitness to his wife's suspicious death, to speak--I rolled my eyes, shook my head, tsked my tongue, and gyrated any other orifice that could show smug contempt. What a stupid premise, I supposed. Boy, was I wrong!THE DOGS OF BABEL is not light summer reading, rather it's like a swift, unexpected summer heat storm. It is fast, intense, relentless, and unabashedly refreshing.Its hero, Paul, is a kind man with an unenviable mission--a desperate need to become a real-life Dr. Dolittle ... Lieutenant Columbo. His hesitant, embarrassing, compulsive lessons with Lorelei, the Rhodesian Ridgeback, are never played for laughs, chuckles, or cheap theatrics. His self-conscious attempts to spark some kind of memory in Lorelei are a tribute to just how much his deceased wife, Lexy, meant to him, and to the faithful animal companion. It is a beautiful, befuddled attempt to bridge the gap between the here and the Hereafter.The story line is an exploration of just how far one man, indeed any mourner, will strive to recover a loved one, a lost memory, a destroyed future. It is a heart-wrenching blueprint of how grief can envelop and enervate even the most intelligent, most reasonable figure.The talking dog aspect is not just an attention grabber. The author's writing style is fetching (pardon the pun) and her imagination takes readers willing to follow her lead into the labyrinthes of an emotional and mental meltdown, plus into the corridors of a frightenting underground society of canine mutilators. It is truly terrifying and each sentence is anxiety-ridden.Coming out in the summer, with its hook being that a dog just might end up talking, this novel may attract starry-eyed fans of ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL. Reader, beware, though. This truly is BABE THE GALLANT PIG meets FIGHT CLUB. Not for the tender-hearted, but rather for the reader who is willing to have his or her soul touched, bruised, stomped on, regenerated, and ultimately restored.A great debut because it is so audacious, crazy, brilliant, overreaching, and finally human. Forget about the \\"man bites dog\\" or \\"dog walks into a bar\\" aspect, this is a novel that really is just that: novel. What a rare treat!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The plot is inane. The only sympathetic character is the dog. Lexy is a spoiled, selfish, egocentric fleabrain, incapable of concern for anyone else--neither her husband nor her unborn child. The husband is fumbling, inept, and downright stupid. I was not affected by his pain, his loss--only by his selfishness. The parts on dog abuse upset and angered me, especially the husband's part in exposing his own dog to the horrors of the underground &quot;research&quot; group. The plot is silly, the ending a foregone conclusion from the beginning. Apparently it did not occur to either the professor or his wife to get help for her problems. The novel is somewhat appropriately named--it is a dog and it is babble."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel is one of those rare books that has everything to offer: a suspenseful story that makes it a pageturner, beautiful writing that engages the mind, wonderful characters...

But I stumbled as Parkhurst fell (often comically) short of writing in a masculine voice. Paul Iverson, the narrator, is a very unconvincing man-in-mourning, and often unconvincing as a man at all, using descriptors like \\"prettily\\" and \\"lovely,\\" and so often saying things so decidedly feminine (\\"I sink into the memory as if it were a warm bath\\") that I could never get into the narrative itself. I had high hopes, but the Dogs of Babel failed to speak to me on any level.To read more reviews check out Void Magazine's website."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Parkhurst to me, evokes the feelings I have when I read such authors as Atwood, Hoffman or Coehlo. To me, a novel such as this is less about the beginning, middle and end and more about the words in between. Its in the little details. Lexy painting \\"I Love You\\" along the kitchen walls, which only glimmered in the morning sun for Paul to see. Paul and Lexy's first date... a wedding where everyone wore a mask she made.

He turns to the only witness: the couple's Rhodesian Ridgeback, Lorelei. He wants to teach Lorelei how to talk, and how to tell him what really happened the afternoon of his wife's death.The book explores one man's grieving process, and how he reacts to those around him. He becomes a joke at work, and begins a short correspondence with a prison inmate who succeeded in making a dog &quot;talk&quot;. These scenes were the most disturbing in the book, because as an animal lover, I found it extremely difficult to read. Thankfully, the scenes are short, and through the experience in the book, Paul realizes that he needs to center himself. It struck me that Paul's life and work focus on language and communication; yet, he and his wife could have solved a number of problems had they just communicated better with each other.Overall, this book is a great accomplishment. It is especially good when you read it with your dog at your side."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I can understand why THE DOGS OF BABEL is being compared to last year's hit THE LOVELY BONES. In it, the main character must deal with his wife's death and does so through the process of trying to teach his dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Lorelei, &quot;speak,&quot; as the dog was the last to see his wife, Lexie, alive. He hopes that Lorelei will someday be able to &quot;tell him&quot; how Lexie died. Throughout the novel, Parkhurst makes clear that it is not so much about teaching a dog to talk as it is about the difficult process of grief and the extremes people will go to to feel some sort of connection to the lost loved one, to feel some kind of closure to the event. One of the most important characters in the book is Lexie. Though not physically present, her spirit pervades the entire story. How did she die? Only Lorelei knows, and she's not talking. Or is she? Her husband must cope with Lexie's death and deal with loss, love, and healing throughout his journey to find the cause of Lexie's death. I'd recommend this book based on its premise: we all deal with grief in different ways and we all need a sense of closure to loss. In the end, the book left me with a tear in my eye and a greater understanding of the power of love."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Yes, as various reviewers have stated, this is an emotionally charged and interesting book.

I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Maybe it's because I am a dog lover, maybe not, but I found The Dogs of Babel to be an extraordinary story. Here's how it goes: Lorelei, the Rhodesian Ridgeback, being the only witness to his wife's fatal fall from an apple tree, Paul Iverson believes that if he can teach her to talk than he will discover whether it was truly an accident. As the story unfolds, you learn not only about the methods Paul tries in teaching Lorelei to talk (which are non-surgical, thank you), but also about the intense relationship that he and Lexy, his late wife, had.To shake things up more, there is a secret club of people, if you can call it that, who believe in surgically enabling a dog to speak. They perform grotesque surgeries, attempting to alter dogs' throats in order to allow them to speak. Unfortunately, many are killed during these horrible practices. For me the description about this club and the poor dogs involved was the most heartbreaking part, of course I am an animal lover, remember.As for this book being similar to The Lovely Bones, I did not find much evidence of that. And this didn't make The Dogs of Babel a disappointment to me at all. Overall I found the book to be a rich story about life after loss and the healing process, as well as how creully some people chose to treat animals for the &quot;benefit of science.&quot;"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"By now, you know the basic premise: Paul Iverson attempts to teach his dog how to speak, hoping the dog can tell him about his wife's death. Yes, it's an interesting concept. But the novel digs deeper than its gimmick, and does an admirable job of tracking Paul's healing psyche.Much of the book's strength, in my opinion, is built around dichotomies. Paul is a learned man, yet finds himself grasping at supernatural straws (talking dogs and telephone psychics). Paul is skilled at solving puzzles and riddles, yet he fails to put together (even as he narrates) the pieces that point to his wife's mental instability. Lexy, Paul's wife, is the central dichotomy: a manic-depressive who creates masks (the mask metaphor is used beautifully throughout the book).This novel will inevitably be compared to \\"The Lovely Bones\\" because of its subject matter. However, I don't think it suffers from this comparison; \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" packs emotional heft I found lacking in \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" and Parkhurst's writing is tighter than Sebold's.On the negative side, the book's second half doesn't have the same intensity as its first half. And, Parkhurst isn't 100% convincing as a male narrator: Paul's missing some testosterone in his thoughts and actions. Also, even though Parkhurst starts to paint Paul as something of a tongue-tied misfit afraid of social situations near the book's beginning, she tends to contradict that characterization: Paul is rather glib and witty throughout the story.Minor complaints, really. All in all, this book is a fine read--especially for a first novel. I'll look forward to future works by Ms. Parkhurst."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I had quite a different reaction to this book compared to other reviewers. Before the premise even revealed itself, I found the description of the romance corny -- along the lines of a bad movie on the Lifetime Channel.And, without giving too much away of the plot, let's just say I am an ear, nose, and throat surgeon and I can tell you that the author did absolutely no medical research for the veterinary/surgical portion of the book. The last straw was when one of the dogs supposedly had a laryngectomy (larynx removed) and had nothing more than a band-aid on its neck. Even if you ignore the fact that it takes 5 years of surgical residency to learn this procedure, once a larynx is removed a tracheostomy is required or the animal would not have an airway! Come on....put a modicum of effort into researching for your writing."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It held my interest from start to finish. And it wasn't one of those overly-sappy stories that play on your emotions. It shows what an otherwise healthy individual might do in the wake of grief. And it shows what an individual who is healthy enough to see that she is somewhat unhealthy might do when faced with a difficult decision regarding something that would effect others.I am a die-hard animal lover. Yes, the animal cruelty section was upsetting, but if you read the author's note in the back of the book, she does note that she realizes some might find it upsetting. It needed to be part of the story--to show how far down Paul could have gone because of his grief--but he stopped himself.This book had great symbolism, too."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I finished this book three days ago, and I still have strong feelings floating around because of it. The Dogs of Babel is an emotionally painful reading experience, and for me, one of the most intensely sad books I've ever encountered (but that's a good thing -- genuine emotion is hard to come by in this post-modern meta-fiction riddled contemporary literary period).You've probably read how this book is about a man, Paul Iverson, who is trying to teach his dog to tell him why his wife died in a fall ... but it's not a gimmicky book. It's about grieving, self-examination, love, and how complicated people and relationships can be. People complain that there are plot events that are unrealistic or far-fetched, but I'd contend that they are missing the point: this is the most emotionally honest book I've come across recently. As the reader learns more about Paul and his wife, he becomes more invested in Paul's plight, so much so that the pain is real and raw. If you want to feel for a character in a novel, then this book is certainly for you.The caveat, though, is that The Dogs of Babel is an intense experience, which may not be for you depending on your current circumstances. If I had recently experienced a loss, I doubt I could've gotten through it at all (at least without a breakdown). I'd also be careful if you're feeling emotionally fragile since I can't get it out of my head three days later with no end in sight for me (when was the last time a book hung around with you for some time after you finished it?)."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"5 stars&quot;The Dogs of Babel&quot; is about Paul Iverson, a linguist at a local university who meets and quickly marries a young artist named Lexy Ransome. She is everything to him- she brings light and color to his dull, academic life. The two have a seemingly happy and passionate marriage until one day Lexy mysteriously falls from a tree and is mortally injured. The only witness to the incident is the couple's dog, Lorelai and Paul, in his grief and desperation, decides he is going to make Lorelai communicate in order to reveal the secrets of his wife's last day. He abandons his friends, family, and career in order to work with Lorelai, and in doing so finds out much more (both about himself, Lexy, and the nature of desperate people) than he bargained for.When I read the premise for &quot;Dogs of Babel&quot; I had no idea how Carolyn Parkhurst was going to make it come together. But she did, and did so beautifully and tragically. Although the concept sounds bizarre, what it really does is provide a meaningful way for Paul to retell all the events and emotions of his marriage to Lexy.This is a wonderfully written book. The narrative weaves in and out of the past and present with no effort at all. Normally, I can't take stories of grief and loss too often because they make me fear for the fate of my own loves ones. But this was different- it's not a book about grief, or sadness, it's a book about the thing we do in desperation to move on from the pain. It's an honest story about the cruel secrets of human nature.Note: I must warn you- there are some situations dealing with animal abuse in the book. While Paul is doing research on the ability of animals to communicate, he runs into a bizarre underground group that is determined- in any way possible- to get dogs to speak. I am *very* sensitive to issues of animal neglect and abuse, and while it was hard for me to get through some of the brief passages in the book dealing with these topics, it was not enough to get me to put the book down or turn me off from it. But if you are sensitive to it, you should be aware it comes up in the book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Carolyn Parkhurst has a wonderful way of evoking scenes from the merest whispers of words. This may be by necessity, as the novel is framed as alternating chapters of approximately five pages each in which she follows her character Paul Iverson through flashbacks of his life with his wife, Lexy, and the sad present that finds Paul piecing together the mystery of how and why Lexy died. The brisk pacing and Parkhurst's faculty for creating vignettes that your mind fleshes out make this a quick and not altogether unsatisfying read.Lexy's character is certainly the most compelling, not the least because of her having died in the opening sentence. Lexy is complex in the most satisfying way, both laughter and sorrow, sunshine and darkness. Her appeal drives the novel, and we as readers wnat to know more about her. We, like Paul, want to unravel the mystery not only of her death, but of Lexy herself.Unfortunately, Paul himself seems more alive (and believeable) in the flashbacks with Lexy. Alone with their dog, Lorelei, in the absence of Lexy, Paul is not just a figure of grief, but a character who seems too much an inhabitant of the page. That is, the flashbacks seem to be a part of a world, a fictive reality where we believe the characters continue on after we stop reading about them. But the Paul of the present seems too much a writer's sketch, and the second half of the book is fraught with worse sins of writing.The passages about Wendell Hollis and the Cerberus Society are very nearly unreadable, and don't bear explanation here. The psychic, Lady Arabelle, is likewise an uncomfortable and ill-considered plot device. Not only do these two plot \\"twists\\" defy the reality Parkhurst so carefully crafted earlier in the novel, they threaten to highjack our interest in the story altogether. That they do not is perhaps partly due to the fact that we keep getting a glimpse of the past, of Lexy, and we forgive the author her indiscretions to work our way to the end with Paul.The end, ultimately, does not redeem these clunky plot contrivances, but it does offer a beautiful summation of Parkhurst's talents as author. The final paragraph is wondrous, and pulls together the the colorful metaphors of Lexy in a jewel of a moment.I wish Ms. Parkhurst would eschew the too obvious: Paul, a linguist, is married to Lexy (punning of the Greek \\"lexikos,\\" pertaining to words, as well as the library of Alexandria of antiquity); Lorelei, the siren of Germanic myth, is the mute witness of Lexy's death that Paul is obsessed with; Lexy's rearrangement of books, we know well in advance, will be some sort of code; even the apple tree itself, with overtones of Eden.The idea that Lexy fell from an apple tree at once sets the reader on notice that he must put aside credulity to a certain degree; this is both liberating for the author and a dangerous high-wire act to attempt. Likewise, the idea that Lorelei might \\"speak\\" to Paul is a trail of breadcrumbs that could lead to some dark woods. But the reader can embrace those parameters. Had the novel not over-reached its plot in the second half, this could have been a 4- or 5-star book. Paul's life as an academic, too, seems stitched-on, as if to compensate for his never having been as well sketched as Lexy.But I can forgive the author these shortcomings. There is enough in Lexy, and in Parkhurst's evocation of her with a wink of fable, to make me hope her second novel does not fall prety to the sophomore slump, but rather reverses it. She has a powerful sense of human inter-relation, but drifts when her characters are alone. But most tellingly are those moments when this novel does sing, as it does in the second chapter when Parkhurst evokes the Homeric muse to write: \\"I sing of a woman with ink on her hands and pictures hidden beneath her hair.\\" Parkhurst's gift is that she can sing, when she is not foisting chunks of plot upon us that feel like they belong in forgettable novels rather than flashes of a brilliant other world."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Prior to reading this novel, I wasn't sure if I wanted to or not. I had heard good things about it, but I didn't think I'd find it very interesting. Boy was I wrong! The Dogs of Babel is officially on my list for the best books I've read this year.Paul Iverson's wife, Lexy, is found dead after an apparent fall from an apple tree in their yard. The only witness is their dog, Lorelei, who cannot relay the answer to Paul's most important question -- did Lexy fall on accident, or was it suicide? As a linguistics professor, Paul does a lot of research and work with the spoken word. Why couldn't he teach Lorelei to talk? So Paul takes a sabbatical and embarks on the process of teaching Lorelei to say what she knows about that fateful day.I loved every minute of this book. The Dogs of Babel is beautifully written and I commend Carolyn Parkhurst for writing this story. However, it is more about teaching a dog to talk. The flashbacks of Paul and Lexy's life together are the best parts of the book. Lexy is a free-spiritied and troubled character, and their courtship and marriage was incredibly romantic and tragic at the same time. And despite some sensitive material about dog abuse, I still found The Dogs of Babel an exquisite read."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This story is painful and hopeful all rolled in a coating of grief. If you have ever lost a love either by death or dumping you can relate to Paul's emotional struggles. Especially when he wonders how his lovely but mysterious wife could have wound up dead under the tree. Their courtship was beautiful and yet Lexi snaps into rages that Paul thinks will be calmed by their love. The writing is seductive and her word choices are most unique. This tale will pull you along even when your logical mind tries to throw a tantrum. Just go with it....it's a story after all and meant to be an escape. This is one of the best stories I have read in a long time. Not the most well written or ploted but the best emotional heart tugging story.I can see how animal lovers would be upset at the subplot of surgery performed on beloved dogs but I would say that it's far from \\"graphic\\", disturbing yes but only because the author's writing is so real that we believe this to be happening. At that point in the story, we as the reader have become attached to Lorelei and fear for her.I found myself hoping Paul would snap out of it but knowing that dealing with grief is not an overnight process Many reviewers have critizied him for being so blind to Lexi's obvious instability, but when you are in love, you want so badly to overlook those flaws. Her rages were few and far between so that he could almost forget them but near the end he begins to notice how difficult it was living with her moods. I think Lexi felt his drifting and decided to set him free by killing herself. Twisted but to a disturbed person you can see how she knew she was a burden to their love. Flashback to Disney and she talks about how she \\"ruined everything\\" by getting upset.Interesting how the author doesn't go into Lexi's background to explain anything. We just get the present life and usually that is what you know about your SO- most people edit or hide their troubles (Like Lexi creates masks to hide behind)I think the most hurtful times in the book were the nasty notes and jokes left by his coworkers at the college. I'm sure many can relate to that pain of being treated as a joke, especially when you are going through a painful loss.Near the end, I wanted Paul to survive, be happy, get angry at Lexi, realize that she was screwed up and go on with his life and come out of his pain wiser and stronger.I can't wait to see what this author comes up with next.Read this book- you'll love it."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This beautiful book reads like a fable, so please don't be too literal-minded reading it. It's a story of blinding love, grief, and memory. I loved this author's ability to see beauty in sadness.It's also about taking someone's full measure. Yes, I found the descriptions of dog mutilation scary, but I thought it served a metaphorical purpose; Loralei is a dog and Paul (the narrator)eventually finds his love for her in what she is, not what he wants.The narrator's deceased wife is another fully realized character, smart, funny, talented, ... and depressed. In so many ways their relationship is ideal, yet he never betrays to the reader the difficult parts of loving her. He cannot change either of them.If you enjoy parables, myths, and fairy tales this book is especially for you. The parellels between his story and that of &quot;Janet and Tamlin&quot; are clever and heartbreaking.This is the first book since &quot;Everything is Illuminated&quot; that I took out the library, then went out and bought after I read it because I needed to own it. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"To begin with &quot;The Dogs of Babel&quot; is a pretty unusual and sophisticated title for a novel. This is a good start for any book. This is the kind of reference that characterizes the contemporary novel. More than making an auto-reference, the writers opts for referring to something outside her novel --by doing that she trusts her reader, and beleives that the person who is buying the book has enough knowledge to 'decipher' the title. With her &quot;The Dogs of Babel&quot;, Carolyn Parkhurst aims in a distant target and doesn't miss her shot.Not for a single second is the Babel legend mentioned in the novel --it is a knowledge you must have prior to begin the book. And if you still don't have in the end, you will be moved to learn about it. And, believe me, it totally fits the narrative.The book tells the story of a linguist who decides to do the impossible: teach his dog to speak. In his mind he has a good reason. The dog is the only witness of the fall from an apple tree that killed his wife. What is consuming him is the fact he does not know whether that falls was an accident or a suicide. He has reasons to believe in the second option.Alternating between past and present, the story of Paul and his wife Lexy is unfolded and we learn that despite the true love, there were mental issues consuming her. The more we read the more plausible is the suicide.With the tone that is melancholic from the beginning, Parkhurst tells the story with a man struggling to survive --find a reason to keep up, when there is nothing left for him. The narrator has to deal with the grief, and doesn't know how to. The wish of making the dog learn to speak is at the same time his way of accepting his wife is gone. If on one hand he wants the dog to 'tell the truth', on the other, once the truth is told, there will not be much left of his wife, but his memories.Indeed Parkhusrt's premise is original and poignant. Her option on telling the story may sound na?ve at some parts, but that is how she chose to make her point. Alongside with Audrey Niffenegger's &quot;The Time Traveler's Wife&quot; and Mark Haddon's &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time&quot;, &quot;The Dogs of Babel&quot; makes the trilogy of the mental instability. Each of them has its flaws, but more qualities than problems. Another thing, the paperback edition cover is very beautiful."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Like many other reviewers, I found the idea intriguing, and as a dog lover, certainly sympathized with the idea of trying to find out what's going on behind those eyes. The finish had some emotional content and value.But, the book had so many flaws that I found incredibly distracting:Even if I hadn't known it was written by a woman, I would have figured it out in a few pages. Paul does, notices, and says things that men probably wouldn't. For example, he mentions Lexy's dress as being embroidered &quot;from bodice to hem.&quot; Most men know what those words mean, but I've yet to meet one who would notice it, much less mention it.The man's an idiot--to connect to my point above, he notices clothing and other such things, but somehow doesn't realize his incredibly depressed and suicidal wife is suicidal. And he picked a fight with her the night before she died. Hmmmn.He brings his dog to a cult that mutilates dogs???? That happened to be in his neighborhood????That there actually was a psychic named Miss Adelle (or whatever it was),instead of that just being the name of the business. And that he found her! And she kept scrupulous notes for a book she was going to write (was it going to be called &quot;every Tarot reading I've ever done&quot;?)The magical plot-forwarding TV that he has. Reports of Dog J getting stolen on the national news? Lexy getting chosen as a sample voice for a commercial? He happened to see it?The Talking Dog thing had very little to do with the story or the plot or the denouement, and of course led us to see Dog J, which was among the most unnecessarily disturbing scenes I can remember reading. That and the even more unnecessary mutilation of Lorelei.That also must be a crazy apple tree, with a ledge at the top and all. That's not really how trees grow--they kind of peter out with smaller and smaller branches. You generally can't stand at the top and just topple over and not hit branches on the way down.And the whole Disney/spontaneity thing. Please. Fine, the idea was original. But I didn't buy that she hadn't thought about it before the date, as evidenced by her strong feelings about ordering dinner. She announces that only appetizers should be eaten, or else the date would have to be over (really? why not just avoid dessert?), but it sounded like a rule she had thought of ahead of time, not the musings of someone making stuff up as they go along.Finally, perhaps the biggest flaw is its overall structure. Paul must have instantly known she had committed suicide. Knowing everything we knew at the end, it was pretty darned obvious. But he knew all of that at the beginning. He didn't discover that she had attempted suicide in the past--he knew it all along. He didn't discover that she had threatened suicide recently--he knew it all along. He didn't just suddenly discover that they had had a terrible fight the night before she died--He picked that fight!I think this would have been a good short story. Everything she used to lengthen it beyond the central concept hurt it."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I got this as an advanced reading copy from a friend in publishing. She dropped it in front of me and said \\"READ THIS\\". The last time she did that it was Alice Sebold's Lovely Bones, so I listened to her and I read. And I was not disappointed.The book (as everybody else has said before) is about a man who loses his wife. There's something ODD about his wife's death, though, so he tries to teach his dog to communicate with him and tell him what happened the day she died. Sounds hokey, but it's not. Trust me, it's not.The book takes on a bit of mystery as you go . . . as a reader want to know what happened to Lexy. You want the dog to talk. You want Paul to stop acting crazy. Pieces of the dead wife's history begin to unfold as you continue through, and you realize what a wonderful, sad, character Lexy was. The author takes her time, making you like the character you never meet, and by the end you are touched by Lexy's story and how Paul and the dog tie in.The only reason that I gave this book 4 stars and not 5 is the dog talking bit got a little weird on me at one point. There's a subplot that involves a network of people that try to teach dogs to talk and the crazy things done on their 'quest'. I understand why it's in the book, but some of it gets a little raunchy. I would have rather dedicated those pages to Lexy the Mask Maker, but beggers can't be choosers. I'm still thrilled with the rest of the novel.Buy this book. Delve into it and enjoy it. It won't be that hard to do. There is a poignant sadness that colors every page. The author really makes you care about the little family of Paul, Lexy, and Lorelei. And the last few pages, when Paul realizes exactly what happened, will choke you up. They are a real heartbreaker.Happy Reading."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Grief is a strange thing, often bringing with it the kind of pain that can cause even the sanest among us to do things so completely out of character and so irrational that others begin to fear for their personal safety and wellbeing. It is said that there is no greater grief than that suffered at the loss of one's child but, especially for those who have no children, losing a beloved spouse has to be a crushing blow of the same magnitude.In The Dogs of Babel, Carolyn Parkhurst tells the story of one man who suddenly faced exactly that level of grief when he returned home one evening to find his backyard swarming with policemen inside the crime scene tape blocking entrance to his property. Lexy, his wife, was dead, the result of a fall from a large tree she had climbed for some unknown reason. That the fall had killed her was beyond question. All that remained to be determined was whether she died by accident or by suicide.Despite eventual assurances from police investigators that Lexy's death was the result of some kind of freak accident, Paul felt that there was much more to her death than the police would ever know. He also realized there was a witness to what happened: the couple's dog, Lorelei, a Rhodesian Ridgeback that Lexy brought to the marriage. Paul, a university linguistics professor, much to the dismay of everyone in his department, decided there was only one thing to do. He had to teach Lorelei to \\"talk\\" so that she could tell him what she saw on that terrible afternoon.In succeeding chapters, Parkhurst alternates between Paul's almost frantic efforts to communicate with Lorelei in the present and his bittersweet memories of his life with Lexy. Many of Paul's memories are almost too good to be true and, as he returns to them seeking clues about what might have happened to Lexy, he begins to admit to himself that all was not what it seemed to be.Despite its title, this is not really a book about a man's efforts to teach a dog to talk. Rather, it is a book about grief and the craziness that can take over the lives of those suddenly struck by catastrophe beyond their comprehension. Paul does eventually come to realize that his work with Lorelei is doomed to failure, but not before he places his one remaining link with Lexy in mortal danger through his contact with a group of maniacs who are trying to make it physically possible for dogs to talk by subjecting them to painful and deforming amateur surgery.Frankly, this would have been a better novel if Parkhurst had spent more time with Paul's efforts to make Lorelei tell him the truth about Lexy's last day. Instead, she has concocted some kind of romantic mystery in which Paul stumbles around seeking clues that will conclusively prove whether or not his wife killed herself. In the process, both Paul and Lexy are revealed as the flawed and rather unlikable characters that they are and the reader comes to realize that the only truly sympathetic character in the book is a dog. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is doubtful that Parkhurst intended it that way.But my biggest complaint about The Dogs of Babel is that Carolyn Parkhurst did not play fairly with me as a reader. She withheld a key piece of information from me, one that I will not reveal here because, in a sense it is a \\"spoiler,\\" but one of which Paul was aware within days of Lexy's death. Knowledge of that information would have made it much easier to decide whether or not Lexy was a suicide, something that Parkhurst could not have her readers do if her novel was to reach the climax she intended for it. That approach does not work for me and is a crutch that authors should never be tempted into using because most readers will resent it.The Dogs of Babel is not necessarily a bad novel, just one that could have been so much more than it is."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"When I first started to read this book, I couldn't put it down! I almost stayed up through the night -- it was that good. However, as it progressed, I started thinking increasingly more about Paul & Lexy and have the following questions: 1] Why wasn't Lexy in treatment? A few good signs/episodes clearly indicate that she had deep-rooted problems which, apparently, caused her to inappropriately react and/or \\"act-out.\\" 2] If Paul was so smart, why didn't he beseech her to get help? 3] Was Paul a control freak? I was annoyed that he had so little insight into Lexy's art that he would attempt to diminish the importance of her necessary \\"artistic spark\\" by bringing home an \\"assignment.\\" I realize that most readers would view this as \\"helpful,\\" but I did not. However, her reation was a bit over-the-top -- once again. LOVED LORELEI -- REALLY LOVED THIS ANIMAL, and I agree that some parts of this book could upset animal lovers. However, it could also upset someone grieving, as well as those who have experienced a specific form of mental illness -- don't wish to give any more info away!!

I wanted to know what happened, but I wish I had never read the book. I can't get it out of my mind. Don't read this book *especially* if you are a dog lover. The fact that the main character could even remotely identify with these dog butchers made it absolutely impossible for me to feel for him in the main story about his wife's death..which was a bit bizzare in and of itself, but a good story.

I was expecting to read 10 pages before take off, fall asleep, and then wake up at landing and maybe read some during the taxi to the gate. Lets just say I never took my nap.Such a nicely done storyline.

However, by the time I finished The Dogs of Babel, I realized that this was actually a book about love and grief, and what a person feeling these emotions may be willing to do. I have felt both these emotions first hand and the author does an amazing job putting these feelings onto paper.Yes, Parkhurst does use an unusual storyline to get her point across. Who would think that a book about a man trying to get his dog to communicate with him could be serious? The point is that someone with unresolved grief is willing to do ANYTHING to have it resolved. If you are the type of reader that likes straight to the point, no deep thinking involved, books, don't read this. If you are the type of reader that likes a book to keep you intrigued for days to come, I suggest that you give The Dogs of Babel a try.

Through the process, we learn of Paul and Lexy's courtship and marriage in flashbacks that are telling of her state of mind.As we read about their relationship, it becomes clear that Lexy has emotional problems that Paul isn't quite equipped to deal with and that she is reluctant to talk about.

I had to skip over a few parts about the graphic dog abuse. I couldn't find warmth or depth in the characters. They were just too bizarre for me. After reading other reviews on this book, I am aware that it has moved some readers to tears. For me, I couldn't wait for it to be over. I bought it for $3.00 at a used book store and am planning to give it back to them for free. I don't want the negative energy hanging around my house. I'm left to wonder what has happened to our society to make so many people love this truly weird, unbelievable story."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"An interesting take on grief and conflicted love, but two of the main characters (Lexy and Paul) are bound to get on your nerves. Lorelie is the only one who is written \\"true\\"; maybe Parkhurst is a dog person to the bone (uh, no pun intended; okay, maybe a little). Lexy is volatile/fragile and Paul is clueless/clueless (OMG, is this guy a doofus), yet the premise is so original that I kept going back to see what would happen. However, the segment involving the Cerberus Society was so hamhanded, hackneyed and fraught with the worst sort of stereotyping that I had trouble taking the novel seriously after running into it. The resolution might leave you saying, \\"And about time, too!\\""},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Story of a man driven to the edge of madness by the unexpected and unexplained death of his young wife. Their dog is the only witness to her fall from a tree and he becomes obsessed with teaching the animal to speak so he can gain some closure on this horrific loss. Despite interventions from friends and coworkers, he falls into a dark pit of despair and strange activities. The reader slowly becomes aware that his wife was irrational in thought and behavior before and during their marriage and can begin to sympathize with this man on a deeper level as he struggles to understand her life and her death."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel is a beautiful and tragic tale of love and loss. The slow revealing of the main couple's past is well woven and easily believeable. The completely crazy part was the talking dog theme that Carolyn Parkhurst overreached on...In the book, The main character (Paul Iverson), devastated by the loss of his dearly loved wife, makes a desperate attempt to make sense of her death by trying to teach his dog to talk. What at first is a poigniant and heart-rending (albeit futile) struggle, quickly becomes super-bizarre. Everyone does things in grief that don't make much sense, and Paul's efforts really bring home his misery. However, Parkhurst's story would have been better served had she abandonded the \\"talking dog\\" thing before descending into the absurd. The wierd \\"scientific\\" experiments on the dogs were just creepy and really detracted from the story of Paul's journey towards understanding. It was an okay read, and a wonderful work of character development, I'm just not sure that Parkhurst didn't take the gimmick too far."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"When I first heard of this novel, I couldn't imagine being able to suspend my disbelief to the extent that I could tolerate the far-fetched concept: a grief-stricken widower decides to teach his dog, the only witness to his wife's death, to talk. But to my pleasant surprise, this was nothing like the outlandish tale I was dreading. Rather, in author Parkhurst's skillful hands, the decision of the main character, Paul--who happens to be a linguist--to teach his dog, Lorelei, to talk, seems not only plausible but completely understandable. Parkhurst shines in her ability to describe the pain and confusion that results from the sudden loss of a loved one as well as the one survivor's seemingly irrational efforts to make sense of a death that appears to be senseless.In searching for answers to his wife Lexy's death, Paul reconstructs their relationship, bringing the reader along with him to their first date (which lasted a week), their marriage, and their life together; this reminiscence, not Paul's work with Lorelei, forms the bulk of the story. Slowly, a more complete picture of Lexy begins to emerge, yet the exact reasons for her death do not become clear until the very end of the novel. I found myself to be genuinely surprised by the details which Paul uncovers, and although I have never experienced a similar loss myself, I empathized with Paul more and more as the book wore on. Twice in the final pages I found myself sobbing: when Paul finally figures out Lexy's last clue, and when he describes their relationship in the very last paragraph.Like life itself, this novel is both sad and beautiful, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I couldn't help but laugh at the main character when he repeatedly phoned a 900 number which his wife called before her death. I found myself repeatedly yelling at the Paul for the stupid things he was doing. I did enjoy the book tremendously. It was a story of how two people loved each other and how even after the death of his wife the husband struggled to see, if he really knew his wife?There were some unusual struggles in the story. The main character dealt with, getting his pet dog to talk."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"From the remarkable opening line, I was an instant fan of Ms. Parkhurst.This beautifully written first novel is perhaps not for everyone, but I highly recommend it to any reader who loves animals (especially dogs), and/or is interested in a sensitive and courageous exploration of the mysteries of language, art, marriage-- and self-deception. I couldn't stop reading.And I immediately wanted to adopt a Rhodesian Ridgeback. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel (published as Lorelei's Secret in the UK) is a fantastic novel. Trying to describe this book is hard, largely because as soon as you say: \\"Well, it's about this man who tries to teach his dog to talk so that he can find out how his wife died\\", you invariably get bemused looks and lose people's attention! But before you stop reading...this book is actually really, really good. It seems so realistic and engrossing that you don't want to put it down.Paul Iverson is a professor who calls home to find that his wife, Lexy Ransome, has fallen out of an apple tree in their garden and died. The police decide that it was an accidental death and Paul is left feeling bereft with only Lexy's dog, Lorelei, for comfort. Paul then realises that Lorelei was the only witness to his wife's death, and as he is a professor of linguistics he starts to investigate language acquisition in dogs. Through the course of the novel we learn more about Lexy, the relationship between the married couple, \`talking' dogs, and what really happened on the day of Lexy's death.The characters are real 'characters'. They are unique and interesting with plenty of faults as well as good points. Paul is a likeable guy and reading about Lexy's troubled past is very emotional and thought-provoking. I found the ideas about suicide and depression to be particuarly interesting and chilling at the same time.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Even now, days after finishing it, I can't help thinking about the characters and plot and how good it was - in fact, I'm just about to start rereading it. It isn't often you get a book that deals with such a weird subject matter in such a believable and original way. I would definitely recommend that you read this book, especially if you like deep, psychological mysteries.JoAnne"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book was okay. At first I got really into it, but it got very slow and was too depressing. I don't know how anyone could have standed Lexy, she seemed like a woman who needed a shrink of some sort. Though it was an easy read, I couldn't help but think days after I read it about if something like that ever happened to someone in my family.I also don't really get why it was called the 'Dogs of Babel'. the only reason I can think is because the fortune teller talking about the dog and the fool. I don't want to give it away for those who haven't read it. Anyway, I guess I'll understand it better when I'm older."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The book tells of college professor Paul's attempts to solve the mystery surrounding his wife Lexy's death in a fall from a tree. In alternate chapters, the professor recalls his relationship with his wife as well as the steps he takes to learn from his dog Lorelei why his wife died. He feels that, since his was dog present at the time of Lexy's death, the answer to his question is going to be revealed by teaching his dog to talk.I enjoyed reading this book very much. Just as my husband said I would, I did cry. I liked the mystery of the story and the slow, tender way the author described the professor's relationship with his wife. The sadness and disorientation he felt after the death seemed very real. The hidden despair shown in spurts by Lexy was frightening and sad. The premise of the professor's trying to teach his dog to talk gave the book a special and interesting quirk.An FYI: I would caution animal lovers that some parts of this book may not be to their liking because they do involve pain to dogs."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I found this book to be the most beautiful expression of grief I have ever read. As we watch Paul go through all the stages of struggling to understand his wife's death - shock, sadness, betrayal, anger and angst - he finally comes full circle back to love. The loss of not only Lexy but then Lorelei spoke so clearly to me about understanding the place that dogs hold in our hearts. Lorelei represents all that is good in this world - total unconditional love. I could not put this book down and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I really liked this book. It was a very fast read and it kept me interested.

What he does in his grieving period is well, human, I think."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I found it difficult to put this book down.

I'm actually disappointed now that I have finished, I'm missing the story now that it is over."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"this is a fantasticly eerie book that will get under your skin and rumble around a bit. the story itches with suspense and sadness, at the same time. furthermore, parkhurst's writing is chock full of allusions, from the narrator's wife's name (Lexy) to Lorelei, the charming canine. this book is intelligent, entertaining, and thought provoking. i highly recommend it, especially if you have a weekend to spare. you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Well, this was a tough one for me to like. I always have my doubts about any book with this much hype and for the first part of the novel, I was not impressed at all. The novel, as you probably know, concerns a man who tries to teach his dog, the sole witness to his wife's death, to talk so that he can understand if Lexy, his wife, fell to her death accidentally, or if it was suicide. The novel is really about Paul, the husband, and his attempts to deal with his searing grief--the talking dog is just a gimmick, and for most of the novel, a rather annoying one at that. Paul, our narrator, shifts back and forth in time, trying to make some sense of his wife's death. He reveals truths to us slowly, and readers will most likely change their opinion as the novel goes on about the true nature of Lexy's death. The pacing in the novel is excellent, the writing, strong. It's not the best novel ever, not even the best one I've read this year. It is an engaging and entertaining read from a promising writer."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"With all the glowing reviews plastered over this book, I was really looking forward to reading a unique and touching story. Boy was I in for a surprise! As it turns out, a professor trying to teach his dog to talk was the least of the oddities in this book. Committing suicide by jumping out of the ol' apple tree in your backyard? Did the tree have a diving platform or what? Why was Lexy so depressed and filled with rage to the point she didn't even want to have children and eventually took her own life? Why did it take a year for Paul's light to come on and him to realize that his wife was very unstable and suicidal and their fight the previous night most likely triggered her leap out of the tree? Of course, this is the man who tries to teach his dog to talk and then eventually takes the poor animal to the surburban home around the corner where a secret society of dog mutillators met. For the small membership fee of $300, you are allowed access to their secret laboratory where you can mutillate your own dog with instruction manuals and everyhting. And exactly what was the society's reason for wanting to make dogs talk? The book was okay up until this part but the animal abuse and mutillation was just completely off the wall and unneccessary. Need I say more?"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel by Carolyn Parkhurst wasn't very good, in so many ways. It's not the kind of book I normally read - a pretty light read, a Today show book club recommendation, and a smarmy little romance. Sure, sure, I read it really quickly and couldn't put it down, but I'm unsure if I couldn't put it down because it was good, or because I'm going to the library tomorrow and want to be able to return it.It's really corny and cheesy. The characters veer wildly from emotion to emotion, whether it's from sanity to in-, love to thoughts of leaving, or scholarly pursuits to general nuttiness. The characters are like every character in every book you've ever read all rolled into one.You know, if you want a light read, something to curl up with on a rainy day, well, even then, I don't really recommend it. You might check out, say, The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger, or just about any of Murakami's shorter novels - Sputnik Sweetheart, South of the Border, West of the Sun, or Norwegian Wood and you'll be in infinitely better shape, and a little smarter for it."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"It has been a long time since I have read a book that deeply affected me, as The Dogs of Babel certainly has. It begins as a seemingly simple story of Paul Iverson, a professor of linguistics, whose wife Lexy dies from falling out of an apple tree. The death is ruled as an accident by the police and the forensics, but as Paul weaves in and out of the past and the present, he starts piecing together for us--and for himself--the true, more complex cause of Lexy's death.Admittedly, I raised an eyebrow to the parts of the story where Paul is attempting to teach Lorelei, their dog, how to communicate with words or with the typewriter. Lorelei was the only witness to Lexy's death, and Paul believes that Lorelei holds the missing clues to her death. In the end, it turns out that Lorelei does--just not in the way Paul was thinking.The book ends with some of Paul's painful revelations and memories of the events that lead to Lexy's death. It's as if he has known all along what probably happened, but he had to tell the whole story first, in order for the conclusion to make sense. For those of us who have ever been to dark places in our lives, when there seemed to have been little hope or purpose or meaning to existence, it really touched a nerve. He doesn't go into a lot of deep descriptions and meanderings, but in a simple language, relates a story of a desperate, lost soul, who rationally decides to no longer be.A tragic and heart-breaking must-read."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"It's an emotional journey of love and of losing your true love. A well written read with appropriate well researched details. The author shows a lot of diversity of knowledge which this reader appreciated."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book was shallow and unbelievable, going for a kind of magical realism, but falling flat. The main character tries to teach his dog to talk, after his wife kills herself, in the hope that the dog will shed (no pun intended) some light on his wife's death. But even the character's reactions to the suicide and bereavement were not convincing. Shallow, and the subplot of lunatics who believe dogs can be surgically altered to talk, was not well-enough developed, or compelling in the least. I was prepared to like this book, I have liked other noirish-type fantasies, but I found it really disappointing."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is truly one of the most dreadful, depressing books I have ever read. I did not like any of the characters and thought they were two dimensional at best. And maybe it's because I am a dog lover that I just could not stomach what happened to Lorelei. This book left me depressed for a couple of days after I finished reading it - because it's horrible and because I actually bought it in hard cover.I am an electic, avid reader and fairly sophisticated about my reading choices. However, I'd like to burn my copy of this book. I give it minus stars."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Gratuitous and frightful descriptions of animal abuse do nothing but add to the horror of a deseperate suicide survivor's search for answers. I hate, hate, hate this book. HATE!It is disingenuous to put Dog in the title of this book. It should be titled \\"Suicide Babble\\". I was lured into the book by Dog in the title like candy to a child molestation victim. Terribly self conscious writing.Please don't read it. If you have a heart, you will be sorry."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I would give this book zero stars if possible. I hated this book. It started out slow, predictable in its dialogue, and then I realized that the gloomy and depressing \\"climax\\" of this book is animal torture.If you are sensitive to animal suffering, don't bother reading this atrocity- it will give you nightmares and add to your thoughts of how sick the world really is. There are so many wonderful books to read- don't squander your precious time on this shameful garbage."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I agree with the review that says this novel is predictable, and I'd like to add that it's very sappy. The dialogue between him and his wife seemed made up and unnatural, and her character wasn't consistent.I decided to read this book because I was lured in by the idea that he was going to find some secret unknown canine language. But it more explores this man's feelings about his deceased wife. It goes back and forth from past to present: (past - he reminsces of his wife and their relationship and present - trying to find the mystery of her death), but the \\"mystery\\" was very predicatable. By the time I reached the end, there was no \\"ah-ha!\\". After I finished this book, I felt very dissatisfied, like I'd wasted a week of my life on this let-down of a novel."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I can not recommend this book to anyone and perhaps for the same reason that one reviewer mentioned. The characters of the man and woman were not developed enough for me to sense that they had a real relationship or to care what happened to them. Lexy's character never seemed real to me, and reasons for her depression or suicide tendencies were vague. As for the section dealing with mutilation of dogs for scientific purposes, I didn't even read those pages. Don't be fooled by the glowing reviews for this book. I'm very open minded and read all sorts of books, but this one did not engage me in any way."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is a disgusting book and I did not read the whole thing. I could not read past the animal abuse stuff. The author must be some sort of weird person. I have destroyed the book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"What is the connection of the title to the story? Not one reviewer (professional or general reader) ever expanded on that thought. Why did the writer choose the title?"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but a word of warning: It is NOT for the faint-hearted. The things is, as a reader you have to get past the extremely disturbing parts and see the book as a whole--much like you have to do with other novels that take you someplace difficult (think McCrae's &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; or any of the other thought-provoking books dealing with the darker issues life has to offer). That said, &quot;The Dogs of Babel&quot; IS well-written and worth a shot--just don't read it right before bedtime."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Beautifully written book. The love he had for his wife is apparent during the whole book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Unlike many of the other critiques I had no previous knowledge of this first novel. In my opinion those that dumped on the book did not understand what it was saying. If Parkhurst can continue being as imaginative and creative as in &quot;Babel&quot; she will be in the top rank of American authors.The dog metaphor was cleverly utilized, but is just that. The author is writing about human relationships in a very special way.It is one of the few books that I found hard to put down, and required some serious thought.I look forward to Ms. Parkhurst's next effort."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"In this brilliantly poignant novel reminiscent of Alice Sebold's THE LOVELY BONES, Parkhurst takes us along on a painful and sometimes bizarre journey of grief. Paul Iverson is a college linguistics professor whose enigmatic and often intense wife, Lexy, is found dead at the base of a tree in their backyard. No one knows exactly what happened except, perhaps, the couple's dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Lorelei, and she's not talking. Yet.In the grief-hazed months that follow Lexy's death, Paul's only focus is on figuring out how and why Lexy died. He tries to find answers in his detailed reminiscences and the close scrutiny of some key things Lexy left behind, but his primary focus is on trying to teach Lorelei how to talk so she can share what she knows.Paul eventually finds the answers he seeks but along the way he suffers the ridicule of his peers, uncovers a frightening fringe element of dog linguists, and gets sucked so far down into the vortex of depression that it seems he'll never be able to climb out. His wayward navigation of grief's landscape is a melancholy reminder of just how thoroughly love can both bind and blind us to another.This book isn't an easy read. There are some off-putting moments, particularly when the story takes an unusual side tangent involving animal abuse. And Parkhurst's unabashed look at the ugly underbelly of grief is so powerful it's sometimes overwhelming. Despite these pitfalls, THE DOGS OF BABEL is a page-turner filled with complex, unforgettable characters who will stick with most readers long after the book is done."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The author was clever to unravel flaws in a loving relationship. Paul Iverson, the main character is caught by surprise by his wife's unexpected death. He does soul searching to try to understand their relationship while he is greiving. After finishing the book, I thought about how easy this might be for a person to fall in love with an personified image they hope the person may be instead of who they really are. The book takes many disturbing twists to keep the reader interested and I felt myself wanting to close the book because of the cruelty described with animals,yet the I wanted to find out how this ended. A sign of a pretty good read."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is quite an astounding book with a great premise. When Paul loses his wife Lexy in an accident and the family dog is the only witness, Paul decides to try to communicate with the dog in order to find out more about his wife.Parkhurst does a brilliant job at portraying Paul's grief and his desperation to find out more about his wife. She also chronicles the sheer darkness one experiences after a loss. Lorelei, the dog, is literally Paul's only lifeline to his wife.Where Parkhurst goes astray is in the second half of the book when Paul's search to communicate with the dog brings him into contact with a psychic and an underground dog linguist group. This stretches the imgination and distracts from Paul's struggles.Still a beautiful book to read."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This novel is worth reading for its powerful exploration of grief and love. Parkhurt's novel gives the reader an intensely private and emotional view of a man's first year of widowhood. The plot is driven by the question of whether Paul's wife, Lexy, died from suicide or accident. The entire subplot of teaching Loralei (the dog) to speak serves to illustrate the complexity of grief.The book is soundly written with great creativity in characterization and metaphor. Although not on the same level of House of Sand and Fog, its emotional intensity and exploration are similar."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Simply put, this book did speak to me. I heartily recommend it for anyone who is an animal lover--also for anyone who has ever truly been in love and who has ever grieved deeply.I will leave the in-depth reviews for the experts. There are plenty of those sorts of reviews out there. However, this book was riveting, as well as meaningful."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is a book well worth reading. The plot is original and intriguing.After Paul learns of his wife's death, he goes on a mission to find out what really happened. Looking for clues in his house to learn about Lexy's fall, he turns to the only witness, the family dog. His mission earns him ridicule from his colleagues, gets him involved with criminals, and makes him spend countless hours on the phone talking to strangers.This is an interesting book, however, I only give it 4 stars since some of the clues and plot are a little predictable. If you pay attention, you will figure out Lexy's faith before Paul does. Still, it is a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"After finishing this book, I went into such a funk. Had I seen a Hallmark commercial of any kind, I probably would have started bawling.However, this is not to say that this book isn't fantastic. It absolutely is. This book made me think and it touched me in an obvious way. This is a quite a different reaction from many of the other books I have read, which are often meaningless ways to pass some time.This is a story about an incredibly deep romance between two people. The two participants are so different, but yet they bring out the best in each other. We find out about this romance after tragedy has struck.As you are reading a review of the book, you know that the story occurs after the death of Paul's wife Lexy and that he is seeking meaning to her death. So, the book is also largely about grief and recovering from it.I didn't want this book to end, and I read it in an afternoon. It was fantastic, hope you enjoy it too!!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book is magnificantly written and is definitely a heavy read, emotionally speaking. It requires an Emotional Quotient in order to read, in other words. It is exciting, carrying on really three stories... You'll love it! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I read The Dogs of Babel in two days. It is about a man who suffered the loss of his wife who fell out of a tree in his backyard with his dog as the only witness to her death. As a reader, you will sincerely connect with the characters and feel for Paul. This book really touched my heart. It is interesting, sad, funny at times, and a great read in general. The plot may seem outlandish, a man trying to teach his dog to talk, but it is his desperation and need to find solace that touched me so deeply. I would definately recommend this book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Paul, a linguistics professor returns home one day to discover that his young, talented and beautiful wife Lexy, has either fallen out of or jumped from the top of a giant apple tree in their backyard, and is dead. The only witness to the event is Lexy's beloved dog Lorelei. All consumed with grief in the weeks and months after Lexy's death, Paul takes a leave of absence from the university in order to solve the mystery of Lexy's death. Was it an accident? Or was it a suicide? Obsessed with unlocking the key to the mystery, Paul engages in research into teaching a dog to talk, in the hope that Lorelei will tell him what he wants to know. As he goes about this he encounters a cult of sadists who mutilate dogs in an attempt to teach them to talk. This is the creepy part of the novel. But in my opinion this is a distraction in the novel, not essential to the plot and put in for it's lurid effect. The more compelling part of the story is watching Paul search his mind for clues to what happened in the story of the history of his marriage to Lexy. What emerges is the portrait of a disturbed young woman, who is by turns depressed, angry, selfish and suicidal. We wonder why Paul can't see this at the outseft of the marriage. Yet as we know, 'love is blind'. What remains is an idealized view of a woman so adored by her husband that he is blind to what is quite plainly in front of his face. She needs professional help, yet not until the end of the story does he suggest it. The book is heavily ladened with symbolism. At Paul's first meeting with Lexy at a yard sale held at her home, he purchases a gizmo for making square hard boiled eggs, a clumsy hint that in their married life he will at times force her into being something she is not. Lexy earns her living as a masker maker, the author telling us that most of us never truly reveal ourselves to others. The symbolism becomes a bit heavy handed. Other creepiness appears when Lexy takes up making death masks for a living, or when Paul consults a telephone psychic. Although the portrait of a loving husband consumed by grief is well handled, beautifully written and compelling, the novel is essentially dishonest. For at the end the reader finds out what Paul has really known all along yet concealed from the reader. I as a reader recoil from such authorial tricks. Yet, it is clear that Parkhurst is a talented writer and this is her first novel. It will be interesting to read her next novel which will hopefully be more subtle and not dependent on contrivances."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"There was some good writing in the book, which kept me reading it, but much of it was flat overall. I thought the characters were flat, their supposed \\"passion\\" was flat, and the \\"moment of grace\\" that one review spoke of was so totally flat it didn't exist. In fact, the ending was extremely obvious.I agree with the person who called this a nice \\"pitch\\" novel, especially with the inclusion of the dog (guarantees dog-loving readers), but felt that a lot of potential was wasted: for further character development, for a believable plot, for some moving conclusions and fresh insight.In fact, my strongest impression was \\"bloodless.\\" Nothing was really engaging enough to make me truly interested, and I kind of had to wonder if the style was encouraged in the author's MFA training -- there were perfect short chapters, each ending with an \\"insight,\\" and it all seemed too crafted for words.That said, I think the author has tremendous potential, and I have great hopes for her in the future."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The premise of this story is wonderful, and at times it comes close to pulling it off. But just when you think it might, Parkhurst gives us one more contrived situation or one more over-the-top-cute glimpse of the main characters' relationship and you're left disappointed and hopeful once again. The depiction of grief is dead-on, intense, emotional, painful to read at times it's so well-done. She should have trusted herself a bit more with it. We don't need their relationship made so precious so we feel the loss; we would have felt it anyway. Having the lost wife a mask-maker teetered on the edge of contrivance, slipped even closer when they became death masks. Had she stopped there it could have been tolerable if too noticeable. But she slips over the edge a few too many times with this particular aspect. The same is true with the underground dog society and the final message from his wife. I wanted to like this work so much, and she overcame herself so many times that I remained hopeful that by the end I would. But unfortunately it proved too hard to ignore the contrivances. Even so, I can't say the book isn't worth a read--there's much here to savor. Read it, and prepared to be saddened by the work as well as its failed promise."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I don't usually go to the trouble of writing a review for the books I read. I'd rather people read them and make up their own minds, and I rarely have insight that might be helpful to other readers. But this book touched me so deeply that I had to say something about it. The combination of joy and despair, charm and depth, and the ability to amuse you and break your heart at the same time is very rare. This book has it. I can't remember the last time a novel made me cry. It wasn't Paul's grief that touched me (though it did) as much as Lexy's, because I can identify so deeply with the elation of life while at the same time being in so much pain.I don't want to overdo it here - I think you get the point. I highly recommend this book, but it's not for everyone."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Linguistics Professor Paul Iverson returns home to find his wife Lexy Ransome dead from an apparent fall from a backyard apple tree that it seems she must have climbed up on. Their dog Lorelei is the only witness to the tragedy, but her barking brought help too late for the victim.Over the next few weeks, the mourning Paul notices little things in his home seem out of kilter. Originally writing this off as grief, he begins to wonder about whether his spouse accidentally fell or committed suicide. Desperate to know the truth, the linguistic professor tries teaching English to the eye witness his canine, but little if any progress is made until the duo hooks up with an underground group that may enable improved communication between man and dog, but at what price?THE DOGS OF BABEL can be divided into three parts: the romance between Paul and Lexy, the teaching of English by Paul to Lorelei, and the workings of the underground group. Each segment in of itself is well written, but never fully integrates into a cohesive novel as if Carolyn Parkhurst could never decide on the main theme. Though some romance fans will appreciate that piece best, this reviewer relished the interplay between the professor and his dog. Ms. Parkhurst displays depth, imagination, and talent that makes this novel worth reading, but hopefully her next tale is more focused.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The gist of this book is that Paul's unstable and troubled wife, Lexy, has died in a fall. The only witness to her death was their dog, Lorelei. Paul, desperate to know whether it was an accident or a suicide, tries to teach his dog to speak so that she can tell him what happened in Lexy's last moments.Leaving aside the implausibility of teaching a dog to speak human language, especially in a novel that is not presented as science fiction or fantasy, this is where I really begin to lose sympathy for Paul. He is so obsessed with prying a testimony out of the dog that he loses touch with the fact that she is as loving as a pet can be.It gets worse when he strikes up a correspondence with a convicted felon who was put away for animal abuse after he was caught surgically altering dogs to make them talk. And I lost the last shred of sympathy for Paul when he realized that the felon's friends' meeting place was in fact the selfsame place where Lorelei had been abused as a puppy, and went to the meeting anyway. That was it for me. Grieving or not, that was inexcusable.Because Paul is so bent on his impossible goal, Lorelei ends up placed in a great deal of danger and goes through some unnecessary nastiness. I can't help feeling that Paul sold Lorelei out for nothing.I give this two stars instead of one because the prose is really quite beautiful, and Lorelei is lovable and perfect."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The \\"Dogs of Babel\\" starts off like Marc Levy's \\"If Only It Were True,\\" a story about a man who is the only one capable of communicating with a woman in a coma. This is both a compliment and a criticism. Levy's book is a very quick good read, kind of fluffy but also entertaining, and will never be called \\"literature.\\" Still, Levy's book, with all of its silliness, has stuck with me.The problem with \\"Dogs\\" is that it starts off totally plot driven. The central character, a man whose wife has just died falling out of a tree, feels almost flat in his personality. He doesn't even really express grief about what has happened. So you read this and you think you're reading genre fiction. Fast and light with an emotional payoff at the end.Then about two thirds of the way through the book the author goes literary. What's the point? I read the book several months ago and I've already forgotten! I read \\"The Lovely Bones\\" (which also deals with death and healing) by Alice Sebold immediately after \\"Babel\\" and it was a far better read and far more meaningful both in terms of genre and literary merit.I understand that \\"Babel\\" has its fans, especially those interested in characters dealing with death and depression. I can see the book's value in addressing some of those issues. Still, it's unlikely it will stand the test of time - as either literature or genre fiction."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I rarely review books on Amazon, or anywhere else, but this book is so bad, I felt obligated to warn people. The plot is ridiculous, the characters are poorly drawn and tedious, and the prose is alternately banal and pretentious. How did this book get so many good reviews? A cult that mutilates dogs in an effort to get them to talk? A woman who climbs a tree and jumps out of it as a way of killing herself? The stupid trip to Disney World. The paper mache mask nonsense. The silliness about rearranging the books. The whole thing with the psychic. Silly, boring and utterly uncompelling."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Two stars instead of one, simply because the grammer and punctuation is decent. Perhaps I'm unable to suspend disbelief long enough to wrap my brain around this story--because I'm befuddled by all the glowing reviews this book has received. The characters seemed under-developed (what's the deal with Lexy's rage?). If she was so unstable, how could Paul be completely oblivious? The secret society and dog mutillation was ridiculously unnecessary--why it was thrown into the story at all is inexplicable to me. Very bizarre, indeed!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Come on people, don't you want even a little more from your reading experience than this load of sentimental nonsense? Terrible characters (especially Lexy, who never comes across as a real person -- too plucky and kooky by half), and a horrible plot involving Frankenstein-ian surgeries on dogs to get them to speak like humans. Read the review below written by a medical doctor if you don't believe me -- what happens in this plot is incredible and gross and silly. I never got a sense that the narrator felt much for his dog, and I could care less about how his wife did herself in (I could see the answer to this question coming a mile away -- all those 'kooky' little character traits. So irritating). One of the worst plots I've read in a long time, a close second to 'Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell', but mercifully much shorter."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I almost didn't finish this book. I was disappointed because of the lack of development of the characters and it felt like the author was trying to herd cats with as many directions the story traveled. The way it was written gave me the impression that the author was just trying too hard to make it work."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This story was sad and quite a painful read. I felt like a helpless observer most of the time I spent reading it. I could only sympathize with, get mad at or feel loathing toward and then forgiveness of Paul as he dealt with his grief. I most appreciated the way the author handled issues that many people have s blind faith in or spend much engaged in wishful thinking about. I do not recommend this book for troubled youngsters or depressed adults without a good deal of discussion about it."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"So much for buying a book based on the quirky, intriguing premise. The idea of getting a dog to talk (or somehow communicate), especially as a witness to a crime or a mysterious accident, is fascinating. I flipped pages and saw that chapter two opens with the sixteenth-century case of a grieving mother who adopted a dog to replace her dead infant. She suckled the puppy as if it were human, dressed him and with great perseverence, she succeeded in getting the dog to \\"speak,\\" though listeners usually had to ask her to translate. For 13 years the dog never left her side. On her deathbed the dog spoke his last words: \\"Without your ear, I have no tongue.\\" He never uttered another sound, canine or human, and died a year later. The people of Lyons erected a statue in his honor.Wow, I thought, this is my kind of book! Another page:\\"....dogs are witnesses. They are allowed acess to our most private moments...Think what they could tell us. They sit on the laps of presidents. They see acts of love and violence, quarrels and fedus...If they could tell us everything they have seen, all of the gaps of our lives would stitch themselves together.\\"And so a linguist grieving for his wife tries to learn the truth from the dog who was on the scene. I bought the book.Why was I expecting something more than a descent into grief and a sentimental replay of the romance and marriage? All along, the man narrating the novel sounded like a woman to me. I know, New Age men, gentle, sensitive, romantic men, do exist. But something in his tone just hit a wrong note with me. The meet-cute at a garage sale, the square eggs, were very romantic. But the romance that followed was so off-the-wall, I couldn't buy it.What I did like were scenes involving dogs. The talking-dog jokes -- I laugh every single time I hear them.But Lorelei, the dog in the novel, stayed in the backseat, and the truth about Lexi was just depressing. And I kept thinking about other books I might have bought with the money I invested in this one."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book is darkly funny and deeply sad. I thought the protagonist and narrator Paul had a compelling and interesting narrative voice, and while the premise of the novel sounds a little silly when you're describing the plot to your friends, overall the book is eminently readable.Parkhurst accurately and heartbreakingly captures being in a true love relationship, describing the highs and the lows with verisimilitude. The book gets harder to read as it goes on, because it gets emotionally deeper; Paul reveals more of the nuances of his relationship with his late wife and we as readers delve with him into the pain of losing the love of your life, and the accompanying dissociation with reality that kind of tragedy brings. The character of Lexy was frustrating, but upon reflection, that is because Parkhurst convincingly portrays a person suffering from depression (and how difficult it can be to be in love with a person like that).As far as books about grief goes, this one stays as light as I think you can be while still handling the subject matter thoughtfully. I laughed; I cried; I made my SO promise never to leave me."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"First off, I love the cover, including the fact that a ridgeback really does look like the dog in the picture. Overall, I really liked this book. I won't say I really \\"enjoyed\\" this book, however, because it is such a convincing, harrowing portrait of grief and the insanity someone can easily be driven to in such a time. I read some reviews on Amazon that warn against reading this if you have recently experienced loss, but the engrossing story of Paul, his beloved but flawed wife Lexy, and the dog who witnesses her death, was still incredibly sad and moving.Paul narrates his own story, describing the evolution of his relationship with his wife before her death, right up to it and then afterward, when he can't decide if he remembers his wife who lived or an image he has created from grief. The dog Lorelei plays the role of witness - witness to Lexy's mysterious death-fall from the apple tree in their backyard - and the point is that Paul tries to somehow coax answers out of his mute dog. Soon enough, Paul develops an insane faith in the ability of dogs to learn to speak, in any hopes of obtaining the answers he needs for closure.Now, this is the type of peeling-away-the-layers book that I was looking for when I got myself into this, and I have only good things to say about it. The pacing is fast, making this the saddest page-turner I can remember reading. The characters are real, multi-dimentional people, the story is involving and although you might turn away from depressing books, know that by the time the book begins, the worst part is already over. For the reader of modern fiction of any type, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel isn't a bad book, but it's not a great book either. The book opens with the narrator, Paul, suddenly discovering that his wife, Lexy, has died from falling out of the apple tree in their backyard. The rest of the book details how Paul grieves and copes with and the loss of his wife. The narrative alternates between their past love story and Paul's present day coping activities. In particular, Paul attempts to teach his dog Lorelei how to talk, because he realizes that Lorelei is the only one who has insight into the last moments of Lexy's life. I am sympathetic to his very strange endeavor. Anyone who has suffered a sudden loss would have a ton of questions and would go to any lengths to find answers. Still, I found Paul's attempt to teach his dog how to talk weird. Then, as the book progressed, this business of teaching a dog how to talk got even weirder. I found it to be distracting from the central theme of coping with a sudden death.In between the present day narration is the one about Paul and Lexy's past. Some parts of Paul and Lexy's love story remind me of Nicholas Sparks' writing. Their romance was sticky sweet. The two of them were so in love with each other that their first date lasted a week. However, that's where the similarities end. Paul and Lexy's romance did not have an overarching theme or greater message about love in the way that Sparks' novels do. Additionally, I had a hard time relating to Paul, Lexy, or their romance.The novel is neither plot-driven nor character-driven. Instead it focuses on one aspect of human life, coping with death. I think that Paul knew the answers to Lexy's mysterious death from the very beginning, but he wasn't ready to face it. After all, isn't denial the first stage of grief? Throughout the book, he desperately searches for clues about his wife's death and in the end he finds the answers that I felt were in his possession all along.Overall, I would rate Dogs of Babel 3.5 stars. But since I am unable to rate it with a half star, I rounded it up to 4 stars. I neither recommend it nor not recommend it. It's as enjoyable read that was never dull, but parts of it were just too weird for me to give it a higher rating."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I'm not sure where to begin . . . this is an amazing, unusual, wise, and gorgeously sad book.It's about a man whose young wife dies suddenly and unexpectedly in what was officially ruled an accident. But Paul begins to wonder what really happened to Lexy after he notices some strange, out-of-place, things around the apartment. The only witness to Lexy's death was their dog, and Paul - who is a professor of linguistics - decides to teach the dog to communicate so that she can tell him what really happened to Lexy.The book has been tagged mystery, and there is indeed a mystery in it, but this isn't what I'd call a mystery genr&eacute; book. It's not so much about the mystery as it is about love, loss, and the journey through grief.About 3/4 of the way through, there is a bizarre, almost slapstick, mystery-type development that doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the book. Some reviewers have called this part ridiculous, implausible, etc. and feel that it spoils the book. I totally agree that it is ridiculous and different in atmosphere from most of the book, but I think it enhances the book in a fiendishly clever way. I think that it was inserted deliberately, and that it is intended as subtle satire.As such, it serves a couple of important purposes. First, it lightens the mood temporarily, giving the reader a break from what could otherwise have been a relentlessly sorrowful book. It gives us a chance to laugh and roll our eyes at the creepiness and implausibility of it.(Mild Spoiler Alert) . . .. . .. . .Secondly, it distracts us from the real truth about Lexy's death. The book ends in the only way it possibly could, given the personalities of the characters, the overall atmosphere, and the events. Thus the answer could have been predictable, and although it still would have been a moving and meaningful book, the ending would have less impact if it didn't come as at least somewhat of a surprise. The Cerberus Group plot leads us off on a wild goose chase, making us think that the author might come up with ANY kind of craziness as the cause of Lexy's death: who could tell what it might be?. . .. . .(End of spoiler section) . . .Parkhurst is manipulating the reader's thought process and emotions here, and although I know that some readers find that annoying, it delights me when an author does this. It's something only the most gifted of authors can do. It requires not only unusual writing skills, but also exceptional insight and understanding into the human mind. I tend to be a very logical and unemotional person, and I loved the way Parkhurst could make feel feel all kinds of different emotions and lead my thoughts down unaccustomed, irrational, paths.You'd have to be a truly hardhearted person not to fall in love with the dog Lorelei. Although the breeds are different, her personality is so much like my dog's that I was constantly reminded of my own dog's intelligence, good behavior, loyalty, and affection. My dog got lots of extra petting and treats while I read this book!And I loved the way Paul and Lexy met: because of a gadget that makes square hard-boiled eggs. There really is such a thing - I have one, and like Lexy, have never gotten around to using it!The multiple layers of symbolism are another quality that makes The Dogs of Babel such a gem. There are the books that Lexy chooses to rearrange as a clue. There are the masks that Lexy makes, a spectacularly beautiful theme. There is the mystery of Lexy's past - what happened to make her the way she was, and why does she seem to have no family (or no contact with them?) There is Disney World and New Orleans, both of which clearly have significance as more than just vacations. There are the psychics with their Tarot readings.But most important is the Scottish legend of Tam Lin, a hauntingly beautiful and mysterious traditional story/poem/ballad. At times both Paul and Lexy embody different roles in the story: the finest knight, the elf queen, Tam Lin, Janet (the human girl who rescues Tam Lin from the elf queen.) Carolyn Parkhurst shows us the elf queen from an entirely different perspective than I have ever seen before, giving the legend (and this book as well) a whole new level of complexity, mystery, and meaning - and especially, compassion.The various layers of symbolism are going to keep me thinking about this book days and weeks after finishing it.The Dogs of Babel is a keeper. It's a brilliant work that has much to teach us about life and loss. You'll want to read again and again, and each time you do, you'll find something new in it.(261 pages)Quote from The Dogs of Babel:\\"When I was a little boy, my mother, who was given to hyperbole, used to tell me that if the world were to come to an end, her last thought would be of me, and she would fling my name out to the heavens as the mortar of the earth burst apart and the ground fell from beneath her feet. It is only now, when I am surprised to find that I am growing older every day, it's only now that I am beginning to believe that my mother was not just speaking extravagantly. I think every one of us carries with us a name like this, a name whose importance may not be clear to us until we find it on our lips in those final moments. I don't think it is ever, perhaps not even for my mother, who we expect it to be.\\""},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Loved this book! Devoured it in 3 days and now will be looking for other Parhurst books!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"What could have been a really depressing book was actually a delightful read despite the subject matter. Paul's wife Lexy is found dead beneath a tree in her back yard and while her death is ruled an accident, Paul feels compelled to discover what really happened. Their dog Lorelei was the only witness and Paul is determined to find out what she observed that day. Paul's foray into canine linguistics seems absurd, but his attempts to teach Lorelei to speak seem completely logical. He is also aided by several unusual clues that Lexy left behind, which drives his desperation to know what was going through her mind when she died. While this could have been a dismal book, the author mercifully omits the tedium of Paul's initial grief and plunges directly into his quest for understanding. Throughout the narrative he reflects on the history he and Lexy shared, which helps to guide him as much as the ambiguous clues. There is a lot more to this than just Paul's experiments and ruminations and I really enjoyed the way it all came together. The novel's pervading sadness is infused with clever humor and quirky intelligence that is rarely executed so well."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Great story! A tear jerker but is one of the best stories I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel by Carolyn Parkhurst is a phenomenal novel that I have become very fond of. Honestly however, the only reason why I picked up this book was because of the cute puppy on the cover who I soon found out was Lorelei. This is one of those books where you almost become friends with the characters and feel their pain. Even after the first chapter I could feel his pain. I immediately felt Lexy and her death upon me.Basically what happens in this novel, is that Lexy was found dead. Apparently she climbed to the top of the apple tree in their backyard, he rest in unknown. Did she commit suicide? I still haven't found that out yet. It seems that the only being that was near at the time (including neighbors) was Lorelei, the dog. Past stories and legends about dogs speaking have come to thought to the man. So, the man tries to get Lorelei to speak. He works and works. He researches thousands of stories in history about speaking dogs. He gives Lorelei a test to analyze her skills. I have not finished this book yet but I can already tell you that it is incredible.I loved the flashbacks into how Lexy and Paul met and how they became married, and all the flashbacks into their marriage. I think it really leant something special to the book, though I will admit that sometimes I just wanted to get back to the story at hand just beause it was so good or it was at that special point where you just have to know what happens next. But take that with a grain of salt, it's not that the flashbacks weren't good and weren't worth reading, just that I was so drawn in by the story. On the other hand this book is also very dark and horrid. It is not especially aheartwarming novel but definitley a MUST read."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"If you're an animal lover who is repulsed by scenes of animal cruelty, avoid this book at all costs. Although it's billed as a moving novel about grief and the bonds of love, those themes are overshadowed by the graphic (although highly implausible) theme of surgical animal mutilation. The animal cruelty that you dismiss as only a passing reference at the beginning of the book blossoms into a critical plot point that made me want to vomit with disgust. I couldn't sleep after I read it.Can't stand reading about the occasional animal-cruelty story in the newspaper? Do yourself a favor and skip this book: there are plenty of similar novels out there that won't turn your stomach."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"As an exploration of the grieving process, this book works well. Clearly we can see Paul move through the stages of grief, and we go through the disbelief, the sadness, the anger and the resolution with him. I think that part of the book is quite believable and well done.What I didn't like was the character developent. To me, there didn't seem to be enough evidence as to why we should care about Lexy or mourn her loss. She was quirky, she was spontaneous, she was a free spirit! So what? She was also self centered, unstable, and annoying. If we are to be joining in with Paul's journey through grief, shouldn't we care more about the character being mourned? Paul was better developed and a more sympathetic character, but even with him I felt that there were too many loose ends.All in all, this was a decent read, and Carolyn Parkhurst has written a page turner. But I finished the novel not hungry for more and would hesitate to recommend it when there are so many better novels out on the market right now."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The book is OK, wouldn't recommend it.

Although the cast of characters are not Star Trekky, they are Jesuits. This book does raise a lot of religious and philosophical questions without being preachy. One question posed: how does finding life on other planets affect one's religious beliefs?I like how the story unfolds, intertwining the present with the past. I like the author's creativity in \\"First Contact\\" Issues. I found several of the characters to be likable and enjoyed reading what they had to say. I found a few conversations between these characters to be fresh and thought provoking.However, I felt the object of suspense was a little over-hyped. I also had trouble with all the foreign names, keeping them straight for a while. And either I missed it, or it was never clearly explained what happened to Emilio's hands.

The author deliberately plays up the love angle in the beginning to throw the reader off the scent. By the end of the book, the reader knows that Paul, the narrator, has concealed key facts surrounding his wife's death--key facts that indicate that he picked a fight with her the night before she died, that he was considering leaving her, that she was seriously depressed and disturbed before they ever met, and that he was something far less than Mr. Sensitivity--all of which led to his wife's decision to kill herself.She even left him in code a part of a favorite poem of hers. In the book, Paul thinks of this poem as indicating that she loved him so much that she wished he had eyes of clay and a heart of stone so he wouldn't grieve so much. I read it differently. I think that she was telling him that he already had eyes of clay (he couldn't see her pain) and a heart of stone (she could tell he wasn't sympathetic to her mental situation any more), and therefore, she was choosing to die.Paul's lack of empathy is pretty clearly sketched in a number of incidents, not just with his second wife (the one who kills herself), but his first wife, whose great crimes apparently were her insecurity and anxiety and wanting to talk about it. His response was to stop talking to her. With his second wife, his response to her rage and depression was to either pressure her to use his ideas for her art, or to give her surprise trips in which he planned the daily itinerary. By the end of the novel, he has already started to date some third woman, apparently not much troubled that his irresponsibility and selfishness has led to his dog's being mutilated. Here is a guy not much troubled by self-doubt.This book was suspenseful and disturbing, but a real downer. I'm sorry to have gotten to know Paul."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I really like this novel. Even though the part about talking dogs is quite weird. Lexy would be the ideal wife... if she could just keep herself together :)"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book represented everything I hate in a book. First, the writing was terrible: it was hollow, the author asked rhetorical questions, she answered rhetorical questions, and the characters congratulated each other on the depth of their wisdom (which is really the wisdom, or lack of it, of the author). Second, the plot was about a person who suffered the kind of \\"tragedy\\" that most people will have to face sometime in their lives, in fact many times in their lives, but the book portrayed this as something greater and rarer than that. At least the dog didn't learn how to talk. That would have been unbearable."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is what writing should be. A book that takes you through highs and lows, fear and despair, hope and hopelessness. The story is about a very troubled woman Lexy and her dog Lorelei. She meets a linguist professor Paul Iverson and they marry. Paul is a very quiet, studious, unassuming kind of man who is totally swept away by the excitement and unpredictable nature of the younger woman. Paul is truly captivated by Lexy so much that he fails to sense something is wrong with her. Within days of their meeting she has a terribly explosive episode where she cusses out a perfect stranger, and then gets really weird. This is Ms. Parkhurst introducing us to a woefully troubled character, one I still don't know if I even liked, but I certainly felt very sorry for. Yes, she did something totally reprehensible to me, but she felt it was the only way out for her. She didn't believe her life was worth living, and I won't go into the other as not to spoil it for the future readers. Paul's quest to find out why Lexy died is wrought with intrigue, soul searching, and despair. His suffering was almost too painful to read, and when his anger surfaced it was so much of relief, because then I could get angry. Lexy was a lost soul from the first minute she appeared in the book, I knew this, but I kept hoping that maybe, just maybe it was all a horrible accident. The mystery surrounding Lexy's death will keep you mesmerized until it is revealed, but the pain and suffering of Paul and Lorelei, will stay with you awhile. This book highlights how suicide is not a solitary action. Yes, the act itself is, but the ramifications are like the ripples in water. They spread out and smother everything within range.The book hops from the present to the past so you get a good sense of how the relationship between Paul and Lexy's grows. The book elaborates on Lexy's life from childhood to that terrible day in October, and only touches on Paul's. My only citicism is that I wanted to know more about Paul. He wasn't a very strong willed character. I kept hoping for a reaction when Lexy would have one of her \\"spells,\\" but he seemed to just accept them. I think they both had eyes of clay, him for not seeing how much Lexy needed help, and Lexy for thinking this was the only solution to her problem. Paul and Lorelei loved and needed her and she cared more about herself and her demons. I finished this book last night, and will admit to thinking about the characters several times today. It made me think about the masks I myself wear and how easy it is to hide your true feelings from the one's who love you."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I wish I had read the online reviews first (even though most of them are positive), because after reading many newspaper and literary reviews, I was under the impression that this book was completely different. I read it in one day, yet halfway through I found myself saying, &quot;Is this ever going to get to GOOD?&quot; I agree, many of the events in the book are highly disturbing: my stomach wrenched, my heart beat unsteadily. But at the end of the day, I was lead to believe (not only by the reviews I had read but also by the inside flap) that this book was somewhat of a dark comedy/thriller about a man's fascination with linguistics and his quest to teach his dog to speak (or communicate). I was prepared for a gripping scientific thriller filled with pages filled with his work and progress with the dog -- how maybe his hard work would come to some fruition. Instead I found a weepy, emotional, depressing account of the life Paul Iverson had with his emotially disturbed dead wife. Blah blah blah. Moreover, though Ms. Parkhurst is a talented writer, I do not believe she should have attempted to write this book from a man's point of view. At times it read too feminine, too dramatic, too emotional and too sensitive to be written from a male's first person perspective. By the end of the book, I felt exhausted and haunted by this tale -- and not in a good way.P.S. Any dog lover will be horrified at some of the happenings in this book. Be prepared."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I'm a sucker for animal-centric stories, and so when I heard about this book, I grabbed it immediately. I had already read a book about talking dogs, I might add: Kirsten Bakis's \\"The Lives of the Monster Dogs\\" -- which, fair warning, is nothing whatsoever like \\"The Dogs of Babel\\". But in any case, I found Parkhurst's novel to be touching and engaging, but in the end, only good, and not great.I agree with some readers that the digressions into the strange subculture of scientific alterations / experiments to make dogs talk were not necessarily beneficial to the more central story of how Paul deals with his grief. But I congratulate Parkhurst for the audacity of those plot elements (the most similar point of tangence with Bakis's novel, by the way). Ultimately, however, I felt it just wasn't *quite* well enough written for my highest rating. It was very good, but dialog was often not quite believable, and despite some reviewers praise of the characterization, I thought some of it left a little to be desired. For instance (and this isn't a trivial point either), I find it difficult to believe that a linguist, even one in the grips of the ultimate grief, would decide that he could teach a dog to talk. Still, \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" and all that ...All that being said, however, I think it was a very good novel, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I have never read a book like this before. I picked it up because I thought the cover looked interesting and because, well, I like dogs :) After reading the description I knew I had to read it. It just sounded too interesting! A man trys to teach his dog to talk to find out how his wife dies...you know you want to know how THAT turns out! What I found was a REALLY interesting story about dog psychology, love, friendship, tragedy, and...well, a VERY weird and obsurd secret society. I really don't want to give anything away, but if you have any interest at all in this book, but you are wondering if you really do want to read it....just get it you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"After a long period of time of completely disliking this book and not being able to put into words why, one day I sudden realized exactly why I hated it so much. Out of the blue it came to me that Lexy is a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, (which you can Google for more information), but in short, it is a term coined by film critic Nathan Rabin to describe a girl who is idealized in media to be \\"perfect,\\" but in actually, would be considered crazy in real life.Never is it really suggested that her mental instability had any kind of negative impact on their lives. Sure, they had good times and bad times, and sure Paul understandably would be grieving for his lost wife, but... she was crazy. Maybe he just needed a little bit more time to realize that, yes, it's a tragedy that he had to lose a loved one, but in the long run he might be better off in a healthier relationship with a more stable person. Paul idealizes this crazy wife of his even though she was, clearly, not a great person to be in a long-term relationship with. With just a few lines like that added towards the end, I might have been more forgiving towards this book.To be fair, I have to admit that I did end up finishing the book, as opposed to just chucking it in disgust. It did have a certain amount of pull that I wanted to at least finish it up to see how it ends, and you may find yourself more satisfied with the end than I was. You may also find yourself far less annoyed than I was with the Lexy character, and if so, then the book overall will definitely be more enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but I really, really didn't. The premise is interesting - it sounded a bit John Irving-esque - but the execution was just bad. Though this is purportedly a love story, the characters are flat and lifeless, and I felt no empathy for them or their story. The character of Lexy appeared to be trying too hard (I think I met her in a women's studies class in college). And I felt as though the author was terribly manipulative in the way in which she described the relationship between the couple. None of it seemed real. I kept waiting, but the book never really got worth reading."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Great read. I became very attached to the narrator, Paul, Lexy, his wife, and their dog, Lorelei. Obviously, Carolyn Parkhurst has a dog as she pulls on the heartstrings on anyone who has ever loved one. The book makes the reader laugh but also feel great sympathy and sadness; also a lot of worry about Lorelei.Actually the relationship of Paul and Lexy reminds me of the new sit com, Committed. Two people so in love yet coming from two very different interior worlds.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is the type of book that is rare...a story that seems literary, yet very entertaining to read.You don't even have to read what the book is about. When you read the excerpt, you are drawn into the two main characters.The lady in the story, Lexy, is so expertly crafted that I found myself thinking about her as a real person. A person I could have genuine feelings for. The narrator, Paul, seems just as real.This book also is easier to read with the chapters being shorter than most literary novels.And, it seems that the Today Show Book Club knows how to pick 'em."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"When I first picked up the book, I had no idea what to expect, and the first few chapters where very interesting and drawed the reader in. But what happened next was a roller coaster ride of a mourning person's feelings and emotions in being left behind. I do agree that if you love animals that there is some parts of this story that will upset you. But the overall book is wonderful, and it reminds me of Lovely Bones, in the fact that it shows how people deal with death after their loved ones are gone."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I read this book in one night--I couldn't put it down. It has got to be one of the most amazing books I've ever read (and I've read plenty). The overarching sadness and the search for answers to love and loss is captured in near perfect prose, and I sat in bed sobbing as I reached the end.The premise is beautiful and the writing clever and as magical as the masks the dead woman creates. Paul's grief and yearning is palpable. Lexy's emotional rollercoaster is frighteningly real.Some criticize the book's plot or turns as \\"unrealistic,\\" but I find it's the near fairy tale quality of the story that enables the writer to convey the jagged truths and heartaches of the story. Lexy lives in a world of myths and legends, she grew up listening to horrifying children's tales. This book is a modern fairy tale, or as near to American Magical Realism as I've found--and isn't it in the nature of the fairy tale or the tales of Grimm to convey a lesson or moral through a magical ensemble of characters?Paul's search is for the truth of Lexy's death: was it an accident, or did she kill herself? What sense does either option make? What sense is he to make of the aftermath--the emptiness, the grief, the uncertainty of his world?Anyone who has watched a loved one suffering from depression, or from self-doubt, anyone who has lost a loved one and asked why? why? why? will find the book agonizing, but also strangely soothing.Can't we all identify on some level with the widower, alone in the darkness of an empty night, reaching out to a stranger and desparately seeking for answers to the haunting questions we are so often too frightened to utter?"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"A *beautifully* written story about grief, coping, love, and the effects of depression. I read constantly, and this is the first story in ages that has had a strong effect on me. It is, as others have said, incredibly sad, but it is told with such amazing honesty that it's worth the tears you will, no doubt, shed."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Parkhurst gets off to a great start with an intriguing premise (which I won't repeat, as other Amazonians have covered it). I actually fell for the innovative plot she seemed to be constructing, and I kept wading through uninspired, flat descriptions of a courtship that was supposed to be moving, thinking there would be an emotional payoff eventually. I'm an animal lover who has rescued multiple dogs over the years, but I could tolerate the scenes of animal cruelty for the sake of plot or character development. What I couldn't tolerate was the amateur, unconvincing dialogue (\\" 'God, Lexy,' I said, and this time I couldn't keep the anger out of my voice. 'Do you know what it's been like for me, sitting here all night, not knowing if you were alive or dead?' \\"), the one-dimensional characterization (get it? Lexy was kooky and spontaneous and Paul was stilted and overly rigid? If you didn't get it, don't worry; Parkhurst will tell you again. And then again), and the symbolism so overt that it seems the author believes her readers are just too stupid to understand nuance. This is a novel that tries too hard and trusts its reader too little. I will say one positive thing: the denouement, in which Paul understands the truth behind his wife's death and comes to terms with it, is surprisingly thoughtful in its treatment of the existential separateness within even our most intimate relationships."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Just reread Dogs of Babel, years after the first time. Very compelling story and real characters. The writing is so good that you forget you are actually reading a book. Thank you Carolyn Pankhurst. I loved this book!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Grieving hearts, talking dogs, and crazy people. Basically, those are the characters that populate this wonderful novel by Caroline Parkhurst. It is a good read, but thankfully, it is a short read. Almost guaranteed to put the reader into a state of melancholy, the plot is very daring and original.Here we have an emotionally unstable woman who dies. Her husband begins to wonder whether it was suicide or accidental. Unfortunately, the only living witness, the only one who knows, is the woman's Rhodesian Ridgeback, Lorelei. Her husband, a college professor named Paul Iverson, embarks on a project to teach the dog to talk.Perhaps it is the grief and the sadness that could drive an educated man to sink to such a low level of rationality. Yes, the actions of the husband, are irrational. However, that does not make for an implausible plot. That may be one of the main themes in the story. That feelings of sadness and of grief can cause people to do irrational things.In his desperation to teach Lorelei to speak, Paul makes contact with an underground group called the Cerberus Society. The Society has been secretly performing surgery on dogs in order to physically alter their vocal cords. The goal being to give them the ability to speak. Needless to say, a lot of \\"subjects\\" die from these covert surgical procedures. The subjects who do survive end up physically grotesque, and at best can only make pitiful sounds that are not even close to human speech. The procedure usually end up killing the dogs. This is obviously a group of people who should be arrested and charged with animal cruelty. Paul's insanity and his desperation puts Lorelei in danger. We eventually learn that when she was a puppy, Lorelei was scheduled for an \\"operation\\", but luckily she found a way to escape. Paul's wife later found her at her doorsteps, took her in, and raised her. Through Paul's conversations with the group, they have now learned that Lorelei was one of their escaped patients and would like nothing better than to get her back on to the operating table.Perhaps the most sane, and the only likeable character in this tale is the Ridgeback, Lorelei. Apparently, a movie script is in the works and a movie may not be too far away. And what a challenge it will be to find a \\"dog actor\\" to play the part of Lorelei, since she is in most of the scenes. I just hope this will not cause people to buy this breed of dog on impulse. I recall the increase in demand for Rottweilers after The Omen came out. People with very little knowledge started breeding their dogs in the interest of making a quick buck. Lots of people who were not able to properly care for such a wonderful, intelligent breed ended up buying them on impulse. The dogs ended up paying the price.This book is certainly worth your while. But please, do not read it if you are already feeling low or depressed. While I like getting caught and captivated within the plot, I would prefer not to feel down during this time of the year. The story is powerful. Yes, there are light moments, but they are few and far between. The story is masterfully crafted and told. It is an easy read. You can easily finish the book in one weekend, with time to ponder between the pages.UPDATE: The comedian, Steve Carell, has agreed to play the part of Paul Iverson. Hopefully we will see this on the big screen in the very near future. I would have picked Paul Walker for the role, but I'm sure Carell would also do a good job."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The story of a man searching for answers in the mysterious death of his wife has been told before - many times. But never, in my reading anyway, has it been told quite like Carolyn Parkhurst tells it in \\"The Dogs of Babel.\\"It's the tale of Paul Iverson, whose wife Lexy dies when she falls out of the high branches of a tree. The only witness to the event is their dog, Lorelei. The death is ruled as accidental, and the only reasons Paul has to question that are vague suggestions - a rearranged bookshelf, a steak seemingly cooked just for the dog, and a voice heard on a late-night psychic call-in show. Paul, a linguist by trade, decides that his only recourse is to teach Lorelei to talk, so she can tell him what she saw.If it sounds far-fetched, it should. \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" is about many things, but of course a big part of the story is about grief and the extremes it can push us to. For the grieving, the insane can seem perfectly reasonable. Teaching a dog to talk, for example, can seem plausible and even achievable. Paul's motivations, while heartbreaking, are always clear. The conclusion of the novel is not a \\"big twist\\" ending, though there are surprises in store to be sure, and the ending satisfies both in terms of plot and emotional resonance.\\"The Dogs of Babel\\" unfolds like an origami crane, detail by detail, until all is revealed. Careful and measured and crafted almost to perfection, it is a marvel of subtlety and grace in storytelling. The language of the book has a cadence and a beauty that is rare in modern fiction. I was reminded at times of Alice Sebold's \\"Lovely Bones\\" for the mystical quality of the prose, at other times of Jose Saramago's \\"Stone Raft\\" for its odd sense of surrealism - both books I admire deeply. Simply put, this is a beautiful book.Lyrical, surprising, engaging, moving, and enlightening - \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" is all of these and more. It resonates and echoes in the heart with an honesty few books ever find. Other books about grief and loss and the quest for answers wish they could be this book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Stylistically, this book reminded me a lot of The Lovely Bones. However, The Lovely Bones took a couple weeks of gestation to really start to appreciate it, whereas this book pretty much hit me from the start. This is one of the saddest books I have ever read, and while I think anyone who has ever loved will find the heartbreak in this book wrenching, those who are married will find it nearly unbearable. In a good way."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Even though it's been a few months since I finished this book, I wanted to get my thoughts out there. I read this book after reading Parkhurst's other book, Lost and Found, because I had so enjoyed her writing and couldn't wait to see how she took such an incredibly out-there topic.Dogs of Babel is intriguing, because it's such an impossible story, and yet you find yourself caught up with the idea that it can, indeed, be possible. At least I was. I was taken with the story from the beginning and got really into it. I am, for the record, a dog lover, so I was, perhaps, by default, biased in that favor.At times during the tale, my interest waned. There was no particular reason I could pinpoint; it just lost some of the initial energy.For that reason, I definitely liked Lost and Found better. But I was thankful that my enjoyment of Parkhurst's writing style still remained. I am looking forward to her next book. Whatever it may be about, I can be pretty sure it'll be something someone else hasn't tried, or succeeded with, before."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I wish I could give this book higher than a five. Or I wish I could go back to all the other books I've ever rated and knock them down a notch. Nothing I've read before quite matches up to this book.I browsed through some other ratings online, before I started reading the book, and was surprised at the amount of people who rolled their eyes at the topic. I immediately knew it was a good topic for me. So many times I've wanted to know what my own dogs were thinking, and I think it was a nice, fresh subject that hasn't been covered in every other book before. I think I was hooked before I even opened the book. Many people balked at the fact that Paul would try to teach his dog to talk, or that he would call a psychic. I immediately thought that he should call a pyschic, so none of this was shocking to me.I think the story was beautifully written. The only part I could have done without is the story about (and friends of) Hollis Wendel, but not because I don't think they add something to the book, but because I personally cannot handle any type of animal abuse.I loved the flashbacks into how Lexy and Paul met and how they became married, and all the flashbacks into their marriage. I think it really leant something special to the book, though I will admit that sometimes I just wanted to get back to the story at hand just beause it was so good or it was at that special point where you just have to know what happens next. But take that with a grain of salt, it's not that the flashbacks weren't good and weren't worth reading, just that I was so drawn in by the story, that I would think, \\"Can't we put off this flahsback for a chapter or two until I find out what happens to...?\\"The cover of the book says it rises to a point of stirring, peaceful grace, and I hoped I would know when that point was, and of course I did. I wish I could say it was as peaceful for me though. It wasn't. I haven't cried over a book in years and didn't expect to anytime soon. I think I've never gotten to \\"know\\" the characters as deeply as felt I knew Paul, Lexy, and Lorelei. I started crying when Paul found out what Lorelei was trying to say all along. I started crying again when he finally found out what the books meant. I started crying again when I found out the importance of the steak. My heart broke more than once for Lorelei, not only when you find out what she did for Lexy (when Paul decided to see what the view was like), but also, for how she must have felt when she got out of that doggy door. She must have been confused and scared, and I just wanted to be there to console her. I know how odd this all sounds. Again, I can only stress just how entrancced I was by this story. I will also confess that a lot of my tears stemmed from my own fears and wondering how I could continue to go on if I were to lose my husband. It seems unfathonable, and in that way, my heart also broke for Paul, for Lexy, who got to \\"that\\" point, and for the love that they shared and was lost.At the end of the book, after deciding not to open the front cover and start reading it all over again, I thought about starting a different book, even though I'd already been reading for four hours and it was almost midnight, and way too late for me, but I just couldn't do it. I felt it would be \\"disrespectful\\" to how amazing this book was, and I know that may seem odd, but all I can say is that I got to the point where I thought Paul and Lexy and Lorelei were real people out there somewhere and my heart broke for their story. I've never been touched by a book like this before. I had to keep reminding myself after I'd finished reading it, that this was a book of fiction, and there was no reason for me to be so upset.In the end, I didn't go back to the first page and start again, and I do plan on picking up another book today, but none of them quite seem worth reading anymore. It's that feeling when you finish such an amazing book, you just know no other will ever be able to top it, and so you're no longer as excited about reading them anymore. I am though, going to hold onto this book, as I think one day at some point I'm going to start from the beginning again."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is one case where I definitely agree with the critics rather than the vast majority of readers. As the critics said, the premise of this book is captivating; a man's wife falls to her death, and the only witness is the family dog. Was it an accident, suicide, murder? The man decides to teach the dog to speak so he can find out what really happened. Unfortunately, this plot line is given very little space in the novel. The book is actually just a long-winded bit of sad recollection as the man remembers his dead wife. The part about teaching the dog to speak takes up perhaps 10% of the book, and never goes very far at all. Also, the reader is given a bit of a mystery to solve regarding something the wife did on her final day. This sob-plot would also be interesting, but it's basically an unsolveable riddle. When the main character did solve it, I nearly laughed out loud because the entire premise was so ridiculous. Instead of being groundbreaking or intriguing, this book is basically a long rant about love, loss and grief. While some parts are poignant and touching, several critics have hit the nail on the head when they said that the dead wife was such an eccentric nut that it was difficult to care much about her."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This novel fits into no category. It stands alone as an homage to grief and a search to undrstand the mystery of a loved one's death.Lorelei, the family dog, is the only witness to Lexy's fall to her death. Perhaps, though, she did not fall but jumped in an intentional act of suicide. Paul, Lexy's husband and a linguist, decides he must find the answers to Lexy's death from Lorelei. It's here, in Paul's silent grief with no words, that he decides to teach his dog Lorelei to talk.The book then takes a turn to the macabre (think Max Ernst meets Mengele). It is actually desperation disguised as hope. As Paul loses himself, it's as though he's falling into a hell where communication is filled with charged images and nightmares reflected back like distorted mirrors in a circus.Lexy, an artist and mask-maker is the counterpart to the real. Her masks depict our many selves and the selves that others choose for us. Towards the end of her life she becomes immersed in the creation of death masks, creating beautiful, transcendent renditions of a symbolic life to be savored by loved one's left behind.What this book sometims lacks in cohesion, is made up for in the brilliance of how it communicates Paul's fall and ultimate transcendence of the spirit. As the poet Roethke says, \\"What is madness but nobility of the soul at odds with circumstance\\".Not only is this an amazing first novel, it is an amazing novel on its own. I recommend this book very highly."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I found that I couldn't put this book down. I finished it in about 2 hours.

Who cares if one or two of the plot points were a little far-fetched? Not me! Did I enjoy it? Yes. Did it make me laugh? Yes. Cry? ALMOST! Think? Most definitely. Would I recommend it? Yes, especially to Ridgeback owners - they'll recognized their sweet dogs in Lorelei.This book has been compared to The Lovely Bones ... to me, there's no comparison.

The originality of this book is to admire. I'm not a real fan of novels that have animals as a center peace, but the suspense of this story, the thrilling feeling that I got from reading it and the desire of wanting to find the truth, made me wished, after finishing it, that I had read it more slowly, so that I could have felt it longer. A book about a man that is trying to coupe with the lost of a loved one and at the same time trying to find out the truth behind her misterious death. A dog that hides truth behind her eyes after being the only witness of its master's death. For people that welcome possibility into their lives, this book its an original and refreshing peace of work."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"&quot;The Dogs of Babel, by Carolyn Parkhurst, is--in my opinion--a unique blending of the writing styles of Nicholas Sparks and Stephen King, however unlikely that may seem.

The book focuses on the experience of loss and aid of the company of a dog, a true companion. The author has an exceptional way of allowing the reader to fully experience the emotions that run through the main character, a linguist who tries to teach his dog to &quot;talk&quot; so that she may reveal the mystery behind his wife's death. His attempts lead him in a completely different direction than he intended, but they ultimately accomplish his goal. It was difficult to put this mystery book down once I began reading it."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book is powerful in the sense that a man is looking for the reason on why his wife died, from his wife's dog. It is a testimoney to the love of a man and a woman which is overshadowed by many dark and light pathos, plus of the innocence and love of animals. Their dedication and loyalty. For a person like myself, who has done rescue work for abused dogs, parts of this book were extrenely hard for me to read. But the ending is beautiful.....This is a a really good read and takes you thru a wide spectrum of emotions. Highly recommended. This is a whole new view towards relationships in writing today. GM"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I was surprised at how beautifully this book treated the relationship between humans and dogs. Again, as another reviewer has said, why must an author avoid an unpleasant subject matter, such as animal abuse? Does that mean that no books should be written about child abuse or the Holocaust, for example? Anyway, the only thing &quot;missing&quot; from the novel was an examination of Lexy's past. I thought that was strange. But it was simply a presentation of a mentally disturbed person's symptoms, no explanations, and perhaps that is all right, after all. I felt so sad as I read the novel; it was almost like listening to sensitive classical music that is perfectly tuned to make us feel sorrow. And I also appreciated the writer's ability to turn the prose chilly, and frighten the reader, in the scenes with the animal abusers. There were moments when you condemned Lexy, and Paul, too, but by the end you were sympathetic to all the characters. They got under your skin - and that includes Lorelei, the dog. Wonderful book, cudos to the gifted author."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"A dog is the only witness to a woman's mysterious death, and her grieving husband is determined to teach the dog to speak in order to learn what really happened. The story goes back to when the couple first met, chronicling their relationship from its happiest to its gradually more unhappy days, until it's determined what really happened to Lexy. It's an engrossing read, although I surmised from about the first twenty pages what the main character refuses to admit until the very end."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"There are few books which will consistently grab at your very heart and soul all the way throughout the story. \\"The Dogs of Babel\\", fortunately, is one of the few. From the beginning, you become amazingly entranced with the plight of Paul Iverson, thanks in large part, to Parkhurst's uncanny ability to make both his inner and outer dialogues resemble a man who we would probably meet within our lifetime. Paul's emotions throughout this book become the reader's, and at times, the experiences can be very moving as both the reader and Paul move through towards understanding what happened to his late wife.This book is not only a reflection on the process of grief, but also on the intricate network of emotions produced through any single instant. Parkhurst is extremely talented in showcasing humanity for what it is in all its fluctuations of ups and downs, and in the end, we are left with a witty, poignant, and touching tale. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"What a melancholy read! Paul is a trustworthy narrator, sinking deeper and deeper into his own grief. Lexy is a natrual tragic chacracter. Both of these characters create a work of domestic bliss as well as tragedy. Not a happy read by far, this work will make you look at the secrets of married life in a new way."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This made for great book club discussion. Well written. The whole idea that you could work with a dog in a variety of different ways to get him/her to talk is used as a device in the book to show how grief can overwhelm a person's sensibilities - at least that was my take. Others were more disturbed by the work on and with the dogs. Still, this is a very clever, engaging read."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is a wonderful beach read that stays with you. On the surface, it is a story of mystery and romance--but digging deeper, it looks at relationships between men and women, scholars and artists, and people and their pets.It is a well written page turner that is hard to put down. I would reccommend it both for plane trips and book group disscussions."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"One of the moist poignant stories about grief I have ever read. Parkhurst skillfully weaves a simple tale whose meaning goes beyond the story of Paul's quest for the truth. The characters are multidimensional, her use of language is lyrical, and by the end, the reader is left with the experience of a satisifying journey."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Carolyn Parkhurst's The Dogs of Babel is one of the most unusual and compelling novels I have read in a very long time.The basic structure of the story revolves around the efforts of the narrator, one Dr. Paul Iverson, an academic linguist, to determine the exact circumstances of the death of his wife, who fell out of their backyard apple tree. The authorities are happy to cite it as an accident, but Paul observes \\"anomalies\\", as he calls them, that raise questions in his mind as to the veracity of the accident finding.Paul sets his sights on the family dog, Lorelei, the only witness (or is she) to the event. He determines he will teach his dog to talk to learn the facts.The device sounds both ridiculous and contrived-and is in fact both-a fact that notwithstanding has no adverse affect on one's enjoyment of the novel. That such is the case says much about Parkhurst's skills as a writer. The voice of Paul is so strongly developed and overwhelming in its pathos that one is willing drawn into this book despite the patent absurdity o much of its underlying \\"logic\\".This is a complex book. It is a novel of love and loss, the devolution into insanity and anomie, the structures and codes inherent in language and, ultimately, it is a mystery story. The mystery is not, however, the obvious one that the book posits at the very beginning, namely \\"accident or suicide?\\" Although that question isn't in fact answered definitively till the very end of the novel, the presumption of the answer is clear early on. However, what isn't clear early on is the actual mystery of the origins of the motivation's implicit in the event.One should be warned that there are some genuinely repulsive aspects to the book surrounding the actions and effects of a local society also trying-through means radically different from Paul's-to effect speech in animals. There are several aspects of animal cruelty involved that can be very off-putting. Those who don't handle such matters well are advised to think twice about this book.The novel has many of the usual shortcomings of the first novel-some of the \\"coincidences\\" that drive the story are highly contrived. Many secondary characters-heck, virtually all of them-are little more than caricatures. Some scene transitions are uneven at best.All of which counts for nothing in the end. There were times this book was so upsetting I put it down in disgust-only to pick it up again almost immediately and dive in once again. This is a book that grabs you by the throat and won't let go. It is a very sad and melancholy work. Nevertheless, the resolution-to the degree there is any-is, in the end, both very moving and extraordinarily satisfying.This is a rare and wondrous read."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel is one of the more remarkable debut novels of recent memory, a story with a fascinating premise that engulfed me in a beautifully tragic exploration of grief and the very human search for meaning in life and death. When I saw that the book involved a man trying to teach a dog to talk, I had to check it out. There's a good reason why Paul Iverson wants to teach his dog Lorelai to communicate with him - the dog is the only witness to his wife's extremely peculiar death. Life seemed normal for Paul and his wife Lexy, until the day Lexy fell to her death from the top of an apple tree in the backyard. The death was ruled an accident, but Paul is thrown for a loop by the tragedy and seeks answers to many questions. Why would his wife have climbed the tree in the first place? Was it really an accident, or did she kill herself? What did he do wrong? Was her death somehow his fault? And why did she leave behind several strange incongruities in the house on the morning before she died. Paul's bookshelf, for example, had been rearranged. There has to be meaning in these things, Paul believes. The only possible source for answers is Lorelai, the dog that belonged to Lexy even before they were married. She had been there in the yard, she had seen what happened, and maybe he could figure out a way to learn what Lorelai saw that awful day.Paul is a linguist by profession, and he gets the idea of trying to teach his dog how to talk; he even manages to make his mad idea into a bonafide project of his academic pursuits - even though his colleagues come to think that his wife's death has thrown him off his rocker. As the story progresses, we get to know Lexy through Paul's vivid memories of his time with her. She was what you might call a free spirit, the kind of woman who talks Paul into driving to Disneyland on their first date (which ends up lasting a full week). An artist by nature and profession, Lexy clearly saw the world in a unique way, and we can see why Paul fell in love with her so deeply. It becomes ever more apparent, though, that Lexy's oversensitive nature was quite fragile and that she harbored some pretty dark and possibly debilitating inner demons. It makes for a most tragic examination of the life of Paul and Lexy and casts an ever darker pall on the tragedy of her death.Paul's attempts to enable Lorelai to tell him what happened are also increasingly strange and disturbing. The flash cards, the attempts to associate words for things Lorelai can understand, even a special keyboard for hoped-for canine communication are understandable, but the documented case of a talking dog named Dog J and Paul's encounter with a group of people using radical surgery to enable dogs to make human sounds is pretty weird. As matters play out, it also adds an even greater weight of sorrow and remorse to the whole story.This novel will have an emotional effect on most readers. You can't just put The Dogs of Babel away and never think about it again, as it will remain in your thoughts for some time. This voyeuristic look into Paul's emotional struggles with grief and the extraordinary way in which he seeks solace is quite touching and, at times, heart-wrenching. And there's not any real nugget of meaning to take away from the encounter. Knowing what happened doesn't necessarily explain what happened, nor does it necessarily bring peace or even cloture to the reader. It's really impossible to describe the emotional plateau this story plays out on; it's sad, wondrous, and quite unforgettable. Carolyn Parkhurst is a virtual literary poet who just so happens to write in a narrative framework - but I would argue that The Dogs of Babel is in fact a sort of poetry, for only poetry in its purest form can touch your heart and mind this deeply. This is a brilliant novel."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"\\"The Dogs of Babel\\" was a fantastic debut from author, Carolyn Parkhurst. I'm hoping to discover more of her works in the years to come. I was easily able to sit and read this book in a matter of just a few hours while on vacation. At times, it was even hard to put down.I had originally picked up the book because I thought that it would prove to be an interesting mystery. However, I soon discovered that the book was less about a mystery and more about relationships. Not only the relationship between lovers, but also the relationship between people and dogs. It truly brought out the animal lover in me, and for that, I'm grateful.To tell you anything further in a review may ruin the story for readers who have not yet had the opportunity to experience \\"The Dogs of Babel,\\" so I will leave my review short. Thank you for a \\"simple\\" yet entertaining read, Ms. Parkhurst."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Those reviewers labeling Lexy kooky, eccentric, immature and self-absorbed have obviously not had the experience of loving someone who suffers from mental illness and suicidal feelings. Unfortunately, \\"signs\\" that could have been picked up on in life often do not become clear until death.Paul's grief is so great that he's moved to do the absurd (teach Lorelai to talk, meet with Cerebus Society) to find answers. The animal torture was difficult to read, but added much to the parralleled torture of Paul's anguish. Its gravity was the vehicle needed to bring Paul around to the realization that his grief has been clouding his judgement, jeopardizing his work and friendships, distorting his memories and love for Lexy ... he was suffocating, but to absorbed in the \\"quest\\" to realize it.I would have cut the last few graphs, but otherwise I was pleased with an anti-climactic ending that mirrored life."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is an extremely enjoyable story for those of us who have entertained the thought that our dogs are trying so hard to communicate with us vocally, why not teach them to talk? Ultimately a life-story about the non-verbal side of relationships between man, woman and dog, and what we assume, but can really never know without examination of the heart. Parkhurst takes this theme even one step further by entwining a bizarrely macabre tale of a \\"clinical\\" discussion in her story-line of the supposed \\"science' of canine speech. She winds up taking a rather tragic topic and amusing us with the very typical anthropomorphising that dog-lovers everywhere, often subject themselves to. I found myself (finally) loving the fact that my dog can't talk - making her that much more charming."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is a book I got for Christmas. A pollyanna gift of different books. I would not have chosen it for myself, but I loved it!! I traded it around the office and it provoked many conversations on grief, the depths of grief, and finally, getting on with life. It was a very well written book. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This was truly an amazing novel about both a man and a woman's quest to find themselves, and, in the husband's case, to also \\"find\\" his wife (physically as well as metaphorically). Both characters learn to accept themselves and their circumstances by the end of the novel, but to tragic ends.It's refreshing to read the other thoughtful reviews on this website because I've read some rewiews that say the novel focuses on animal cruelty, which is to completely miss the major themes and imagery in the novel. But, for those readers to say that they were affected by the novel is to say just that: they were affected.Dogs of Babel is definitely a must read! Poignant and heart-breaking, this novel will move you. I've already recommended it to everyone I know, but I'm not willing to loan out my own copy just yet."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Those who denounce this book because of its references to animal cruelty have missed the message entirely. The true story - a beautiful love story - follows the grief-stricken Paul as he tries to understand what happened to Lexy on the day that she died. Lorelei, their Rhodesian Ridgeback, is not only the only witness to Lexy's death, but is also Paul's last living, breathing link to his late wife. As such, Paul tries everything he can to uncover the truth, and resolves to teaching Lorelei to talk, so he can have closure about Lexy's death. The Dogs of Babel becomes truly gripping and meaningful as we watch Paul, in his grief and desperation, lose touch with reality in order to uncover information about Lexy's death that only Lorelei knows.To take this literally is to overlook what I feel is the true meaning of the book. Either it demonstrates to the readers the extent of Paul's grief and disturbance, or it serves as a means to make the book into a bit of a fable. The author has woven in elements of fables throughout the novel, most noticeably the Tam Lin poem or rhyme from Lexy's childhood. The fable characteristic combined with Paul's outlandish tactics in uncovering the mystery create a rich and graceful message that is certainly worthwhile."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"If you've ever had a dog companion, you will feel this book to your very soul.If you haven't, you will still have a hard time not feeling the weight and sadness of this story.Without telling you too much of the story line, just know that it is a sad story about love, loss, and animal companionship. There is a difficult part towards the end, if you love animals. I do, and it made me cry, but hang in there, you can get through it!This book was forced upon me by a colleague (who didn't cry when she read it), and at first I was skeptical that I would like it. I'm so glad I read it. Give it a try."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Since there is no need to repeat a synopsis of this plot, I would like, instead, to applaud Ms. Parkhurst's novel because it does not conform to the strict formula of \\"realism\\" that is now a prerequisite for mainstream literary fiction.THE DOGS OF BABEL reminded me of the new wave of fabulation literature by writers like Jonathan Carroll. While I realize that DOGS is not a fantasy, it actually uses many devices of contemporary speculative fiction.As the story progresses, we see the tragically flawed Lexy change from an innocent eccentric to a woman who seems to live in a crosshatch between our reality and some other dark world just outside our reach.The same is true with Paul's encounter with the \\"dog cult\\".Most reviewers have belittled Parkhurst's inclusion of this material, but I think that it once again demonstrates how utterly alien Paul's unwanted \\"Special World\\" (a la Joseph Campbell) has become.I think that many of us have found ourselves suddenly thrown into a group or society that is so foreign that it seems surreal. Paul has to be thinking, \\"Can it get much stranger than this?\\" The critics and many readers did not like this; I thought that it was a great way to show how out-of-control Paul's new life had become.My disappointment in the novel was the lack of depth of Paul's character. While he certainly deserves sympathy, there was not enough emotional depth there. And I think Parkhurst could have used his background in linguistics to greatly enhance a (very good) novel."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I also loved every minute of The Dogs of Babel. The writing is beautiful and the story carried me along. I tried to pace myself because I didn't want the book to end, but I couldn't put it down. It's rare to read such a combination, a story that is both unique and heartfelt. Yes, there are some quirks, but they are part of the tapestry of the characters and what makes life, life. The book's greatest achievement is conveying the characters' emotions. I really got caught up in the details and the grief and the love, and had a clear picture of it on every page. The novel's twists and turns never seemed overly contrived to be, but seemed part of the curious surprises that life throws our way. The book is wonderfully structured in its narration, letting us glimpse past and present together with hints of what is to come. I thoroughly enjoyed this great debut novel and look forward to more from this writer."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I found this book to be so romantic in the telling of Paul and Alex's love story. And it was also one of the saddest books I've ever read. It's about love and loss and dealing with all the things that come in between. And yes, the dog in the story is so sweet and I was on the edge of my seat hoping and praying everything would turn out okay. I loved this book and am all the better for having read it. It's also one of the most heartwrenching books I've ever read. Just wonderful"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"An incredibly moving saga of the continuum of grief, the Dogs of Babel captured my interest from the first page and rarely did it let go. There are ethereal, beautiful scenes in this story that are generally found only in dreams or old Fellini movies. Those images have haunted me since I closed the cover for the last time and are part of what prompted me to write this review.The main character of Paul Iverson was crafted with deliberate attention to each minute detail; his palpable grief came across in each of his odd actions and my heart was touched by his love for the dog that he and his wife had shared. That being said, I found the character of his wife Lexy to be less compelling in that there didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to her madness, but I wonder if that was just the point. The couple's Rhodesian Ridgeback Lorelei, is the most real dog that I have ever read about in literature; her presence is a big part of what makes the book so good. Another reason are the very clever surprises that come out just when you least expect it.I suggest this book to readers who enjoy a sentimental story, but just make sure you sit with a box of tissues at your side.Nicole Flowers"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"\\"And I find, more and more, as the days go by and the balm of my forgiveness washes over the cracked and parched surface of my heart, I find that remembering her as she was is a gift I can give us both.\\" Carolyn Parkhurst's The Dogs of Babel provides wisdom and insight in t midst of a tragedy. Her use of originative creativity makes the novel an authentic page-turner.In The Dogs of Babel, Paul Iverson's lifestyle becomes dramatically altered when he comes home from work one day to find that his wife, Lexy, mysteriously died. Nobody was around to witness except for the dog, Lorelei. In the time following the accident, Paul becomes determined to uncover the strange clues around the house to reveal what happened to his wife. Paul becomes certain that by training Lorelei to talk, he can uncover what happened to Lexy. While Paul investigates, he thinks back on all the memories of his life with his spouse.When looking at the plot of the book, the setting comes into play. If Lexy never fell from the tree, the story's purpose would prove itself useless. For example, if someone other than Lorelei had been nearby to witness the \\"apple tree\\" incident, how could the plat possibly amount to anything?Although Parkhurst uses a unique method of drawing the reader into the plot, certain clues seem to give away future events. A representation of this occurs when Paul reveals that Lexy had told him \\"during the sweet, breath holding time of their engagement\\" there \\"had been moments in their life when she had thought about killing herself\\". This statement automatically makes one start to wonder if perhaps Lexy's enigmatical death is suicidal.For the most part, Parkhurst demonstrates an excellent job of elaborating on the high points of Paul and Lexy's love life, but a few instances occur where the topic being stated can be brought out more. One such occurrence is a small anecdote of their wedding, which is all said and done in approximately three sentences. Although Parkhurst's use of figurative language creates a very vivid picture of the \\"small and lovely\\" wedding, most readers wish for a more complete story.All in all, The Dogs of Babel by Carolyn Parkhurst proves itself to be a novel whose purpose thrives on keeping individuals up all night reading and questioning what comes next. While a few minor flaws remain evident, the novel should not be pushed to the back of the bookshelf to collect dust. Although the plot tends to be easily predicted, high points make if a quite enjoyable book. The Dogs of Babel captivates the hearts of readers and inspires them to stop \\"looking through eyes of clay\\" and \\"find the truth held all along\\"."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The first one hundred pages were wonderful. I really enjoyed the authors writing style. I was so into it that I actually forgot that this was fiction. I was very disturbed by the discription of the Cerebus Society, the treatment of the animals, the description of Dog J, and what happens with Loreli. I felt that took away from my enjoyment of the book.This is a book that has a good concept, starts out well, but make a wrong turn in the middle that causes me to not enjoy it."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"A beautifully well-crafted tale of loss. In exploring a relationship that has ended in tragedy, I found it brought to life both enormous joy and sorrow. A short read at 260 pages, I nevertheless had to put it aside several times because it was simply too much for me in a single sitting. While it occasionally had a twist that bordered on the absurd, those twists were so carefully crafted into the integrity of the story that I found them impossible not to embrace. I heartily recomend this book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Carolyn Parkhurst's The Dogs of Babel is a wonderfully powerful novel. However, although drama abounds there are enough bits and peices of humor to keep this book from being depressing.The Dogs of Babel centers around a man, distraught over the apparent suicide of his wife. The only witness to this horrible event was the family pet Lorelei. Being a linguist, Paul decides to attempt to his dog to communicate so that he can finally discover what really happened on the day of his wife's death.Overall, this book is less about teaching a dog to do the impossible and more about a man trying to come to terms with the most ultimate pain imaginable. It's about overcoming grief and loss and in a little way, it's about life.The only bad thing I have to say about this book is that somewhere past the halfway point the book strays from the premise it begins with and turns into a semi crime-drama for about 20 or 30 pages and finally returning back to the original mood of the book before the finale. However, it isn't a huge setback and doesn't disallow the book to be enjoyed.All in all, this is a great book. Powerful and written at a fast-pace. It's a great summer read. FIVE STARS!!!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book is by far the most poignant book that I have read in a very long time.

Some topics in this book may be upsetting to animal lovers, but perservere...you will be richly rewarded. I wish that there was a rating of infinite stars, because I am just in love with this book.

She had fallen out of an apple tree in the back yard. The police rule it an accident, but he has some suspicions, so he does the only thing a rational human being would do under the circumstances: he will teach his dog how to speak so that the dog can tell him what happened.This of course is completely ridiculous but at least the narrator realizes it is ridiculous so the reader is at least spared that. But he tries anyway, and that, along with the back story of how he met and romanced his wife, is the plot. Turns out the wife has some issues, mental-health wise, and if there was never a story in literature about an attractive woman with mental health problems, this might have been a little more interesting. But of course, there have been hundreds of stories like this. Better ones.Somewhere in there the narrator learns of a society of people who have dedicated their lives to teaching dogs to speak. So he meets them and there are a couple of adventures involving them and although this is mildly interesting it finally occurs to the reader that yes, this is ridiculous. Completely.Eventually he learns what happened to his wife. Frankly, the author needs to get out more. There are a lot of interesting things in the world to write about.

From my bedroom to the subway to under my desk in class, the book kept me intrigued, brought me to tears, and even afforded a few laughs.The Dogs of Babel opens with Paul, a linguistics professor, receiving news of his beloved wife&#8217;s death, which the police confirm as an accident, although Paul believes otherwise. And how better to discover the cause of your wife&#8217;s death than teaching the only witness, your family dog, to talk! I&#8217;ll admit, my love for dogs was what truly brought me to this magnificent novel, but mystery lovers and dog fanatics alike can easily be drawn in as Paul recounts the beautiful love story he and his eccentric wife shared.With surprising plot-twists woven right into adorable moments of a passionate romance, the book moves quickly, barely giving me time to recount the special moments to whoever will listen, as I needed to figure out what happened. And I did. I sat there stunned. As if I finally put together the pieces of a story my best friend was withholding from me. Parkhurst&#8217;s stunning language creates so many unforgettable images, and weeks after reading the book they still play in my head like memories.If you&#8217;re looking for a quick read, a touching tale, or just some humor about talking dogs, Parkhurst&#8217;s book is a must-read!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book is really good.

Did Lexy fall from the tall apple tree or did she jump? Her death is ruled an accident, but, if she fell, why was she up there in the first place? Plus, just before her death, Lexy reorganized the books in their library and fed Lorelei a steak; both acts were previously unheard of. Paul wants answers and hopes that Lorelei can somehow provide them. He investigates the possibility of canine speech and becomes the laughingstock of his colleagues at the university where he teaches. Meanwhile, his flashbacks to his week-long first date with Lexy and her occasional outbursts of anger provide us with a portrait of an imaginative but troubled young woman. I kept asking myself why neither Paul nor Lexy ever mentioned psychotherapy, but I guess he was in denial, and she was too embarrassed. Also, how could Lexy possibly earn a living making papier-mach&eacute; masks? Oh, well. Let's not fret the details. At least Paul's obsession with dog training abates a bit when he finds that Lexy consulted a TV fortune teller just before her death. This discovery gives him a different mission: to find out the details of that conversation. Or perhaps he can unlock the mystery by reading Lexy's dream journal, or by figuring out what the new book arrangement means. The various clues fuel Paul's quest, but I was never quite sure if grief drove his pursuit of the truth or if he just wanted closure.

It was a fun read and a theme that interested me. Her debut novel is more of a mystery, a theme that i don't often find appealing, which is why i think that i let it languish on the shelf for so many years.However, this is not so much a straightforward mystery, but told from the perspective of a grieving husband trying to figure out the details of his young wife's untimely death. Her death is never a question of foul play. Lexy, Paul's seemingly bipolar young wife, has died from falling from the top of a tree in their backyard. in the aftermath, Paul sorts through clues to determine if Lexy accidentally slipped or committed suicide.in his grief, Paul begins to fixate on Lorelei, the family dog and only witness to Lexy's death. Paul is a linguistics professor and begins to get obsessed with the idea of teaching Lorelei to communicate, specifically to speak. It sounds crazy and may be, but grief can lead to some insane ideas.Warning, this novel has a very disturbing, creepy twist. It actually made me feel sick to my stomach to read.The book has many beautifully written flashbacks, detailing Lexy and Paul relationship. i loved the theme of masks, woven in throughout. The story has many tender moments, but Lexy and Paul feel like a real couple, a couple that has many flaws. it's this rooting in reality, that balances Paul's outlandish behavior as a husband in grief and unreliable narrator. It also makes the reader relate and like both main characters, rooting for them to ultimately have a positive outcome, despite the tragedy of Lexy's death.A very well-crafted debut novel from Parkhurst. i am excited to read her future novels.Please visit my blog [...]"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This for me at least was one of those novels that after finishing I had the strong desire to immediately reread it in order to enjoy it more. It is a novel that involves mystery and love all wrapped up into one story that is told by a man trying to figure out why his life has turned out the way it has. Narrated by Paul Iverson, we see his world told through events that led up to his wife's suicide. A suicide which was witnessed by his dog Lorelei. Paul being a linguist by trade finds his grief telling him that he can teach his dog to actually speak and tell him the secrets his wife Alexandra &#34;Lexy&#34; held during her last moments alive. What I liked about this novel from te start was that it was more then a normal mystery novel. In that it explores relationships at their best and often worst moments. And it isn't merely a love story between Paul and his wife but more of a story about a man in the depths of despair and the comfort he gets from his only confidant at the moment who knew his wife just as well if maybe even more then him. This confidant just happens to be a dog. During Paul's crusade to make Lorelei speak we see events from the past tell a story of how Paul and Lexy meet and fall in love. Did she commit suicide? Was it ll just a unfortunate accident? It was a great pleasure for me to go on this journey to find out."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Okay, let's get this settled right away: This book is not about dogs, although it features a Rhodesian ridgeback named Lorelei as one of the main characters; it's not about solving a crime, although the protagonist, Paul, is ostensibly unraveling the mystery of his wife's death; and it's not about linguistics, although Paul, in the course of unraveling the mystery, tries to teach Lorelei to talk. The reader who picks the book up because of its jacket blurb or book club status may be disappointed. The Dogs of Babel is about the intimate, exquisite, and often painful relationship between two people, each locked in his or her own dysfunction. It is also one of the most poignant portraits of bipolar disorder i've ever read.I agree with other reviewers that Parkhurst's quirky plot devices, which at first draw the reader in, become a bit much as the novel progresses; however, by that time, i was thoroughly caught up in the dance of Paul and Lexy's marriage. Paul, the surviving spouse, is more engaged in understanding the relationship after his wife's death than he ever was while she was still living. And Lexy, though dead at the opening page, seems curiously more alive than Paul throughout most of the book. As for Lorelei, hers is the ancient role of the dog: to guide the spirits of the dead to their rest.I highly recommend this book to those psychologically-minded persons who enjoy exploring and understanding the range of human emotional experience."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Paul Iverson calls home from work one day to find there has been an accident.

Desperate to make sense of what happened, Paul - a linguist by profession - sets about trying to teach Lorelei to communicate what she saw that day. A long shot to say the least -- even Paul's colleagues are laughing behind his back when they get wind of his project. But the author succeeds in making the reader believe it might be possible.In addition, Paul notices certain incongruities about the house. Are they clues left behind by his late wife, or is his grief causing him to embark on a wild goose chase?The story begins in a surprisingly humorous vein but takes a much darker, even horrific turn about two thirds of the way through, and as such reminded me very much of Amanda Filipacchi's excellent novels. They also share a significant element of wordplay. This is a book which should please mystery fans and language enthusiasts alike."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"A friend told me this book had been on the USA Today bestseller list for a long time. Okay, so I read the blurb. A man teaching a dog to talk. I remember how much I loved Dean Koontz's Watchers and forked over way too much money. Certainly the author is skilled, but this book is not uplifting like The Lovely Bones. I can handle death, but when dogs are mutilated, I can't take it. What really haunts me is that the author probably saw an article about actual people who do these horrible things and went on to weave a fictional story about it. I know these things exist in the real world, but I don't have to read about them for entertainment. And that's why I read. Anyone else who wants a good book about dogs, if you haven't read Watchers, pick it up. It's been re-released recently. Sorry, Parkhurst, but you're off my list."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Powerful, moving, emotional. Get the Kleenex out. I can't stop talking about this book. I read it in 4 hours flat. Didn't get up once! AMAZING."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Ok, that is a ridiculous opening for such an amazing book...but the point I am making is that when I first read the premise, and that people were referring to this amazing work as \\"the lovely Dog Bones\\" I was a bit put off. But this book is not about talking dogs. I feel it is about how people respond to grief. Grief tears you apart, makes you unreasonable...This is a book about a man who responds to grief and through the set up it is almost plausible.Beyond that, I think I held my breath a few times, wondering if the book would take weird turns. I didn't want Paul to get involved with Hollis...but I really don't think the book goes off track. Yes, Paul, a fairly rational man, is taking up with weird underground cults and phone psychics but these are the tools of desperation.I would also like to say that, though the book has moments of graphic description about animal mutilation, it is obvious pro-dog. Some of the reviews seem to imply that Parkhurst is some kind of horrific dog mutilator. No...her characters are, again to show the depths of Paul's journey. These passages are here to show you how far people will go.I will tell you that this is a painfully close to the bone novel,filled with brilliant insight, amazing symbolism, and skillful writing about relationships, being left and the search for answers when you are left suddenly.I thouroughly can recommend this wholeheartedly, it is a beautiful piece, risky and wonderful. Go with an open mind. It is not the lovely bones...it is something quite different. Dig up it's beauty for yourself"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I absolutely love this book. I have read it at least 4 times now, have gone through as many copies loaning out or gifting it to others. Something in the poetic writing of the author, the way I am caught up with my love for the characters she has created. I am not a particularly emotional reader, but the saddest moment in all books I've ever read is when Paul asks Lorelei to find Lexy. This book definitely is heart wrenching and exhausting- but it is a quick weekender read and it is worth emotional roller coaster."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"After reading all the favorable reviews of this book, I was in for a nasty surprise. I was drawn into the book immediately by its interesting premise, but it wasn't long before I began to be bothered by the voice of the narrator. The story is told in an imaginative and frothy voice that I was unable to accept as the voice of a man, and this is where the book fell apart for me. By the time he started calling the psychic hotline, I gave up on the book and will not go back. Paul Iverson is the least convincing male character I have ever encountered."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I loved Lexy and Paul and Lorelei. Great dialogue from the start. Lexy is so spontaneous and such a bright light in the beginning! Don't you love their 'first date'? The author has a wonderful talent for making you feel good that Paul found her - Maura was so awful. Getting to know Lexy as the chapters unfolded made me feel as though I kinda knew what the ending would be. I kept hoping I was wrong. This was a very special book. I don't pretend to know the depth of Lexy's depression but I feel she should have been so madly in love with her 'knight' that she would get help. \\"Not in the cards\\" as her phone psycic would say. I really liked the book and would recommend it to anyone who loves to read."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"There are a few things I usually look for when I'm reading: palpable tension, complex and interesting characters, and harsh truth.Caroline Parkhurst's scenes are vivid and strong with the kind of tension (between Paul and Lexy) that makes me giddy.Paul's obsession with making the dog talk is probably one of the more unique ways to have a character deal with loss, and because the book itself is about a man trying to learn about his late wife using any means available, anything and everything having to do with his quest to make that happen struck me as essential to the plot.Lexy is deliciously idiosyncratic and depressing and angry, and strangely strong.The only hangup I had while reading was that, every now and then, Paul sounded more like a woman than like a man (the things he thought or the way he thought them). But it didn't happen often enough to be a big distraction to the story.Which is, yes, a strange one. And that's what's most fun about fiction - you can write books about people trying to make dogs talk.Homefront"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I enjoyed this novel by Carolyn Parkhurst. I read several reviews (here on Amazon of course) that said this was a very sad book. And it was a sad book but I was surprised by how funny it was as well. I laughed out loud several times.Paul Iverson tells us the story of his life with wife Lexy. He comes home from work one day and discovers that she has died under strange circumstances, the only witness to her death is their dog Lorelei. In the weeks after her death he notices strange clues in their home: books rearranged on their shelves, a mysterious phone call. He's determined to figure out what it all means. And so he does.I enjoyed the main characters of Paul and Lexy. I enjoyed the story of how they met, their first date and the unfolding of their relationship.I thought the whole concept of the bereft widower linguistics professor trying to teach the eye-witness dog to speak was a bit surreal but well done.The psychos he meets were scary, the wife's profession was interesting, the sweet things she did to express her love for her husband were touching.I liked the voice the husband has and the way he tells his story. I loved the scene where the ex-wife comes to check in on him after Lexy dies...I laughed out loud.I thought this was a quick and easy read and sad but enjoyable."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I enjoyed the book but never felt the urge to stay up all night reading. Parkhurst does a nice job with the narrative, but as another reviewer stated, I never felt much sympathy or empathy for the main characters. The book might have done a better job probing Paul's experience with grief. I did not feel that Lexy was drawn out to its fullest... in fact, I often found her trite and quite annoying. Maybe her battle with mental illness might have been exposed earlier - and with much more boldness.I will definitely check out Carolyn Parkhurst in the future. As to recommend this book??? I guess I would wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. And I'm VERY picky about books.

The writing style flows well and doesn't get in the way of the story.Second, I haven't read any reviews that branded this book in any way a dark comedy or science fiction. If that is what you are looking for...this is NOT the book for you.If you are looking for a novel that is touching and tragic but can make you smile and appreciate true love (for man and dog!)...READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I purchased this novel on a whim at a book store one evening - talking dogs, what a riot, I told myself. I have to read that. What I found, houwever, was a horribly tragic tale that kept me constantly wavering on the edge of tears. I started it around 10PM and, despite telling myself I was going to bed early, could not put it down until 2AM when I'd read to the last page.The tale of Paul and Lexy is charming, playful, and fun. This story, however, starts at the end of the relationship - with Lexy's death - and works its way backwards through their relationship. These bright moments - memories of their past relationship - shine like brilliant sunlight in a book tinged with the darkly intense despair of loosing a loved one. (This provides just enough to keep the reader hanging in there and following Paul's quest to discover what happened to his wife - a book focusing purely on the events after her death would have been simply too sad to bear.)Paul's approach at coping - trying to teach their dog Lorelei to talk, so she can tell him what happened - is a unique one to be sure, but it's one the reader can relate to under the circumstances. A mysterious death, with no witnesses? What would any of us do?In today's desensitised world, this is a book that provokes strong emotion. And, though it be sadness, it is worth feeling just to know you still can. To read this novel is to grieve with Paul, and, perhaps, recover with him as well."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The story of each of the characters, Paul, Lexy and Lorelei are tragic and heartbreaking. They and their story have stayed with me for some time now.

The book begs our credulity, asking us to believe that a PhD in linguistics will ignore his wife's poor mental health. We are to believe that this caring and intelligent man, knowing that his wife is sensitive about her muse and has at least an anger management problem, will engage her in petty arguments, that he will consult a seer to help solve the mystery of her death, and that he will attempt to train his dog to communicate with him so as to obtain the dog's view of the day of her death. Further, this PhD dog lover communicates and visits with men who like to torture dogs and who justify their sickness with a \\"mask\\" of scientific research.If we agree that art is, in part, based on an artist's metaphysical value judgments, what might we to conclude about author Parkhurst's worldview? She appears to believe that people are governed by impulses, dreams, twisted motives, sick desires, and will intuitively resort to irrationality in the face of inexplicable loss. The dead wife made her living making masks. Perhaps the masks symbolize the thin guise of rationality behind which people in Parkhurst's world live. If so, her sense of life, the sense conveyed in this book, is corrupt. The most frightening aspect of this story is that the \\"healed\\" PhD returns to his classroom to teach college students. Teach them what? We pray he sticks narrowly to linguistics.Most of us read to find a bit of truth, some understanding and fun, and to glimpse how noble and enjoyable life could be if it were not for the sort of philosophy presented in Dogs of Babel."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"A professor is devastated by the death of his wife, Lexy, unsure whether it is accident or suicide. During this account of the professor's grieving process, a portrait of his wife and their marriage emerges. Unfortunately, a central element of the plot is the professor's attempt to teach his dog to talk, the dog being a witness to his wife's death. This just does not work as a literary device, both because it is so implausible, and because it just is not interesting. \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" does have some wonderful and original writing: the account of the couple's first date, which lasted a week, and the stories of Lexus' creations as a mask maker. Lexus is a beautiful but sad character: think of Audrey Hepburn in \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\", if she were to be totally in love, but battling depression. I would recommend the \\"Truth About Celia\\" by Kevin Brockmeier as a wonderful, original, quirky novel about the grieving process, a novel much superior to this one."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I was incredibly disappointed with this book. The description implies some sort of mystery - trying to solve his wife's death with the help of his dog. But it is not that. The story is not a mystery - it's an unveiling of a disturbed personality, well, two disturbed personalities - the dead wife and the husband (narrator). I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I am a HUGE dog lover which is one of the main reason this book caught my eye.

Lexy is an enigma; that is clear early in the book. But, she loved her dog, Lorelei...and her grieving spouse is seeking the ultimate connection between the two. The metaphors are strong throughout --- from eating habits, creating masks, phone psychics, and secret societies reveal much of how what we look for and what is hidden in our lives.

The twists &amp; turns were odd, but then again, life can do just that as well.Any animal lover, I think, will find this book bittersweet &amp; touching. I found myself looking up Lorilei's (our canine heroine) breed on the net just to have a mental pic of her as I read. :)I do see the correlation with &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;.

Message: don't give up on someone you love, and grieve (spectacularly if you wish) when they are gone, whether through death, the ultimate abandonment, or through forced separation. The animal abuse? Well, it happens in many other circumstances, unfortunately, and this time the perpetrators got their just desserts. The love of animals also shone through. A brilliant book which I accepted in the spirit with which it was offered. May the author have a long and successful writing career."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I could not put this book down. For those who are concerned with the animal abuse aspect, it is very small portion of the book, and not condoned by the main character. It is a beautiful book that describes the relationship between Paul and his wife Lexie before she died. The book's focus is more on their relationship and the past rather than the present. Parkhurst does an amazing job capturing the grief-striken feeling of losing someone you love and the depression that goes along with it. A must read!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is a great book. The Lovely Bones (which I hated) does not even come close to this book. I was extremely intrigued by the characters, and am amazed at the depth the author was able to achieve. The backstory was very detailed and, like A.S. Byatt's Possession, makes you question whether or not the intricate details of the Cerebrus Society are indeed based in fact. I agree with another reviewer that this book contains graphic animal violence, but it is not gratuitous. It's sadly realistic. Even though, the overall effect is somewhat, well, dignified. The animals in this book are characters, too, and they come off a lot better than some of the humans. This book moved me, and I think it will move you, too."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Paul Iverson came home from work one autumn afternoon to find that his wife Lexy was dead, having fallen from an apple tree in their backyard. Forensic evidence suggested that the fall was accidental, but certain incongruities in Lexy's behavior--she had rearranged the books in one of their bookcases, for example--suggested to her husband that \\"the day of Lexy's death had not been a usual day.\\"The Dogs of Babel tells the bittersweet story of Paul's attempt to recover from and understand Lexy's death. Was it a suicide? There was only one witness to his wife's fall, the couple's Rhodesian Ridgeback, Lorelai, and Iverson, a trained linguist, undertakes to teach the dog to talk. His interactions with Lorelai are sometimes comic, sometimes heart-rending (as when he tells her to \\"Go get Lexy\\"--a command she had never heeded previously--and she runs off, manically sniffing throughout the house for evidence of her dead mistress). The story, narrated by Iverson and written in pleasingly short chapters, jumps gracefully from these training sessions to Paul's attempts to unscramble the riddle of the reordered bookshelf to his memories of his wife--their charming courtship and the unsettling bursts of rage to which Lexy was subject. In the end, Paul's various memories and his detective work coalesce to form a comprehensible narrative of their relationship and of Lexy's last moments.Left at that, Parkhurst's novel would have been highly successful, but the author has also included in her book a section that does not quite fit with the rest. Iverson's interest in canine linguistics leads him to become involved--briefly, and somewhat against his will--with a group of extremists who will stop at nothing in their pursuit of canine speech. This section of the book is horrifying in its details of surgically altered dogs, and one is terrified at the prospect of what may happen to Lorelai. But these shocking chapters are also unrealistic (or so one dearly hopes), and thus out of keeping with the rest of the narrative. They are also not necessary to the story, which could stand on its own as an admittedly less dramatic but no less moving tale of love and death and dogs.Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I was overwhelmed with anger at the husband, Paul. Ms. Parkhurst has to have created one of the most self-absorbed, foolish and frustratingly stupid characters ever put in print. The reason his wife died is obvious to anyone who ever saw an Oprah episode or read a teen angst magazine. And yet this man is so stupid that he makes his poor, sweet, and defenseless dog suffer in order for him to \\"find\\" the reason. He was simply blind and too self-absorbed. The last straw for me came when he started obsessing over the \\"news\\" he heard from the psychic. This \\"news\\" was something he already knew. Yet he only obsessed and considered it a factor when a phone psychic told him about it.Ultimately the plot contrivances in this were the quality of poor sitcoms. The animal cruelty was written with stereotypical characters and I found the details to be stomach wrenching - don't pick this book up if you are a dog lover.The concept of the romance and story was interesting (it made me pick it up at the store), but I will not purchase another of Ms. Parkhurst's books."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"As an animal lover and dog owner I was instantly drawn to the idea of a grief-stricken man trying to communicate with his dead wife's beloved dog. I was not prepared for the absolutely preposterous story of a secret cult of dog mutilating men! These images were so disturbing and unneccessary that it was difficult to focus on what should have been a beautiful and intriguing love story. The writing was mediocre at best and at the end of the book the author was forced to tie up too many lose ends that the main character (as an intelligent Ph.D.) should have known- grief stricken or not!

Creative, fun-loving, and beautiful, Lexy has attracted the undying love of the narrator, which she reciprocates. Her flaw: hair-trigger rages provoked by minor incidents. The narrator loves her despite this (he has a few quriks of his own).The crisis occurs when when she becomes pregnant, something she has tried to avoid since she feels she could not be a fit mother. Why she doesn't seek an abortion isn't clear, but in the story's terms, she becomes a genuine heroine in that she sacrifices her life rather than bear a child she is almost certain to abuse.The business about the dogs is almost a distratction, since nothing really comes of it. Lorelei has a place in the plot, though, which could have been included without so much bizarrerie. And the ending is maybe too pat. The narrator, Paul, sees an end to his grieving, but there are some griefs we should never recover from.But worth reading."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book is sure to send a sensitive person into a depression.

The tale of a man who is so consumed with grief by her loss that he embarks on a journey to get her dog to speak the story of her death is artificially sweet at best because she is the kind of person most people avoid because she is unstable. This makes Paul unlikable because what kind of person attaches himself to a woman who is this much of a timebomb? A fine example of a book that made a strong start and just got lost in a labrynth of ludicrous twists and turns that led to a predictable and safe ending. What was supposed to be thrilling and suspensful was just plain absurd. Moreover, Paul talks and thinks like a woman. Disappointing. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel is an unusual book. It is a love story surrounded by a peculiar plot. What really works in this story are the characters. They are well drawn and entirely believable. Paul is a grieving husband who is haunted by his wife's death. He seems to need to work over the details of her death to accept something that I feel he knows all along is the truth but just can't bring himself to accept. He explores the concept of trying to communicate with the only witness to her death (his dog). This is the errant pursuit of a depressed man - a man who risks his career, who is ridiculed by peers, nearly ends up on the wrong side of the law and becomes slovenly in his personal habits. In that sense it was a journey of self discovery as Paul eventually runs into himself and then, is finally able to bring closure to the matter.The book works for me if for no other reason than the characters. It is not a complex plot but it does draw you in. I especially liked the way that the author depicted Lexy - a passionate, likable but troubled individual. I rate the book 3 stars."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book is phenomenally written. It tells the story of a great love between and couple and the passage of grief so very thoroughly and chillingly you will feel your own pain and longing for Paul, the main character. You will swear you can feel Paul's desperationg to teach his dog, Lorelai, to talk in order to find out a truth he already knows about his wife. This is more a story of Paul's internal exploration and his story of grief for his wife than a mystery, but there is a definite undercurrent of thriller in parts. A GREAT GREAT DEBUT WORK!!!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Paul's unconditional love for free-spirited, fun-loving, not-a-care-in-the-world Lexy is the early focus of the book. During his desperate journey into the mystery of her death, Paul comes to the realization that Lexy's masks were not only physical, but emotional as well. The reader gains a much better understanding of Lexy's true (and troubled) personality as the book progresses. Lorelei, their dog, grieves along with Paul...heartbreaking account of the process she goes through.Portions of the book...pertaining to the surgical altering of dogs...were difficult to read.Overall, a unique and strangely entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The idea of communication with animals is one that resonated with this reader. Unfortunately, as some others have attested, the character of the dog in this novel is much more sympathetic than those of the humans. Lexy, the narrator's wife, was a whiny, irrational and frustratingly self-involved character who I found it difficult to care about. The focus of the novel is on how the narrator deals with his grief over the loss of his wife, so this was a major problem.Also, there were some really nice metaphors and good, original descriptions, but the leap into &quot;noir&quot; halfway through the book felt forced."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"My main critique of this book was Lexy's character - one of those cliched characters who Live On The Edge and Teach You How to Live. Her relationship with Paul was totally contrived - it didn't feel authentic. Frankly, she just seemed like a loon. Ironically, he describes how &quot;easy&quot; it was to be with her, yet it sounds like she made everything incredibly difficult. This is a decent beach read, but it's not outstanding."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Carolyn Parkhurst has used a unique and interesting twist to explore the depths of grief and desperation. She demonstrates the desperate measures that desperate people will take. Paul Iverson is a desperate man. He is struggling with his wife's accidental yet questionable death. While he was away at work, his wife Lexy, climbed to the top of the tree in their back yard and fell to her death. The only witness to her death and the unexplained actions of her last day on earth is Lorelei, Lexy's beloved dog.Paul attempts to unlock the secrets that dogs know and never tell.He embarks (no pun intended) upon the task of teaching Lorelei to talk. His desperate quest leads him to the unsavory people who conduct inhumane animal experiments to alter the physical features of dog's faces to enable them to form sounds similar to human speech. His foolish association with these people nearly causes him to lose the only thing that he has left to love.His search for the truth test his strength to accept the truth about his life with Lexy and his role in their destiny. He learns that he was not the only survivor, nor the only one that loved her.

The novel takes you on a rollercoaster ride that I did not want to get off of.Although the story line seems farfetched, in the context of the book and the characters it truly did seem believable.I would highly recommend this book, but not to those who cannot handle something of this dark of nature or someone who is grieving the loss of a loved one. It is a very deep novel and it seems to stick with its readers."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Parts fairy tale and whimsy, parts dark and disturbing, The Dogs of Babel is an unusual love story about imperfect, but very deep love.Paul Iverson is grieving deeply for his wife, Lexy, and tells the story of their remarkable relationship while desperately grasping for answers to questions that, in the asking, indicate he may already know some of the answers.Lorelei, the family dog, is the only witness to Lexy's death and the first to painfully alert the world to this tragedy. So begins Paul's quest to find a way to communicate with Lorelei to uncover the events leading up to Lexy's fatal fall. Though some readers may feel this is a bit over the top, animal lovers will feel less so. Paul's observations on how Lorelei does successfully communicate her own grief and needs, sleeping on a sweater with Lexy's scent, patiently waiting some mornings near her studio, will ring true with anyone who has learned to respect the wonder and intelligence of animals.Carolyn Parkhurst weaves together symbolism and language to create a story more complex than it appears on the surface. Paul and Lexy are interesting and multi-faceted characters - their imperfections make them believable and endearing. Paul, a somewhat reserved and thoughtful linguistic professor, has a new world opened to him because of Lexy. He remembers and shares the (almost painfully) beautiful escapades of their courtship and marriage, as well as the troubling conflict of their darkest moments. Lexy, a gifted artist in a unique medium, papier mache masks, has let only the tip of what appears to be a destructive mental torment known to her husband.The Dogs of Babel is a quietly compelling story. There are several disturbing chapters related to animal abuse and cruelty I found difficult to reconcile with the rest of the story, but overall, Lorelei's role in the story is important and respected. The greatness of this novel lies in the beautiful storytelling related to three themes - the animal/human bond, the complexities of grief, and the extraordinary intricacies of unconditional love."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"While not just another love story, \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" does detail the love affair and marriage of Paul and his mask-making wife, the newly deceased Lexy. As the narrative unfolds, the reader watches as Paul's obsessive attempts to make sense of his wife's death force him to become reclusive, to relentlessly pursue a pay-by-the-minute phone psychic, and to try to teach his dog, and only witness to Lexy's death, Lorelei, to speak.\\"Dogs\\" is a modern day fairy tale in the true Brothers Grimm fashion. Parkhurst has crafted a sweet story of romance and love counter-balanced by deep sadness, despair, and the desperation of grief. Not a novel to be taken in the literal sense, \\"Dogs\\" explores the surreal and often futile attempts of survivors to answer questions surrounding a loved one's death and to blame themselves even when circumstances are beyond their control. Parkhurst skims the surface of mental illness and its sometimes exasperating silence and links it to the allegorical Cerberus Society, whose sole purpose is to create a speaking dog.Masks, ghosts, talking dogs and hidden messages combined with raw human emotions in a familiar household setting create an atmospheric and beautifully layered story. A wonderful read, without a doubt this season's \\"The Lovely Bones\\", and a story that will stay with you long after the last page has turned.*Having read and reviewed this book, and then read other's reviews, I must add a personal note of recommendation that readers approach this book with no expectations. Ignore the hype, ignore the reviews, yes, even mine, and approach this book with an open, inquiring, intellectual mind. If you do so, I think you will be pleased. As my mother always says, the origin of resentment is expectation. Good reading!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Those of us who live with animals, like cats or dogs, often share simple but reliable methods of communication with them. We know when they are happy, scared, hungry, angry, or want to play. We may talk to them in our language and think they are talking back to us, but we know we can never really share language with them. Legends of talking dogs and horses abound but seem silly, like the punchlines of jokes, or just plain impossible. But in Carolyn Parkhurst's novel, THE DOGS OF BABEL, the idea of talking dogs is deadly serious.Paul Iverson's wife died mysteriously, falling from the apple tree in their backyard. The police and medical examiner rule it an accident, but Paul finds some troubling evidence that makes him doubt the conclusion. He feels that his only hope in uncovering the truth of his wife Lexy's last day is their dog Lorelei, who was the only witness to the fall. With this sad and interesting premise, Parkhurst shares with the reader Paul's emotional first year without Lexy. And Paul's search for the truth about her death takes him in frightening directions.THE DOGS OF BABEL is not a mystery; Paul is not searching for a murderer, only the truth about Lexy and her state of mind on the day she died. A linguist by profession, Paul begins to obsess over the idea that if only Lorelei could somehow share language with him, she could tell him what really happened. He takes a sabbatical from his university position and devotes himself to teaching Lorelei to talk. This desire to learn what Lorelei knows about Lexy's death takes Paul, and the novel, in a bizarre and tense direction as he encounters a group of dog abusers and mutilators, and risks Lorelei's safety. Confronted with the impossibility of getting Lorelei to speak, Paul realizes he must go elsewhere for the answers he is seeking. So he searches his memory and finds a sadness and fear in Lexy that he never clearly saw while she was alive.This beautifully written novel swings back and forth between the present --- Paul's fixation on not only trying to teach Lorelei to speak but on his attempts to uncover other aspects of Lexy's last days, such as her call to a television psychic and why she rearranged the books on their bookshelves --- and the past, Paul's memories of his years with Lexy in courtship and marriage. But even through the veil of heartbreak, Paul begins to put together the pieces he needs to understand Lexy and the way she died. Lexy, who made her living creating beautiful and one-of-a-kind masks, often hid behind her own creations. For Paul, it becomes essential to strip away Lexy's mask and thus come to terms with her sudden and tragic death.Masks, talking dogs, square eggs, animal abuse, grief and memory, psychics, marathon dates, death and love: Parkhurst daringly attempts to fit the entirety of Paul's life into less than 300 pages. Part fairy tale and part horror story, Parkhurst captures the sorrow and desperation of both Paul and Lexy. An imperfect but inventive novel, THE DOGS OF BABEL is an emotional and frustrating tale of both the romance and heartbreak of one marriage. Readers willing to indulge Parkhurst just a little as she struggles to fit many ideas and themes into one short novel will find a surprising and original story that, like Paul Iverson, is both nave and wise.--- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"THE DOGS OF BABEL by Carolyn ParkhurstOne of my favorite books read so far in 2004, Carolyn Parkhurst's THE DOGS OF BABEL is a slightly twisted tale of a grieving widower trying to reconcile the death of his wife. It's one of the more unusual books to come out in the past few years, taking the reader into a somewhat unbelievable scenario that involves dogs that learn to speak.Paul Iverson is a middle-aged linguistics professor that has a successful career and a loving wife. When he calls home in the afternoon one day and finds an unknown man answering the phone, his life changes forever. He returns home to find his wife has fallen out of an apple tree in their backyard and is found dead. The police have declared this an accident, but something does not seem right to Paul. There are telltale hints all through the house that his subconscious perceives that his wife's death is not what it seems to be. The only witness to Lexy's death is their beloved dog, Lorelei, the one to discover the body.And so begins Paul's obsession to teach Lorelei to speak. As a linguistic, he feels he has the know-how to train her to make human sounds and to tell the story of what really happened to Lexy. He takes a leave of absence from work, and lives and breathes this project to the dismay of his co-workers who now feel that he's lost it. His home shows the neglect Paul has begun to live under, the piled up dishes, the stacks of newspapers, and the disheveled look that he presents to anyone that may happen to come to visit his home. Paul's life mission now is to find out why his wife died, and he cannot rest until he knows the truth.THE DOGS OF BABEL takes on a macabre turn, which will repulse many readers, dog lovers or not. The point of the book, however, is not to frighten or to offend the reader. The real story is the journey that Paul needs to make to accept the death of his wife. It isn't until he talks to a TV psychic that he finds out what he needs to know, and if the reader was perceptive enough, the clues were there from the beginning of his story. Paul unfortunately did not want to accept this knowledge, and continued in denial until someone helped him see the light.I truly loved THE DOGS OF BABEL. A remarkably short book yet full of insight and packed with information on the love story that was Paul and Lexy Iverson, it will probably be one of my favorite books of 2004. It's not quite a love story, because it's told from a point of view of a mystery, but I personally saw this as a love story and a man's acceptance of the death of his cherished wife."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I read about the premise of this book and couldn't wait to read it. It dragged for me. It would have been so much better as a murder mystery where that is actually solved by something that results from Paul's effort with Lorelei. The character of the husband was sympathetic but the wife came off as a fruitcake. The writing itself is nice, just the plot needed some more twists and turns. You could see the kidnapping coming the minute the kidnapper excuses himself, it was so predictable."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I feel misled by the hype this book received. It appears to suffer from the same faults possessed by a woman who told me it was now one of her favorite novels of all time: much surface flash, but serious underlying deficiencies. Carolyn Pankhurst is a talented writer, and her style and facility with the language are impressive. She'll likely have a successful career, and I'll read her next novel. On the other hand, neither of her main characters &quot;came alive&quot; as real, believable people. I felt no sympathy for either protagonist, and although that may be because I'm heartless, I do respond to fully rounded characters. Was I the only person who wondered why our hero was never contacted by, or reached out to, any member of his family during his entire ordeal? Or, for that matter, that the main chracters seemed to exist in a vacuum devoid of all but one or two friends? Also, the jarring juxtaposition of the &quot;bittersweet&quot; tone of the first 164 pages, and the subsequent subplot involving the bizarre Ceberus Society, detracted from my overall enjoyment. A decent first novel, not a noteworthy one. With her talent, I expect Ms. Pankhurst's next effort will be better."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I usually hate books that are self-consciously quirky, and so I approached this book with some trepidation. The first few chapters took my breath away, however, and I rushed headlong into it, believing that Parkhurst was a major new talent, and that the quirky elements of the story really served a purpose. Unfortunately, the book does not live up to its dazzling beginning. Just when the depth and complexity of the characters should have been revealed and explored, Parkhurst instead gives us inane plot developments and girlish whimsy. What a disappointment. The &quot;girly&quot; voice really became irritating as the book wore on -- by the end, the narrator felt more like a fourteen year old girl than the middle-aged man he was supposed to be."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I think \\"just plain strange\\" is the best way to describe this book. Clearly as we read along, the wife, who has died after a fall from an apple tree, is a bit disturbed. The thought that the husband wants to know what their dog witnessed when and before it happened is interesting. How the story goes about answering those questions and the husbands discovering the secret animal experimenting group is just creepy. I found it disturbing to read what had been done to the dogs. It seemed out of place for the story.I finished this book in a day. I think it could have been better without the dog cruelty covered.It was a sad story."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Wow, this was recommended to me by a coworker and I cannot say that I feel as strongly about it as she did. She claimed it was one of the best books she had ever read. Hmm. I wonder how much she has read? The emotional journey that the main character undertakes is interesting and makes for a good story. His wife has just jumped/fallen (?) from a tree and he is trying to teach his dog to talk so he can figure out what happened.That's where the book goes wrong. The absurdities of this part of the story detract greatly from the interesting story to be told. Ultimately, the writer also deprives you of being able to fully \\"solve\\" the mystery by witholding KEY facts until the end of the book. These are facts that the main character knew, but did not reveal until the end.By the end, I felt like the book had the potential to be a 5 star story, but ended up with only 2 stars because I had to completely suspend my disbelief in regards to every single thing about the \\"teaching the dog to talk\\" part of the story and also because major plot reveals were held to the end of the book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"When Paul Iverson's wife, Lexy, falls from an apple tree, her instantaneous death is ruled an accident, but Paul is not certain. Certain things done by Lexy that day lead him to think that it could have been intentional. The only witness to the fall was Lexy's dog, Lorelei, and Paul becomes obsessed with the desire to know what Lorelei knows. He leaves his job as a linguistics professor and tries to teach Lorelei to speak.The story is told in both the present and the past, using effective flashbacks and memories, as Paul narrates the story of their relationship, what he knows of Lexy's past and his attempts with Lorelei. Some of their early relationship is quite beautiful, with Paul's offering of \\"square eggs\\" being quite original and sentimental and is my favorite scene from the book.Paul is a generally likable character, his deep grief seeming natural and real and his dependence on Lorelei in the days after Lexy's death both sweet and sad. The object of his mourning, on the other hand, was not nearly so appealing.We only see Lexy through Paul's besotted eyes, but her whimsical nature and fragile emotions did not inspire the same admiration in me. In particular, Lexy's emotional difficulties came across as teenage angst that had not yet matured into a woman's turmoil. As such, she elicited more annoyance than sympathy, which worked against the beauty of Paul's grief. As is the trend of late for current novels, The Dogs of Babel seems a bit pretentious with it's excess of darkness and seems to draw attention to its dark aspect with Lexy's outbursts. Instead of giving The Dogs of Babel a tense, emotional feel, this aspect gave it a forced feeling, as if Ms. Parkhurst were trying too hard.Paul's attempts to teach Lorelei to speak lead to the most unappealing part of the book; he has some interaction with a group of weirdoes (no other word will do) who are attempting to give dogs speech by cruel surgical ways. At one point, I put the book down, determined to read no further until I knew for certain that Lorelei would not be hurt. The animal cruelty element seemed to be unnecessary as well as a turn off formyself (and I'm sure many other readers).Despite my dissatisfaction with some aspects, I found The Dogs of Babel to be an engrossing first novel. Ms. Parkhurst has an easy style, and is very adept at weaving the back story into the present action. Her short chapters speed the reader from one to the next, with a genuine build up of suspense evident. I cared about Paul and Lorelei and was anxious for the situation to resolve. Though the ending was much weaker than the rest of the book, overall it was a satisfying reading experience. I will be interested to read Ms. Parkhurst's future works, unless of course, she continues to use the theme of animal cruelty, and expect to continue to hear good things about her as a writer."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This may be the most gripping, and emotionally painful, book I have ever read. That there is such disagreement about it is a testament to how different our capacities are for feeling love and devastating loss, for appreciating emotional subtlety, and understanding - or experiencing - the forms madness can take. I both couldn't put the book down and had to put it down often to let the pain subside. This book is essentially a fable, with psychological lessons for those of us who can learn from it. If you're one of the lucky ones who allow yourself to be touched deeply, you're in for quite a ride."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Carolyn Parkhurst's The Dogs of Babel is written in a simple and elegant style, but the plot is not so compelling. The vignettes of Paul and Lexy's life together are sweet; the chronicles of Paul's adventures in canine linguistics fall apart. He accomplishes nothing except to realize how fruitless the field is. The story does have some creepy parts, especially the meeting with Remo, and we want to kick Paul for going. He partially becomes the maniac his colleagues believed him to be when he first took on his project. Lexy is interesting, original, and deep, but her anger fits are somewhat unbelievable (the death mask incident). But overall, The Dogs of Babel is a good read."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I purchased this book with whole-hearted intentions of turning it into my next week-long read, and it was everything but.This novel grips a hold of your heart and doesn't let go until the end; meanwhile you're thrown back and forth, and in and out of the reality of true love, devotion, and the torture of grief. This story is beautifully written as if the main character is sitting in a chair in front of you, pouring his heart out for all to see, and guiding you through the lengths that a person will go to in order to wrap their fingers around the smallest bit of closure."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book is what I call a \\"quick\\" read. However, I just couldn't get into the plot which involves a grieving widow trying to teach his dog to talk! The relationship between the dog and the owner is very sweet, but I found myself not really caring about what happenes in the story - with the dog or the sad main character. Maybe if you have a dog that is your pride and joy, you will enjoy this first novel of Parkhurst's, but for me it was on the silly side."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I flew through this book in a little over an hour, which means I was comfortable and interested enough to not put it down, yet it also means it doesnt inspire any deep thinking. Parkhurst's writing seems effortless, and her characters endear themselves to the reader. And for those animal lovers out there, you will shed a few tears in the process."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I am an animal lover. This novel appealed to me because of the idea, although obscure, of a man teaching a dog to talk. The book was well written and it seemed to be well researched and certainly had some suspense, although the reader can \\"read in\\" to certain clues to figure out what is going to happen next.What disappointed me was the fact that when I read the dust cover when buying the book, it read to me that Lexy was murdered and their dog was the witness. I was very disappointed to find out early on that it was suicide. That part was disappointing enough without having to read about mutilated dogs. I was disgusted and furious that the author had to take this story had to such a place. I actually threw the book across the room. The only reason I forced myself to finish the novel was to make sure that the author had the decency to bring kidnapped Lorelei back safely to her master, Paul. Thankfully she made that happen - but not before the dogknappers cut out her larynx so she could no longer bark.Overall, the story line is good. It's a depressing book. I feel that the animal abuse could have been left out and the story still be effective. Certainly she could have found another way to fill those pages without forcing the reader to imagine such cruelty."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel offers readers an interesting premise--training a dog to master human language--and some potentially interesting characters; however Carolyn Parkhurst is not up to the task. The novel suffers from pedestrian prose, uneven characterization, and (in ironic harmony with the deceased wife, Lexy) an identity crisis. The writer can't seem to decide what the story should be, a mystery-romance or a Garpian satire. There are a few moments of wonderful lucidity in which the prose shines and the story compels, but such moments stand in stark contrast to the mostly limp prose of the narrator and the split-personality of the plot. Perhaps Parkhurst should write short stories exclusively."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I was very drawn into this book because of the surprising first page and was able to finish the entire book in three nights. Well written and not as preposterous as some reviewers have said. Sure, there is one strange part, but I didn't feel it took away from the book at all. When I put myself in the narrator's shoes, nothing seemed strange, just all part of grieving."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I'll cut to the chase. This book quickly reminded me why I don't read fiction anymore. I tried one more time. Now I remember."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is a well written book which explores the mind of a tormented man who has just lost his wife .BR> I really enjoyed this book until about half way through when animal cruelty invaded it. It was disturbing and shocking to read about cruel experimentation on dogs.The story had its merits and there was no need for the author to destroy it with animal cruelty. WHY WOULD SHE GO THERE???This book is not for people who love dogs or for that matter anyone who has a heart."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Very thought provoking, interesting topic. Some parts were a bit grotesque, but there's a bit of mystery and romance woven in."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"\\"Dogs of Babel\\" has to be the most vile, disgusting book I have EVER read. The author's dark side is scary -- that she would utilize animal cruelty of the most evil kind imaginable (not once, but twice) to sell books makes me frightened she is on the streets. This is gratuitous violence at its worst.I checked this book out of a library, so am certainly glad I didn't give this person a dime of my money. I was ready to toss it mid-book, but felt, to be fair, I would see if the author had any purpose for the cruelty to the dogs in her story and if the merits of the book could redeem her choice to write about such depravity. Turns out she did have a purpose-- to sell books, period. Redeeming merits? NONE."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I thought the premise for this book was a great idea, with an interesting story andall kinds of plot possibilities. I was not hooked early on and found the romance/courting story played like a Lifetime movie. Nothing made me care about either character, I found Lexy to be self-centered, immature and spoiled. Paul, didn't seem very bright for a college professor and this is proven later when he makes some questionable and ultimately bad decisions concerning Lorelei, the couple's beloved dog who is the only witness to Lexy's mysterious death. I thought I would learn something about animal linguistics, and was anxious to find out what significant clue Lorelei would reveal about the cause of her mistress's death.That's what kept me reading. I didn't even see the animal abuse plot coming, and I wish I could get it out of my mind. It's not belabored but its a very unsettling section of the book. Paul is an idiot to put the dog in harm's way, and ultimately it is the dog who pays the price for Lexy's death and Paul's search for answers. My wish would have been that this sweet dog had different owners."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Really enjoyed this book. It was read in a short period of time so that I didn't have to wait to find out \\"what is happening next!\\""},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The premise of this story is so intriguing. Paul Iverson's wife, Lexy, is killed in a fall, and the only witness is their dog, Lorelei. He is a linguist, as it happens, and sets out to teach Lorelei to speak so that she can tell him what happened to Lexy.So far, fascinating. Lexy is an artistic, mercurial free spirit, and she has boatloads of issues. She is complex and three-dimensional. The story of their courtship and the beginning of their marriage is completely believable and moving.Then we get to the final third.By the time I reached the final chapters, I realized that only a nitwit like Paul would NOT get just what happened to Lexy on page one. He doesn't need the dog to tell him; the evidence surrounds the house and their lives. Also, the ending that was given to Lexy did not suit her artistic, creative spirit. It's as if Parkhurst just couldn't be bothered to use the creativity she had given Lexy to describe the ending of her life and the lessons she leaves for Paul.Up to page 200, this was a five star read. I knew that the \\"teaching the dog to talk\\" gambit was only a leaping off point and that we would be seeing some soul-searching, with the dog, Lorelei, as the catalyst. Given the quality of the writing at the start, I expected more, but the author simply got lazy and rested on some handy cliches rather than original and deft writing. A shame, because this book could have been something truly special if she had stayed true to the quality present at the beginning."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Started great. Husband calls home one afternoon, a cop answers phone - wife is dead she fell out of a tall tree in the backyard only witness is the dog. Whoa! Was it an accident? Was it suicide? What happened? Great! I was hooked. Then it went slowly downhill for this reader with all the flashbacks of their relationship, and fizzled out in the end without even a whimper. 2 stars because I did manage to finish it. Just disappointing for this reader."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Received the merchandise in timely manner. Was pleased with the item and thevendor."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"My mom bought me this book about 2 years ago and I never read until 2 days ago.

Upon her death she was transformed into a siren and could from that time on be heard singing on a rockIn this sad and deceptively complicated novel, Lorelei, the family dog is the only witness to the tragic death of Lexy Ransome....... And the question remains..... was it suicide or was it an accident?Paul, the husband of the deceased and a linguistics professor, in his grief, grabs onto his only hope, the hope that by teaching the dog, Lorelei to speak, he may finally know what really happened that on that dreadful day.Lexy was a troubled young woman, an artist, a maker of masks, and a wearer of many masks, thus concealing her addled life, where passions seemed to imprison reason.Paul's behavior, on the other hand was primarily rational and controlled.Lexy's enigmatic nature and \\"free-spirited\\" flights help the reader to see how masks were a great metaphor throughout the book.It is not Lorelei that holds the secrets! Lexy is the keeper of the secrets! Lexy's troubles begin early in her childhood and continue into adulthood, as she struggles to veil them and channel them into various artistic pursuits.But all is not well in the persona of the \`unmasked' Lexy and after a particularly disturbing outburst, Paul is left to grapple with the unsettling emotional state of his beloved wife and the guilt he feels at having fought with Lexy the day before her death.Lorelei becomes an unwitting victim in the crusade of Paul in trying to teach her to vocalize intelligibly. The idea that a \`Cerberus Society' or anything close to it exists is at once both shocking and disgusting to any lover of animals and their welfare. What happens there is difficult to digest and is clearly the misjudgement of Paul.But, Parkhurst's novel is catchy, clever and keeps the reader involved and deeply moved on many levels. It is easy to come to really care about her well crafted characters!And....in the end.....we finally learn Lexy's secret."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is a truly interesting book. Great concept, intriguing plot line, good job of visual imagery. I was okay with the way everything turned out, and I enjoyed that the author revealed things slowly. Here's my major beef with this book: Paul Iverson seemed a little too at ease with the knowledge that that group of crazy dog manglers had his home address. And what kind of an idiot, after seeing those surgical diagrams, still takes his dog (his \\"beloved\\" dog at that) with him to the meeting. What'd he think? They were all gonna play a game of frisbee with the pooch? And then he's all shocked cause the dog's missing when he gets home. Oh yeah, never saw that one coming... I'm done ranting now. SO, I liked the book, but I was really pissed off at Paul towards the end."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Although there were parts of the story that were contrived, I think that the idea and the writing were very good. Ms. Parkhurst understands and conveys in a tender way both the human grieving process and the comfort that our animals give to us. She also does a pretty good job of showing the highs and lows of one who suffers from depression (manic depression, perhaps) and the frustration and helplessness the person's family feels as a result."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I have read some pretty bad reviews about this book.So when i picked it up at the library i was sceptical.I jumped in not expecting much,and came out suprised.True the whole dog speaking blah was out there,but it made the book unique.My only complain was it ended to fast.I felt let down by the sudden ending of the book.It was like the author just got tired of writing."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I found myself lost in this poignant and incredibly romantic description of a relationship. The main character Paul starts with the day his wife is found dead at the bottom of the apple tree in their backyard, apparently an accidental fall, and works backwards as he re-examines how they met and fell in love etc. It was beautiful look at what makes a couple, why do we love each other, what are we willing to forgive or sacrifice to be with someone we love.Unfortunately for me the book then took a gruesome and completely unnecessary turn about a group of people obsessed with teaching a dog to talk - by any means necessary. The whole thing felt very manipulative and left a bad taste in my mouth.I think that Parkhurst is an incredibly talented writer and there were some amazing and very descriptive paragraphs in this book that I found myself reading 2 and 3 times but I would have liked it much more if it had left the horror out - it felt all wrong here. I give one half of the story 5 stars and the other 3 to average out at 4 stars."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Entertaining? Yes. Fulfilling? No.While I read it in one sitting, I felt denied and hungry at the conclusion. There were intriguing and thought-provoking phrases attributed to both Paul and Lexy. It was a wonderful trip through their romance. But I found myself longing for more substance, less fluff. I expected more on the \\"teach Lorelei to speak\\" angle, but that, too, proved empty.Don't waste your time, speedread this book, if you read it at all."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is a book that did not deliver. Like a sincere but inept lover, it will leave you high and dry. The plot was too vague and too timid. It is if the writer wasn't sure what to do with the story after the premise was established - turn it into a murder mystery or a soul-searching odyssey. In the end neither was served up adequately to the reader. Nevertheless, the book is not without charms. The description of the dog is sweet, funny and very realistic. Dog lovers and pet owners will be tickled."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Carolyn Parkhurst uses a great vocabulary.This book is one i'm going to want to read time and time again.It was a very sad book from the begining, but it was a great read. I encourage others to read this book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Paul Iverson is the husband we all want. He loves his deceased wife so much that he has a hard time facing her shortcomings. I love this author's style of writing; and if you listen to the audio version, Erik Singer does an excellent job at the narration. Yes, the parts about the dog mutilation are very disturbing, but they are a stark contrast to how Paul feels about his dog Lorelei. Every time I listened to part of this book, it made me want to hug my dog. You can tell this author loves and appreciates dogs very much.I also liked the sensitive way that Lexy was portrayed. She was mentally ill, but that was only part of the picture--she was also a gifted artist and a loving wife. Her illness was something she could not control but fought hard against. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I really enjoyed this story -- couldn't put it down. A sad and thoughtful tale."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I ordered this book from my Public Library System based on a blurb I read pre-release, which heralded it as a great mystery with dogs serving as canine Dr. Watsons. It is not. Nor can it properly be filed in the library's \\"Mystery\\" section.It is Literature. Sparse, haunting, sometimes lyric, Literature.When I received the book, I noted that Noveau Novelist Carolyn Parkhurst is described on the inside back jacket as holding a B.A. from Wesleyan University and an MFA (Master of Fine Arts) in creative writing from American University. This frequently, as in this case, portends a cerebral hand-wringing. I also noted that the book had become a selection of the Today Show Book Club, (Hey! I don't get up in time to languish in front of the TV before bolting out the door in the morning!) another ominous portend. And it was deja vu all over again.Prior Reviewers have already given away more than enough of the plot. If you want to pre-read it, read them. I would just add that I was disgusted by the doggie disfigurement. If you loved *The Lovely Bones*, you'll lap this right up.

The husband is so desperate for the dog to tell him what happened, he embarks on a journey to teach the dog to speak. This is a unique story, to be sure. But not only is the premise preposterous, the ending is a true disappointment. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say I find it seriously annoying when I spend hours and hours reading a book, and only at the end discover the resolution of the mystery required a tidbit of information the author held back merely to encourage you to read the book. I'll compare how I felt at the end of this book to the following example: when I read a murder mystery and I'm introduced to several suspects, but at the end of the book I find out the murderer was someone never introduced in the story before then - a surprise character added at the end. That's how I felt at the end of \\"Dogs of Babel\\" - manipulated and irritated."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Maximum concept and maximum buzz leads to big sales but mediocre novel.

I tend to think of these as \\"pitch\\" books, because the \\"IDEA\\" or \\"CONCEPT\\" or \\"PITCH\\" is easy to spot, is easy to transmit from author to agent to editor, or from author to agent to movie producer. (It just so happens that a Dogs of Babel movie is in the works.) The pitch novel, done correctly, is destined for the movies (done not so well, it's destined for the remainder pile, but this may be a discussion for another time). And Dogs of Babel is no exception--it's a pitch novel done well. Here's my pitch if I'm Carolyn Parkhurst's agent (which I'm not, in case you were wondering): \\"Mourning husband attempts to unravel the truth regarding his wife's death by teaching the only witness--his dog--to speak.\\"Sounds intriguing, yes? Well, maybe?The trouble is, a decent novel is extremely difficult to reduce to a pitch, and authors who are encouraged to do so (as they often are) tend to oversimplify their work. They may create average or even above-average entertainment, but if they attempt to stretch beyond that, they may run in to trouble.There are a few aspects of Dogs of Babel that do just that. The darker aspects of dog-speech explored in the novel are done so in a manner that seems entirely outside the novel's scope. A sinister gang of dog mutilationists? Well, maybe. But it comes as too much of a surprise--or too much of a distraction. It removes us from the otherwise-central lovestory, and turns the storyline on itself as if eating its own tail.Because therein is the novel's strength. In its lovestory. The lovestory is simple, yes, but beautiful in its simplicity. The lovestory does not attempt to change or move us into places we haven't been before, but this is precicely why we long for it. The lovestory is central to the human being. We want it. We want it simple. And we want to feel it again and again, even if it ends poorly. See Romeo and Juliet. Will we ever tire of those two? Is there any story less complex yet more moving?I doubt it.Meanwhile, I don't mean to be too critical of Dogs of Babel. I enjoyed it, to a point. It will likely make a good movie. And thus seems the contemporary landing place of the pitch novel. In the right hands, the movie can exceed the power and scope and meening of the novel. Bridges of Madison County, for instance, was a sugary, non-essential, throwaway novel that becomes a fully-realized, moving, simple love story as a film.Maybe when they make the movie of Dogs of Babel, they an get Clint Eastwood to direct. Then again, maybe I better go finish my own novel before this dog at my feet eats me out of liver snacks and kibble."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I was extremely disappointed in and disgusted by this book!

You will begin reading it and not want to put it down. It will draw you into itself and hold you tightly within its grasp until the very end. You will laugh, cry, get angry, and be sickened, but you will continue to read it because you have to.By reading the publisher's summary you already know what The Dogs Of Babel is about. Therefore I don't have to bore you by going into it once again. Any other details that I think you would like to know would be unfair to tell you because they give away the vital goodness, (and the horrors) that reside within this wondrous story. Suffice to say that the protagonist of the story, Paul, goes through all the normal stages of grief when his beloved wife Lexy dies suddenly. The twist that author Carolyn Parkhurst weaves into Paul's stages of grief is what makes this book an engrossing one.I cannot warn the tenderhearted animal lovers enough, however, there are parts in this book that definitely will make you sick. I would like to say more on this, but feel brevity is perhaps best due to my not knowing the audience my review may reach.Do I recommend this book? Highly. It will be with you for a while after you read it due to its thought provoking nature. Despite the previous comment, I would hesitate to recommend this book to someone in the process of grieving. Although the book deals with the issue of grief, it is far too intense and is not of the self-help variety."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Anna Quindlen...I really admire her, don't you? Such a gifted writer. A woman of keen intellect and insight into the human condition and body politic. Consequently, for some years now, I have read her avidly, most frequently agreeing with her every utterance and always admiring her bountiful talent.So, when Quindlen last year very enthusiastically endorsed Alice Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" I was all ears even though it didn't sound too appealing. Adolescent girl, rape, heaven...? Ugh...sounded like a religious book...a chick book...or, worse yet, Hallmarky sentimental. Nonetheless, based solely on Quindlen's rapturous review, I read \\"Bones.\\" And I was enthralled from the first page. Seldom have I -- a voracious reader -- read a novel as gripping, lyrical, and as provocative. Hooray for Sebold for crafting this gem of a novel -- and for Quindlen for shining the spotlight on it.So when I read in USA Today that Quindlen had blessed another new author and novel, Carolyn Parkhurst and her \\"The Dogs of Babel,\\" I counted down the days to its June 2003 publication, knowing that I was in for a big treat: a compelling, page-turning story beautifully and intelligently told. \\"Dogs\\" was published; I bought it; I read it in a few days.And now I have a question for Anna Q.: What were you thinking?One word springs to mind in describing \\"Dogs\\": dumb. The story is just flat-out dumb. And I am not referring to the widower's wanting to teach the dog to speak in order to learn what happened on that October afternoon in the backyard. That's a lamebrained notion. Of course. But the poor widower, a linquist, is desperate to discern the facts of his late, beloved wife's last day. Yes indeed, I thought as I ended chapter one, this is going to an excellent novel.Wrong. After that first chapter, the story plodded along. Not great, but not bad. And then I hit page 165 and The Cerberus Society. This, Dear Readers, is where \\"Dogs\\" plummeted into a death spiral of idiocy. Groaning, I kept reading, believing that the Quindlen-annointed Parkhurst was going to pull her story out of this free-fall. But she didn't. And the rearranged books...? I won't elaborate as not to give away any of the story, but, trust me, it's more groan-inducing idiocy.Also, for the record, even though the husband Paul Iverson tells the story, it was not quite right. Unlike, say, Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone\\" in which Lamb tells his story convincingly from the woman's perspective, I somehow always was aware that Paul's story was being written by a woman.Fellow Amazonians, my advice to you: Save your money. But if you do invest your money and time into \\"Dogs,\\" I hope you disagree with me completely and enjoy it immensely.As for me, though, I was very disappointed. Not only in this lackluster novel, but in My Anna. Missy, next time you recommend a book, I assuredly will wait to see what the critics and Amazonians have to say about the book before I make any purchase."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I don't understand the glowing reviews for this book. The characters are contrived (Lexi, mysterious woman marries Paul,divorced professor) and uninteresting. Lexi somehow convinces Paul to drive 2 days to Disney for their first date (first hint that this book wasn't going to be believable). We never learn much about the backgrounds or motivations of either character. I wanted the author to flesh out these people -- what brought Lexi to her depresssions? What were her outbursts about? We never really understand Lexi because it is written from the male perspective. Then there is the subplot of an underground talking dog society which grossly abuses dogs --- not worth the paper it took to print. And who would believe that Paul would leave his beloved dog in the backyard after meeting up with these creeps? It was a quick read, but still a waste of my time."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I picked up this book because its main character is a male (like me) who teaches college linguistics (as do I) and owns a dog (like mine). How many chances will I get to read a novel in which the main character could easily be me? I thought I would be in for a quirky character or two and an original plot that would combine humor with some ponderings on language and the gaps between people, topped off with some late-night musings about the minds of dogs (&agrave; la Mousaieff-Mason's \\"Dogs Never Lie About Love\\"). The Dogs of Babel delivers on all these expectations, but then goes on to explore them more deeply and poignantly than I could have thought possible. The resulting story is one of love, loss, the desperation we feel when we can't communicate (remember: Babel is in the title), and the evil that we are capable of when we decide we must communicate at all costs. Of course, it helps to be a dog-lover, or else many of the novel's preoccupations might just seem silly. To tell any more would be to spoil it. Perhaps one of the most amazing things about the novel is that it unfolds from a male perspective that is absolutely convincing, and that is a rare feat for a female author."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"THE DOGS OF BABEL begins with a fascinating premise: a woman died from falling out of an apple tree in her backyard. Was it accident, murder, or suicide? There was only one witness - the family dog.Linguist Paul Iverson, the husband of the deceased woman, narrates the story, giving his thoughts as to what might have happened. While trying to solve the mystery, Paul also gives us background on how he and the woman met and married, describing their relationship's highs and lows. Then odd things begin to happen to Paul...letters from prison...strange phone calls...THE DOGS OF BABEL is Carolyn Parkhurst's first novel. I hesitate to be too critical (especially since I'm about to finish my own first novel), but I will say that Parkhurst is an excellent writer. Her descriptions, characters, atmosphere are right on target. For me, the problems are only two: 1 - Parkhurst simply tries to cram too many ideas (although they are great ideas) into one book. There are easily enough ideas here to sustain two books. Confining them to one means that the important elements of the story either don't get the attention they need or they lose significance. 2 - The payoff didn't work for me. It may work for other readers, and it obviously has for some, but I couldn't buy into it. Parkhurst sets up a very difficult premise in the first chapter, one that's tough to deliver upon without descending into absurdity. The solution is not absurd, but it's also not entirely satisfying either, based on the original premise.THE DOGS OF BABEL is both an entertaining read and a page-turner. Although I wasn't wild about the book, Parkhurst's writing is certainly good enough to make me want to read her next book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This is an odd little book.

The police rule it an accident but he can't help but wonder what really happened. The more he digs, the more he finds odd about the days leading up to her death. The only witness was their dog, Lorelei, a Rhodesian Ridgeback, and Paul gets obsessed with the idea of teaching her to talk so that she may tell him the truth of what happened to Lexy - was it an accident or suicide?

We already know at the beginning that Lexy Ransome climbed the apple tree in her back yard, fell, and died. But WHY did she do it? Paul Iverson, her staid college professor husband, becomes obsessed with that question, and with learning the truth from the only witness to Lexy's fall: Lorelei, Lexy's Rhodesian Ridgeback dog. \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" alternates between Paul's memories of Lexy--a woman as impulsive and changeable as her husband is steady and stodgy--and his attempts to get Lorelei to communicate in human language. His obsession even leads him to the Cerberus Society, a truly terrifying group of maniacs who use surgical means in their efforts to reshape the canine mouth for human speech. (Paul's visit to the society is one of the most unnerving passages I've read in recent fiction; Parkhurst shows us just enough, and leaves the rest to our imaginations--the hallmark of a writer who understands how to terrify a reader.) Parkhurst's writing is lucid and lyrical, and she demonstrates a fundamental comprehension of both the irrationality of love and the impossibility of really understanding another human soul. She makes Paul a heart-rendingly sympathetic narrator, and in the end she allows him as much peace of mind as anyone who has lost the love of his life can ever really have. This is an odd, touching, and rewarding book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Upon reading the fly leaf description of this book I thought it sounded interesting and magical, and at first I wasn't disappointed. Paul Iverson's wife Lexy has died mysteriously with the couple's dog Lorelei as the only witness. While flashing back to the story of their lives together, Paul struggles with trying to discover clues about the circumstances of Lexy's demise, wishing that Lorelei could speak in order to tell him the truth about the events of that day. He actually begins to try to teach her, taking a sabbatical from the university where he is a professor of linguistics.Even that part sounds preposterous, but it really wasn't until the middle of the book, when some of Paul's choices lead him into a sick situation with the predictability of a bad horror movie (No, you idiot! Don't go to that house, what are you thinking?) ... after that, the symbolism becomes forced, the characters no longer seem believable, and surprises that should be important fall flat with their poor delivery.Parkhurst's writing style is lovely, but she could use some help on plot. Even though the cover, the book's summary, and its book club status make it appear tantalizing, I would skip this one."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Who hasn't wished to have a real heart-to-heart with a pet? And if your pet was a witness to the person you loved most in the world, who died suddenly and mysteriously, it's easy to see how that could become an obsession. Dr. Paul Iverson takes a year's sabbatical to focus on linguistic apprehension and communication in dogs-- because he wants his dog Lorelei, a noble Rhodesian ridgeback, to tell him what happened the day his beloved, few wife Lexy, a talented maskmaker, climbed to the top of an apple tree and fell out.This is a terrific portrayal of grief-- from the way Paul idealizes Lexy early on to the way his darker memories of her are allowed to surface. Yes he's holding back from us-- he knows a few significant facts about Lexy and the day before she died that he doesn't reveal until the end-- but he's probably repressing them himself, too. Like Lorelei, who goes running through the house and barking in corners when Paul murmers \\"find Lexy,\\" Paul wishes to somehow change the past and bring Lexy home.This is a hard book to put down, it's told very simply and the sense of suspense is palpable. The prose style is down to earth and Paul has his own lyricism (as when he talks about grief and its long halls and empty rooms) that is very moving. Lorelei is a terrific presence too. I didn't always like Lexy-- but it's clear that Paul was bowled over by her. Paul is so convincing that his project seems off-beat but possibly brilliant-- until you see for the first time how his house is looking through the eyes of visitors and you realize he's very depressed (dishes unwashed, dust everywhere). And when he pursues his project to a meeting with obviously dangerous, cruel \\"scientists\\" at the Cerberus society it's clear that Paul is losing it-- but that also means he's close to his breakthrough.I didn't think the twists and turns were at all unusual given the situation-- maybe the Cerberus society, but grief-stricken people have always consulted psychics and mediums and Paul's doing so seemed almost expected.I'm holding back one star only because I didn't think the revelations at the end were as convincing for me as they were for the lead character so I felt a little let-down. But overall, this is a must-read for anyone who loves animals and has ever experienced grief-- or for anyone who likes great writing."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The interesting premise of &quot;The Dogs of Babel&quot; was what attracted me to the book: can Paul Iverson teach his dog, the only witness to his wife Lexy's death after a fall from a tree, to speak so that the grieving husband can discover what happened? Once the story unfolds, however, the original story line goes astray with a series of flashbacks that explore Lexy's personality and her relationship with Paul. Ultimately it is Paul's own memories of Lexy that uncover the truth.Not only does the &quot;teach the family dog to speak&quot; action fizzle out, but there are some unbelievable and downright silly subplots that detract from the beauty of the storytelling. These include Paul's brief association with a disturbing and fanatical group of dog abusers, Lexy's rearrangement of the books on the shelves to convey a cryptic &quot;message&quot;, and Paul's conversations with telephone psychics. As we learn more about Lexy herself, she is revealed to be a very disturbed woman with a penchant for impulsive actions and violent behavior, and I did not find her to be a sympathetic character. Nor could I understand what made Paul tick, since many of his actions often seemed irrational and out of character.On the positive side, the book is well written and it does have some good points. It contains interesting symbolism about masks, as is highlighted on the front cover. There are insightful comments on relationships, love, and loss. Lexy's fanciful side, including her square egg machine and her philosophy on food and dating, provides some light moments in a predominantly melancholy story. All in all, however, I found the book disappointing."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book pulled unexpected emotions from me including full blown rage towards one of the main characters. His blindness in the face of trying to uncover the secret of his wife's death includes an act of such insensitive stupidity I wanted to jump into the pages and rescue the long-suffering Lorelei. I understand the point of exposing the animal abusers as a plot device but I think the author went overboard with the sacrifice Lorelei is required to make. It could have been made with less obvious drama and brutality.My sympathies for Paul's grief remained acute until this pivotal act. From there, it dissipated to the point of disgust.Enter this book at your own risk."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I found the book to be very entertaining..

However, The Dogs of Babel, though disturbing, is one of the best reading investments I've made throughout the year.Paul returns home from work to find that Lexy, his wife, has had a fatal fall from their apple tree. Even though the police rules out the occurrence as an accident, Paul finds various inconsistencies that tell him that something more sinister happened. But the only witness is Lorelei, a female Rhodesian Ridgeback and Paul's saving grace. A linguistics professor, Paul is convinced that he can teach Lorelei how to talk. What transpires is a disarming story that floors the reader with its various twists...The novel has a mixture of darkness and poignancy. Lexy is a rather complex character and her eccentricity spoke to me. However, I agree with some of the reviewers that complain about the lack of voice in the novel. Sometimes Paul's narration is wooden and lacks depth - making it difficult to empathize with his grief. Perhaps the novel should have been written in third person narrative. But other than that, The Dogs of Babel is one of the most original novels out there. Though the subject matter might somewhat strong for some people. A warning to dog lovers: there are some passages in this novel that are rather disturbing. Make sure you can handle it."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"A short blurb in a book club circular first piqued my interest in Dogs of Babel. \\"Grieving widower attempts to teach family dog to talk.\\" One of my favorite books of all time was Watchers by Dean Koontz. I instantly wanted to jump into this book, hoping for another taste of that level of fantasy; what would it be like if our family pet could really speak? After reading the PW review, I realized that I might not be getting what I had hoped for, but even so, I am very glad I chose to go ahead and read this book.As others have already mentioned, the story is about Paul Iverson's attempt to teach his dog to speak so that he could learn the secrets surrounding his wife's sudden death. As I read, I realized that teaching the dog to speak really wasn't Paul's focus, at all. It was just his way of coping, grieving, and remembering his wife. There is an element of poignant romance in the story as he tells the story of his wife from their first meeting to that fateful last day, but it is done in a way that is moving rather than sloppy sweet. In his narrative, you can clearly see Paul's shortcomings and his wife's mental instability, from their bizarre first date through to the end of the book. These are not perfect people, and that is what makes the book all the better.I have to admit that my favorite character in the book is Lorelei, the dog. The only places where I really cried were when she grieved in her own way the loss of her master. I did like reading about her take on Paul's attempt to teach her language, particularly in the scene where he is trying to get her to say \\"Wa\\" for water, withholds her water to make her ask for it and she (logical and intelligent) goes and gets a drink out of the toilet when she is thirsty. Very smart dog.As for Paul's side trip into the world of Cerberus; That was the only point in the book where I really hated that guy. But that brings us back to the fallibility of people and how grief affects each person differently. It seemed he'd go to almost any length to discover the truth about his wife's death, even at the expense of a very trusting companion.In short, I enjoyed the story (finished it in a day) and found the characters compelling and real. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Dogs of Babel's basic plot, involves the death of a wife named Lexy that falls from a tree. Or at least that's what is suspected. The only witness is their dog, so the determined linguist professor Paul decides he will decode the secrets of his wifes death by teaching Lorelei to speak.Parkhurst's novel works when it shows a couple coming together through usefull flashbacks, and Paul's grief of trying to get inside his dogs head. The small successes that Paul has, and the numerous failures he has with Lorelei give great insight into a mind that doesn't know how to cope with grief. As the novel continues we start also understanding the mindset of Lexy as a bit of a troubled eccentric. Shortly things get pieced together slowly between an absurd idea, and a woman who has some inner demons we're not quite sure of. You patiently and excitedly await the outcome of both story angles.. until... the book gets to the half way mark.Unfortunatly at the half way mark where the reader is waiting for a bigger expected climax, the author introduces the \\"Cerebus Society\\", (for reasons of plot spoiling I won't go into, but others have pointed out on this site) that is absolutely... ridiculous. In reading the book at this point I couldn't take it seriously many times laughing at the ridiculousness of it. Shortly after the meeting of the \\"Cerebus Society\\", the tone of the novel changes, and the dog is kidnapped.Since suddenly there is no dog, the conflict between Paul and Lorelei is gone which is the best part of the novel, and you are stuck in limbo with a stupid plot device, and then a novel that runs quickly into its conclusion.There is also a plot hole (describing it would be a spoiler). Basically in a nutshell, Paul suddenly remember something about his wife months after she died. The reality is after she died the police/coroner WOULD HAVE discovered \\"this\\" right away and TOLD HIM at the time of the death. This \\"discovery\\" is obviously used later in the novel as a gasp moment for when the writer has run out of a way to make the book more interesting.It's okay reading, and the writer has a gift for getting into the mindset of characters somewhat, but this giant wrench throws the book off place, and takes away the main focus of what made the story good in the first place. That of a man locked in grief with someone who can't get answers, but thinks he can.Sorry can't recommend it."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I don't usually post reviews, but after reading this book, and after reading many of the reviews here, felt compelled to post a review.I feel rather strongly many have missed the essence of the book.Lexy is a character with huge intensity, something I relate intimately with. It is reflected in the success of her career, where success is measured by happy clients and work satisfaction. It is reflected in her capacity to love. Those who are loved by her such as Paul will have experienced a love so rare and so intense that that in itself gives meaning to life.The intensity comes at a price. Such things which seem relatively unimportant or even trivial can affect such people so deeply that cumulatively it can cause thoughts of suicide from time to time. Therapy is often not the answer either, because you can't change other people or the world, and it's such things that make life itself not worth living. Lexy's motives are different though - she wanted to protect those she loved and felt she was best able to do so by removing herself. There is certainly credit to thinking that if one cannot be a good parent one should not be a parent.Many things come to mind too - perhaps she felt she was in a cycle where she carried the same emotional baggage passed from generation to generation, and it was time to break it. Personally, as a parent with similar intensity and thoughts of suicide, I believe that my being aware of my cycle I am able to break it with my wife's support. If I felt I couldn't, maybe things would be different for me also. But even now, I understand the pain of living with suicidal thoughts without being clinically or even often depressed.I feel the bizarre inclusion of the dog and related events are to illustrate an important point. Paul, loved as he has never been loved before, left alone with no answers, is compelled to go to extraordinary and bizarre lengths to find answers. Love has been known to have such effects on people so I am not sure I would criticise this area too harshly. The psychic hotline is a similar theme - both Lexy and Paul for different reasons were desperate and sought unconventional help.The book as a whole is written with an openness and intensity that I have never seen elsewhere. It is not without its \\"flaws\\", but I feel in so much as nothing is perfect, they are relatively insignificant to the power of the book. It is only at the very end that we understand Lexy's motives and find answers to the puzzle - and in so doing, feel her pain.People are all different - and I hope that those similar to Lexy feel the courage to stay on. These people may even spread deep and meaningful happiness to those whose paths they cross. And I hope those who can't imagine such intensity to at least understand that the world is one everyone shares, and callous actions may affect others in ways never actually intended."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"What are publishers thinking? ARE publishers thinking?Paul, the main character, has no character. He loves his wife... that's who he is. She is troubled and clearly needs therapy.The writing is somewhat tedious (do I need a paragraph to tell me they say hello to each other when he comes home?) and the book is quite sentimental, except for the dog abuse, which is horrific. I wish I could wash the book out of my mind.I have given it two stars because she defined his first wife's self-obsessed ways beautifully, having her say something like: \\"I have repeatedly asked you not to leave your dirty coffee cup on the table and you have ignored my needs and wishes.\\"Possibly the writer will grow now that she is a published author (obviously most people here disagree with me).Hug your dog."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book is, quite frankly, overhyped. It's a fast, light read, yes, but the narrator is cardboard, and I don't buy that his disconnectedness is due to grief. Paul doesn't know his wife at all, and while that is part of the point, the book relies more on plot surprises than the deep character revelation that makes a book literary. Check it out of the library, but don't shell out the cash for hardback."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I've just finished reading \\"The Dogs of Babel\\", by Carolyn Parkhurst, and wanted to peat out some reactions before the week came along and stuffed all my time and revelations in a polyester sack like a goblin. In so many words, I loved this book, but I hated it in equal measure. It was interesting study for me, because it was a perfect example of how the cover of a book can utterly deceive a reader. The evils of such publication foibles are innumerable, but this is the first time I've run up against this particular breed of deception.Across the cover of my copy, we see an angelic portrait of a dog with its head next to a woman. Interestingly, I was under the impression that the human on the cover was a child - it's a woman, I see quite clearly now, but the effect remains. It looks like the cover of a Wal-Mart Harlequin with dogs. It gives off an aura of sugary sweet messages woven into a story with characters about an inch thick facing problems long since exhausted in so far as their creative reservoirs.Could I have been more wrong? I don't know.\\"The Dogs of Babel\\" is a devastating book. It is crushing, it is brutal, and it is poisonous. I loved it, and I hated it. I loved that it was honest - that it was unflinching in its portrayal of grief and what grief can cause us to do to those we love. I loved that the prose was simple and at times striking. I loved that the characters were the dark gray of storms and shadows, I loved that the story was as bruised as its subject matter. I loved the ending, the \\"solution\\" to the mystery, and the way it arrived at said conclusion.On the other hand, I hated its main protagonist. Parkhurst didn't pull any punches - her main character, Paul Iverson, is a man caught in the tempest of fresh grief. He's off balance, and as a result, often pathetic and inconsistent. He is human, and he isn't a particularly strong breed of human - he's a professor who is surprisingly unprofessorial, he's a man who's rebounding from his second wife on the way to his third, and he's kind of an idiot on more than one occasion. I also hated his late wife, the dead woman in question. In truth, I found them anything but likable. It was a massive problem for me as a reader, but fortunately not enough of a problem to distract me from Parkhurst's perfectly decent novel that occasionally touches on great moments.It may seem nitpicky, but I was also put off by Parkhurst's take on Paul. It's never easy for an author to scale the Great Wall of Gender, and I do think she succeeded - for the most part. Sometimes, however, Paul is simply unconvincing. He's not unconvincing because his actions are unconvincing - he's unconvincing because he is nowhere near as internally angry, as tormented, or as confused as a man would really be in this sequence of events. The anger takes too long to come, and when it finally does, lasts a total of about six pages. Parkhurst has a knack for creating a female character we can really lose ourselves in (indeed, Lexy is a brilliant creation) but Paul often comes across as flat and stale as a soda cracked open and then left sitting around for two days.The story itself is a clever twist on the classic locked room scenario. A dead woman in a yard, surrounded by apples. A dog, frantically bounding back and forth, circling her body. No one saw what happened. The only witness is the dog. It's a great beginning to a mystery, and it's compelling enough beginning to end that I as a reader was able to churn through the book in about three nights of reading (I might have been able to go through even faster, had I not been consistently distracted by that oh-so-irritating thing called Life) without ever hitting a portion I felt was tacked on, unnecessary, or bloated. That's quite the achievement for an author to have, especially on their first go around with the big Vel.The story, however, takes unexpected turns. I considered how to write this review without giving away too many spoilers, but I figure in some capacity I've got to warn potential readers about what exactly they are signing up for. I for one am the kind of reader that can handle almost anything in a book, so long as I know before hand what I'm getting myself into. This book was anything but light reading. \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" handles some issues with startling candidness, subjects such as suicide, severe depression, gruesome animal abuse (I'm talking about characters performing surgeries on dog's vocal chords here, grafting human jawbones into their faces, in an effort to make them talk, etc), what effects grief has on those we love, and abortion.Wait, hold the phone. Abortion? What does abortion have to do with a dog?Well, nothing, not really. And I'm sure there will be plenty of readers who argue that no such subject is within 3000 kilometers of this tale, that I'm reading too much into it, that I'm overreacting, etc. I argue that regardless of what your beliefs concerning abortion are, know that this tale brushes close enough to that Nasty of Nasties that it will raise your eyebrow if you actually think about what you're reading.Be warned, there be dragons.As I mentioned earlier - I was given this book as a gift. It's not my usual fare, and certainly isn't the kind of book I would have picked up at a store to read. However, I tend to read the books I'm gifted, and I'm particularly glad that I read this one. It was a good book - it had moments of sheer beauty, and some moments of emotional genius. I won't deny that I cried while reading this book, which I suppose is a testament to its quality. But I felt betrayed by it, as well. I felt betrayed because the narrative lures you in with promises of surface drama, with a story that fits nicely into a shoebox that you can put on a shelf like a Hallmark card. To be clear, these are the kinds of stories that I usually describe as a waste of time.This book did not succumb to such an issue. It was a power punch, it was full of severe themes handled by fragile characters, and in the end the truest victim of all is the dog. The dog. For those who don't know (meaning anyone who hasn't met me, and no one who has), I love dogs. I love them in a deep, intrinsic way. It's apparent from the book that Parkhurst loves dogs as well, and as was revealed by her interview at book's end, she was dealing with the death of her own dog while writing this. The result is a genuine sense of emotional rot at the core of \\"The Dogs of Babel\\". It's undeniable. This book is heartbroken, soft spoken and so pathetic we want to slap it to wake it up.But we can't.We can't bring ourselves to hate this story because it's so true. It's so true that we would allow terrible things to happen to our dogs because we ourselves were so lost in our heartbreak. It's so true that a suicidal person who actually follows through with the act is willing to sacrifice the hearts and minds of the people that care about them. It's true that suicide can cost other people just as much, if not more. It's so true that we are cruel when we should instead be kind. It's so true that we have two hearts, one small one and and one big one. So much painful truth packed into one slim little book with a dog on the cover.It hurts. But it's good.7.5/10"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I so enjoyed this read. I could not put it down until I'd learned the secret of what happened. Lorelei the dog is a wonderful character and I lived that she acted always as a dog would. It was a sorrowful and thought-provoking book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I definitely thought that I was going to read about dogs that talked. I was surprised to find out that none of the dogs in this story really talk. That fact made the book more enjoyable since it made it that much more believable. I don't know why I compare so many books to Catcher in the Rye, especially since I didn't like it. Yet, Catcher in the Rye is one of the most well known depression stories. This book too is a depression story. It's difference with Catcher in the Rye is the fact that the person comes out of their depression and moves back into society. Many depression stories seem to end where they started, a person depressed. Conflict that does not provide a resolution is not a story and should never become a novel. The Dogs of Babel provides both your sense of depression and the constant struggle to push up out of depression."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Every character was pretty likeable, even Lexy. Its her character actually that makes the book worth reading. Her sense of humor and tantrums were an expert touch.This was an intense read but my only dislike was the ending. It slowly builds up and when you finally reach it its not as nearly as climatic as you would have expected...but I guess in some ways its not a bad thing, because too much drama can definately shove a good book to overkill. Although I was not fond of the ending, I love this book."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I also had heard that this book was very good and I was hesitant to read it. It just didn't \\"seem interesting\\". Man am I glad I decided to read it. It was so good. It is suce an emotiona book about the love this man had for his wife. This book is truly a love story. You can really feel his pain and torment and how he just went crazy trying to find out what really happened. It does have some graphic areas that deal with animal abuse but truly worth the read!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"To me this book can be read on many levels evoking many emotions which makes it a real work of literature. The dog is wonderful, yes I have dogs and communicate with them on many levels. Do I wish they could talk? Sometimes yes, many times I'm grateful they don't. The animal cruelty disturbed me as it did Paul so I ached with him and appreciated that people will be outraged by this as there is a lot of animal abuse out there (and just not reading this book won't make it go away) that we can take a stand against. Also grief makes many do irrational or uncharacteristic things. But I think the story isn't about Lorelei or Paul. It is about Lexy. Knowing a lot about Bipolar Affective disorder I felt her ups and downs, the rages, remorse and her compassion. Characteristic is her artistic talent and intelligence. I felt her fear in having a child as many people with Bipolar disorder are afraid not only of how they would care for a child but also if they would pass the disorder along. So afraid that in periods of despair they might contemplate what Lexy did. Had Paul truly understood her illness he would have insisted on her getting help. I think this story ultimately shows how unfamiliar people are with mental illness even in this time of the BRAIN. Lexy expressed the Stigma when she challenged Paul with \\"you think I'm crazy\\". Paul just didn't have a clue and Lexy suffered quietly not fully understanding herself. She truly believed at that moment(as an untreated depressive would) that she was doing the best thing for Paul and Lorelei by committing suicide. I too felt there was always a woman telling the story behind Paul and I think this was intentional as I truly believe Lexy was helping tell the story. I think this is a must read for all with mental disorders (when not depressed and able to see the fallacies in Lexy's thinking) and their friends and families wanting to gain some more insight. Although many seem to think this is pure fantasy I wouldn't at all be surprised if I were told it was based on real characters. I know my dogs would go find another water source (like the toilet) if I was crazy enough to withhold it until they said wa!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"It definitely isn't for everybody - but it's uniquely thought-provoking when you look at the emotions behind each action carried out in the book by the main character Paul and his wife Lexy. I would love certain parts then get weirded out on others, but couldn't put the book down. I read it in one sitting.I think after you read this book you have to ask yourself 2 questions:1) Do you REALLY know your loved ones and do they REALLY know you?2) If you lost THEE most singularly important person in your life, is there anything you wouldn't do to see them again ESPECIALLY if you didn't get to say goodbye or say all of the things you've always wanted to say to them?When I asked people who were very disciplined and firm in certain beliefs if they had lost their child, parent, spouse (mentioned all specifically by their name), would they do this or that (mentioned different immoral scenarios) just to see them again, they found themselves as surprised as I was when they realized they hesitated before answering. It's in that hesitation that you can't say what you would or woudn't do at a time of such intense, indescribable pain. You are not the same person mentally or emotionally at a time like that and that's where you find yourself actually having sympathy for Paul in The Dogs of Babel.Excellent read and definitely makes for a great insightul Book Club discussion!"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I loved this book, but it was heartbreaking to read.

The main character's wife has recently died, and the only witness to her death was their dog. Paul is a linguist who likes words, likes meaning. He holes himself up in the home they shared and looks at what he belives are clues his wife left to her death. He becomes obsessed with the concept that maybe he can teach their dog to speak, and the dog can tell him what happened. As he becomes more and more unnerved and his friends become more and more concerned, Paul relives the memories of the wife he loves; the sometimes unstable, sometimes neurotic wife he at times felt he barely knew.

Some people, a precious few, can share this with you. In the case of \\"The Dogs of Babel,\\" I was fortunate to find both the person and the book, and both changed the way I experience life. Carolyn Parkhurst, the author, deals with the grief of a man who has lost the woman he loves, a woman driven by a unique and haunting vision of life and a refusal to accept anything less. In coming to grips with this grief, he strikes upon a rather unusual idea for comprehending what happened and walks a fine line between curiosity and insanity in his desperation for understanding and resolution. Along this journey, we are given a glimpse into the beauty and the agony of an intense relationship that ends in tragedy, and the bittersweet wisdom that emerges. For those of us who have known both sides of the mirror in a way that few ever will, this novel will have even deeper impact.

Paul Iverson is a lingusitics professor whose wife dies when she falls out of a tree in their back yard. Their dog, Lorelei is the only witness to the event, and Paul believes that if he can instruct her to speak, he'll get the answer to a gnawing question: Was the fall accidental or on purpose?Where the \\"Lovely Bones\\" worked for me and this didn't is in \\"Bones\\", the main character witnesses her family and friends grieve about her. Here, Paul is the one grieving and yet it's only when another party comments on his disheveled appearance or messy house we're given clues to his state of being.I suppose we're supposed to glean from his desperate attempt to get the dog to talk it's a way to cope?The book shifts between past and present recounting the courtship and marriage leading up to the event in the tree with his wife bobbing between fits of impulsive happiness to hair pulling, table clearing tantrums.This guy didn't think she might have a problem? This is balanced with Paul attempting to teach the dog the English language, and a quickly resolved subplot of a sadistic fringe group that practices horrible experiments on canines in an attempt to get them to speak.I missed it. The only thing or creature I should say I felt anything for was the dog, but animals in peril, like children are easy button pushers for me. It's clear Parkhurst has a vivid imagination, and is technically a gifted writer, but the only message I got from the book was to hug your dog today."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Ultimately, this clever idea fails to go beyond just an idea; and the great pace and writing of the first 30 pages dissipates. Others have commented on the play of the arrangement of books on the shelves at the narrator's home, and I agree that it comes across as forced. The caper with the underground dog people is a silly and belongs in a different novel. But what really brings this novel down is the &quot;male&quot; narration which is never male enough to deal with the female lead, Lexi. Paul admires her in the way that a woman wants a man to admire her, and not the way a man would. Save your money and buy the used copies. There will be enough of them."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"The Dogs of Babel is a surprisingly lame book.In any work of fiction, characters don't have to be likeable, but they must always be interesting. Here we are presented with two cardboard cutouts who simply don't ring true -- an inert, boring man wearily pining over the death of a completely flaky, irrelevant woman. Their vapid love story struggles so hard to be romantic and quirky that it verges on the absurd (let's drive hours to Disney on our first date and stay for days! Let's jet off to another city so we can wear masks! Yawn. Yeah, right).Coincidences arrive from nowhere and stretch the imagination to the breaking point -- The moment a TV is turned on, it blares the TOP STORY on the evening news, which happens to be the story the character is most interested in. Newscasters spout unintentionally hilarious cliches, as do the police. Other bad cliches and coincidences abound -- a new-agey, caring TV psychic, who just happens to answer the phone when she is being sought after, as well as a dog who manages to escape from a research facility, show up on a main character's doorstep, and -- how surprisingly coincidental! -- become involved in the plot years later.Besides the bad plotting and sadly drawn characters, the writing repeats itself, making sure the heavy-handed symbolism is SPELLED OUT IN CAPITALS so as not to be missed by anyone with an IQ greater than that of a cucumber. One can almost hear the author gleefully thinking 'This might be an interesting thing to happen. Let me see how I can shoehorn these characters into that situation!' rather than letting events flow, and having character and action become one.I could go on, but shall not, for fear of boring you as much as this novel did me. Want quality? Read 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time' and 'Interpreter of Maladies,' two recent works written with style and depth. Avoid books like this, where the author smugly points out twice in the back cover pages that she has received university degrees from the places she studied writing. Once again we roll our eyes and learn that those with nothing to say must go get an MFA, so they can discover a 'voice.'"},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This has got to be one of the worst books I've ever read. The premise is completely misleading and definetly not for dog lovers. It's not a love story, it's not a mystery, it's just plain depressing and creepy. The wife is a complete nutjob and the husband oblivious and self-centered. I'm also disappointed that a female author wrote this crap...thanks for taking us decades back to the time when mental health and women were so poorly misunderstood. The author does nothing to offer any hope to these \\"tortured souls\\", so you are left not even caring about them, just annoyed by them. The creepiest part of this story is the animal torture, I wonder what would possess the author to even write about it. I skimmed through this section, but still felt disgusted. **Spoiler alert** The only character you end up rooting for is the dog, and then the unspeakable happens, the poor thing gets her voice box removed because the husband is an obbessed idiot thinking he could make his dog talk. On a side note, I did notice this book was also published as \\"Lorelie's Secret\\" Let me assure you, there is no secret, what you know at the beginning is exactly how it is. If Ms. Parkhurst is trying to get her readers to feel completely depressed and creeped out at the end of this story, she succeeds. Definetly not my cup of tea. I still can't figure out the rave reviews....I'm scratching my head, \\"really??\\""},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"This book's idea was alittle quirky and odd. I decided to try to read it anyway.Paul Iverson was married to a woman who was one long run on sentence. When she talked, it was as drone as could be. After his divorce from this woman, he meets at a garage sale Lexy, a woman who sparks a major interest. He talks to her about a gadget that makes \\"square eggs\\" and when he goes home he makes some for her and brings them back to her house to ask her for a date. She accepts, she likes him too and their first date is to out for dinner, but because the date will end after they eat, she insists they only order appetizers, for the next week.They travel around, going to Disney World, as they only order side dishes, still insisting that if they order dinner, that the \\"date\\" will be over. The finally order dinner, and they decide that the first date is over, that is about a week late.Lexy has a Rhodesian Ridgeback dog, who is white, and huge. Her name is Lorieli after the German siren of the Rhine. She is Lexy's companion and follows her everywhere.Paul and Lexy are married. Lexy is a very skilled craftsman,who makes masks. She makes them for weddings, part of their first date was to go to a wedding where all the guests and bride and groom are wearing masks that were handmade by Lexy. She starts to custom make them for people who have lost loved ones.Paul receives a phone call from the police that there is an accident involving Lexy. She has fallen from an apple tree in their yard and she has died. He is crushed, and perplexed as to why Lexy would climb an apple tree and for what reason??? There were a few more mysteries surrounding her reasons for climbing the tree.Loreli, the dog is the only witness to this \\"accident\\" and Paul decides he is going to teach the dog how to speak and tell him exactly what happened. He researches language, and he finds a society that acutally teaches dogs to \\"talk\\" like humans. He contacts these people and as he is at a meeting he realizes thatthese people are completely cruel to animals, by removing and reconstructing their throats and their brains. These dogs are horrifically mutualated in order to make this happen. He brings Loreli to this meeting hoping to find more answers to this mystery or Lexy's death. He becomes increasing scared of what they will do to Loreli, he brings her home. The police raid the meeting and Paul escapes without any reprecusions. Hegoes home for find Loreli dognapped, gone.The book reads from past to present, every other chapter. It tells of a man who loved his wife terribly and how he was willing to join a \\"sick\\" society in order to find out what happened to her. He desperately tries a physic from the television when he hears her voice on a pre-recorded show. He slowly pieces little puzzels together, of things that Lexy has laid out for him, explaining her death. Which he does figure out is a suicide.This book is a love story told from one point of view, past and present, and how during the morning period, how your mind canbecome less rational as you try to make sense of someone unexplained death. It also tells of a love for his dog and how he feels after he has put her in harms way.Paul puts all the pieces together at the end, of Lexy's death, and it is sad that someone with so much would want to end everything that they had and shared."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Intriguing premise, some good prose and imagination, nicely paced, but ultimately a disappointment. Once you get to the parts with an underground cult in suburbia (who just happened to live in the same neighborhood as the protagonist) doing mutilation surgeries on dogs to try to get them to speak English, a television psychic who takes copious notes of all her conversations for the book she's writing (who'd read that one?), and a PhD in Linguistics who is about as bright as a blown light bulb. Similar in tragic tone to \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" but without all the humor. My advice: speed-read through all the Dogs Hooked on Phonics stuff, and you'll finish in half the time and may be moved a bit by dysfunctional people meeting in mid-life and trying to overcome their psychological issues."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I somehow always end up reading books that leave me disturbed - and, while many people will disagree with me, that is not an emotion I particularly enjoy. ( I probably should read these reviews before I pick up the books!) Anyway, this book was no exception. While the premise sounds kind of interesting and mysterious, it really is a warped book. Unless you enjoy getting new, repulsive ideas (say, perhaps, you can't get enough from the newspaper)I'd suggest that you skip it."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"Carolyn Parkhurst paints an astonishing picture of love, love lost and survival. Paul Iverson had a beautiful life with his wife Lexy and dog Lorelei. One phone call and his life is changed forever.Lexy is found dead in their backyard after apparently falling from the large apple tree and the only witness is Lorelei.How did she get way up in that tree? Why? Did she really fall?Paul struggles with so many unanswered questions and with learning to move on through life without his wife. He begins to experiment with Lorelei to try to get answers.Many stories and past studies that Paul finds have shown that dogs have been taught to talk. If this could work with Lorelei maybe he could finally get the answers he's been looking for and get some closure.Aside from trying to pry the answers out of Lorelei unsuccessfully, Paul begins to take notice of strange clues around the house. After many years of marriage certain items that have always been in the same spot now are not and then there are the weird phone calls as well.Paul starts to realize things are not always what they seem and begins to get closer and closer to figuring out the events that took place on the last day of Lexy's life.Parkhurst tell this powerful and astonishing story in a beautiful poetic style. This novel is captivating and mysterious enough to grip the reader's attention until the very last page."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"If you're expecting a story about a man trying to teach his dog how to talk, you've got another think coming. This is about a man grieving over his wife's death. Lexy Ransome had either jumped or fallen from the top of an apple tree and the only witness is her dog Lorelei. Paul Iverson, a professor of linguistics, sets out to teach her how to talk so she can tell him what really happened.The two lead characters are extremely well drawn. Lexy is an artist who makes decorative masks for every occasion, including death masks. At one point in her life she shaved her head, had the dome tattoed with snakes and went to The Prom as the only bald-headed girl there. The Paul Iverson portrayal is impressive because of how well Parkhurst gets inside the head of a man (He is the narrator). His relationship with his first wife is especially true to life.If you're thinking this is too much of a downer for you, don't let it bother you. Just when things get especially bleak, Parkhurst throws in a little comic relief. We see Iverson trying to teach Lorelei how to say &quot;water&quot; by hiding her water bowl. She's to smart for him; she drinks out of the toilet bowl.Some parts of the novel are a bit far-fetched. During his research, Iverson finds a man who operated on dogs to make them more receptive to human speech. The man is doing prison time, but he's got a bunch of followers carrying on in his name. Iverson is so desperate to find out what happened to Lexy that he attends one of their meetings. Because Iverson is such a likable character we accept this. The book also works as a mystery, as Lexy leaves sprinkles of evidence lying about that Paul tries to decipher: she had cooked a steak just before she died, but there's no evidence she ate it; she had rearranged Paul's bookshelves; she had made a phone call to a psychic. All of this draws us further and further into the book, good to the very last bit."},{"Title":"Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection","review":"I felt like I was reading a sophomoric version of An Accidental Tourist by Anne Tyler. Unfortunately, this book utterly lacked the depth and originality of Accidental Tourist. The protagonist is supposed to be a professor of linguistics who has written multiple textbooks. Nothing in his voice or his understanding of language would suggest that he has even broken open one linguistics text, let alone authored one. The inaccuracies about language acquisition were appalling, the premise was silly, and the characters were not credible. A boring book, only to be read if you have nothing else to do."},{"Title":"Plane geometry,","review":"the book you sent me seems to have the basic information found in high school geometry 1 & 2.

In fact I read sitting on the floor because I'm bent over laughing. Seriously. Bright, witty, entertaining and knowledgable.Full of good advice and the humor to get us all through the day. Look for his other books. The one on dating is excellent, but I didn't see it listed on Amazon."},{"Title":"Money Can Make You Rich","review":"If you like money, if you are interested in money this is the book for you. Money Can Make you Rich is truly that, rich in humor and a deep look at some of the funnier experiences of the author in pursuit of Money. His ability to laugh at himself, his mistakes in attempting to make money and at some of our concepts helps to take this light hearted look at a very serious subject. For the author's first published book I think this one is a hit!"},{"Title":"Doing Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences: An Integrated Approach to Research Design, Measurement and Statistics","review":"This book is aimed at students in the social sciences, education and related subjects who have only a basic background in statistics and quantitative research design. The emphasis is on the design and execution of research projects, and includes issues of planning and sampling, measurement, choice of statistical model, and interpretation of results. Frequently, the topics research design, measurement and statistics tend to be covered in three separate texts and any links are left to the struggling student or novice researcher, who too often finds it difficult to integrate these. The aim of this book is to encourage researchers to consider all the assumptions and their interactions when making decisions during the planning of research. They need to take into account the interrelationships between 'technologies' when designing the structure of the study, creating measuring instruments, collecting data, selecting statistical tools, and interpreting the results. Therefore, the statistical tests are not just after-the-fact, but are used as part of the planning process to help make such decisions as sample size and desired reliability of instruments.The titles of the chapters are: Part I: Introduction to Research Design 1 The Nature of Enquiry 2 Beginning the Process 3 Initial Sources of Invalidity and Confounding 4 Basic Designs 5 Identifying Populations and Samples 6 Additional Sources of Confounding by the Measurement Process and Interactions 7 Refining the DesignsPart II: Measurement Design 8 Principles of Measurement and Collecting Factual Data 9 Measuring Attitudes, Opinions and Views 10 Measuring Achievement 11 Evaluating Data Quality: Determining Instrument Reliability and ValidityPart III: Turning Data into Information Using Statistics 12 Descriptive Statistics Using a Spreadsheet 13 Probability and Statistical Significance 14 Power of Statistical Tests Part IV: Ex Post Facto, Experimental, and Quasi-experimental Designs: Parametric Tests 15 Comparing Two Groups: t-test 16 One-way Analysis of Variance: ANOVA 17 Factorial Designs 18 Randomised Block Designs and Analysis of CovariancePart V: Non-Parametric Tests: Nominal and Ordinal Variables 19 Nonparametric Tests: One- and Two-Sample 20 Nonparametric Tests: Multiple- and Related-SamplesPart VI: Describing Non-causal Relationships 21 Correlation and Association 22 Regression"},{"Title":"Doing Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences: An Integrated Approach to Research Design, Measurement and Statistics","review":"There should be a table of contents of this book on theweb. If I had known it, I would not have ordered this book.The title and the contents of this book are really mismatching. I thought the book was about more practical applications of quantitative research methods to the social sciences. In reality, however, the book is about elementary-level statistics assisted by a simple computer software, accompanied by an introduction to social research methodology."},{"Title":"Doing Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences: An Integrated Approach to Research Design, Measurement and Statistics","review":"It has been several weeks now, and I haven't received this book.

Again, unfortunately, it was published in 1999 and the information on the use of Excel was not applicable to 2007. In addition, the content was not easy to follow. The feedback from other classmates was similiar to my experience. By the way this was for a graduate course.OH"},{"Title":"Doing Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences: An Integrated Approach to Research Design, Measurement and Statistics","review":"We used this textbook in a quantitative research methods course, and it was not fun. The professor, who has a doctorate in statistics and works in stats every day actually told us not to read certain chapters because they were confusing. She provided alternative materials.I am also very expert at using Excel, but I found Black's Excel exercises to be difficult to follow and poorly set up.If you have another alternative, I'd opt for that instead of Black."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The good- Several good ideas, a fairly straight forward good guy approach, and a fast read.The not so good- The point of view, the writing \\"style,\\" and the lack of realistic follow through of most of the good ideas. And the constant cliches.The bad- The repetitiveness of events and scenes, the details that don't matter (constantly), and the bubblegum flavor.It feels like a transcript or fleshed out outline of a D&D; session.Problems are presented to the reader, but are rarely solved. An example: we learn in the beginning that 2 classmates of the main character have gone missing. We later find that those classmates were also abducted into this magical world, and die. The main character cries that he's unable to help one, but after that, we hear nothing about it for the rest of the book. It's not foreshadowing, it furthers no plot or character development, and it might as well not happened. Worse, we find the main character has been missing for weeks, and yet only once or twice does he think about home, and never once about letting his grandparents know he's ok. The same people who obviously love and care for him, and were worried when it was just two of his classmates missing. What must they be going through with their ward having been missing for weeks already?This book needed an editor.Not to be entirely critical, there were some really good ideas. I like the world and the characters. The lack of encyclopedic explanation of every detail was refreshing and helped with a smooth fast read. It also served to bring in some needed tension.I can see this book appealing to some of the friends I've had over the years, and I will be recommending it to them. But I'll recommend it cautiously, with caveats and explanations.I won't be buying the sequel, but I also don't regret buying the first on speculation from a recommendation by a friend."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The writing is the worst I have seen in any published book, it reads like a high school paper. I could not get through this book so cannot comment on the plot.Edit: Other reviewers note that it was self-published."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Alright. I really tried to get through this book (it was a freebie on my e-reader). It's pretty terrible. The tense the author uses is awful. The character acts VERY unrealistically to being chucked into a fantasy world. It really is like a badly written D&D; plot.And - I've read tons of very weak fantasy over the decades. I can't think of the number of weak Dragonlance or Forgotten Realms books I absorbed as a kid. Any one of those is way more worthy of your reading time.The characters are flat and unrealistic. The descriptions are minimal, but not in a good way. Plot lines resolve into \\"travel here, get in fight, make some rhyming magic, make a friend or two\\". When the character kills a girl from his world, he kind of shrugs it off. It makes even the main character's characterization pitifully weak.This is the first fantasy book I've dropped without completely finishing...in forever. Maybe a decade? It was painful. I was really trying to finish it, but I couldn't do it...dropped about 3/4 of the way though.Oh, and the other reviewer is totally right. The author is the one leaving 5-star reviews (and in one case, spamming for his book in his other reviews...which makes it even more clearly his work)."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"A more meaningless, pointless and badly written book I haven't come across.

I'd be livid if I had paid for it! Heck, I'm livid I wasted the time to read it!Brian Pratt seriously needs an editor. He attempts to write in the present tense, but constantly slips into the past tense, often within one paragraph, and sometimes within just one sentence! He also has a plethora of run-on sentences, misused words (\\"in difference to . . .\\" rather than \\"in deference to . . .\\"; \\"affect\\" when he should have used \\"effect\\"; etc.), misplaced modifiers, etc. All this causes for a very confusing read.Also, Pratt needs to develop his characters more. All his characters are flat, two-dimensional. They are boring. Their conversations are dull.Pratt tells a story. He does not show his reader. I have no idea what James (his main character) looks like. I have no idea what the buildings and towns and forests look like. Pratt's trees are tall. His buildings have signs outside. Big whoop! Show me HOW tall! Describe the building!The book has potential, but it needs a ton of work and a good editor. I am surprised this was ever published! Whatever editor he did have needs to be fired and hung in the town square by his toenails!Still, all that said, Pratt has accomplished something I haven't: his work has been published. Perhaps now I can stop being so hard on myself with my own self-editing, since this drivel has made it into print."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"It appears that someone took a game of D&D and tried to write a story from it.

That being said... Read it. This book is bland at times, but at others it does start to become enticing. The reason I suggest this book, however, is because the series is wonderful. Each book becomes more elaborate, the story line onfolds nicely then twists back over itself to throw you for a loop, and the imagination is enjoyable, and the characters are easily identafiable with people you know."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"It's an alright book. The author's switching from narrative form to prose and back again seems to happen at random and can be somewhat disconcerting.

I liked the characters and although yes, it is more or less a Dungeons and Dragons adventure, I'm an old D&D;'er from decades ago so I had fun with it. BUT - the switching from present tense to past tense, often in the same paragraph, serves no purpose. It's as if it were originally written in past tense, then edited into present tense with many errors and omissions. And I find the poor use of \\"its\\" and \\"it's\\" and other such grammatical and spelling errors take away from my enjoyment. But then, I find these errors in just about everything published these days, so obviously nobody else really cares, so I just grin and bear it.All in all, a fun read, an hour or two of escape from reality, easily forgettable.
