Joy"},{"Title":"Dressing Smart in the New Millennium","review":"Back in my school days, I used to envy the girls in my class who had big sisters. Usually, these girls were avoiding the klutzy mistakes the rest of us made because their older sisters told them the pitfalls to avoid and what to do to be the coolest of the cool. In her book &quot;Dressing Smart for the New Millennium,&quot; author and image consultant JoAnna Nicholson becomes that cool, hip and in-the-know big sister for those of us who are clueless about what looks fab and what looks drab, what looks chic and what looks cheap and what looks terrific and sexy as opposed to terrible and sleazy. And, the best news: Nicholson promises us that we don't have to be skinny little supermodels to look sensational. No matter what our weight, height, ethnic group or appearance, she has the fashion and make up tip to make us look like a million dollars -- and often, we don't have to spend a dime on our wardrobe to do it. She tells how to mix and match jackets and other separates so that one outfit can be worn a jillion ways and gives tips about how to look great even at the end of a busy day. Did you know that you can keep your lip color from wearing off at a meal? Simple: just use a lipliner pencil as a first coat underneath your lipstick; when the latter wears off the undercoating will show, making you look like you still have lipstick on. Why didn't I think of that? And by using shoulderpads and &quot;pegged&quot; skirts -- straight skirts that are narrower at the hem than at the hips -- you can look more slender even after the extra holiday pounds. Who should buy this book? You should, if, in the author's words, you wouldn't want your favorite movie star to see you as you are right now. She tells us not to leave the house in &quot;grubbies,&quot; because you never know who will see us looking our worst. Nicholson says that even royalty has asked her what she does to look so good. After trying a few of her tips, and getting more compliments than ever before, I believe it. Before you go spend a mint on a new outfit, invest in this book. It could save you from making a fashion mistake. And, who knows, it could turn a few heads."},{"Title":"Dressing Smart in the New Millennium","review":"This book is a must for every woman.

This book is intended for scientists, engineers, mathematicians, managers, and other college-educated persons who need to interact intelligently with radar experts. J.C. Toomay's book won't make you an expert, but the consise, focused chapters will quickly acquaint you with the radar concepts you need to contribute in development or analysis of systems that include elements of radar technology. One note of caution is that this book does treat a very technical subject, and although Toomay doesn't spend pages deriving radar equations, the reader will need a good understanding of integral calculus and fourier analysis to get the most out of his book. A solid background in engineering or physical science is a thorough prerequisite for getting the most out of this book.Highly recommended as an introduction to radar technology for those who don't plan to go back to college for a Masters degree in electrical engineering."},{"Title":"Radar Principles for the Non-Specialist, Third Edition (Hardcover) (Scitech Radar and Defense)","review":"This book has the fewest errors and least misleading information on radar and propagation pound-for-pound of any books on electromagnetism I have seen.

I'm a Physicist turned Radar Systems Engineer for going on 30 years now and I cut my teeth on this book when it was still an Air Force publication. It is simply a work of genius to be able to take a complex and intricate technical topic such as radars, and to be able to distill it and simplify it down to such fundamental core essence that anyone can learn and understand at least the basic principles: even if they are not an engineer. That was its intent then when it was first written and it is the intent today. And it masterfully succeeds at that. Even though I have long since graduated from Radar 101, I still have a copy handy in my library and I still find myself even today referencing it, if but only to use it to present a simple explanation of a radar concept to the less initiated. To compare this book to Skolnik is just plain absurd, and illustrates that these evaluators just completely missed the point of this book despite having supposedly read it. And, oh by the way, just because you have a copy of Skolnik on your shelf does not mean you have read it, nor does it mean you understand it, nor does it by itself make you a Radar Engineer. Skolnik left out an awful lot of stuff to get it down to still being a \\"HandBook\\". That means there is a lot of stuff you need to know or figure out yourself if you are actually going to evaluate or implement real radar techniques and technologies. Nor does Skolnik have everything about radar in it (despite its thickness). Radar is not a one book topic, and you need a library containing a multitude of books from at least the likes of Barton, Stimson, Richards, Mahafza, and a couple of dozen more to fill in the gaping holes left in Skolnik's admittedly classic tomb. And that does not even cover the more esoteric signal processing, target tracking or classification aspects of radar, which are full up disciplines all by themselves. Bottom line is that this is absolutely the very first book that EVERY aspiring Radar Engineer should have on their self. And once they have truly mastered it and moved on (and BTW, simplicity can be deceiving), give it to a Manager, Colonel or General so you have a chance of actually talking semi-intelligently to them about Radar. That is both the purpose and the magic of this classic incredibly well executed little book. If you think you are too smart or too mathematical to own a copy, then get one for the rest of the people you need to interface with.

I couldn't get past the first chapter of this book, not that's it hard. Far from it, it gives a very simple presentation of its subject matter - too simple, to the point that it leaves out the basics. It wouldn't even be so bad, except that when you get down to the end-of-the-chapter questions the author quizzes you about those basic things he didn't bother to tell you in the text. So it was with the first question of the first chapter. I spent hours boggled as to what role the \\"aperture\\" played in a radar's design; for those who don't know that's the term used by radar engineers for the area of their antenna, while a single sentence to that effect could have saved a lot of confusion - it was nowhere to be found. I had to look elsewhere to find answers to my most simple of questions. And if I'm going to look elsewhere, why use this simple book at all?I suppose if you're already thoroughly familiar with radar engineering and want a point by point review this text may have some value. But as far as it's purported audience - novices who want to be brought up to speed - it just doesn't work. If he put in the details (like defining his technical jargon before usage) it might make sense, or at least if there were some worked out examples you might be able to piece things together, but lacking in both the former and the later the text is nothing but a frustration."},{"Title":"Radar Principles for the Non-Specialist, Third Edition (Hardcover) (Scitech Radar and Defense)","review":"The book arrived on time and it is new as announced.

This self-published volume is littered with typos, but this does not overwhelmingly detract from its being a good read that will no doubt be useful in helping some people to change their lives. It is written in an in-your-face confessional style, which, of course, is appealing to many these days.In it he attempts to make amends for past wrongdoings, and he \\"tells it like it is\\" when it comes to \\"wrongs\\" that he has committed and that he believes have been committed against him - including living family members. He sometimes diagnoses the \\"roots\\" of the problems of others who have scorned him, although he has no formal training in psychology.An odd feature of the book is that while he makes it clear that he is \\"promoting\\" the AA, NA, etc. lifestyle, those organizations themselves are founded upon anonymity. (Saint Bill W. himself was tempted to self-promote, so who can \\"blame\\" John Stover for succumbing to the temptation?) Perhaps odder still is that although this book is autobiographical, Stover alters his last name within its pages. (What's the point of that?)ROAD RUNNER could be instrumental in turning around the lives of troubled individuals with an emotional maturity level below the age of 24, and so should not be dismissed out of hand despite its being in need of professional editing. You don't have to be an addict (active or recovering) to enjoy Stover's flowing, and by turns acerbic and romantic prose style.

Fossum's \\"The Image of the Invisible God: Essays on the Influence of Jewish Mysticism on Early Christianity\\" (Novum Testamentum et Orbis Antiquus, v. 30. Freiburg, Schweiz: Universit&auml;tsverlag; G&ouml;ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1995) opens in its introduction by offering a simple \\"graph\\" set of definitions and relationships: Mysticism, we are told, is \\"vertical\\" apocalypticism and is supplementary to eschatology which is \\"linear\\" apocalypticism. The concern of mysticism in this schema is the heavenly world (hence \\"vertical\\" or \\"up\\") and the ways in which humanity can gain knowledge of those mysteries.The work is a collection of essays, some published earlier, some given at various conferences and the like. In setting his essays in context, Fossum uses his introduction to take the reader on a quick, but thorough, survey of work on the question of the influence of Jewish mysticism in early Christianity. He grounds his survey in the work of the early 20th century by noting a relative lack of such work as the century progressed. He follows G. Scholem's argument of a tradition-historical connection between the idea of heavenly ascent in the apocalyptic literature and later rabbinic-era Merkabah and Hekhalot texts. At the same time, he stresses the need to avoid an anachronistic reading of the Judaism of early Christian period as *solely* the later, orthodox, Rabbinic Judaism with which we are more familiar, and to recognize the diversity of the forms of Judaism that really characterize the period, noting that the inclination for doing so has increased in recent years with the rise of interest in apocalyptic and pseudepigraphal literature.\\"The Image of the Invisible God: Colossians 1.15-18a in the Light of Jewish Mysticism and Gnosticism.\\"This leads off the essays. Acknowledging the births of Christianity and Gnosticism out of the same cultural matrix, this essay opens with the intent to merely \\"flesh out the historical context for the terms and motifs used to describe Christ.\\" (p. 15) A first discussion on the description of Christ as \\"the image of the invisible God\\" takes us away from the Adam-Christology of Paul and into that line of tradition common to Hellenistic Judaism and to Gnosticism to speak of the \\"image\\" of God as an hypostasized image distinct from both God and man. The Greek word \\"phos\\"--translatable as either \\"man\\" or \\"light\\"--is the basis for this line of meaning and some of the various mythologies behind such \\"images\\" (later swept out of the faith by rabbinic Judaism) are explored, as well as the use of the idea of such an intermediary by Philo. Hellenistic Judaism could combine the \\"phos\\" of Gen 1.3 to the Glory of God on the heavenly throne and Christ in Col 1.15 can be the same identification and physical embodiment of God: a conception different that the idea of Sophia or Logos as divine image.A second consideration in this essay is the naming of Christ as \\"firstborn,\\" a term commonly attributed as an allusion to Prov 8:22. Instead, Fossum considers it in light of the closest actual parallel which is a fragment of the \\"Prayer of Joseph\\" preserved by Origen. Here the angel Israel is conceived of as the Glory of God, and \\"his name \`Firstborn of every living thing' would seem to allude to the light which was brought into being on the very first day and which could be construed as a heavenly Man, even the Glory.\\" Since Christ is hailed in the same way in Col. 1:15, Fossum concludes, this could be another piece of evidence that the hymn recognizes him as the Glory of God.In considering Christ as a demiurgic figure in v. 16, the idea of Colossians conveying a Sophia Christology is again contrasted with a heavenly Man figure, who could also bear that demiurgic function. Fossum cites a heavenly Man in the \\"Gospel of the Egyptians,\\" a Gnostic text called the \\"Poimandres,\\" and the beliefs of an apparently pre-Christian sect called the Magharians to that effect. Fossum likewise is interested to point out that the description of Christ as head of a \\"cosmic \`body' of the Church\\" in Col 1.18a is arguably related to contemporary Jewish mystical language of God's having a \\"body\\" as articulated in various ways in such documents as the \\"Shicur Qomah,\\" the \\"Lesser Hekhalot\\"--our oldest Jewish mystical work, from the second or third century BC--and the writings of the Jewish Christian Elchasai, who put the body of an angel he identified as the \\"Son of God\\" at an impressive 96 miles in height.So instead of the more-or-less consensus among exegetes at reading Col 1 as an example of Sophia-Christology, Fossum has offered an alternative in trying to read the hymn as an Anthropos-Christology, an attempt he justifies by the fact that both readings are possible out of a pre-Christian Jewish milieu. He claims his argument's success in that the themes examined are not typically present in a Sophia-Christology. Such a Christology usually never identifies Sophia as God's \\"image,\\" or as \\"firstborn\\" (denying the famed application of Proverbs here), and while Sophia can be a demiurge in the Jewish mystical tradition, no such speculation about the Body is tied to Sophia-thinking. Thus he feels that an Anthropos-Christology, whose roots can be seen in earlier Jewish and Gnostic mysticism, is a better avenue for our reflection upon the text.\\"Kyrios Jesus: Angel Christology in Jude 5-7.\\"This has Fossum considering a question he does not think has ever arisen before: whether Jude 5-7 presents Jesus as the Angel of the Lord. Noting the controversy over the textual variant in v. 5 as to whether \\"Jesus\\" (the most critically-supported likelihood) or \\"Lord\\" is the preferable reading, he ends up saying that which reading you use really does not matter. Even if it is \\"Lord,\\" he notes, one still must accept that people felt free to replace that with \\"Jesus,\\" and even \\"theos\\" in some variants. Then, given the acts reported of this figure--delivering the Israelites from Egypt, destroying their pursuers, imprisoning the fallen angels, and destroying Sodom and Gomorrah--he refreshes our minds of the long tradition of reading these acts of God as being specifically performed by \\"the Angel of the Lord,\\" and of reading this OT figure as a manifestation of the pre-Incarnate Son, as we see in writers like Paul and Justin. Through a very lengthy set of textual comparisons, he argues that \\"it would not have impossible for Jude to have anticipated Justin's identification of the Angel of the Exodus as Jesus.\\" (p. 60) Philo had already identified the Logos with that Angel, and Sirach has Wisdom replacing the Divine Name held by the Angel. Marshalling the textual tendencies in this direction within Jewish spirituality, it is not surprising to find Fossum hailing Jude as having used \\"Jesus\\" as a name for the pre-existent Son even some fifty years before Justin would do so.\\"Ascensio, Metamorphosis: The \`Transfiguration' of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels.\\"This essay or chapter follows the same general plan of comparing the NT text with a variety of earlier Jewish passages in which similar motifs might be discerned. This exercise, however, comes across as sloppier and more contrived than those we have read up to this point. Jesus' transfiguration is itself transformed and is recast in terms of an ascension schema. Motifs like \\"going up the mountain,\\" \\"acting after a six-day [preparatory?] period,\\" \\"a transformed appearance,\\" \\"transformed clothing,\\" and \\"being overcome by a cloud\\" all are tied to similar Mosaic motifs from Moses' ascent of Sinai. But in their application to the Transfiguration story, details that do not line up are forced or ignored, a number of absurdities are proposed and some of Fossum's conclusions seem rushed or self-contradictory.For example, in order make the ascension theme work, Fossum has to insist that the journey to the top of the mountain where Christ will be seen in a transformed way is an ascent to heaven: that the height of the mountain is in itself as far up as one could walk in the three-story universe, and thereby gets the party to where the vision of Christ can take place. Fossum is correct in portraying many of the mountain scenes in earlier Jewish literature--like Moses on Sinai in Ezekiel the Tragedian's \\"Exagoge\\"--as a kind of view of heaven and God's throne, but it is less clear that such is the case here. It could just as easily be talked about in terms of a \\"descent\\" than an ascent, but the point is forced. Then we see details acknowledged like the lack of any fading-away of the light in Christ, or the absence of such light in Moses' and Elijah's faces--or the disciples'--although they, too, should be understood as having just been in the divine presence. Such details are acknowledged, but then left unexplained or ignored. We begin to see a few absurdities when Peter proposes building shelters for the three heavenly figures, and this is taken as proof that Peter realizes that he is in heaven, but which misunderstanding about his duty to build in heaven requires him being corrected. Peter makes no such clear assumption, but it would allow Fossum to draw out another weak parallel. Similarly, Fossum notes that the voice from the cloud identifies Jesus as his Son, but does so in the same words as the identification at Jesus' baptism: therefore while the voice may be real, the actual text of what the voice says betrays Mark's editing hand. Finally, after having just stated that the voice in the cloud identifies Jesus as his beloved Son, Fossum goes on to note in his conclusion that the meaning of the story here is to point out that Jesus \\"has become their equal.\\" This looks more self-contradictory and is symptomatic of the comparative weakness of this essay compared to the others we have read thus far.While a line-up of interesting and compelling parallels are introduced in this essay, the over-all sloppiness of the parallel's lining-up *to* the text limits the usefulness of this reading of the Transfiguration. The fact that Fossum seems to both want to turn the entire Transfiguration story into a contrivance created through the recycling of these Exodus motifs, *and* to acknowledge it as an actual event in the life of Christ, creates problematic tensions that leave perhaps too great a strain on the credulity of the reader. The weight of these sewn-together motifs overwhelms the significance of the story itself and does not let the narrative speak for itself or to flow at all. Instead, one is left with a confusing pile of re-used OT themes that do not seem to carry any coherent and unifying meaning if we accept Fossum's reconstruction in too strong a way.\\"Partes Posteriores Dei: The \`Transfiguration' of Jesus in the Acts of John.\\"Another essay on the Transfiguration takes its departure point from a non-canonical text. This one is more modest in its goals and resultingly more successful. In this case, Fossum's interest is in drawing our attention to the body of the transfigured Jesus, particularly in the two themes of the great size of the transfigured or glorified body, and in the idea of its \\"nakedness.\\" Again, he draws attention to the Exodus stories of Moses and Sinai and speaks of both Sinai and the Transfiguration as being ascent stories. (This paper and the previous one were earlier combined and presented together, which may also account for what seemed the previous essay's \\"messiness.\\") After the manner of Moses' seeing God from behind, the \\"Acts of John\\" (c. 200 AD) also presents the disciple as only being able to see the Glory of God, for in the \\"Acts\\" John is presented asapproach[ing] him discretely, as if he does not see, and stand looking at his hinter parts. And I see him not dressed in clothes at all, but stripped of those we saw [before], and not at all like a man. And ... his feet are whiter than snow, so that also the ground is lit up by his feet, and that his head reaches up to heaven, so that I became afraid and cried out. And he, turning around, appeared as a small man and took hold of my beard and pulled it, and said: \`John, do not be faithless but believing, and not inquisitive!'Both the nakedness of Jesus, his feet (at least) turning dazzling, and the enormity of his body (while he is turned away from John, \\"transfiguring,\\" as it were) are all themes seen in various other texts, canonical or apocryphal, relating to the heavenly body. Fossum leads you to some comparisons and gives you some idea of the relative representation in the literature of these varied forms of the new body. \\"Naked,\\" he feels, is not quite the most accurate description of the body, as most texts speak of the heavenly body as then \\"clothed in light.\\" This is why he thinks this text immediately qualifies Jesus' nakedness with describing his appearance as \\"not at all like a man.\\" In short, all these descriptors are to be properly understood in the way that they add the most to the Glory of Jesus, and not in ways in which they might be considered as detracting from it.\\"In the Beginning was the Name: Onomanology as the Key to Johannine Christology.\\"Here we have perhaps the most fun essay of the set. Fossum begins with a blanket rejection of Bultmann's long-influential attempt to describe the teaching about the Logos in the Prologue to John as \\"Sophianology,\\" on the grounds that Sophia simply does not qualify to fulfill the role of the Logos as John describes it: the Logos has always existed in John, it was not the first thing created as Wisdom was in Proverbs; the Logos descended and become incarnate whereas there is no such description for Sophia. Instead, Fossum offers a wide set of texts as evidence that the Jewish motif which John *does* fulfill is that of the Logos being a concept that stands in for the Angel of the Lord, particularly manifest as the divine Name or Tetragrammaton.The texts he cites are offered in comparison to the following traits of John's Logos: the Name is eternal, and can even be regarded as a/the Power of God and hypostasized. The Name was the instrument of Creation, possibly even after the mode of a demiurge. The Name was also given to the Angel of Yahweh, and thus could be indicative of the pre-Incarnate Logos. The Name tabernacled among the people in the Temple of God. All this harmonizes rather nicely with John's treatment of the Logos and makes for one of Fossum's more compelling essays, although occasionally still marred by such confusions as saying that \\"the Gospel of John never makes a clear reference to Jesus as the Name...\\" which is then followed by a long quote from John 17 where Jesus in fact says, \\"Holy Father, keep them in Your Name, which You have given me....\\" Editorial problems like this aside, this essay must from now on be considered mandatory reading for anyone working on the Prologue to John's Gospel.\\"The Son of Man's Alter Ego: John 1.51, Targumic Tradition and Jewish Mysticism.\\"This essay was Fossum's examination of connections between the saying of Jesus to Nathaniel in John 1.51 and the dream of Jacob in Gen 28.12. Thinking that the idea of Jewish tradition that Jacob had some kind of image in heaven was in fact an obscuring of the earlier idea that Jacob had an image carved on the heavenly throne of glory that was in fact identical with the Glory, Fossum reconstructs a picture for us of angels who were familiar with the Glory itself descending and ascending to and from Jacob in order to view the earthly image for themselves. In the same way, Fossum argued, the Son of Man was both in heaven and on earth at the same time and John's point is to say that Nathaniel--and the reader who \\"envisions\\" Jesus in the Gospel--are able to see the heavenly Glory that is the Son of Man in Jesus who walks here with us on earth.Conclusion.On the whole, while many of Fossum's arguments are hardly conclusive, the texts that he brings together are a useful tool for the student of the Gospels. If discerning the effect of Jewish mysticism on early Christianity is not so much making conclusive, deductive arguments, but is instead the re-construction of a \\"mystical imagination,\\" then Fossum's book will go a long way toward bringing together those texts and images that might enable one to enter this part of the mind of the early Jewish Christians. The book is also valuable in establishing a beachhead for a great deal more scholarship that can be pursued: the topics of the book, while illustrative, are hardly exhaustive, and leave plenty more to be done. Perhaps its greatest contribution to further scholarship, then, would be the high level of mastery of the oft-obscure Jewish texts that are necessary to attempt serious work in this direction."},{"Title":"Residential Architecture: Continuing Dialogue","review":"This book was invaluable in helping us plan our dream home. The Amazon.com reviews seem extreme - - real users planning real homes seem to love this book. That's exactly who we are, and we're glad we ignored the nay-sayers here! It's true that if one is looking for ultra-modern, cutting-edge design that abhors tradition and pushes the envelope, this probably isn't the book for you. However, for real people planning updated, traditional homes that have a sense of timeless beauty and grace, this book works! We've gotten quite a few ideas from it that we absolutely love."},{"Title":"Residential Architecture: Continuing Dialogue","review":"This is nothing more than a glossy brochure for a mediocre builder.

Not knowing much about architecture and design, this book was a wonderful reference for my husband and me. The beautiful pictures helped us in deciding what we truly wanted in our dream home.

It contains every custom home builder cliche ever concieved. Or, in other words, it contains all the main stream unoriginal home ideas that you can view for free at any home plan website. There is no substitute for an imaginative architect and this book is no exception. The best any homeowner can do when researching the process of building a new home is to find a good builder and a good architect... this book represents neither. My advice, skip this title!"},{"Title":"Residential Architecture: Continuing Dialogue","review":"if you are interested in architecture, try reading something a bit more profound. This picture book is uninformative and the homes represent poor design taste."},{"Title":"Residential Architecture: Continuing Dialogue","review":"Do you have any idea how hard it is to find examples of high-rise remodeling? Trust me, it's not easy. The small section on Mr. Tringali's creation at 5000 Town Center alone is worth the price of the book! 5000 Town Center is metropolitan Detroit's only true high-rise condominium tower. The photos are beautiful; I just wish that there were more of them. I really appreciate the fact that the floor plan was included for this design, but most of the other homes are shown without floor plans. This small section of the book is a rare chance to see inside of one of the many fantastic designs in 5000 Town Center. Unfortunately, but understandably, it's almost impossible to see all of the designs in the building, even on their own 5000TownCenter web site. It kind of makes sense - after residents buy their space, spend hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of dollars rebuilding their new home, they just want to enjoy it for a long time to come. These units are almost never available for purchase.(A few years ago a back ordered a book, sight unseen, on high-rise homes. It cost me almost $70 and turned out to be a children's book. I wish that I would have been able to buy this book back then.)"},{"Title":"The memoirs of Jacques Casanova de Seingalt","review":"I did not get this six book set at Amazon I got it at an estate sale.Since there have been no reviews yet I would just like to say that anyone who likes biography mixed with history and love, this is just a great set.

After reading this book, you will never get these two confused ever again.The only problem now is that since my two cats and my black Lab retriever saw this book, they now hide behind the furniture and under my bed whenever they see me coming.

Ty is a 34-year-old head cameraman on a reality game show, and Shannen and her twin sister are finalist contestants. Nine years ago Ty was a third-year law student mutually in love with Shannen, who'd told him she was a 22-year-old grad student. Much to his horror, and fortunately before the relationship had been consummated, he discovered she was an underage high school student of 17. He broke up with her harshly, not wanting to take any chance Shannen would attempt to keep them together, since he didn't believe he could resist her. Later, when she was of age, Ty wanted to look Shannen up. But by then major scandal had rocked his family, sending his father and brother to jail, and he figured she'd want nothing to do with him. Now on the island, they have a second chance at love, except....if they get involved, Shannen will be disqualified from the contest, and Ty will lose his job.As a long-time fan of Barbara Boswell, I've read and enjoyed every book she's ever published. She writes with sympathy and flare about family relationships, and she's particularly fun when she deals with twins and triplets, a favorite theme of hers. Her stories are consistently light-hearted and uplifting, often funny, and always sexy. This book certainly displays each of those wonderful traits. As for the story line of this particular book, even if you don't like reality game shows (I confess, I don't), that won't interfere with enjoying All in the Game. It serves as a quite interesting and often clever backdrop for the hot relationship between the appealing hero and strong, intelligent heroine.Boswell has a sharp, unique author voice; her writing is smooth and polished, avoiding aggravating redundancies, and she doesn't dump in endless backstory at the beginning of her books, as so many other novelists tend to do. Instead, she carefully sprinkles in pertinent information about the protagonists' pasts throughout the course of the story in a way that adds to interest and tension. In addition, I particularly appreciate her use of close, third-person point of view. By that I mean that she only uses the point of view of two people, the hero and heroine, and it is very clear at all times when she's switched point of view. This technique allows the reader to have a much deeper, more intimate relationship with the protagonists. Unfortunately, very few authors of *any* popular genre of fiction seem willing or able to write in close third, choosing instead to employ omniscient as (seemingly) a good excuse for careless head-hopping and frequent, long swatches of tell-don't-show narrative. Taking a vacation from that kind of writing makes it doubly a treat to read a consummate pro like Ms. Boswell."},{"Title":"All In The Game (Man Of The Month)","review":"Predictable and boring. Would not recommend. Had to hurry and download a book to learn how to use new kindle at library. Since had on device, thought i'd read it."},{"Title":"All In The Game (Man Of The Month)","review":"I enjoy reality tv shows, especially Survivor, which this book is clearly a spoof of. Boswell's version of Survivor, called Victorious, however, shows none of the creativity of Survivor. The stunts (such as standing on a plank for hours and seeing who falls first) are all ones that have already been done in Survivor. More complicated stunts might have been harder to write though. There's very little scheming, and what scheming there is is underdeveloped. Survivor is interesting because of the cast of characters, but we learned little about the characters who were constantly mentioned. Furthermore, the twists in the game would never be the ones used in a reality tv show because ratings would be horrible. For example, Survivor would never let one tribe dominate so much that the merged tribe was all from the same original tribe. Reality tv shows are interesting and creative, because the production team will try to change things up if they're boring. Boswell does this once, but the change she writes is incredibly stupid. None of the hardships of Survivor are explained other than they're hungry, have blisters, and only the twins work hard. What about feeling betrayed, bug bites, uncomfortable places to sleep, rainy nights, etc?A few examples of Victorious that got on my nerves, Ty never got yelled at for getting involved with a contestant (the whole relationship/ trying to supply Shannen with food and ointment). He's a lawyer, at the least he signed a contract to do the show! The show was supposedly on tv at the same time as the filming. Shannen is supposed to be on the jury, but she's allowed to go back to the tribe's home to watch the immunity competition. Lauren (her twin) falls off the log that she's balanced on and slips into water and everyone acts like Lauren's about to die. Duh, she's on a reality tv show on a island surviving, hasn't she dealt with some hardships? She's not a four-year-old who needs sis to kiss her booboo.Furthermore, I didn't feel that there was any chemistry between Ty and Shannen. The sex scenes were so tepid. Ty gets turned on, they fall into bed. Big deal!I didn't think the conclusion between Lauren and Ted was explained satisfactorily. We find out that Ted is a jerk, but Lauren goes off with him happily and then she comes off very mad at him and we never figure out why.And then at the end, when the twins are told to dress alike, they didn't know that they were going to be used for something? I mean, hello, at the least Shannen has proved that she's not so gullible. And Lauren wasn't really gullible either other than briefly with Ted.I kept reading this book just to see if Boswell would ever use a potentially interesting storyline and actually make it interesting. The basic plot (two people meet on a reality show, one contestant & one cameraman) had a lot of opportunities to show creativity. Unfortunately, it was just boring."},{"Title":"The Mass of Brother Michel","review":"There are some books that you meet as strangers in a hallway and part as dear friends forever changed.

A sort of mental reset button for individuals going through tough times and wondering if they'll last forever. No, they won't and here's the reassurance from 43 well-known and famous women who have been-there, done-that and can tell you in no uncertain terms what they -- and you -- should keep in mind when the tough stuff comes your way.Compiled and written from the premise of: \\"If you could somehow postmark a letter back through time to you younger self, what age would you choose and what would the letter say?\\" Ellyn Spragins offers brief introductions and letters from 43 women whose names you'll probably recognize.

But with a mentor and some training, your success could really be amazing.\\" (Rachel Ashwell)\\"I'm not one of those adults who think kids have the best lives. I know how much the world's traps and dangers burden you...But you're going to be okay. Roz, here's the other thing I want you to know. Being an adult is better than being a kid. You're going to grow up -- healthy and whole -- and everything you're feeling now is going to be great material for your work.\\" (Roz Ghast)\\"...failure is busting you wide open so that you can learn what true success means: being a whole person, someone with balance and compassion...You'll learn that it's okay to be vulnerable and okay to say. 'I don't know what I'm supposed to do with my life.' You'll develop a taste for the happiness you can have just from living a life, from mundane, everyday pleasures...\\" (Jane Kaczmarek)Excellent book!

If you think &quot;democratic pedagogy&quot; sounds dull, think again. The Process of Becoming is engaging and timely. People who prize democracy often express negative views of Nietzsche. But Leslie Sassone, a highly regarded professor at Northern Illinois University, shows a deeper understanding. She has used her thorough knowledge of Neitzsche and her personal life confrontations to create an informed, humane, powerful text that demonstrates the connection between group well being and personal truth. I have used the book to show doctoral aspirants that dissertatins can be literate and truthfull. I especially like the clean style, honest revelations, and multi-leveled texture of meaning.

Following each chapter's explanation is a problem set of 30 or so problems, which tests the student on the latest concept and every single other concept covered so far. Needless to say, doing the same kind of problems over and over and over again gets very old.

Asma's book, Following Form and Function: A Philosophical Archaeology of Life Science, could also have been titled, Everything you wanted to know about the Cuvier-Geoffroy debate but were afraid to ask. Either title might, unfortunately, suggest a difficult book, addressing either a subject too arcane to be of interest to the general reader, or an unnecessary exercise: in regard to this latter concern, one could put forth that in our &quot;sophisticated&quot; time the inextricable linkage of form and function is taken for granted;onsequently the debate between Cuvier (arguing for the primacy of form/function) and Geoffroy (arguing for the priority of morphology/structure) is both deeply antiquated, and long resolved.Early in his text, Asma sets the conceptual priorities straight: the central subject of his text (p 7), the form and function debate, speaks directly to the most profound questions of epistemology and metaphysics. Citing Stephen Gould (p 170n9,188n1) Asma proposes that this central subject is of greater immediacy and goes deeper than the conceptual struggle between evolution and creationism (Huxley).By seating this debate in its proper historical, and philosphical context, the whole Western philsophical canon (from Aristotle to Darwin and back again is the title of one of his references) falls into the ambit of Asma's deftly written book. And his explanations, although perforce not infrequently a bit detailed, are with just a little effort encouragingly apprehensible.Asma book is particularly successful in its attempt to shed light on one of the least tractable areas (most difficult to learn about/teach) in biology and philosophy: the vexatious arena of telology. A New York Times Book Review of Edelman's Bright Air, Brillant Fire was entitled, The Chicken and the Egg Together at Last; I could also have entitled this review, The Acorn and the Oak Together at Last, because Asma's explanation of non intentional (organistic, organismic) teleology is both compelling, and the best I come across.Notably the Cuvier/Geoffroy debate has recently sufaced in the popular scientific literature (e.g., Gould (11/85) Geoffroy and the Homeobox, NH; Gould (10/86) Archetype and Adaptation, NH, Gould (2/97) As the Worm Turns NH; Desmond (82) Archetypes and Ancestor UOC; Zimmerman (98) At The Waters Edge, fP, also texts by Kauffman, Goodwin). Gould's essays (Gould apparently mentored some of Asma's early effort)in particular provide a rather excellent acompaniment to Asma's more puristic philosphical project.In closing, I suggest you open this book: from Asma to Aristotle to Cuvier/Geoffroy, it is a very good work indeed."},{"Title":"Following Form and Function: A Philosophical Archeology of Life Science (Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy)","review":"I was quite surprised to come across this work, and found that it changed my view of biology on the spot. Since the mere mention of teleology in biological company tends to produce 'bizarre behavior' this work is a positive indication that times are changing and the many philosophical issues need to be reconsidered in light of the resurfacing of developmental questions of evolution. The current monistic emphasis on adaptation and function is heuristically critiqued and the results, while still perhaps murky, powerfully address a huge void in current thinking. The author adopts what he calls a modified Kantianism, which is all well and good, but in so far as he lands in the realm of 'dialectical biology' (very briefly at the end), one wonders if the formulation is not in need of further 'debugging'. Kant's powerful formulation of a stance toward teleology,whose considerations are generally fruitless speculations Darwinists rightly find suspect, with its embrace and reserve both is at once a green light and a warning. But that is the price of doing business in such a radically different form of biological thinking. Splendid effort, whatever the results."},{"Title":"Following Form and Function: A Philosophical Archeology of Life Science (Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy)","review":"What's up Dr. Asma.

After I'd finished all of Peters' Brother Cadfael mysteries, I finally gave in, despite having groused to myself for years that she'd spent time on these when she could have been spreading mayhem through medieval Shropshire for our fun and her profit.It's a shame I took so long to give Felse a fair chance. Peters was already an excellent writer when this story was written; the Felse stories are good novels, not just clever puzzles. They carry the bonus that they aren't bound to a formula as tightly as are the chronicles of Brother Cadfael.Felse's turf is on the Welsh border, but in the last half of the twentieth century, and in \\"Midshire\\" (technically not Shropshire). As in the Cadfael stories, time doesn't stand still for the characters. This, as one of George's later appearances, doesn't feature his son Dominic in an active role in the investigation - Dominic is on holiday abroad, having just graduated from university. This particular story is set in Mottisham, one of the villages near Felse's home base of Comerbourne; the area is also the scene of RAINBOW'S END, for anyone who'd like to see how the supporting characters fared in later years.The Macsen-Martels, as their double-barreled name suggests, are an old family, but their fires are burning out. The valley, as local Sgt. Moon says, is tribal, not feudal - 'squire' is a dirty word around here. The best they ever did was in acquiring Mottisham Abbey out of Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries. \\"Count for nothing now. Never will again. Never *did*, for all that much.\\"Robert senior was a notorious womanizer who sank the family deep in debt before finally breaking his neck in the hunting field. His widow, a cousin whom he married for her money, would never hear a word against him. Robert junior, the elder son, takes after his mother in looks and values, but what in her is aristocratic arrogance has in him been eroded like a medieval carving. He grew up helping her cope with his father's endless debts and paternity suits, and it seems to have taken its toll on more than the family fortunes - he's worn to the bone. Far from being a lord of the manor, he works in a realtor's office. His younger brother Hugh, on the other hand, has his father's energy, but he turns it to a more profitable end as the junior partner of Cressett and Martel, local garage. (The senior partner, Dave Cressett, is only a year younger than Robert, and where Hugh provides flash and dazzle, Dave provides sturdy dependability. Dinah, Dave's younger sister, chips in - a pocket edition, but made of the right stuff; Hugh's got sense enough to be moving toward marriage with her.)The family can't maintain the Abbey anymore, and they've finally convinced the National Trust to step in. The building must be restored to original condition as much as possible, so they've started by reinstalling the old wine cellar door in the church porch - there's a family story that it belongs there. George Felse, just returning from a holiday after promotion to deputy head of the county CID, passes the time of day with Sgt. Moon while stuck in traffic, caused by the bishop's stately progress of reconsecrating the door. It's a *DOOR* - 7 x 5 mediaeval oak, flanked by carved angels that were outdated when it was carved and have come all the way around to being modern, and weighing a quarter of a ton. It and its knocker come complete with a Macsen-Martel family legend, which we hear when the younger son, Hugh, takes his Dinah to officially meet his family.Only a local sensation, not even a nine-days'-wonder; Bunty's comfortable statement that there's nothing to fetch them back for a second look, though, goes into the category of Famous Last Words. At first, it only begins with the regulars of the Sitting Duck taking the mickey out of the small gang of pressmen who turned out for the ceremony. (The pub conserves its home-brewed beer for the regulars, and anyhow such strangers are nature's way of providing entertainment.) Nobody expected Gerry Bracewell, the quickest-witted of the pack, to return a few weeks later in pursuit of a potential story - and still less for Dave Cressett to find him dead in the church porch, head beaten in before the door.Felse opts to hang onto the case rather than passing it to the Yard; something was significant about the door itself, not the man. All that was unusual about him was that he'd seen the door once before, years ago, when photographing the house for a series of articles on obscure country houses. But what could be so deadly about a door that was already on public display?The only touches of amateur hour in Felse's thoroughly professional investigation are Dave Cressett's inquiries when he returns Bracewell's car to the widow, and a few scenes from Dinah's point of view. They're adequately explained by the closed-shop attitude of Mottisham's people - when there's trouble, they pull together, but right must be done. Although those psychic researchers are fair game when they show up at the pub..."},{"Title":"The Knocker on Death's Door","review":"Best known for her \\"Brother Cadfael\\" series, Ellis Peters (1913-1985) was also the author of thirteen novels featuring Inspector George Felse. Published in 1970, THE KNOCKER ON DEATH'S DOOR is the tenth novel in that series--and among the best.Peters often worked with contrived-but-witty plots, and this work shows her at her best. The Macsen-Martels have a notable family tree and historic home, but their time has passed. In the face of dwindling fortunes, they have decided to pass their home into the hands of the National Trust--but before they do so they restore to the local cathedral a historic door that fell into their possession. But along with the door goes a legend, the tale of a man who was carried off by the devil when the door refused to admit him into the church.Needless to say, no sooner is the door returned to its rightful place at the church than there is a body to go with it: a news photographer is found dead at the threshold, his hand extended to the great cast iron knocker. But his soul wasn't spirited away by the devil, at least not judging from the gaping wound on the back of his head. It is murder, and Inspector Felse is on the scene.Unlike most Felse novels, this particular entry does not feature his son Dominic; it instead offers an array of locals, some of whom are determined to play detective. Although hardcore mystery fans will likely spot the killer early on simply due to the way Peters sets up the plot, the characters are well drawn and the story is an amiable companion for the hour or two it requires. Recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Knocker on Death's Door","review":"This is another solid entry in the George Felse series. We see a great deal of George this time, and that is a good thing. George is a wonderful character - straight, no-nonsense, and smart as a whip. The wonderful thing about Ellis Peters books is her wonderful plots and characterizations. She will take something simple like an old, medieval door and build a tale around it. This whole story revolves around this old door, and the old door has a lot of secrets to tell. George is willing to listen to the door and its hidden secrets and is therefore able to solve the case. We have a nice mix here of an old cold case and two new cases (a murder and an attempted murder). Ms. Peters weaves them all together seamlessly."},{"Title":"The Knocker on Death's Door","review":"Mild-mannered DCI George Felse, who prefers to solve English country crime without the aid of the Yard, finds himself near the Welsh/English border--first on vacation, then on business. He is abruptly shaken out of his appreciation of Midshire'snatural beauty when confronted by a manorial/monastic mystery--complete with curse. Could monks gone amuck at the time of theDissolution actually influence lives (i.e., cause death) in this century? What is the fatal attraction of a curiously-wrought knocker on an oaken door, which was hung first in a church, then in a private wine cellar, but has since been donated back to an ecclesiastical setting?Ellis Peters, known to aficionados as the creator of the Brother Cadfael series, weaves a delightful web of suspicious characters, cryptic legend and mundane motives into a contemporary thriller, with medieval over--or rather, undertones. Her fans will recognize her penchant for incidental romance: in this case an unexpected but platonic love affair at the end. Socially-conscious in her own time, she raises poignant commentary on the role of impoverished aristocracy, dying out gracefully (?) for lack of cash and new blood...apologies for the ill-chosen expression. Will the Manor be saved by the Trust or is this the end of the line for the Macsen-Martel family? Will the sins of the philandering patriarch be visited upon future generations? Anything by Peters is sure to please; savor this novel as her literary premonition of a medieval Welsh monk dabbling in mystery. My advice: beware of the cowl in the mist and don't knock first!"},{"Title":"The Knocker on Death's Door","review":"Being a fan of Ellis Peters's brother Cadfael series, I decided to try her earlier mystery series, featuring detective inspector George Felse. The Knocker on Death's Door is a good, light read, with interesting historical details, although the solution to the mystery will be obvious to most experienced mystery-novel readers. The plot centers around the restoration of a medieval door to its original place in the village church, and the secrets the door holds, which reveal a long-hidden murder. There's a sweet, innocent romantic sub-plot woven through the detective story, and George Felse is a delightful investigator. Overall, a good read for fans of the traditional English-cosy mystery."},{"Title":"The Knocker on Death's Door","review":"Like many other readers, I've come to my first Inspector George Felse mystery by way of Brother Cadfael. I found it a delightful surprise. Although published over 40 years ago and set in then contemporary England, it didn't seemed dated at all.Inspector Felse and his wife are returning home from a holiday weekend when they find themselves caught in a traffic jam in a little village where no traffic jam ought to happen. It's caused by a bishop's progress, as a church door is reconsecrated - \\"re\\" because that door has been removed from a private home's wine cellar as part of preparing the home to become an historic site. This involves restoring the home as closely as possible to what it was in the time of King Henry VIII, when it stopped being a monastery.The door and its curious knocker attract attention from the press, partly because of a local legend about an apostate monk who died after the door refused to admit him. A few weeks after the reconsecration, a journalist who saw the door when it was still part of the Macsen-Martel home arrives in the village to see if he can find a story. He winds up dead on the church steps, his head bashed in.So Inspector Felse returns to a place he thought he had passed through once, incidentally, and would never see again. As he investigates, another man winds up on the church steps - this one still alive, but with head injuries. Understanding the locals, from the aristocratic but now impoverished Macsen-Martels to the owners of the local garage, proves just as important to solving the case as Felse's investigative skills. The characters make this an absorbing read, although the mystery is fun, too. If I come across more Inspector Felse books, I'll be happy to read them.--Reviewed by Nina M.

It's very funny and just the kind of book a young boy would make any adult read to him over and over. And girls will like it too.If you had put your hand over my eyes and read the first paragraph of the first story to me, with main characters Alpha, Oliver and Omega, I would have known who wrote it right away. It has Mahy's rhythm, her humor that comes from the sound of the words, the alliteration she loves. This is a book made to be read aloud. It sounds funny, and it means funny too. The plot of these two stories twist in ways that, even having read a lot of Mahy, I never could have predicted. Everytime I encounter one of her stories, I wonder how that kind of twist came to her. I wish I could do it myself.The first story is about three boys who have recently moved into a house. In the apartment, whenever the boys tried to do something adventuresome, they were told to wait until they were in a big house. Then they'd have space enough to have an adventure. Well, they were in the new house, and nothing was happening... until a pirate decides their house is the perfect place to \\"steal\\" a party.In the second story, a bunch of atypical robbers kidnap an orphaned librarian reasoning that her \\"parents\\" would be the city, and they would have to come up with ransom in order to open the library again. But of course, the librarian always wins. Mahy was herself a librarian for many years.Perfect read-aloud book. Lots of fun. And the illustrations are an extra (goofy) plus. They are done by Quentin Blake, the illustrator who worked on Roald Dahl's books, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, BFG, The Witches etc. You'll recognize his style when you see it."},{"Title":"The Great Piratical Rumbustification & the Librarian and the Robbers","review":"This book was read to me by a teacher as a way to learn to write a story outline, and with this book I found it extremely easy.

Sensitive writing and deft plot handling continue the good work started in 'Kydd' and Artemis'.But, where 'Artemis' seemed to be a vehicle for establishing Kydd's commitment to the sea and his improvement in both nautical and social niceties, 'Seaflower' is packed with action on both land and sea.In almost every sort of boat under every sort of captain, Kydd and Renzi suffer the highs and lows of life in the Caribbean - hurricanes, disease, self-loathing and shipwreck, as well as friendship, family, promotion and self-esteem.Mr. Stockwin gets better with each book, his sea-knowledge comes across loud and clear. Combined with his personal research into the locations produces a highly-believable account of little-known events in the most volatile period in British naval history. There follows a taster of the next book 'Mutiny', and, as we have come to expect in this genre, a historical note outlining the facts behind the fiction.As good as it gets. *****"},{"Title":"Seaflower: A Kydd Novel (Kydd Novels)","review":"Yes, the book does seem to be a series of episodes, but I did not find that as objectionable as did some readers. And, while I am sure that there are inaccuracies with regard to geography and leagues sailed and so on, these are not especially noteworthy or destructive of the plot. If there is one objection that might be reasonably raised, it is that of happenstance: whenever the going gets rough, an island appears--or, a long-lost relative just happens to show up in...Jamaica!Stockwin's narratives stress action--the realistic tedium of the voyages (which was handled neatly and realistically in Hornblower and Aubrey/Maturin) seems distatsteful to the author. Nonetheless, I find the series largely appealling and sufficiently different from (say) the Drinkwater group to be worth reading."},{"Title":"Seaflower: A Kydd Novel (Kydd Novels)","review":"Book three in the Kydd series (see my reviews of _Kydd: a Novel_ and _Artemis: a Kydd Novel_) is very good. Kydd is slowly climbing the ladder, but sometimes falls a few rungs first. Lots of good action in this book. Good fighting, good adventure. This series has really grown on me. A few minor criticisms: sometimes I feel that there is not a good resolution to the episodes. All of a sudden, the action ends and problem solved. The transitions are too abrupt. I'd like to see more on how Kydd and crew get out of their predicaments. Also, I would strongly urge Mr. Stockwin to issue a dictionary (not of sea terms-we already have _Sea of Words_ ; see my review of that) but of the dialogue. There are just too many words and phrases that the average reader (especially Americans) will not understand. Also, the dialogue is written in pronunciation spelling, and that takes some getting used to, especially for American readers who will not immediately recognize such spellings as \`er' or \`orf' = \`uh' and \`off.' A dictionary is a must. However, the odd spellings add realism to the speech of the characters and I have come to appreciate it. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Seaflower: A Kydd Novel (Kydd Novels)","review":"***Minor Spoilers***I have read the first two novels in the series. I found them reasonably good entertainment at the time, that is about a year ago. When I came to write this review I browsed over the other user reviews of the first books. I honestly could not remember some of the minor characters and incidents referred to, so I feel Stockwin fails the test of \\"memorable writing\\". I am one of the readers who feels that the character Kydd lacks depth and development, however that is my personal taste to desire such a thing, and it is perhaps part of the Age of Fighting Sail genre, that characters are rather one-dimensional. There are certain conventions to be followed, not neccessarily rigidly, in most genre fiction.I am most disappointed when I read reviewers who give Julian Stockwin's books a lot of praise for authenticity, and then I find parts of the story that I do have some knowledge of, and they don't seem authentic. The worst instance I have seen of this was in \\"Seaflower\\". The navigational aspects of the book seemed quite sloppy.The movements of \\"Seaflower\\" seemed too fast to me. I was reading the paperback edition.On page 309 Seaflower is to \\"strike south then East\\" and it will take \\"3 or 4 days to Barbados\\". If she went 300 miles south, then 1000 miles east, which is what I scaled off my National Geographic Map of the Caribbean, that would 1300 nautical miles. SF would have to sail at more than 12 knots to do it in 4 days. The theoretical maximum hull speed of a 70ft vessel is 11 knots. A modern yacht might manage that but an 18th century vessel loaded with men, stores, and heavy guns would not have a hope. 3 days is out of the question.On page 308-310, she weighs anchor in the late afternoon, departs Kingston, and turns east before noon next day!! That is either sailing at 25 knots, or not going deep in the Caribbean to avoid the enemy, as was the stated intention. As a mere detail, the often-mentioned noon sight would establish that they were on the best latitude for the easterly course.On page 311, dirty weather is seen ahead, that is to the east. In a tropical revolving storm,that would put the wind from the north, on the port beam. The captain orders \\"ease sheets, bear off to leeward, set course NNW\\". This means the fore-and-aft rigged sloop would have to gybe (risky in a heavy breeze), and sail very close-hauled to go NNW. Not impossible but difficult and pointless, as the storm will probably go that way too. And indeed, (p313) \\"they struck south then southwest into the reef-strewn west Caribbean\\". Did the Captain decide this? We are not told. It was not a good strategy I feel, with the storm centre to the north, they should go east, where there is most sea-room, the wind is on their port beam or astern, and it's where they want to go anyway.They lose track of their position (very likely in the storm) and run up on an island(p316). \\"The tidal surge deposited Seaflower gently among storm-tossed coconut palms\\" - this is so poetic I will not begin to examine if it is possible or not, but will return to navigational incongruities.Kydd is given the task of sailing the longboat with a VIP passenger to complete the mission. He knows his latitude. We are not told. He sails to the Spanish Main, the northern coast of South America, we are vaguely told it is somewhere near Barranquilla, and Cuerda Grande. This took one and a half days. The exact position is given to Kydd by a local inhabitant. Barranquilla certainly exists, \\"near half-way along the Carribean Coast\\" but I have not been able to find Cuerda Grande. The party confer. Port Royal is supposed to be 500 miles away, 3 or 4 days sail with the NE tradewinds on the beam. The small size of the boat makes the projected 130 to 170 miles per day progress wildly unlikely. I have found accounts of the open-boat voyages of Bligh and of Flinders in the same era and they managed 70 and 80 miles per day respectively. Kydd and the VIP decide to make for Barbados, expecting to take 6 days. To fit the situation so far described, this will be 700+ miles, at 120 per day.Kydd intends to run along the 14degree latitude. Good idea, that is how a lot of navigation was done before chronometers became available. Much is made of the importance of longitude. They should have been able to manage quite well without it. Kydd changes course when he reaches 65degrees west, whence he will sail \\"a couple of hundred miles, say no more than a day of sailing\\" to the Windward Isles (p334). He's even quicker than I thought! The change of course is unneccessary, he could continue until he sees the islands (more about this below) and they should recognise where they are because they have been in this area before. When I read on p338 \\" The passage between the two islands was more than 25 miles; at their height-of-eye they would probably not even see them.\\", I had the jolt of disbelief that set me off on checking all these points. I remembered reading an account (Adrift, Steve Callaghan, 1981) in which Callaghan could recognise three large islands in the Leeward Isles from his tiny liferaft. Could not Kydd do the same?According to my maps the passage between St Vincent and St Lucia is just 19 miles wide. The highest peaks of the islands are 30 miles apart. If the boat is exactly in the middle of the gap, the peaks will be 15 miles away. Inspection of Norie's Nautical Tables tells me that anything above 35 metres will be visible at 15 miles from a height-of-eye of 5 feet. The peaks are 950 metres and 1234 metres high!To extend this idea, Barbados is 340 metres high, and comes into view at 39 miles. anything above 650 metres on St Vincent is still visible at 54 miles. So at that point, Kydd will be able to see both islands at the same time. Also, Barbados is 15 miles wide at a distance of 80 miles from St Vincent. Quite a large target navigationally speaking.Stockwin appears to totally ignore the real geography of the area when he throws in a last-minute crisis, with the boat hitting an uncharted reef somewhere in the middle of the st Lucia/St Vincent Passage. The National Geographic Map shows the depth in the passage as over 200 metres. As another has commented, this problem is solved with ease. The Windward Isles squadron just happens to sail over the horizon at the right time to save Kydd & company. Stockwin tells us on his site that he loves to visit these locales to give his works authenticity.

I'll buy no more books from Amazon."},{"Title":"Seaflower: A Kydd Novel (Kydd Novels)","review":"This is an interesting novel, the main character being Thomas Kydd, a seaman in the Royal Navy during the 1790s. The novel is a little weak when it comes to describing action against the enemy (some actions seem a little superficial) but gives good accounts of fighting bad weather and generally surviving aboard a ship of war. John Nicol's autobiography, &quot;John Nicol Mariner,&quot; is a good account of a seaman during that time period.In actual fact, during that time there were more losses from disease, storms, shipwrecks, and accidents in general, than there were from enemy action. The description of Kydd's survival after coming down with yellow fever would be typical for the location and time period. Frederick Hoffman in his autobiography, &quot;A Sailor of King George,&quot; related his experience aboard a ship where he was one out of 16 midshipmen, and one out of two who survived a yellow fever epidemic. The survivors lived to tell their tales, so stories are naturally about survivors. There was reputedly an old toast in the Royal Navy for &quot;a long war or a fever season,&quot; i.e., others misfortunes opened opportunities for promotion.While it may seem a little unreal for a ship or officer to have one success after another, such officers did exist at that time and many, including Nelson, achieved rapid promotion by their successes.There were young men from well-to-do families who ran off to sea for various reasons (just as some later joined the French Foreign Legion). Some survived and achieved success. The character of Nicholas Renzi is believable."},{"Title":"Seaflower: A Kydd Novel (Kydd Novels)","review":"Stockwin does an excellent job with the physical details of 19th century sailing and writes tolerably on the sentence level.Two large elements of the novel don't work so well, though. The first is the plot, so-called. Kydd and his friends go through one apparent challenge after another, but all are easily resolved. Just as the drama starts to build, the characters solve the problem or the danger goes away, resulting in repeated anticlimaxes. The plot does not seem to have an overall arc or a structure of building tension... essentially, there's no point.The second problem is with characterization. Though the characters are appealing enough in themselves, they're never challenged and none of their experiences seem to change them. They don't develop through the book.I can't really recommend this."},{"Title":"Seaflower: A Kydd Novel (Kydd Novels)","review":"The 3rd installment in the Kydd series following on from \`Kydd' and \`Artemis'. This was the book that I really expected to see a little more character development in Kydd. Unfortunately, the book fails in many ways, not just with the lack of Kydd's character. The worst area is in regards to the plot. Time and again we find the author building up a dangerous situation, i.e a sail in the distance.. only to turn the page and find that the crew has defeated the enemy and all is well. It seems to read like a collection of 20 short stories all with quick endings. The only exception to this trait is the final story.The worst book of the series so far, but still ok to read and a must if you want to continue reading the series."},{"Title":"Seaflower: A Kydd Novel (Kydd Novels)","review":"Enjoyed by my husband and he couldn't wait for the arrival of the next one!"},{"Title":"Seaflower: A Kydd Novel (Kydd Novels)","review":"Julian Stockwin tells it like it was for Jack Tars in the Royal Navy during the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars. Stockwin's Kydd series relates the climb of Thomas Paine Kydd, a young Englishman, who is pressed into the Sea Service and embraces the challenge of life between England's 'wooden walls' as he makes his way through the ranks.Stockwin's Kydd saga, including Seaflower, is based on historic events, allowing Kydd and his friend Nicholas Renzi to be placed in situations which reveal the real-life world of below-decks sailors in Nelson's Navy. Seaflower takes the pair from Portsmouth Harbour and the trumpted-up court martial of an officer with influence to the Caribbean, where Kydd faces personal challenges which continue to mature and shape him. Aboard the cunning topsail cutter Seaflower, they sail against the French and the overwhelming forces of the tropical seas.Stockwin is at his best in describing the eighteenth-century in which Kydd lives, including the ships, exotic areas of the world, and the sea. Seaflower brings Kydd's characterization to a new high. I cannot wait to read the next title in the series, Mutiny.This is best new naval fiction during the Age of Sail to be published in recent years!"},{"Title":"Seaflower: A Kydd Novel (Kydd Novels)","review":"Julian is a great author and this series is for anyone interested in the age of sail. Julian and his wife have developed believeable experiences for their young man Thomas Payne Kydd"},{"Title":"Seaflower: A Kydd Novel (Kydd Novels)","review":"The sailing jargon and phraseology are true to the period - excellent plot, pace and story! Anyone that enjoyed Horation Hornblower will delight in this series as well."},{"Title":"Seaflower: A Kydd Novel (Kydd Novels)","review":"This is the third novel about the maritime adventures of Thomas Paine Kydd, only a couple of years before a young wigmaker in Guildford, pressed into the Royal Navy, and now, in 1794, not only a prime, intuitive seaman but a quartermaster's mate -- and at the end of this volume he's on the brink of receiving his step in the form of an Admiralty warrant as master's mate. The story begins exactly where the previous one left off, with Tom appearing as witness in the matter of his captain's loss of their previous ship. But then he and his surviving friends are bundled hastily off to the Caribbean; someone with influence obviously is being protected. Having lost his petty officer's rating with his ship, he soon regains it on the elderly TRAJAN, and proves his worth enough on arrival in the islands to be well set for further advancement. But then the French invade the island and Kydd is separated from Renzi, his particular friend, who must depart with a small vessel loaded with refugees. The story divides interestingly, with Tom putting in a stint managing the workforce of slaves in a small naval dockyard (another opportunity to increase his general maritime knowledge) and Renzi's education and knowledge of French coming in handy on the admiral's staff in Jamaica. They are rejoined, of course, and spend some time on the tiny cutter SEAFLOWER, which has a bit of luck in the matter of prizes. And there are several more episodes which keep things moving right along, not only naval but also in diplomacy and in family matters. The author is extremely knowledgeable about his subject and his characters, while heroic at times, are also entirely human in temper. The style has matured over the three volumes so far, with less of a tendency to elide the narrative, but Stockwin still has a tendency to cut to the chase -- not necessarily a bad thing, given his subject. And Stockwin isn't O'Brien. But still, I don't believe I would recommend this series for the novice reader of Napoleonic naval adventure, because a certain amount of settled understanding of ship-handling and technical jargon on the reader's part is necessary for full enjoyment."},{"Title":"Seaflower: A Kydd Novel (Kydd Novels)","review":"In this third book in the series about Thomas Kydd, the pressed man who finds himself at home as a seaman, the pacing is less frantic than the last book but still full of adventure and suspenseful events, as well as depictions of the seafaring life that helps convey its wonder even to the most lubberly reader. Kydd was last seen shipwrecked along with his friend Renzi. The book opens with the court-martial looking into the responsibility of the one surviving officer. From there, Kydd and the surviving crew from the Artemis are off to the Caribbean, to face hurricanes, fever, stints upon land and actions upon the sea.Kydd is slowly working his way up, from position to position--from able seaman to petty officer, so readers of this series get to experience the working of the ships and the seamen from the various ranks. At times Kydd seems to be just a bit too much of a prodigy, but he really has to be a stand-out if he's to dream of being promoted as quickly and hopefully as highly as he hopes. Renzi is a very curious counterpoint to the earnest and forthright Kydd, erudite and cryptic--and a bit of a deux ex machine at times, he remains an intriguing character.I enjoyed this book more than the last one (although my favorite is still the first) and will definitely look forward to reading more in this series."},{"Title":"Seaflower: A Kydd Novel (Kydd Novels)","review":"\\"Seaflower\\" comes after \\"Kydd\\" ,and \\"Artemis\\" in Mr Stockwin's series about Thomas Kydd ,a seaman in the Royal Navy during the French Revolutionary Wars of the 1790's .It follows on from the second volume \\"Artemis \\" and opens with Kydd and others from that unfortunate vessel waiting to give testimony at a court martial into the loss of the ship.His testimony is damning to the officer responsible but that worthy still has influence ,so Kydd and others from the Artemis are sent on board the \\"Trojan \\"to the Caribbean there to wage a campaign to capture French occupied West Indian islands .The first port of call is Guadaloupe ,where the French settlers are largely sympatheic to the British ,being anti Jacaobin .However agents of the revolution successfully stir the slaves to insurrection and \\"Trojan \\"is forced to abort its mission and put out to sea where after a fierce strom they eventually dock in the British island of Antigua.Kydd is assigned to supervising local labour in the dockyard repair crew and is taken in by the master carpenter ,the devoutly religious Zachary Caird ,whose puritanism proves a stumbling block for his full acceptance of Kydd .Meanwhile Kydd's friend Renzi has wound up on Jamiaca where his brother is a substantial landowner,and where he is eventually re-united with Kydd and they join up with the cutter Seaflower which,under the inspired captaincy of the redoubtable Farrell .proves itself in battle ,before retuning to Jamaica.The final passage of the book details a long and arduous open boat voyage -vividly described -in which Kydd plays a vital role.Returning characters from earlier novels include Kydd's sister ,who is now the comapanion of a tiled lady in Jamaica .The book moves briskly and the actaion scenes are well described and vivid .This moves the life of Kydd along to its next stage with commendable vigour and only the increasingly tiresome musings of Renzi slow things down .Those who liked theb earlier volumes will like this ,and those unfamiliar with the earlier books are advised to give this a miss until they catch up."},{"Title":"First Easter Morning: The Gospel Accounts of the Women's Visit to the Tomb of Jesus","review":"Although it is an area that scholars usually shy away from, Edward Lynn Bode puts the stories of the visit of the women to the empty tomb of Jesus under investigation. Based on my own study, I disagree with the conclusion that Bode reaches in the last part of book, namely, that the empty tomb narratives are basically historical. However, Bode undertakes his own examination fairly and, thus, is to be commended. I found much of value in this book besides, particularly in the redaction criticism of all four empty tomb narratives. The best trait that Bode exhibits is an encyclopedic knowledge of various scholarly positions, which allows him to refer to the various differering opinions before presenting his own conclusion. This is fine scholarship."},{"Title":"An Ascension Handbook: Material Channeled from Serapis","review":"As a physicist and lightworker I found this book to be a minefield of breakthroughs. We have all heard that we create our own reality.Many of us know how to create what we want through positive thinking and visualization. But few of us know why and how this process really works. This is the first book where the physical reasons for which that is so are explained. I have had for a while the feeling that one day our physics will encompass the laws of manifestation aside the laws of motion. In this book Serapis, channelled through Tony Stubbs, gives clear explanations of the physics of thought and creation, that make 100% sense. You will never see reality in quite the same way again. I thoroughly recommend it."},{"Title":"An Ascension Handbook: Material Channeled from Serapis","review":"This is a relatively small book about ascension, but thankfully it covers a lot of ground and is free of fluff. It beautifully describes the mechanics of ascension in easy to understand terms. The first part explains the process in terms of energy (metaphysics / quantum physics) and the second part provides exercises for practice. It is one of the best simple books on ascension."},{"Title":"An Ascension Handbook: Material Channeled from Serapis","review":"The first half of the book explains reality, quite interesting too. It will help free the mind. The second half is filled with how-to's. The thing about ascension is that it's a process. That is what I didn't realize at first and didn't think the book was complete. Now I know that I just need to use the helpful stuff in the back throughout my every-day life and it will work. Oh, and the decree to the violet flame is &quot;I am a being of violet fire, I am the purity God desires!&quot;, add it to the Violet Flame visualization in the back. God has its own definition for the New Age, but everyone must define their own belief, so if you don't believe in god, then refer to it as &quot;the source&quot; or &quot;eternal consciousness&quot; that we're all linked to. I don't believe in god either. This book is very simple and good for any beginner. If you're new to the metaphysical, this is an easy crash-course in learning terms and concepts, explained in the first half. I am using this book as a guide for my new path. Oh, and if you're completely new, I defind Buddhist enlightenment as complete peace while on Earth, in a body. I define Ascension as making your body vibrate so it lives on the dimensions of spirit. However, you are not dead. You have eternal life and can create a body, or more, in any shape, back on Earth at any time, past, present, and future."},{"Title":"An Ascension Handbook: Material Channeled from Serapis","review":"Check out my review of \\"What is Lightbody\\"- because this book is almost a mirror image of that book- just lacking the descriptions of the different levels.Again, between these two books, the premise is that the entire planet is moving to light... which conflicts with most current Lightworker beliefs. Both also say to consider their books \\"just another opinion\\"... I would think channeled information from an angel would be more 'concrete' in what it says.I also disagreed with what this author said about \\"love\\"- how cheating on your partner isn't a bad thing- and that instead of being upset, you should simply ask \\"was it good?\\" This way of thinking is NOT a healthy expression of love or behavior. If you are in a committed relationship- then you should honor that committment- or else don't even get into something committed.But that's the problem I had with this book and the \\"Lightbody\\" book. Both say that 'everyone is going to ascend' so therefore, who cares about other people, just enjoy your life and work on yourself. I tend to believe that, according to prophecy, those who are spiritual and ascend will go the way of the new earth, and those who fail to acknowledge the signs and stick to their old ways, will stay in the 'old earth' dimension.Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense why some people are going through the ascension process, like I am in a very intense way... and others are not, and are unaware of what is happening.I have read much better information by doing online searches, then anything provided between these two books.Just be advised that this book offers much different views of ascension, than most other Lightworkers."},{"Title":"An Ascension Handbook: Material Channeled from Serapis","review":"This book indeed gives some interesting information, and it offers us different angle to look at the current reality. For those unfamiliar with perception of this world as the complex structure of various energies it may actually lead to better understanding of its true framework. Even though in some details it may be not the same as other channelled information about Ascension process or Lightbody.But the problem with this book is different.Imho, it's all a bit too superficial, and it feels more like just an introduction to the Ascension, not a practical handbook at all. It gives too many mundane examples slowly explaining rather simple matters, as though the author tries to persuade readers that it's exactly the way it all happens.But the very nature of this book suggests that people (who proceed with reading such book) are supposed to be already familiar with the basics. A handbook proper is expected to have more solid and comprehensive material, it should be more of a _practical_ guide. It doesn't seem this way.And yet, at the same time, brevity and scarcity with which it touches some excercises apparently assumes that readers are quite advanced in meditation. Few tools (to be applied via visualization) are described in this book too briefly, in my opinion.In short: too many pages were used to explain what energy & its frequencies or esoteric nature of some human relations are, but very few pages are devoted to real exercises/practices or to in-depth information..."},{"Title":"An Ascension Handbook: Material Channeled from Serapis","review":"Ignore the over-the-top cover on this book.

By and large it succeeds.It is only recently (a few decades ago: in mathematics that is an eyeblink) that the finite simple groups were finally classified. To those of a certain cast of interest this is mindblowingly exciting - but the mathematics behind it is challenging.This book does a fair job of working up to speed on the various concepts, and provides the reader with plentiful illustrative examples throughout the text as he goes. Classification is one of the main objects of the exercise (as is so much of group theory), and the reader is regularly pointed in that direction.One problem I had with this (which is why only 4 stars) is that at times it does go a little fast. To a certain extent it has to - it's a short book and a colossal subject. If this *is* a problem, then there is no reason why you can't read around the subject from other sources. And there are plenty out there."},{"Title":"Truth and Method","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. It is Gadamer's masterpiece - published when he was sixty years old, and the result of a life time of scholarship. T&M; is a critique of romantic hermeneutics -a doctrine that holds that the meaning of a text is identical with the intention of its author. On this account, the purpose of interpretation is to reconstruct the author's intention, the experience they had while writing it that is held in the text. To this Gadamer contrasts his own theory of historically effected consciousness. Gadamer claims that 'understanding a text' involves understanding the tradition of which it (and you) are a part. In the course of doing so, Heidegger ranges over the history of aesthetic theory, phenomenology, and hermenutics, biblical interpretation, as well as examining the nature of all human understanding.Gadamer is a student of Heidegger. In this book he is interested in demonstrating the way a Heideggerian account of consciousness (and being in the world) can help us make sense of the act of interpretation. He is also interested in demonstrating that one can use Heidegger without being a Nazi or obsessed with anxiety and being-towards-death.This book is highly technical, the prose if difficult, and demanding (it helps to have read Being and Time, Kant's Critique of Judgement, some Augustine and Aquinas, etc etc etc.). For people who can get into the work, however, it promises a comprehensive theory of human being, the history of philosophy (and indeed, western thought as a whole) and a holistic worldview of unmatched death and detail. And that's no small potatoes.For those interested in in reading Gadamer but not ready to tackle T&M;, I recommend some of the shorter volumes of his speeches and writings. One of these, _Philosophical Hermeneutics_, is (relatively) accessible and generally considered by Gadamerphiles to be 'Truth and Method Lite'."},{"Title":"Truth and Method","review":"First, Truth and Method is a true classic. Basically, it sees Gadamer revitalise 'nonscientific' truth, i.e. the experience of truth inaccessible to method and irreducible to bare statement. The book itself does have a structure/setting that makes it difficult to get into initially (it is usefully read in tandem with a good commentary eg. Joel Weinsheimer's 'Gadamer's Hermeneutics'), but it is simply worth the effort.Second, the review below is mistaken when it attributes to Gadamer the idea that the Old Testament should be read literally. Gadamer refers to Luther's position that \\"the Scripture has a univocal sense that can be derived from the text\\", but he does this as part of an historical overview of hermeneutics and, on the very next page, Luther gets refuted by 18thC historicism. Gadamer moves beyond both these positions to reveal how 'literalism' (and - more pressingly - 'historicism') is a projection of unproductive prejudices. It is an \\"obstruction\\", that gets in the way of the truth Gadamer seeks. Also, while T&M; is relevant to theology, it should be made clear that Gadamer is writing of a philosophical-universal hermeneutics and not something regional."},{"Title":"Truth and Method","review":"Hans-Georg Gadamer's Truth and Method is a result of sixty years of reflection on the nature of the hermeneutic experience and an exemplary document of lucid and fascinating scholarship. The purpose of the treatise on understanding is \`what takes place above our thinking and doing', in other words, the constitutive events in art, literature and ethics.As Gadamer's examination of the romantic human sciences, or Geisteswissenschaften, is constantly referred back onto the tradition and the sources from which it emerges and supports itself, some background knowledge is required, particularly of classical philosophy, Hegel and Heidegger.The project of Truth and Method opens by engaging the reader to a critique of Kantian aesthetic exposition, and uses it as a starting-point for an examination of hermeneutics, the art of understanding. In the course of the examination Gadamer does not, however, engage in a dialogue only with the philosophical tradition, but by continuously exploring the universality of the hermeneutic experience demonstrates its relevance and presence in history, study of languages, legal theory and theology.For a reader coming from the analytic-linguistic tradition, the final section on the hermeneutic character of language should be of particular interest. In it Gadamer outlines his conception of language as the horizon through which the experience of the world is understood. But as throughout the book, the horizon of understanding is not determined solely on the basis of the grammatical or the logical structure present; indeed, the horizon itself is a constant possibility for the historically effected consciousness to gain further self-knowledge through its experience in language as a historically and temporally defined phenomenon.The style of the book is thoroughly lively and engaging; despite the abstract subject-matter the argument is never lost from sight and Gadamer's sense of clarity in terms of expression makes the book a pleasure to read and come back to.I recommend this book whole-heartedly, not as a conclusive and total life-philosophy, but as an exploration and fascination of the possibilities of human potential in its recurring activity of living and perpetuating, its own culture, tradition and being."},{"Title":"Truth and Method","review":"Hans-Georg Gadamer's Truth and Method must be considered alongside the great works of Dilthey, Husserl, and Heidegger as a major treatise on hermeneutics, defined by Gadamer as understanding and the correct interpretation of what has been understood. More commonly, people define hermeneutics as the study/theory of interpretation.Two major contentions that help frame his analysis are: (1) rejection of the view that proper understanding calls for eliminating the influence of the interpreter's context; (2) rejection of the view that the author's intent in writing a text has any special weight to it.As to the first point, he argues that it is simply not possible for the interpreter to escape his present situation. He advances the concept of the \\"horizon.\\" For Gadamer, the horizon is \\". . .the range of vision that includes everything that can be seen from a particular vantage point.\\" It is the grounding of the interpreter, including that person's language, that fixes the possibilities of what that person can see and understand. In Gadamer's words, it is\\". . .the way in which thought is tied to its finite determination, and the nature of the law of the expansion of the range of vision. A person who has no horizon is a man who does not see far enough and hence over values what is nearest to him. Contrariwise, to have an horizon means not to be limited to what is nearest, but to be able to see beyond it. A person who has an horizon knows the relative significance of everything within this horizon, as near or far, great or small.\\"To interpret the words of the past, Gadamer says that:\\"Just as in a conversation, when we have discovered the standpoint and horizon of the other person, his ideas become intelligible, without our necessarily having to agree with him, the person who thinks historically comes to understand the meaning of what has been handed down, without necessarily agreeing with it, or seeing himself in it.\\"In interpreting texts, two horizons are involved--one is the horizon of the interpreter and the other the particular historical horizon into which he or she places him or herself in trying to understand the text. Thus, the two horizons interact to produce understanding.The historical horizon of the text is not fixed; it cannot take on a meaning that is unchanged for all times and places. Here, he gets to the heart of successful hermeneutic inquiry--the fusing of horizons. He says:\\"Hence the horizon of the present cannot be formed with the past. There is no more an isolated horizon of the present than there are historical horizons. Understanding, rather, is always the fusion of these horizons which we imagine to exist by themselves. . .Every encounter with tradition that takes place within historical consciousness involves the experience of the tension between the text and the present.\\"But what of the intention of the original author of a text? That leads to another of Gadamer's major points, by now clearly implicit in his idea of fusion of horizons. In short, it is not particularly important in trying to interpret a text. Once a text is created by its author, it becomes, so to speak, freed from the creator and begins to take on its own meaning, based upon its historical horizon, continually evolving as circumstances change. It is the text's horizon that interacts with the interpreter's horizon.So what? To the extent that \\"reality\\" is the subject of inquiry, our understanding of \\"reality\\" will change as the historical horizon of a particular claim about reality changes. We can, then, never come to a satisfactory conclusion about a transcendental reality, about an absolute truth. Is relativism the end product of the endeavor? The hermeneutist in the Gadamerian tradition would simply note that there is no way out.This is one of the most historically important works available on interpretation. It is difficult and challenging as a work; however, the effort to learn from Gadamer is well worth it."},{"Title":"Truth and Method","review":"I have given the actual book 5 stars because it is a seminal work in the field of hermeneutics; I don't believe that a book should be given a poor rating based on its printing rather than its actual content. However, the printing of this edition of the book is so poor that I wanted to issue a brief warning to those considering purchasing it. Briefly, my beef with this printing is as follows:1. The text is incredibly small and compressed.2. There is almost no margin space for anyone wishing to underline or make comments in their copy--granted this is a seemingly trivial complaint, but considering that this book is technical enough that most of its readers are professionals or students and not casual readers and will likely be wanting to annotate their versions, this is a pretty large oversight on Continuum's part.3. Most importantly/worst of all, the body of the text's placement on each page is incredibly inconsistent; often the words on a page will be typeset so far to the right (we're talking 1mm, at most, between the glue in the binding and the end of each line) that one is almost forced to break the binding of the book to be able to read each line. This problem alone is enough to make this printing unreadable for all but the most tolerant of readers. It should be said that I've seen several copies of this edition and each one suffered from this problem; the printing is simply low-quality.My suggestion, for those who wish to read this incredibly important and insightful work, is to get an older printing. I recommend the second revised Continuum edition (white cover, ISBN 0-8264-0585-1). This edition is infinitely more readable and suffers from none of the problems listed above, and the text itself it isn't fundamentally different than the newer printing."},{"Title":"Truth and Method","review":"I hate to admit it...especially because all the other reviewers have raved about it...but I find Truth and Method to be a real slog. Yes -- there is some good stuff here. But be warned - you will really, really have to work to get through this book!Now at this point you may be thinking \\"well, you are probably lazy or were unprepared.\\" But the thing is - I was neither. I have read Being and Time (which I think is an easier - yes easier - book) and have done much prepatory work for T & M including Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics by Jean Grondin -- which I highly recommend).This book is brilliant. But I think it is very interesting that all the reviewers have such high praise for a text that is so very difficult. Great ideas do not need to be inaccessible. Don't believe me? Look at Plato, Aristotle, Nietzsche....."},{"Title":"Truth and Method","review":"Gadamer's Truth and Method is a long, dense, and richly informative effort to find a solid and rational basis for understanding in the human sciences or Geistenwissenschaften. Gadamer proceeds from the observation that efforts to adapt experimental methods used in the natural sciences, as well as sophisticated statistical models employed with less success but with just as much commitment to rigor in economics and related disciplines are, by their very nature, ill-suited to his objective. Gadamer is, of course, correct, though he puts himself in a position that die-hard proponents of quantitative techniques and the mathematical expression of lawfulness judge to be hopelessly problematic. Nevertheless, Gadamer persists. Whether or not he succeeds is inevitably a judgment call, but I'm inclined to view his efforts as fruitful, providing a persuasive methodological foundation for research in disciplines wherein well-informed interpretation necessarily takes the place of model building and testing.Gadamer's book, first published in 1960, represents a lifetime of scholarship, covering western philosophy from the ancient Greeks to the time of Truth and Method's publication. Gadamer's mastery of material pertinent to his task has rightly been characterized as encyclopedic, but it is also suitably focused, especially through application of the hermeneutic method, broadly speaking. With regard to questions such as what does it mean to be a thinking, feeling human being who actively interprets the circumstances that give life meaning, Gadamer proposes that we seek a thorough understanding of the tradition of which we, as socially created entities, are manifestations.Without trivializing Gadamer's conclusions or misinterpreting their methodological and substantive import, it seems reasonable to conclude that he is referring to a process that is conspicuous in the social sciences, especially as understood by ethnographers, namely socialization in linguistically rich environments. Each of us is born and raised in an historically specific time and place that can reasonably be construed as having an interpretable shared culture, an ensemble of prescriptions, prohibitions, commonplace explanations, ways of making inferences, and modes of understanding to which consociates refer in making sense of what it means to be. Emile Durkheim's concept of the collective conscience and George Herbert Mead's generalized other are products of socialization into a specific socio-cultural milieu and can be construed as closely approximating tradition as Gadamer understands that idea. Thus, in Gadamer's view, \\"history does not belong to us; we belong to it. Long before we understand ourselves through the process of self-examination, we understand ourselves in a self-evident way in the family, society, and state in which we live\\" (Gadamer, 1998: 276).Research with reference to an identifiable tradition, a specific collective consciousness or generalized other is best done interpretatively, through application of qualitative anthropological methods to achieve hermeneutic understanding of the conditions of life as they are experienced and understood by concrete human beings. Given this orientation to making sense of one's place in the world, growing interest in ethnographic techniques and the consequences of their application has produced a good deal of contemporary interest in Gadamer's work and in hermeneutics generally.Gadamer has been challenged by Habermas and others as being insufficiently specific as to the meaning of tradition. In this critical view, complex modern societies are not characterized by one stable and homogeneous tradition shared by all. Instead, divisions such as class, race, ethnicity, language, and religion assure a multiplicity of different and changing traditions for any time and place.While there is merit to this critique, I think it is often overdrawn, ignoring the fact that Gadamer's approach is readily applicable to co-existing but varied socio-cultural configurations for any time and place. Were we to completely discount Gadamer's approach for the reasons given by Habermas, we would also be obliged be reject Max Weber's use of ideal-typical analysis of social systems; an unlikely event, indeed.Truth and Method requires a substantial commitment of time and effort, and Gadamer devotes a lot of attention to failed alternatives to his hermeneutic approach to establishing truth in the human sciences. In short, he does not cut to the chase but gives a history of the varied philosophical routes that others have tried over the course of millenia to find a compelling methodological basis for achieving understanding in the human sciences. Nevertheless, the richness of the material makes reading it and thinking about it worthwhile. However, those of us who lack a strong background in philosophy will gain less than better informed readers."},{"Title":"Truth and Method","review":"If, somehow, you have the urge to read a theory on interpretation (with all of its philosophical ruminations),then, Gadamer's Truth & Method is the one for you. No doubt it is considered as a classic text in hermeneutics. Reading thiswill be better in the combinative books by Heidegger (Being & Time- trans: Macquarrie & Robinson) & Merleau Ponty(The Phenomenology of Perception -trans: Landes)However, I am not here to explain of Bildung. Or the concept of Erlebniskunst & Erfahrung.

Even so, it caused me to think more seriously about how I interact with and think about art, literature, and history than I had ever thought to do before. His suggestion that we really come to understand literature by considering the question the author was attempting to answer is an intriguing concept; one that I think I've been applying for some time without really thinking about it."},{"Title":"Truth and Method","review":"Hans-Georg Gadamer's *Truth and Method* is a very interesting product of the midcentury German scene. Written at the beginning of Habermas's ascent, Gadamer's arguments could not be more different than those of the famous critical theorist: from his famous rehabilitation of \\"prejudice\\" to a sweeping defense of classicism -- right down to music without period instruments -- we see from the professor of the early DDR a curious mixture of *Nazi-Zeit* matter-of-factness (detractors of Gadamer's teacher Heidegger and Gadamer's own time-serving ought to remember the many others who went ahead and published during WWII, such as Sartre with *Being and Nothingness*, Merleau-Ponty's *Structure of Comportment*, and Braudel's *Mediterranean*) and \\"socialist humanism\\". Gadamer's quest is for a vision of interpretation that does away with the \\"philosophy of subjectivism\\" that motivated *Geisteswissenschaften* greats like Schleiermacher and Dilthey: taking many cues from *Being and Time*, Gadamer inflects Heidegger to come up with a very compelling picture of linguistic interpretation that attempts an arch-conservative welding of contemporary concerns to the whole of recorded history. Anyone who has ever felt the need to defend the \\"logic of the social sciences\\" will find Gadamer's divers reflections on philology, aesthetics, and history grist for the mill. Additionally, perhaps this work could stand with Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca's *The New Rhetoric* as an anticipatory rebuke to structuralism. Fascinating."},{"Title":"Truth and Method","review":"This book is good for those who study philosophy and theory, but it is a difficult read.

I will read it again and again."},{"Title":"Truth and Method","review":"Gadamer's _Truth and Method_ is both very profound and very readable; it is a vast improvement over other more widely-read philosophical texts from the same region and time period (such as Heidegger's _Being and Time_ and Husserl's _Crisis of the European Sciences_). Unlike the aforementioned philosophers, Gadamer is actually willing to stick his neck out and reveal to us the true nature of his own personal spiritual beliefs. Believe it or not, Gadamer has the audacity to tell us that we \\"must take the Old Testament literally\\" (!) That's right, folks. Adam and Eve, Noah's Ark, Moses, Abraham-Isaac-Jacob-Joseph-ect. We have to take all of that literally. Now I've been to north-Georgia, backcountry, hillbilly Baptist churches where they didn't believe in that stuff anymore. And that is precisely what makes Gadamer's philosophy so revolutionary. The age of reason has quite literally come full circle. People were completely caught off guard by this shocking new assertion, that we must once again turn to the literal interpretation of the Old Testament in order to explain the dawn of temporal conciousness in man.It seems as though modern phenomenolgy has uncovered far more new questions than it has answers. Hegel was one of the first to attempt an in-depth systemization on how and why the \\"spirit enters into time\\". Heidegger was one of the first with a specific answer, stating that the phenomenon of spirit is attributable to a type of \\"care\\" and \\"being-unto-death\\". Sarte countered that this phenomenology is in fact a result of \\"being-unto-other\\". But if we believe Gadamer's historical theory, we may have a concrete solution to all of these problems. Rather than be stuck with a narrow and one-dimensional theory of the phenomenon of soul (which could easily be diluted with other contingencies and unforeseen contributing factors) Gadamer brings us back to a very viable, believable, and comprehesive system of the historical birth of the spirit. Granted, it is impossible to empirically prove the historical accuracy of the Old Testament, but Gadamer points out this historic text's uncanny ability to account for and eliminate every possible obstacle to the coming-into-being of spirit. Once we understand Gadamer's system, we realize that not only is the Old Testament a sensible, fitting, and believable way to account for our existence, it is actually one of the most solid and inarguable existential theories out there. Yes, it does seem shocking and surprising at first, but the more you think about it, the more believable you will find the Old Testament to be. Apparently, the modern philosopher must go down every dead-end, back-alley historical theory known to man before he can finally come to terms with the wisdom of the ancients.So the only question remaining is, should you buy this book? If you are open minded enough to at least consider the possibility of the historical theory described above, then you will probably find this book to be interesting and intellectually stimulating. If, on the other hand, you are horrified and appauled by what I just said, maybe you should instead ask your college professor for his latest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Sleeping Rose","review":"This story caused an &quot;a ha&quot; moment when I read it to my child.

I will agree that as an adult I saw that this is what the author was trying to do. However the story was not very well put together. The plot was confusing at best and misleading at worst.A man who lives in the country with his wife and two children has this rose that blooms the first day of may every year. One year things are different. For one the King invites him to bring his rose for everyone to see and a beggar shows up in his garden. Now, this beggar is depicted as Jesus. The man shoos him away. Some time later when the man sees that the rose is not opening on time as it should he begins to think and remembers the beggar. He then feels bad, goes to find him and gives him a meal. When it comes time to see the King the rose is still closed and the man goes before the king empty handed. What do you think happens next?? You got it! The beggar, a.k.a. Jesus shows up with the rose and proclaims that the man was so good to him and here is the rose in full bloom and is the most beautiful thing anyone has ever seen.Now, here is my problem. First it seemed to me that the man only remembered the beggar because his rose did not bloom. Second, I got the impression that the rose did not bloom because he was mean to the beggar. This is just not how things work! The gospel is not a tit for tat. In fact it is the exact opposite. Jesus loved us when we were unlovable. He saved us when we could not save ourselves. When the man finally realizes what he has done wrong and finds the beggar (I will agree this was a good thing to do) he is \\"rewarded\\" by having his rose bloom. This just does not seem like a good message either. All in all I found this story to convey a works based salvation and the illustrations to be a bit creepy as well. While the message may have been subtle I will not read it again to my children. In fact I won't even sell it in my yard sale. I threw it away!

Second, on the back of this book it says it is a stunning love story and on the binding it advertises itself as a historical romance. Where is the romance? And unless I've missed something, how is this a stunning love story? Throughout the entire book, Percy appeared only a handful of times and then he was nothing but a doormat for Maresa.

I could have done without the history lesson and maybe a little more romance. Napoleon and his escapades were constantly crammed down my throat and I began to wonder if this was his story and a story about the war and that of Percy and Maresa's romance was nothing but a subplot.

While anyone can write a book, this author weaves talent and magic into a novel that is unique - it is for the educated, well-read and lovers of literature and romance.I loved the review by Harriet Klausner - right on the money! I also liked the pixycita review. These books aren't just your run-of-the-mill books that are a dime-a-dozen and easily forgotten. Her book's are original, different and on the cutting edge."},{"Title":"Fifth Daughter","review":"If you loved Gone With the Wind and War and Peace, you will love this beautiful novel. The characters are well rounded and they actually grow throughout the novel, not staying stagnant and stubborn to their own causes as with most romance novels these days. This book encompasses the original meaning of romance novels and focuses upon the actual emotions of the characters, even when they make us angry or sad, and does not have so many sex scenes that we lose the plot line. Maresa, the heroine, grows up feeling unloved by anyone except for her childhood friend Percy and she tries to make up for this by doing the things immature women do for love, hurting the one person who truly cared for her along the way. As Maresa grows from a spoilt brat to a strong woman, Coffman's words make us empathize with the poor girl and root for her all the way. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys well written works, not just romance fans, but romance fans will definently want this one on their shelves."},{"Title":"Fifth Daughter","review":"I just finished reading this book and opened my Amazon file to see if I could find more by this author. This is the first book I have read by Ms. Coffman and the style of writing intrigues me. This is definitely not your standard romance novel.Characterization is indirect and we are given insight into the characters thoughts and confusion. My experience in my only really serious relationship is very similar to the description here. I grew up in North Dakota and my best childhood friend and neighbor was the man I later married. For most of my childhood, he was between a friend and a brother to me. He is the first boy I saw naked, he told me where babies came from, and he is literally in every important memory of my childhood. If my experience is not unique (and afterall there is nothing new under the sun), Merisa's confusion is very real. There was an element of incestousness about this kind of relationship. Like Merisa, I could not understand what I felt and denied that I cared (loved) him as a lover for a long time. He figured it out much earlier.Like the main character, I also bounced around in confusion from one relationship to another with men. And like the main character, I kept coming back to my \\"friend\\" for solace when each of the relationships foundered. I knew those men weren't right for me, but couldn't figure out why. I just had no room for another man but I couldn't admit it even to myself. If I confessed my feelings I might lose my best childhood friend. If he didn't feel the same, would I lose him totally? Would we be embarassed to see each other? It was so confusing that I spent a lot of time frantic with confusion and self disgust, I honestly couldn't understand what was wrong with me. This is the relationship that is described in The Fifth Daughter. I think that only someone who has experienced this sort of love can understand this book.Our relationship was finally able to go forward after some heartbreaking years of separation and confusion (and the death of my own father.) In Merisa's case, she had to be totally separated from her culture and out of space to see the truth of it.Another book with a similar theme is The Annunciation by Ellen Gilchrist. I think she was awarded the National Book Award although I don't know if it was for that book. Love is not all straightforward and clear. If you feel it and feel it isn't right, it can take a very tortuous path."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"While Ingersoll's choice of subject matter will forever ensure that his works will be more obscure than those of his contemporary, Mark Twain, his books deserve the same attention. Witty and scholarly, SMOM is a landmark work of Biblical criticism. Ingersoll disassembles the Pentatuch, pointing out the absurdities and barbarities contained within. While he does give the occasional bit of humor, he is serious in his conviction that the Bible is not the &quot;good book&quot; that it's often made out to be. This one is a must."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"The author makes dismantling the Pentateuch look easy. I have yet to hear or read a theologian debater or writer who is the equal of Ingersoll, or able to present any persuasive rebuttal in response to his arguments. Rather, generally, Ingersoll's detractors have either: urged the faithful to ignore his arguments; and/or heaped personal attacks upon him. Ironically, this is the same methodology that hate groups such as the KKK, the Neo-Nazi's, and others of their ilk, use in response to those who urge different views. The rationale of such strategy is that the end justifies the means. However, such conduct tacitly ackowledges that the defenders of the faith have conceded they cannot directly confront Ingersoll's arguments and ideas on the merits.Ingersoll's chapters on Noah's Ark and the flood to end all floods (pages138-168), the plagues God had Moses inflict upon Egypt (pages 190-209), the tower of Babel (pages 169-175), and the Jews flight from Pharaoh, including their forty years of wandering in the Sinai Desert (pages 210-240), render these stories fanciful and unworthy of literal belief, much less divine inspiration. This book is a must read for any thinking Christian or Jew. The author demonstrates logic, common sense,and humor. Ingersoll disects the contradictions and impossibilities of these, and other, Old Testament scriptures.I am now reading &quot;American Infidel: Robert G. Ingersoll&quot;, a biography by Orvin Larson. I recommend it as a good read too."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Robert Ingersoll has to be the most important nineteenth century figure who is now totally unknown. Ingersoll was known as the &quot;Great Agnostic&quot; and devoted his life to challenging people to rethink their preconceived notions about religion and the Bible. This book is his analysis of Genesis and over a century later it still forces you to open your mind and reconsider. Some of his arguments have been made a number of times in the intervening period but never with more punch or flare. A real eye opener!"},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Ingersoll himself stated that it was not his goal to shatter Christianity, but to shatter the complacency of blindly following fundamentalist doctrine. He was encouraging genuine reflective equilibrium on the part of the religious. At first, this may seem like a road that leads directly to atheism, but I am here to testify that this is not true.I'm glad that our Jewish friend resolved to sustain his quest and that Alexandre was strengthened in his freedom from stagnant thinking. But this is not the end. This is not all there is to say about what the mono-theistic tradition can contribute to humanity. It is not the perfect remedy for the &quot;holly bible&quot; as a whole but the perfect remedy for the fear of questioning it, which leads to seeing it clearly for what it actually is and understanding its true value.After the hilarious and witty Ingersoll, who will get you thinking, I recommend moving on to the excellent scholorship of Karen Armstrong, who will give you not only evidence to support Ingersoll's claims but a new way of understanding the tradition in question. Ready to accept the world with a God-shaped hole in it, I was floored to realize that such a perspective wasn't a clear way of understanding the situation at all. I can tell you with confidence that if Ingersoll peaked your interest that at least A History of God is worth a read (if not all of her other books as well, which I haven't read but am anxiously planning to). Another interesting argument (similar to Ingersoll's) about the nature of complacent awe of the Bible can be found in the first chapter of Who Wrote the New Testament? by Burton Mack.Another fascinating perspective is that of the scientifically-focused Gerald Schroeder. All of his books are worth a read, but The Hidden Face of God is his most lucid account."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"I was referred to this book by &quot;Losing Faith In Faith&quot;, another excellent read. Robert Ingersoll's easy to understand writing for the common person, including those not well versed in the bible, makes this book impossible to pass up. Every point and criticism of religion he made of his time still applies today. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"This book is joy to read, even if but for the literary style of Mr. Ingersoll. Though not a trained philosopher, Ingersoll points out much of the errancy and contradiction in the first books of the Bible.Better yet, he does it with a style and flair that is only comparable to Mark Twain! Most theists (especially Christians) will certainly STILL object to this book. Of course, Mr. Ingersoll used to get death threats in his day so I suspect the criticism by and large, is nothing new.Regardless, if you're a non-theist or have an open mind and appreciation for a well crafted and written book, this one is for you!"},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Wow. I thought that I knew the first 5 books of the bible fairly well, and had found most of the logical flaws that existed... but wow! Ingersoll has an incredible intellect and is quite witty as well. He goes through the first 5 books of the bible and just rips them apart. I don't see how any objective/rational person could read this and continue to believe any of it. Brilliance!"},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Mr. Ingersoll brings a number of points to the fore regarding the Pentateuch, and with a sharp eye for detail and a sharper wit, lays waste to the ridiculous claim of \`divine inspiration'. He points out absurdities, inaccuracies, and downright laugh-out-loud foolishnesses that are contained in the books attributed to Moses. The standard term for books attributed to a particular author (religious) is pseudepigrapha (which means A. Spurious writings, especially writings falsely attributed to biblical characters or times or B. body of texts written between 200 B.C. and A.D. 200 and spuriously ascribed to various prophets and kings of Hebrew Scriptures). The more laughable of these are: how did Noah collect all the animals from all corners of the earth? How did he feed them for nearly a year? Why are there two different sets of counting? Some of the more hysterical idiocies: the ten plagues; first, the Lord destroys ALL the livestock, THEN inflicts them with boils, and THEN slays the 1st born of the livestock along w/the firstborn of the population (we know now that the ten plagues are actually symptoms of volcanic eruption). Somehow, after each plague, the LORD hardens Pharaoh's heart (each time)? And THEN, the Israelites wander thru the desert for 40 years, and somehow, their garments never wear out, or their shoes (love to shop where they did). Ingersoll is especially funny here, vis-&agrave;-vis how many angels were required to maintain the decay of said molecular structures. He points out that the Chinese astronomers knew of Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn 2,449 years before Christ, and 1,000 years before Moses, and they had no direct line to heaven. Fancy that! The mathematics was obscene: there were only 70 Jews when they entered Egypt, and 215 years later (or 430, depending on what version you read: Josephus, supported by biblical scholars, says 215, but Galatians claims 430, Exodus 12:40 says 430, etc.) and upon Exodus, were 3 million. Never mind that the Egyptian have no record of this. Or the Lord sending hornets to plague the Canaanites.I could go on and on, but the book explains these absolute absurdities, obviously interpolations from some very imaginative scribes making it up as they go along, far better than I ever could. So if you are looking for a book that reinforces your faith, this is DEFINITELY not it. But if you want a sensible analysis of an absurd set of books, this is a must read. Allow me to end this w/a quote from Mr. Ingersoll: \\"If the Pentateuch is inspired, the civilization of our day is a mistake and a crime.\\""},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"It's really interesting to think about how Ingersoll would view modern politics. On the one hand he was rabidly opposed to Biblical literalism, also known as the cement shoes around the feet of the American electorate. But his opposition to the Bible wasn't due to any of the forces that get today's Bible-thumpers foaming at the mouth. He wasn't (as far as I know) a communist, hippie, satan-worshipper, or even an atheist. He was actually a family-values kind of guy, and his problems with the Bible stemmed from his hatred of slavery, murder, rape, genocide, and polygamy. Hard to argue with that, and even harder to argue that the god of the Pentateuch doesn't clearly endorse all of the above. In Some Mistakes of Moses Ingersoll reproduces the relevant Bible passages, interspersed with his own commentary, which alternates between funny and furious.I suppose if Ingersoll were around today, his writing would be more like that of his intellectual heir Sam Harris. I recently read this funny quote from Harris's new book: \\"The President of the United States has claimed, on more than one occasion, to be in dialogue with God. Now, if he said that he was talking to God through his hairdryer, this would precipitate a national emergency. I fail to see how the addition of a hairdryer makes the claim more ludicrous or more offensive.\\" Ha!"},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Robert Ingersoll wrote for the common person, using common language and common sense. In fact, he appeals to the same simplicity that people invoke when declaring that there must be a God vis-&agrave;-vis the \\"design of creation.\\" As one reads this book, it is easy to feel guilt for attributing the words of the Bible to the Creator of the Universe. And by the end of the book, one is left with the choice of (a) using common sense and common decency to absolve the Almighty from the barbarism that is contained in the Bible; or (b) continue to practice intellectual acrobatics in order to hold the Almighty responsible for every barbaric word of the Bible. Indeed, Ingersoll ensures that inerrantists are properly chastised for their continued insistence of an \\"inspired book.\\" Such a position is unjustified and insulting to the Almighty. Perhaps it is too idealistic to expect inerrantists to recognize Ingersoll's simple arguments in defense of the Almighty and for that they will perhaps one day be held accountable for insisting that God did and said all of the awful acts found in the Bible."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Beautifully written, sharp as a blade.

The book is a survey of the many inconsistencies, inaccuracies, errors, and outright absurdities contain in the Pentateuch (the Torah) - the first five books (of Moses) in the Bible.The author dissects and largely discredits the Genesis account of Creation, the Garden of Eden, and Noah's Arc; and he does so with humor and wit which made him a highly regarded public speaker in his time. Perhaps as a result of his work, Christian churches and seminaries had to restate their understandings of the Pentateuch in terms of allegories and myths, and thus stepping away from the hardline literalist traditions so popular among the less astute masses of his time.To be fair to both author and Christian alike, it should be noted that the author's issue is with the background mythology of the Old Testament, and by implication the God of Abraham, while casting no aspersions on the life or teachings of Jesus. In the course of his presentation, it becomes apparent (at least to me) that the author regards the five books fo Moses to be a slander upon the almighty, and an insult to the intelligence of man."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Robert Ingersoll's lecture, \\"Some Mistakes of Moses,\\" is as relevant today as it was in the late 19th century. The language is a bit flowery, in conformity with the period, but the thinking is clear and convincing. Ingersoll spent decades travelling the U.S. speaking to sold out houses ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands on subjects including Shakespeare, Robert Burns and, most famously, religion. His assaults on the church and the Bible, salted with good humor and eloquence, drew the fire of local clergy wherever he went. Yet, even in a time when freethinkers were held in even more contempt than they are today, the famous orator drew standing room only crowds everywhere he went.Oratory was a popular form of entertainment in the days before movies, television and radio, and Ingersoll almost certainly spoke to more people in person than anyone else in history. This was perhaps his most famous lecture, running over 2 hours in length. While one can only imagine how much more powerful it was to hear it spoken by this master of oratory, it is, nonetheless, a very good read, and extremely challenging to anyone who puts much stock in the Bible."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Reading Robert Ingersoll always leaves one amazed that he is not known as one of the greatest writers of his century. Criminally underrated for his views, his works, partially inspired by Voltaire's and Thomas Paine's literary attacks on the Church, are written more for the man-in-the-street, but behind his style hides a vast intellect and love for mankind. It's a tragedy that he was hated, and still is, by so many, the atheist infidel who dared cast doubts on, even mock, the unmockable. But there's no doubt that in centuries to come, when the world has evolved enough both spiritually and intellectually to accept Ingersoll's many truths, and his work is reappraised, his name will be held higher than many of the so-called greats we revere today.Despised as an atheist, I'll leave it to Robert to clarify just what he condemns in this book, and why:'And here let me say, once for all, that when I speak of God I mean the being described by Moses: the Jehovah of the Jews. There may be, for aught I know, somewhere in the unknown shoreless vast, some being whose dreams are constellations, and within whose thought the infinite exists. About this being, if such a one exists, I have nothing to say. He has written no books, inspired no barbarians, required no worship, and has prepared no hell in which to burn the honest seeker after truth.When I speak of God, I mean that God who prevented man from putting forth his hand and taking also of the fruit of the tree of life that he might live forever; of that God who multiplied the agonies of woman, increased the weary toil of man, and in his anger drowned a world; of that God whose altars reeked with human blood, who butchered babes, violated maidens, enslaved men, and filled the earth with cruelty and crime; of that God who made heaven for the few, hell for the many, and who will gloat for ever and ever upon the writhings of the lost and damned.'He certainly doesn't mince his words, but what intelligent person could possibly disagree with a word he says?Don't think he's always deadly serious though. The subject matter at hand certainly offers a potentially rich source of humor, and Ingersoll makes full use of it, for example:'Of course, God knew, when he made man, that he would afterwards regret it. He knew that the people would grow worse and worse until destruction would be the only remedy. He knew that he would have to kill all except Noah and his family, and it is hard to see why he did not make Noah and his family, in the first place, and leave Adam and Eve in the dust.'And towards the end he comes up with this gem:'If you find the institution of slavery upheld in a book said to have been written by God, what would you expect to find in a book inspired by the Devil?''Some Mistakes of Moses' is his longest work, but most of his other lectures and essays are worth reading too, and are as captivating today as when they were first written."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"This book is a sharp-witted, poignant and outright hilarious critique of the Old Testament. Light years ahead of his time, Ingersoll asks his readers to take the Old Testament with a large dose of salt, rather than consider it to be of divine inspiration. 'Some mistakes of Moses' is very well-written and thought provoking. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Ingersoll wrote this work in the late 19th century - his views were probably criticized at that time but are pretty close to right on in the 21st century - he takes a tongue-in-cheek look at the Book of Genesis and shows how whoever wrote it was not in touch with reality - this book should be mandatory reading for Christian fundamentalists who stand on their soap box and talk about how inerrant is the bible"},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Although none of the arguments in this book were especially profound, they were highly entertaining. It's amazing to think that such a droll and tenacious speaker was so widely regarded over a hundred years ago, yet today anyone espousing such candid opinions on the veracity of the bible would scarcely be registered by the media. Were he alive today, the poor fellow would be disheartened to see so many exhortions to prayer by the media and government; but this only underscores why this book and others like it are so relevant today.All in all, light, funny and thought provoking; a joy to read."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Some Mistakes of Moses / 978-1-58509-060-0It is difficult to remember that Robert Ingersoll wrote this eloquent argument over a hundred years ago; his impassioned arguments seem so relevant today that it's hard to believe how little has changed since then. Within his logical and cold commentary of the contradictions and problems within the Pentateuch, Ingersoll also sets forth the arguments that:* the clergy is held perpetually hostage to the traditions and beliefs of the past, for it is always safer to quote a dead predecessor than to express a new - and potentially unwelcome and unorthodox - opinion for oneself.* the politicians should be allowed to privately believe what they will, and should not be forced - as an informal religious test - to pander to every religion at once, in a contradictory political dance that reveals only a dearth of real sincerity.* the teachers may feel pressured not to divulge facts and realities that might contradict \\"Genesis geology\\", and may feel pressured to hype up possibilities - regardless of likelihood - that miracles and science may co-exist harmoniously.When, awhile back, I read \\"Why I Am Not a Christian and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects\\" by Bertrand Russell, I was struck by the eloquence and clarity of thought, such as when Russell pointed out reasonably that one's religion can often be just as much a function of where one is born as well as one's personal choices. I was surprised to see that Ingersoll's excellent book makes many of the same points, with his own style. Somehow, the measure of distance between \\"then\\" and \\"now\\" bring his points even closer to home.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"I am converting to Judaism (Reform) and while doing a search online stumbled onto this book. This book's critique of the Bible is amazingly sound considering it is 130 years old. His point of view is however as a Christian judging topics in the holy books of Moses, not as a Jew. This may sound like a silly point, but if you read any Talimud writings, stories and parables are a very Jewish way to get a point across! Hence, when discussing God, you must speak of the limits of knowledge and human existance, etc...Anyway, I wish he attended the Reform movement synagogue once in a while in his day...He would have found out the Jews consider sex a blessing, something you SHOULD do on the Sabbath, not be threatened with Hell and mope aound wishing you were outside... I suspect if his book was about the New Testament some resentful Christian would have lynched him! Good thing the Jews have a sense of humor ;)...Nuff said...This book should be read by anyone who is considers himself Christian or Jewish. And yes I am still converting too! Books like these is a breath of fresh air and puts our religous quests on firmer grounds."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Don't get me wrong, the book is extremely well written, it was a joy to read, and it even had a few arguments that I hadn't heard.However, Ingersoll makes some mistakes that I don't believe are accurate. First, he places far too much stress on the importance of a literal belief. This was probably the case when Christians were running the universities in our country, but it is not any longer. More and more liberal takes on the Bible are becoming common, and the importance of believing in contradictory accounts is less worth arguing now than it used to be.Another place that I believe he goes wrong is the assumption that the proportion of soldiers in the Exodus Judiac population is equal to the proportion of ours. A more accurate case may be made to the number of American men who were soldiers in the Civil War. That, like the exodus, was about survival.All told, his writing is a joy to read. He points out things that most people don't normally think about, and he makes a (to me at least) novel criticism of the dimensions of the ark and its ridiculous ventilation system. However, this is more of the type of book that I would rent from a library. It is fun to own and let friends read, but you will probably only read it once. It is a light read, though, and a fun criticism.A reader, but a renter.Harkius"},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"While this is one of the best and most enlightened books on the topic that I've ever read, this Kindle edition is full of mistakes.

Masquerading as scholarship, Ingersoll's disappointing book is riddled with logical fallacies and on nearly every single page makes bold and controversial statements that rely on his powerful wit rather than fact-based proofs. Moreover, Ingersoll himself makes many incredibly amateur blunders in regard to Hebrew culture and history so as to reveal his massive lack of knowledge on this whole matter. No matter if you think the Bible to be the most evil book ever, Ingersoll's work has no place in any rational person's library except perhaps as a perfect example of how to pass off bumbling tripe as timeless scholarship. The fact that so many praise this book leads me to wonder if they truly were looking for well-reasoned arguments or merely had itching ears to hear someone preach to the unbelieving choir... (2 Timothy 4:3).I openly disclose that I'm a born-again Christian who calls Christ his Saviour and believes the Bible is God's Word. But please don't discount what I've said because of this but please investigate for yourself! I completely believe everyone should examine and test every belief they hold and listen to all sides of every debate! So read his book and honestly decide if you think Ingersoll provides evidence-based research. If not, I humbly suggest you consider reasoning with God and finding peace through Him (Isaiah 1:18).I openly welcome anyone who wishes to defend this work, although I fear your task will be as impossible as it would be to convince Ingersoll of the truth of the Bible...++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Detailed Review With Quotes and Analysis:++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The first four chapters are a scathing commentary on Christianity as he sees it. In truth, he makes many good points about the hypocrisy and close-mindedness of many ministers of his day and also today. Being a Christian, I found myself agreeing with him over and over about the terrible fascism of so many religious people. However, if he is to be honest, one can find hypocrites and tyrants even among the non-religious. So it is exceedingly important to separate the actual teachings of a religion from the bad behavior of certain peoples claiming that religion.Logically, a religion can be quite true and noble even if many people do evils \\"in the name\\" of that religion. This is something Ingersoll doesn't mention, to his discredit. Moreover and most importantly, these first four opening chapters contain no actual evidence or arguments. I was surprised by this because I was hoping to get right into some serious Biblical analysis and scholarship. In fact, the first four chapters are simply rants against religion that do much to excite the anger of the already convinced and as such do a disservice to calm, rational examination of the scriptures. His animosity toward religion almost dripped from the pages.Chapter five begins by asserting that only ignorant people believe Moses wrote the Pentateuch. Sadly, he never actually delves into any scholarly research or proofs to back up this bold statement. I find it ironic that he attacks religious people so much for their insistence on blind faith, yet he fails to back up his claims. I suppose he simply assumes any rational person would agree that Moses couldn't have written the Pentateuch. He does manage to throw in one veiled attempt at supporting his argument by asking how Moses could have written his own \\"eulogy.\\" There's two views on that. One says that those final five verses weren't written by Moses. Still, if Moses wrote roughly 5,848 of the 5,853 verses in the Pentateuch, it seems quite reasonable to say he wrote it all, in general. The second view, says God gave Moses insight into the future to write those five verses. That view obviously requires belief in the supernatural. The point is Ingersoll doesn't bother mentioning any scholarly discussion on the issue, and therefore does a disservice to all people who prefer evidence based reasoning.You will note he also says, \\"As a matter of fact, it seems to be well settled that Moses had nothing to do with these books...\\" Here is another fallacious reasoning. He says we know Moses didn't write the books because it's a well established fact. Mr. Ingersoll, is that truly the best you can do? Why write a book on a matter if the whole thing is already set in stone?He likewise on page 47 claims \\"they\\" (Christians) haven't \\"informed us as to whom we should hold responsible for the evils we endure.\\" That's a very bizarre criticism to level against Christians since the Bible does quite frequently point out that both the devil and our own selves cause evil. Also, please note, this criticism of his isn't related to the mistakes of Moses. Ingersoll loves to throw in these random jabs at Christianity. I find it fairly immature and unscholarly to make off-topic jabs. At least if you are to go off-topic, read the Bible so you don't ask questions clearly answered by the Bible.On the same page he claims God fails \\"to promise heaven, and to threaten hell\\" in the Pentateuch. It is true that there are no direct references to what happens when someone dies. However, there is clear teaching that there is a heaven where God dwells and a placed called hell. I find it strange that Ingersoll uses this as a critique because he later strongly condemns the Bible's usage of heaven and hell. It seems the Bible can't win in Ingersoll's mind. If the Bible had explicitly taught these things in the Pentateuch, Ingersoll still would have found fault. One sign of a nit-pick argument is when if that thing were resolved, the position of the criticizer would remain unchanged. This is Ingersoll's case.Page 48 he claims the Bible's stories are \\"changed by numberless narrators as intelligence increases...\\" Again, is he going to actually provide evidence for this? No. He simply states this as fact. Regardless of your opinion on the Bible, hopefully you too can see how poor scholarship this is on his part. Ingersoll constantly relies on the fallacy of presumption, which means he already assumes his point is true. I want to know how he knows the intelligence of the Hebrews increased. What is his basis? His imagination? Yes.He continues with his presumption by saying religious systems are created by superstitious people. Again, no factual evidence is provided. He apparently thinks his bold assertions need no defense. And he is right that people who *already* agree with him won't mind. But is his goal to merely \\"preach to the atheistic choir?\\" Again, he exhibits horrendous scholarship.On page 50 he commits a horrendous logical fallacy by saying, \\"Now, if the account of the origin of this earth as given by Moses is substantially like that given by the Egyptians then we must conclude that he learned it from them [since he was a prince in Pharaoh's court].\\" This is a massive logical fallacy! He has fallen victim to believing correlation must mean causation! I admit I got really mad when I read this because I couldn't believe Ingersoll would reach such a ridiculously illogical conclusion as this! Dear reader, I so hope you can also see what folly this is! If I hold a similar view to another view I previously knew about, this does not necessarily mean my current view is derived from the old view! Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. To put it in modern terms Ingersoll did a \\"Epic Logic Fail.\\"Ingersoll goes on to explain on page 50 and 51 about the Egyptian views of creation. However, he doesn't bother to provide a single footnote or reference of any kind! Google \\"Egyptian creation\\" and you will find that there is no agreement on the Egyptian view of creation! There are quite a few myths with some similarities (from Wikipedia). So again, page after page he makes these controversial claims with zero evidence provided. I don't care what side of this debate you are on--we should all agree that this is very poor rhetoric.Page 55 and onward: To give a crystal clear example of Ingersoll's ignorance of basic Hebrew culture, he starts the creation on Monday and ends with God resting on Sunday. This is INCORRECT. The week begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday! The Jewish Sabbath is on Saturday, not Sunday! Now, this doesn't change the merits of his arguments, but it is important to realize that Ingersoll is clearly very unfamiliar with Jewish culture. So how he thinks he can write a book about Jewish history and Moses, is beyond me. He is simply unqualified. He still has every right in a free country to write as he sees fit, but we also have a duty to call out shoddy scholarship when we see it.On page 56 he says he cannot conceive of something being created from nothing. Well, he has this problem regardless of the Bible. All people seem to agree the universe had a starting point. Even the big bang has to be a something from nothing if there was a starting point...the problem is no explosion can happen without something already existing. So the big bang and other purely secular theories of origin also have this quite difficult hurdle of something from nothing. He is right that it would take something outside our physical powers to create something from nothing...hmm, God surely could do that.And on page 57 he says that in eternity past God \\"did not think.\\" Oh man...and what evidence does he have of this I wonder? It's just more conjecture from him. He completely fails to understand that God is able to think quite independently of his creation, at least that's what the Bible tells us! You may think my source, the Bible, is wrong, but at least I have a source! Ingersoll's only source is his own wild imaginings...Page 60: \\"Force cannot, as it appears to me, exist apart from matter.\\" And what scientific training do you have again? At least you admit it's just your opinion. As it appears to me, simply saying you cannot understand or comprehend something does NOT make it false. Yet Ingersoll's entire book consists of these types of statements. He can't understand, can't comprehend, can't believe, can't justify, ect. Alright, but I'd like to have more than just your opinions, please.Page 93: \\"a God who made mistakes.\\" So you say. Care to give specifics? Hmm, I thought not...Page 94: \\"It is impossible to think of a personal God as a spirit without form.\\" Oh really? Again, do you have evidence for this? I'm thinking of a personal God right now who is spirit...I'm not going to comment on the remaining 200 pages because it's just more of the same: bold claims presented with zero evidence or references. Ingersoll begs the question, presumes he's right, confuses correlation with causation, and commits other intellectual crimes against reason.In his conclusion on page 264, he commits the tired mistake of thinking that the laws of Israel should apply to us today if the Bible is God's Word. It would be true that we should stone idolaters IF we lived in ancient Israel. But he is ignoring the fact that the Bible clearly teaches that we as Christians are not followers of the Old Testament law. This requires more space than I want to invest here, but the point is his argument is shallow and inspires sensationalism rather than honest inquiry.On page 265-270 he lists all the \\"mistakes of Moses.\\" But again, none of these has he refuted except by claiming they are all wrong. Again, he presumes everything he says is already true.To conclude: I was honestly very, very disappointed by this book. I always enjoy reading other views and hearing well reasoned critiques of the Bible. However, I was shocked to find out that this \\"famous\\" book was actually just one big long diatribe against Christianity with zero evidence or references to support all the venom spewed forth. This book has no place in any rational person's library except perhaps as a perfect example of how to pass off tripe as timeless scholarship. I openly welcome anyone who wishes to defend this work, although I fear your task will be as impossible as it would be to convince Ingersoll of the truth of the Bible..."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Ingersoll missed all the evidence that has been found that proves that the Bible is true.

Rothenberg seems to get better with each new title, and I especially enjoyed this latest. I enjoyed the emotional roller-coaster Claire is dealing with, along with some pretty sharp(and often funny) characterizations. The setting and the plot twists all meshed together quite well. Read all three, then wait for more."},{"Title":"The Shy Tulip Murders","review":"The Shy Tulip Murders are part of the subgenre of mystery where the reader learns about the profession of the amateur detective at the same time that the detective is learning about the case. The hook of these kinds of books lies in the discovery of how the particular career lends itself to solving the mystery.So far, I have seen books that feature book shop owners, actors, security guards, caterers, hoteliers and many many other professions. I have to admit that a plant pathologist would have never occurred to me as a possible protagonist. However, it works reasonably well-- Round Up and rare flowers are built into the story nearly seamlessly and the effect is a well-written and cozy read.The plot is stretched a little thin in some places, and the tension between the environmentalists and loggers felt too large and complicated to be squashed into the limitations of the cozy detective novel. The protagonist herself is suitably spunky, and Rothenberg does a good job of making me curious about her-- almost curious enough to invest in another installment even though this definitely is not my kind of mystery novel.This book should appeal to cozy detective fans. Extra points for you if you also happen to be or know a botanist!"},{"Title":"The plain people of the Confederacy","review":"This short book is based on lectures given by the author. While some of the scholarship and language is a little old-fashioned and some of Wiley's ideas have been questioned by more modern scholars such as McPherson, it remains useful. Wiley presents a refreshingly rational and balanced account of Southern daily life. The material on soldier life is a briefer version of his seminal work &quot;The Life of Johnny Reb&quot;. This isn't a highly detailed study, but it will be a helpful and readable text for anyone wanting to improve their general knowledge of the subject."},{"Title":"Germanicus Mosaic","review":"In this mystery debut, the author has chosen 186 A.D. Roman Britain to set her mystery. Her protagonist is Libertus, a freedman and pavement maker, whose mentor, Marcus Septimus, occasionally asks for favors. This time, Crassus Germanicus has been brutally murdered, and Marcus wants to know by whom. As Libertus begins his investigation by interviewing Crassus' slaves, he begins to suspect that each slave is only telling him enough to satisfy his immediate questions. As he digs deeper, he finds several slaves with either the motive or the means, but not both. In addition, more bodies turn up further muddying the waters. As he closes in on the murderer, his life is in danger, too.Rowe's debut mystery is a page-turner. The fact that it is not set in Rome as the other two major series (Lindsey Davis and Steven Saylor, authors)are is a plus. Libertus is an interesting man with much to lose if he is not successful in finding the murderer and not much to gain if he succeeds. Rowe does not let her history interfere with her story, and yet the fear the slaves face is palpable. There is much to learn of Roman Britain from this book. The relationship between Libertus and his own slave is interesting, and will, no doubt, be expanded upon as the series progresses. All in all, a very interesting read. In addition, it augurs well for the series."},{"Title":"Germanicus Mosaic","review":"It's the second century AD. A body has been found and circumstances are suspicious. Enter Libertus, now a freeman and works as a pavement-maker.In \\"The Germanicus Mosaic,\\" Rosemary Rowe begins what we hope is a series featuring Libertus, a sharp, level-headed, determined man with a nose (and a mind) for detection. His patron Marcus Septimus enlists his help. The case seems quite obvious. A slave is missing--the case is cut and dried. The body is that of a centurian, Crassus Germanicus, which, of course, means that particular attention must be paid to finding the murderer. This should be easy. Not so fast, however, as Libertus soon discovers that there are several people with plausible--and likely--motives. Conflicting clues, hidden agendas, deceit--all now combine to cause concern. Libertus himself is preoccupied. He has been searching for years for his wife, from whom he was separated when they were both Roman slaves and he has just recently heard that she may have been seen in a local slave market. Alas, his personal quest must be put on hold while he solves this other mystery. Rosemary Rowe introduces us to a most interesting character.The author seems well-versed in historical detail and her style of writing is evenly paced in this first-person narrative of Roman Brittain. An excellent read--and hopefully Ms Rowe will grace us with another installment!"},{"Title":"Germanicus Mosaic","review":"Rosemary's Rowe's Libertus mystery opener is a neatly styled murder mystery. \`The Germanicus Mosaic' centres around the murder of the ex-centurion Crassus Germanicus who is found under his hypocaust at his villa after a procession at Gleva and the disappearance of his personal slave, part time impersonator, Daedulus. Germanicus is an altogether unsavoury character who delighted in tormenting people (such as beating his barber slave, Paulus, for nicking him during shaving, forcing the tenured slave musician Rufus to both watch and listen as he abused Rufus' slave love and constantly fining the head slave, Andrethus)We meet many other assorted characters:the gatekeeper Aulus (an apparently inept informer for Septimus), Germanicus' brother, the newly christian Lucius and hear about his ex-wife, Regina, amongst others.All in all we end up with many people at the villa with a motive to murder the man but lacking opportunity. Into the mix steps Longinus Flavius Libertus, a self-deprecating sleuth, ex-Celt who was taken into slavery, then later manumitted and now works as a \`pavement' specialist (had to wince at that as he is really a mosaicist) under the patronage of the senatorial class Marcus Septimus, client of the governor Pertinax. With Libertus is his slave, Junio, and the pair of them set about unravelling the complexities behind the motive in true Holmesque manner - with a fine eye for detail. With Marcus' constant hasty desire to approportion blame at the first sniff of a linked motive and suspect it falls to Libertus to remove the web that implicates other innocent parties and discover all of the events leading up to the night in question. As he succinctly puts it \`one murder leads to another' as we discover that Regina was also murdered and buried under the very librarium mosaic that Libertus had lain some weeks earlier. So, by the time we figure out the truth we are running fult tilt to catch up with the culprit(s) before another innocent dies and Libertus manages to get the protagonist(s) to ingest the poison meant for him. Poison is a common theme throughout.As a first offering, Rowe has not done too badly. Admittedly, the plot moves along simply, but the characterisation and sleuthing is excellent. Libertus is constantly under pressure to discern reality and lies lest innocent parties take the blame so the novel is almost screenplay in its delivery. Nevertheless, the promise is there and I have no doubt as Libertus' continues to sleuth that these mysteries will become a delightful addition to the genre. If you're a fan of the genre, certainly worth delving into. It is only a pity I did not spot this novel when it came out four years ago."},{"Title":"Germanicus Mosaic","review":"186 AD, Britain is the northernmost province of the Roman Empire, the British tribes have settled into a peaceful co-existence with the Roman conquerors.Libertus the main character of the book is a freedman who lives in Glevum, (modern day Gloucester). By trade he is pavement maker or mosaic artist. By inclination he is a sleuth who is usually called upon to help his patron Marcus. A body is found in a nearby villa and is identified as that of a retired centurion. Libertus is called in by his patron to help solve the murder. . . At the same time Libertus is trying to seek out his wife from whom he was separated while he was a slave.My kind of book, not much more to say."},{"Title":"Germanicus Mosaic","review":"The &quot;hero&quot; in this mystery is a freedman turned mosaic maker who is uncreatively called &quot;Libertus&quot; a name that basically just means &quot;freedman&quot;. The mystery and the way it is solved isn't particularly complicated; it seems more a matter of luck and logic than investigation as is the case in books by Steven Saylor. Unlike characters in Lindsey Davis' books, the &quot;hero&quot; and his own slave, Junio, are both likeable and you want them to succeed. Rowe has done a good job of trying to explore how Romanization affected distant parts of the Roman Empire as well as exploring the reality that slavery was a social institution embraced and used by everyone, ex-slaves and freeborn, wealthy and poor. What would be truly interesting and difficult to do would be to have a slave who is a &quot;hero&quot; in these ancient mysteries, someone who could really explain this darker institutioin that seems so favored to modern authors yet so distant from their experiences."},{"Title":"Sixty Jars in a Pioneer Town","review":"This book kept me anxiously awaiting each turn of the page...it was truly a heartening story suitable for both adults and children.

You would think Kim would hire a professional editor to proofread, edit and make the text presentable. I work somewhat in a linguistic zone, so I guess I have an eye for this type of things.

Through her story and the stories of 3 of her girlfriends from college, I could identify thinking patterns about money and finances in general which are inhibiting.As the Rich Dad series of books do, this book shows the need for financial literacy and directs you to make the changes you need to improve your financial education. This book spends more time on discovering what assumptions may be holding a woman from even attempting investing. I liked the section about that helps us when our partner may not have an interest in learning more about financial literacy or investing and the section about dealing with people who have a negative opinion even though they are completely inexperienced. Great read!"},{"Title":"Rich Woman: A Book on Investing for Women: Because I Hate Being Told What to Do!","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to understand real estate investing but especially for women who may think this is a man's job. It helped me tremendously to finally figure out what I wanted to invest in and write it down. I highly recommend this book to any woman who thinks this is only a man's game."},{"Title":"Rich Woman: A Book on Investing for Women: Because I Hate Being Told What to Do!","review":"I've read other books from the Rich Dad company, and have been inspired and excited by them. This book, however, was a complete disappointment.I found it insulting that the book was written in a gossipy, let's-get-together-with-girlfriends tone. Did Ms. Kiyosaki really think that women wouldn't relate to the book unless it was conversation-based? The entire book only contained about four pages of useful information.Additionally, the many typos gave the impression that little care was taken with this book. It seemed as though it was written as quickly as possible, edited as quickly as possible, and distributed as quickly as possible just to add another source of passive income to the Kiyosaki's pockets.The fact that the Rich Dad company stands behind this book has turned me off to any other products offered by the company. My copy has been returned."},{"Title":"Rich Woman: A Book on Investing for Women: Because I Hate Being Told What to Do!","review":"I am a fan of the quick hits self-help books with less story, more inspiration - like \\"The Success Principles\\" which has so many small chunks. Kim's book is written a story of her college friends from Hawaii and how they all end up. Along the way we learn about investments.There are some great points on:- Reasons why women are (and can be) great investors, and also the stupid things women do in relation to money- Why women need to get into investments - of the elderly in poverty, 75% are women and most weren't poor when their husband was alive- Why investing options are great for women as you can work on your own terms, there is no earning ceiling and it can fit round family- Using your personal reason why to create success- A real asset is one that puts money in your pocket - and how to create assetsIf you are new to wealth ideas, then it is highly recommended.

It was then I discovered how dependent I had become on someone else to provide for my financial future. I call it \\"marital welfare\\" -- and I do agree that we are a culture of dependent creatures -- and this fact usually smacks a woman right in the face through circumstances she least expects. Part of rising above all of this has been a dawning awareness of how important it is to take the financial responsibility for my future into my own hands. Kim Kiyosaki has put into words what has already been placed in my heart -- it was the \\"you're on the right track\\" message that I needed to hear to further my resolve -- not just in finances but in every area where self-sufficiency needs to evolve. The good news is that I am remarried to someone who supports my financial plans, goals and dreams and shares in the excitement. This book does not give a step-by-step how-to, but what it does do is bring about a birthing process that can literally change your life because it provokes you to change how you VIEW your life.

Kim isn't saying that the mechanics of investing are different for women, but the motivations, rewards and value of investing groups are. That's why there's so many references to \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" etc. - go there to learn more about pure investing.This book is about defining yours goals, motivations and getting some tips - and if you DO SOMETHING you're probably going to succeed. The stories of the group of friends are sometimes distracting, but they serve an important purpose of letting you identify with situations - activating your empathy and getting the message across. Much more effective than a dry, objective HOW-TO book. I'm telling my friends about it!"},{"Title":"Rich Woman: A Book on Investing for Women: Because I Hate Being Told What to Do!","review":"Kim Kiyosaki shows she's the real deal with this book. I read it with my wife and absolutely loved Kim's perspective and how she kept the theme around her long time girlfriends; the ups and downs, etc and interjected sound fiscal rationale into the life of each one. Of course, we also learned that some folks just won't listen and just won't learn - even if they agree with a great idea; they just can't make the commitment to change. I really enjoyed her comment early on (after explaining the changing reallization of womanhood from our 20's to our 50's) that \\"Its a waste of time to think that men will change. Its time for us women to change\\". If you get nothing else out of the book, at least try to understand the six reasons why women 'must' be involved in investing (such as avoiding dependency and increasing self-esteem). Kim defines the keys (and the best way to make immediate changes) as arming yourself with some fundamental finance education, starting out small, always put some cash down, and stay close to home (at least at the beginning). Of great importance is her succinct rule that \\"Its your choice!\\" If you seek financial \\"dependence\\" then you are accepting that someone else will be responsible for your financial well-being. However, if you seek financial \\"independence\\" then you are opting for \\"long-term freedom over short-term comfort.\\" This book is about understanding the need to make the change, making a commitment to change, seeking financial independence, and making decisions between cash-flow or capital gains in your investments. Control your finances to build your self-confidence.

The rich dad philosophy directed specifically at women?? Where do I sign up? But then I started reading... and kept waiting for it to get better. Then I told myself I would give it one more chapter and then one more. It never did. This book was just plain bad. It was not only bad but the book undermined my intelligence. Are there really women out there who don't even know the bare minimum basics of investing and money? And if they don't, do they also need some long drawn-out narrative story with cliche \\"women stories\\" just to keep them interested?This book was just plain terrible. There is very little actual investing information. It's basically a lot of cliche money advice sprinkled in with Kim's extensive story of her and her girlfriends' quest to become financially free (which honestly bored me to death and also made me question how someone like Kim Kiyosaki managed to find a fan club of women who know even less about money than she does that she can preach to).I also couldn't believe that Robert co-signed on this book! (He had to have, right?) Why didn't he tell her how bad it was or at least how she could fix it! I mean it's easy to see what they wanted to do with this book. Let's empower women and teach them how to take the initiate with their money and not leave it all up to a man...We get it. But come on, it's 2008, give us women a little more credit.

There is one page in the entire book that actually gives you \\"investment\\" information. The rest is a story that you can read in an hour or two. It's great that Kim is coming out from under her husband, Robert's, shadow, but come on, where's the beef? All it takes is a person of wealth and a name and you can publish anything. Honestly folks, you could write a better book yourself.

Rich Womam was written as if woman are stupid and can't figure out investing unless the information (or lack of) is presented in a story about girlfriends. There was no substance to Rich Woman; it's a fluff book written to motivate woman to invest, yet has no actual information. I grabbed the book in an airport before catching a flight because I had read Rich Dad and found it interesting. My main question from Rich Dad was how did Kim buy a 20 unit complex when she was supposedly broke? So, I figured I'd find out in Rich Woman. Nope! Again, this book skirts around HOW Kim and her husband's investments actually came to fruition. I was let down by Rich Woman.

Kim even read my mind about the coattails, acknowledging that husband Robert was the face of the company they built together and candidly sharing that this bothered her. Refreshing! I liked how she was able to balance her genuine emphasis on independence without sounding anti-men. What I felt was missing was really not her fault: she has no kids so can't write like she does, but I do wonder how this story would have played out had kids been in the picture.

One of the most fortunate facets of this professor's expertise is his ability to transmit the fruits of that vast knowledge to his readers in a lively, interesting, easily readable, and well-organized fashion. This book is an apt example. Without overwhelming the reader by overuse of taxonomic names, statistics, or anatomical terms, Dr. Kurten offers a novel view of the Ice Age animals that dominated North America before the coming of man.Rather than preceding along anatomical or taxonomic lines, Dr. Kurten moves forward through time, beginning in the Pliocene epoch that immediately preceded the Quaternary period. Dr. Kurten divides the time period by use of the Blancan, Irvingtonian and Rancho LaBrean periods, rather than through more traditional European time periods. By use of these American-based dividing lines, he is enabled to discuss not only individual North American species, but how the American animal community evolved and prospered into one like the world has never seen.The reader is not only treated to discussions about familiar animals such as the sabertoothed cat, and the mammoth, but can be exposed to and learn about such creatures as the scimitar cat, the Florida cave bear, the American camel, zebra and lion,and giant extinct condors, among many others. You will learn about the evolution of bison, and about the many animals that migrated to the Americas from Eurasia over the exposed Bering Straits during the height of the Ice Age.The book is unendingly fascinating, and one wishes he or she could be transported in time back to the day when these now-departed creatures made the American plains and forests teem with life. I recommend this book very highly to all, especially high schoolers with a little scientific background."},{"Title":"Before the Indians","review":"Kurten at al have described the wonderful variety of large mammals that lived in North America for millions of years, until as recently as 13,000 years ago. Saber- and scimitar-toothed cats, camels, sloths, mastodons, lions, cheetahs and other animals combined to make North America a teeming home to large game more diverse than Africa now has. Many fine illustrations accompany the text.The book is well-written, easily accessible to the interested lay person and does not require college level understanding of morphological bone analysis. Having been to southern Africa in 1997, I now cannot drive or hike through rural North America without imaging mammoths, tapirs, bear-sized beavers, one-ton running bears, and glyptodonts coming to the watering holes and browsing and grazing their way across the landscape.For a comprehensive college-level treatment, see &quot;Quaternary Extinctions,&quot; Paul Martin and Richard Klein, editors."},{"Title":"Before the Indians","review":"I have been looking for information about the size of Panthera Atrox, the Giant American Lion and information of other mammals of the past and finally I found it here in this complete book."},{"Title":"Will Our Love Last?: A Couple's Road Map","review":"As a partner in a successful marriage of 21 years, I am not often drawn to &quot;self help--relationship&quot; books. In my role as a primary physician I do, however, see the sad fallout of marriages that do not last. Thus it was on the recommendation of a colleague that I read Dr. Hamburg's book.In a very logical and readable format Dr. Hamburg outlines characteristics that are central to the success of a marriage. His central premise is that COMPATIBILITY is the key to a long-lasting relationship. This need not mean sameness, but rather a pattern of beliefs, goals and lifestyle that meshes with that of one's partner. Much of the emphasis of COMMUNICATION - style and ability to communicate - is misplaced, Hamburg contends. Couples may communicate very well but deliver messages that are inherently incompatible.Dr.Hamburg thus focuses on specific attributes of each partner and of their relationship.Too often, he points out, decisions are deferred which will make or break a marriage -- the most obvious being the decision whether to have a family. In a humorous but pointedly pertinent chapter he outlines &quot;bad news&quot; characteristics -- red flags that are destined to predict failure but are often overlooked. At the same time Dr. Hamburg develops a construct of three dimensions which each contribute to the success of a marriage -- &quot;physical,&quot; &quot;practical,&quot; and &quot;wavelength.&quot; By combining examples, exercises and questions for partners to ponder together he maps out a way to ask the questions that will help a couple achieve an understanding of the level of their own compatibility.There aren't many self-help books that I can recommend to may patients without reservation, but this is definitely one."},{"Title":"Will Our Love Last?: A Couple's Road Map","review":"As a psychologist, I am always on the lookout for a book that I can recommend to my clients. It is rare that I find one. This is one of very few books that I will tell my clients about and will personally reread. Too many self-help books offer up one or two ideas and then some advice. Helpful, but not enough. This book is different. The reader will learn to think about their relationship, love and compatibility in a clear but deep way. This will enhance communication, and for many, help them to be closer. For others, it will help them make some difficult decisions regarding the long term prospects of their relationship. Dr. Hamburg writes in a clear, very frank manner. He shows insight, compassion and simple wisdom. This is a great book!"},{"Title":"Will Our Love Last?: A Couple's Road Map","review":"The author presents a fairly straightforward theory of how he's seen compatibility relate to long term marital happiness and stability. He breaks it down to three areas: practical, sexual and wavelength. I've thought a lot in the past about the way I relate or don't relate in relationhships, but reading this book I had a number of &quot;aha&quot; moments where I felt like this makes real sense. I've discussed his ideas with a number of friends and the consensus is he's right on. The great thing is that after you read this I'll bet you'll feel compelled to talk about these ideas with friends and more importantly your lover. It's an easy, accessible read that I would see as invaluable to people looking for love or married for years."},{"Title":"Will Our Love Last?: A Couple's Road Map","review":"I've read a lot of books on relationships, compatability and love.

The author also included deceptively simple exercises for couples that allowed them to access not only their thinking about a particular area of compatability, but more importantly their felt sense of it. In short, this book helps cut through confusion in the area of love. It is well worth the cost and it is quite different that most books of the same genre, which I have often found to be very similar to each other. It is clear that this author has many years of experience counseling real couples with difficult compatability issues. I also appreciated that the book did not include too many case studies or examples. I have found many case-study approach type books to read more like a novel than a helpful tool to work with a problem, perhaps this is a personal bias. In short, this book is a very useful tool for understanding an existing relationship or as a benchmark guide for dating compatability. It also achieves its goal without a lot of unnecessary text or redundant stories about other couples."},{"Title":"Will Our Love Last?: A Couple's Road Map","review":"This is a wonderfully practical guide for couples - full of wisdom, common sense and humor. Hamburg's three dimensional model for assessing couple compatibility helped me to understand why we reach some of the impasses we do with our partners. The questions will aid any couple in making a frank and open-eyed appraisal of their basic compatibility, a step which is often neglected in the emotional intensity of a young love relationship. As a marital therapist, I appreciate Hamburg's simple, yet thoughtful, questions and clinical examples as an aid to couples in sifting through their questions and doubts about their choice of a partner. As with any self-help volume, the emphasis is on a particular approach - in this case cognitive and behavioral techniques. In my view the only shortcoming of this book is an under-emphasis on examining the role of individual limitations - such as personality disorders and unresolved family events - in the perpetuaion of couple conflict. That said, I will continue to enthusiasticaly recommend Will Our Love Last? to many of the couples I see in the office as well as those I know personally."},{"Title":"Will Our Love Last?: A Couple's Road Map","review":"Samuel Hamburg answered so many questions I had about love and feelings, I couldn't put the book down. His theories about what makes love last and why some couples, even when both of them seem like nice people, aren't right together. This book can save couples the mistakes that many others have made. It may also help struggling couples who don't know why they're having problems. I know it's helped me. I just wish I had this book years ago. It should be REQUIRED READING FOR ALL PEOPLE CONTEMPLATING MARRIAGE! READ IT TODAY!"},{"Title":"Will Our Love Last?: A Couple's Road Map","review":"According to the author, there are 3 dimensions necessary for a successful relationship. They are:1 -- the Practical dimensionThis is about how well you live and work together.Are you someone who moves quickly or slowly?Are you an early riser or a night owl?Is your decorating style Sleek Modern or Cluttered Country?These may sound like petty, insignificant issues, but on a daily basis, if you and your partner are way off on this dimension, you could easily grate on each other's nerves.2 - the Sexual dimensionThis goes beyond sexual attraction to include sexual style.Do you like quiet, missionary style sex or loud, try-every-position-imaginable sex?Do you like sex once a day or once a month?If you and your partner are way off on this dimension, then both of you will feel frustrated. The partner who wants less sex will feel like a spoilsport and the partner who wants more sex will feel like they are on a sex diet.3 - the Wavelength dimensionThis is about the meeting of the minds.Is your sense of humor quietly witty or loud and raunchy?If the baby's crying, is it best to pick them up or let them cry it out?How do you feel about eating meat?In an ideal world, we would all be able to kindly accept each other's differences in values and opinions. In reality, though, when someone disagrees with a value we hold dearly, we tend to think that person is naive, crazy, or stupid...and respect goes out the window.According to the author, dissatisfied couples are couples who only have one or two of these dimensions present.That's not to say you and your partner have to be twins (some difference is healthy because it allows you to grow and makes the other person interesting) but just close enough so that the ratio of good times outweighs the bad times. I agree with the author's outlook and consider this book to be a smart look at relationships."},{"Title":"Will Our Love Last?: A Couple's Road Map","review":"Have no hesitation about buying Sam Hamburg's clear, realistic, and thoroughly engaging guide to understanding relationships, esp. marriage. He wisely acknowledges your experience with relationships of all kinds (romantic and non-romantic), gives excellent guidelines for understanding what you need from a relationship, and gives likewise excellent guidelines for the dynamics of the relationship itself.

Its starting point is a warning that &quot;communication is not enough.&quot; People who communicate very well may not be truly compatible with each other. Helping you find out if you will be compatible for life with the person you love is the purpose of this book. Compatibility is not easy to recognize, but Dr. Hamburg's lively mix of anecdotes and explanations help you think about the many sources of compatibility.

A few years later, I met a man. We liked different things. I read, he watched TV. I like ethnic food,his idea of ethnic food was spaghetti. But, thanks to this book, I realized that we were very compatible in all three areas. This was the best relatinship I ever had, and it only ended with his death.The difference between my first marriage and my second was night an day.

It is rare that I find one. This is one of very few books that I will tell my clients about and will personally reread. Too many self-help books offer up one or two ideas and then some advice. Helpful, but not enough. This book is different. The reader will learn to think about their relationship, love and compatibility in a clear but deep way. This will enhance communication, and for many, help them to be closer. For others, it will help them make some difficult decisions regarding the long term prospects of their relationship. Dr. Hamburg writes in a clear, very frank manner. He shows insight, compassion and simple wisdom. This is a great book!"},{"Title":"Will Our Love Last?: A Couple's Road Map","review":"This is a refreshing look at conventional therapy vs. compatability. I haven't finished, but am enjoying it! It arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner."},{"Title":"Will Our Love Last?: A Couple's Road Map","review":"since I am just beginning to apply it to my current situation. But after reading it, I certainly see where some past relationships have gone wrong.And the basic theory does make intuitive sense: Hamburg focuses on physical issues, practical compatibility (day-to-day teamwork) and what he calls \\"wavelength compatibility\\" (that is, broader ways of looking at the world, and similarity of opinions on big issues such as religion). As he points out, if your prospective mate flunks on all three criteria, further communication and hard work will only make it clearer that he or she is not a good match.My only real quarrel with Hamburg so far is his suggestions about which issues couples must resolve before being married. For example, he thinks that a couple should decide before marriage whether to have a \\"traditional marriage\\" (i.e. one where the male earns most of the money) or a more egalitarian mrriage. I am not sure that one can know in advance how \\"traditional\\" one's marriage can be; presumably most reasonable couples would move towards a less traditional marriage if the spouses' earning power is roughly equal, but towards a more traditional marriage if one spouse's economic contribution turns out to be minimal."},{"Title":"Will Our Love Last?: A Couple's Road Map","review":"In contrast to so many marriage self-help books that rehash the same old message, this book contains real wisdom. I strongly recommend it to anyone contemplating commitment in a relationship or concerned about their marriage.As a college teacher and researcher, I've read a great many self-help books that proport to guide people in their marriage decisions. Most have one major flaw: the authors assure us that by &quot;just working harder&quot; at our relationships, we will suceed. I've noticed how many people try the advice in book after book and continue to feel a sense of personal failure in their relationships.In contrast, Dr. Hamburg's simple wisdom shows a way out of this cycle of failure.His approach is quite radical yet easily understood and mastered by anyone willing to take the time. He never talks down to the reader, and one can sense the depth of experience and compassion he brings to the book.I learned alot from reading the book and I've given it to many friends."},{"Title":"Will Our Love Last?: A Couple's Road Map","review":"The author claim that after you read his book &quot;love will no longer be a mystery.&quot; Of all the fatuous claims by a shrink, this has to be the most arrogant one I've heard in ...oh, say, the last two weeks.

Spare me the &quot;Dear Abby&quot; sentiments.No, saith the illustrious Dr. Hamburg, the ANSWER that has eluded poets, philosophers, and marriage counselor all these many years is...are you ready?MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING!Get out the hammer and awl and carve THIS one in stone!

I was then a 12 year old geeky bookworm who was interested in reading anything, from the moslem holy book, the Koran, to National Geographic, to Playboy. Although my most precious books then were political, yet there was something about William H. Danforth's I Dare You that was unique and mysterious. It was unique because it was the only English-language book that I was seriously trying to read, when my &quot;anglo-exposure&quot; paled compared to my native Arabic and Urdu. And it was mysterious. I had found the book wrapped up under piles of personal effects of a British-born eccentric uncle of mine, who came to stay with my family in Kuwait in the late 1970s, and then disappeared mysteriously during a short vacation in London. Apart from the &quot;I&quot; and the &quot;You&quot;, I had never heard of the word &quot;Dare&quot;. Understanding what it meant marked the launch of a personal crusade to master the English language. Five years later, I was able to read the book with deep understanding and contemplation. Since then (I'm 27 now), I have read scores of books, mostly in theology, politics and history, in both English and Arabic. But this book proved to be different. It's core subject was the individual reader. It does not talk about the author, or about some self-improvement philosophy that he had developed. It's a warm and simple rendition on living a healthy life and making the most out of it. And it's about what I would call a mental dissection of the human soul, separating mind from body, to understand where the self exists. A man who can dare others to achieve greatness has to be great himself. Mr. Danforth, while devoting his long life to study man, meanwhile worked up the corporate ladder at the General Motors Company. At the sunset of his life, he devoted his time and energy to the Y.M.C.A., and, finally, wrote a book that did not earn him million dollar sign-ups, but changed (this I can bet my life) someone's life forever."},{"Title":"I Dare You!","review":"This book was given to me as an achievment award. That was almost 20 years ago. I could not tell you how many time I have read and re-read the pages of this book. Mr. Danforth's message is just as valuable today as it was 20 years ago, actually more because I appricate the things he says so much more today. I have taken his dare to live my life with the ballance he suggest and I am a better person because of it. In my opinnion this book is a classic in motivation and success that ranks right up there among such titles as &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot;, by N. Hill, &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot;, by D. Carnegie, &quot;The Power of Positive Thinking&quot;, by N. V. Peal, and &quot;The Geatest Salesman in the World&quot; by O. Mandino. These books will build a foundation that you can build a trmendous life upon if you will read them and take their lessons to heart. Of these books, &quot;I Dare You&quot; is my favorite because of it's simple but effective message. This is truly a message that is just as valuable today as it was the day it was writen. If I could only own one book other than the Bible this would be the one book I would own.

(By the way, every year I read it, I make sure to meet that challenge!) You want to jump up and get those exercises in with the air rushing in your chest and swelling you up with pride. This is one of the most energizing books you will ever read. It illustrates and talks about the 4 components of life and how we must keep them balanced to be able to do anything we want to do.When I finished reading it, I checked when it was written and found out it was early this century. However, it far outdoes the self-help books that flood the market today.I will be giving this book to three neices and nephews this graduation and challenging them to read it once a year for the next four years because I know what it did for me during college and what it can do for them.This is one of the least expensive gifts you can give someone, but it will help them Create their lives vs. simply living their lives.

In this time of egotistical, hyper-goal-setting, go-getter fanaticism, Mr. Danforth simply pushes the reader in a logical direction.

I'm intrigued by the use of the four-square symbol which he uses on the cover of the book. The squares are going out in a spiral, much like the ripple effect that his inspirational philosophy has on people, and as Chairman of the Board of the Ralston Purina Company, his business is located at Checkerboard Square, St. Louis, Mo.

Once the war was over, he was given some unimportant posts in the American government, but moved to France to support the French revolution.One of his own writings, The Age of Reason, was a treatise in support of his belief in God, but opposition to all organized religions as being false and hypocritical.This led to opposition to his book and to him by many representatives of organized religions and to his denunciation by President Theodore Roosevelt as a \\"dirty little athiest.\\" Relatively recently, he was finally honored by the U.

They are quick light reads, perfect for a rainy afternoon or by the pool. The only problem I have with them is Jaine's obsession with food begins to wear on you about the 3rd book. Ok, she likes food, but to talk about it every other page is a bit much. Jaine's finishing off of other character's leftover food is also a little repulsive (finishing Lance's 1/2 eaten pastry, for example). Love her neighbor Lance, her cat Prozac needs some manners.

Becky hires Jaine to clear her name and find the real killer.This was a very funny book where the mystery was almost secondary to the humor.

Anything about shoes and a good murder mystery though always works for me."},{"Title":"Shoes To Die For (Jaine Austen Mysteries)","review":"Laura Levine is producing a series not very mysterious but just the thing to ward off the heebie-jeebies on a depressing day. Done entirely in the first person, her young heroine is a chip off the sit-com block, funny if not particularly witty. She is hard to dislike as are the books in this series. 'Shoes To Die For' can claim a first, the murder method. Not to give anything away, I can only say I have never heard of death caused in this manner by this instrument. A non-mysterious highlight is, no doubt, the heroines nautical date. Enough to make even the most love-starved divorcee think twice about re-entering the dating arena. I would not recommend this book to devotees of the classic mystery; others should be entertained."},{"Title":"Shoes To Die For (Jaine Austen Mysteries)","review":"Very easy summer read.

Lance, her neighbor, decides Jaine's elastic waist pants must go and gives her a makeover. He takes her to Passions, a hip boutique, where nothing fits. But she gets an interview to be the new magazine ad writer for Passions.When Jaine arrives for her interview, she finds out that Grace no longer owns Passions. Giselle, aka Frenchie, now does, and she isn't someone Jaine wants to interact with. But she needs a job. So she arrives early one morning to pitch her ideas to Frenchie, but she finds Frenchie dead with a Jimmy Cho stiletto in her neck. There are plenty of suspects, and Jaine sets out to wade through them to find the killer.This is one of my all-time favorite series. Jaine is such a fun character. I love the L.A. setting. The author puts plenty of humor into each book that I just devour them. Her neighbor Lance and the various other characters in this book really add to the story. The plethora of suspects provides enough red herrings to keep the reader guessing right up until the end. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Shoes To Die For (Jaine Austen Mysteries)","review":"Ms. Levine has a great sense of humor. This book is a quick, fun read if you are looking for something that is completely mindless. I would have preferred to see a little more substance...to say it is the proverbial cotton candy for the brain might be assigning too much nutritional value."},{"Title":"Shoes To Die For (Jaine Austen Mysteries)","review":".Laura Levine's brag sheet at the back of the paperback edition lists among her writing credits the following television series: The Bob Newhart Show, Laverne & Shirley, The Love Boat, The Jeffersons, Three's Company and Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. The consequences of such a background are, to say the least, observable on the printed pages of this series--maybe not so much The Bob Newhart Show, but certainly The Jeffersons and Laverne & Shirley. The book ought to come with a CD to provide rimshots at appropriate points.Consider these:The heroine, Jaine Austen (yeah, cute) and her best friend Lance, who is gay (of course) and flaming (naturally!), are having lunch in a trendy eatery. \\"Just when I was wondering if I could possibly convince Lance to desert this place for a restaurant that served actual food, a sultry waitress with huge eyes and tiny [...] slithered up to us.... Ms. Sultry, who looked like her last lunch had been a line of cocaine, slinked away.\\" [Page 10 of the paperback edition - rimshot!]\\"I glanced over at the window display featuring a mannequin in thigh-high boots and thong underwear. Just what I always wanted. The sexy storm trooper look.\\" [Page 13 - badda-bing, badda-boom!]\\"Oh, God. Those harem pants. Just the memory of them makes me shudder. I looked like Barbara Eden on prednisone.\\" [Page 18 - pa-pa-pam!]\\"Trying to find a patient at Cedars Sinai Hospital is like trying to find a fat woman on network television.\\" [Page 96 - well, you get it.]As I read this book and its predecessors, I not only heard the lines in my head in typical sitcom delivery, I found myself casting each part with familiar TV faces.Now, I have brought this up not so much to praise Ms. Levine's style--after all, she is not exactly Oscar Wilde reborn, but to show that she has a style. And style is not so common a thing among cozy mysteries, whose practitioners tend to run to functional but bland prose. Frankly, I find Ms. Levine's cast of hard-edged, always-on characters a welcome relief from middle-aged, frustrated academics; housewives moonlighting from neat suburban homes and adorable children, and harried female entrepreneurs anxiously scratching out livings from unlikely enterprises: Laverne & Shirley LIVE!Style aside, Ms. Levine's plot construction, characterization and clue emplacement are perfectly competent, if in no way extraordinary for the general class of cozy mysteries. As such I unhesitatingly recommend her books for anyone who has developed a taste for cozies, the breezier the better.SIDE ISSUES: What on earth is wrong with Ms. Levine's publisher? On the cover of the paperback it says, \\"'The ideal beach read.'- Publishers Weekly\\". Surely, someone, somewhere offered higher praise than that kiss of death!And why, for Pete's sake, is the cover of the paperback a markedly weaker version of the cover on the hardback? It entirely omits the iconic image of Jaine that appears on all the previous books."},{"Title":"Shoes To Die For (Jaine Austen Mysteries)","review":"Once I started reading this newest mystery from Laura Levine I couldn't put it down!

Having written for TV (The Love Boat, The Bob Newhart Show, Three's Company), Levine's writing is witty. But too fluffy. At least, for me.I was hoping for more substance coming from a veteran TV writer. For the most part, the storyline for Shoes to Die For revolves around Jaine Austen, a freelance writer, grabbing gigs wherever and however she can. And the zany interaction with her happy-go-lucky best friend, tight blonde curls, Lance, a fashion designer in Beverly Hills, is fun to read. And her cat Prozac may be the main show here, licking its privates and dirtying Jaine's \\"rented\\" designer dress with cat hairs galore.Good characterizations, especially with Jaine's parents via email. Funny stuff. But the promise of a mystery meanders too long. And it isn't until chapter nine when a dead body is discovered--in the store.

I enjoyed reading about Jaine's class and her student Mr. Goldman. He is such a funny and believable character. Reading her emails from her parents are also a hilarious subplot.The mystery was solved eventually by Jaine in the nick of time. Although the culpret was not Jaine's first choice, she eventually figured it out.This series is refreshing and cleverly written.

Visiting his favorite high end fashion boutique, Jaine doesn't find any clothes, but does land a potential client for her writing business. Coming in early to pitch ideas one morning, Jaine finds the body of Frenchie with one of the woman's own stiletto heels stuck in her neck. To know Frenchie was to loath her, so the list of suspects in long. The police are zeroing in on a woman who wouldn't hurt a fly, literally. When Becky hires Jaine to find the real killer, Jaine drops all her current writing assignments (ok, she had none anyway) to pursue the clues. Meanwhile, her father has his heart set on the lead in a play at her parent's retirement village, one of her memoir writing students suffers a heart attack, and Kandi signs both herself and Jaine up for speed dating.Fans of this series will love the latest entry. All the charm and sarcastic humor of the others is present. I smiled, giggle, and laughed my way through the entire book. The book is very well set up. By the time the murder takes place, you are aware of several suspects. And how can you not love such an inventive murder weapon? The ending felt a little rushed to me and definitely could have used a few more pages to better flesh things out.This book will appeal to those who love light mysteries. If that's you, this series is in fashion."},{"Title":"Shoes To Die For (Jaine Austen Mysteries)","review":"This was a fun book; it had comedy, mystery, and a little bit of everything...even made me hate a few characters, which usually doesn't happen. It's a good, funny read, with lots of twists."},{"Title":"Shoes To Die For (Jaine Austen Mysteries)","review":"Jaine Austen - freelance writer extraordinaire - is the farthest thing from your typical Los Angeles beauty. Case in point - she's living paycheck to paycheck, celebrities mean nothing to her, she's semi-plus size, and she spends her days - and sometimes nights - working as an amateur sleuth, and coming across more and more carbs to inhale in the form of delicious foods. This time, however, Jaine's fabulous next-door neighbor, Lance, has decided that Jaine must finally throw away her elastic-waist pants, and opt for something more stylish. More trendy. Less trailer park - if you know what I mean. So he takes her to Passions - a hip boutique that stocks clothing that wouldn't even fit one of Jaine's thighs, let alone her entire waist. And, while a new wardrobe isn't discovered there, Jaine is lucky enough to get an interview as Passions' new magazine ad writer. But then the universe shifts, and, suddenly, kind Grace is no longer the owner of Passions, but has placed ownership into the hands of Giselle aka Frenchie - a nasty blonde who makes fun of customers and cheats on her husband left and right. Ordinarily, Jaine would avoid this woman like the plague, but she needs the money - so she takes the job. However, when she arrives at Passions the next morning to pitch her ideas, she finds Frenchie among the land of the dead - a stiletto Jimmy Choo sticking out of her neck. Now Jaine has decided to toss the ad campaign, and dive headfirst into a sea of dangerous fashionistas, in an attempt to find Frenchie's killer, and protect herself from being next on the list of victims.In the superficial land of Los Angeles, Jaine is a diamond in the rough, whose elastic-waist pants separate her from all of the plastic Barbie dolls traipsing around Rodeo Drive. Her dry wit, and sarcastic comments leave readers cackling in delight, while the different mishaps and scrapes she manages to get herself into - and out of - keep you on edge from beginning to end. Laura Levine is, without a doubt, one of the most entertaining mystery writers on the market to date. Her combination of humor, mystery, semi-romance, and la-la land are delightful, and leave the reader dying to accompany Jaine through the streets of LA, as she navigates her way through murderers, speed dating, friends, and fashionistas. The perfect book for a day at the beach - or a day at home. No matter where you are, you'll be able to enjoy Jaine Austen's misadventures - both in the dating world, and the world of high crime.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"Shoes To Die For (Jaine Austen Mysteries)","review":"If you're in the market for a lighthearted and enjoyable read, you'll definitely find it in Laura Levine's latest Jaine Austen installment, \\"Shoes to Die For.\\" It may not be the most perplexing and suspenseful thing you read this year, but I do think that it will rate as one of the more amusing ones.Jaine's neighbour, Lance, is between boyfriends and feeling bored. The solution: to glamourise the fashion-challenged Jaine. And against her better judgement, Jaine agrees to allow Lance to \\"spiff\\" her up. A three thousand dollar Prada suit and an expensive haircut later, and Jaine is looking very polished and quite glamourous. But the best part is that because of Lance's boredom, Jaine just might have landed a very lucrative assignment writing an ad for Passions, Lance's favourite fashionable clothing boutique. But when Jaine arrives early one morning to pitch her ideas, she finds Passions most detested employee, Frenchie, dead, stabbed in the neck with one of her own stilettos. And when another Passions employee, Becky, whom Jaine rather likes, ends up on the police's suspect list, Jaine finds herself, once again, donning her detective hat in order to hunt for Frenchie's real murderer.\\"Shoes to Die For\\" was a nice, uncomplicated and amusing read. The mystery wasn't the most complex or the most intriguing I'd ever read, but Laura Levine's light and breezy prose style made it quite the entertaining read. I, especially enjoyed the colourful and wacky (no other way to describe it) e-mail exchanges that Jaine had with both her parents. The only thing that annoyed after a while was the author's penchant for stating that Jaine had said or done something and then taking it back, and letting us know that Jaine hadn't really acted that way. While this was initially humorous, it lost its charm when it occurred every other page. All in all though, if you're looking for a bright breezy read, that's full of gentle sarcastic humour and loads of fun, you'll want to read \\"Shoes to Die For.\\" A good 3 1/2 star read."},{"Title":"Shoes To Die For (Jaine Austen Mysteries)","review":"I like Ms. Levine's books a lot mostly due to the main character's ability to laugh at herself and the world around her. But some of the \\"quirks\\" do get tiresome - for instance, the references to the cat always licking herself in intimate places is funny enough the first time but gets old pretty quickly. And the \\"Ooops, I said it, no, I didn't\\" routine starts to grate after the ninth or tenth time. And always coming up with a cutsie name for the cat food begins to wear thin almost immediately. But the retirement home characters are funny, the communications with Jaine's mom and dad are funny and sentimental, and all around, these are easy to read, easy to follow mystery/comedies that are easy to enjoy. I recommend them."},{"Title":"Shoes To Die For (Jaine Austen Mysteries)","review":"Shoes to Die For.This is one of the funniest books I've read in ages. If you're feeling blah, tired or just plain bored, you owe it to yourself to read it. Laura Levine uses the same wit and creativity she used to write top sitcom series like The Newhart Show and Laverne and Shirley to cook up this funny, slightly raunchy page-turner that will have you up all night reading it. The sub-plot about Jaine's retired parents, and their emails is as involving and humorous as the main plot. I laughed so much, my cat came over to see what was happening!The characters are well developed, the plot yanks you in, and food-challenged detective Jaine Austin's asides are so funny, you'll be giggling every time you pick the book up."},{"Title":"Shoes To Die For (Jaine Austen Mysteries)","review":"\\"Shoes to Die For\\" is the fourth book in Laura Levine's Jaine Austen mystery series. I have read the prior three, but you don't need to read them in sequence. Jaine Austen is a freelance writer of business slogans, resume's, and brochures. She is single and likes it, and lives in L.A. with her cat named Prozac. When she goes in a trendy boutique to see about an advertising job, someone is murdered in the shop that night. An employee, whom Jaine likes, is accused and asks Jaine's help to exonerate her. Characters are well done and hold your interest. The plot is good. Hardly a page goes by without a laugh, or at least a smile. This is a light, fast read that keeps you turning the pages 'til the end. Good climax. I enjoy Ms. Levine's wonderful sense of humor, but I thought in this book there could have been a little more. This is one series you can count on to entertain."},{"Title":"Shoes To Die For (Jaine Austen Mysteries)","review":"One of the things that makes Laura Levine my favorite among the newer crop of mystery writers is that her books not only have a happy ending, but a happy beginning: The person she bumps off always richly deserves it. This latest volume in Levine's Jaime Austen series is no exception, as the ever-beleaguered heroine's current nemesis discovers that the phrase \\"killer pair of shoes\\" can take on a whole new meaning, and the reader is drawn into a highly entertaining, witty whodunit.Levine is a consistently lively, clever, and hilariously funny author, and I can unreservedly recommend this book to anyone looking for summer reading material--whether you are normally a fan of detective fiction or not.I recommend, however, reading this book wearing flat-heeled slippers. Your designer stilettos will never look the same to you again."},{"Title":"Shoes To Die For (Jaine Austen Mysteries)","review":"I so enjoy this category of series mystery/comedy..Evanovich's Plum, Brown's and Brauns' cats (and dog), Cockey's Sewell to name a few. Austen's are a bit more to the comedy than the mystery but that's okay. I'll never hear \\"Set it and forget it!\\" without laughing out loud due to Austen's use of the phrase in an earlier book in the series.However as another reviewer mentioned it becomes more than a bit annoying of the author's tendency for stating that Jaine had said or done something and then taking it back, and letting us know that Jaine hadn't really acted that way. Yes it was cute the first one or two times (she has used this technique in early books too) it gets old fast and while we are talking about it same goes for the old 'sales pitch' she uses have the reader buy those earlier books. She may be using it as filler since her books are pretty brief anyway.But these all play a minor irritation to the overall book. Which is a fast, easy, and enjoyable read that will have you wanting more."},{"Title":"Cowgirls","review":"As a college student back in the early 1990s, I stumbled over The Cowgirls in a small and newly formed section of the college bookstore called \\"Women's Studies\\". Having only a vague inkling about rodeo history and women's part in it, I stood spellbound as I thumbed through this book, completely absorbed for who knows how long. It was one of those moments, shall I say, when the written word washes through ones consciousness and resonates in a way that cannot be explained. I was changed, for a part of me had been validated. Growing up in a rodeo town through the 50s and 60s, my perception of women in rodeo was quite different from the stories of those who Joyce Gibson Roach documented in this precious and groundbreaking work. At the time of publication, the book was at the forefront of a resurgence in interest in women's history. In my opinion, it is still the only definitive history of the pioneer rodeo cowgirl. The book is written in colorful language I can only describe as rustic elegance and profound wit. No wonder it's still in print. Joyce became my hero as a researcher and writer of first rate, and the stories she told still inspire me three decades later. I bought many copies of this book and gave them to jaw-dropping friends who had \\"no idea\\" about this particular slice of women's history. Thank you Joyce.

It seemed to have no focus. Roth's best work, as represented by \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\", \\"Our Gang\\", or \\"Goodbye Columbus, is finely-tuned satire, but this book just does not measure up to those prior masterpieces."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"Yesterday having watched woody allen's shadows and fog,in which dickens and freud offer the artist a view of modern life and in that story the priest's great sin is in not offering service to the community, the poor,in other words in not liking and building up the neighbourhoods and even leading to the allen's character not believing in a god with such clerics around(although the connection is never made,gazing into the 'intelligent' students which are a problem as well). Here philip roth,one of the great writers of america,so lavishly praised by having so much of his work published in the library of america in which we can view america in a time capsule,and here we have a bit of a holiday from the usual roth characters,since there's not a jewish persona but an italian in a disintegrating marriage in which the community supports,doctors courts police dont come to his aid and offer any mediation at all..they are all judges and executioners. The male patient in this case undergoes psychoanalytic treatment,and the analysis is botched since the analysts analysis is skewed by racial and perhaps sexual problems/transferrance with the female involved(though she not his patients but does he take care of her). The courts and police in this case also do the same and have created a botched type of society,unfair,especially since the lewd female here pictured he puts up for ridicule but she receives no judgement(ultimately dieing in a car crash sent to boston,meeting up with 'fate' whoose inexorable laws none of us can avoid). Mr Roth's novels should be read and enjoyed by all and i dont find here a misogynist,it is just one female married to one male,and the male is often in a murderous frenzy toward her,and the italian scenes and the italian mr venduzzi(a warm and comical portrait/as well as a about journalism). In this novel the whole society he shows in a material sense tries to serve her...but they actually dont they mis serve her. The society treats in this type of showcase,all women as a sexual object and being sogratified or fantasized,giving her the goods through the court system,without being concerned with the kind of values she has,it does not seem to care or try to produce or honour valuable woman,which is not good to woman and is a criticism of men...a world of objects. I'm glad this is fiction and not the real world...in unfamiliar terrain from the cultural background of bible stories and jewish history,this versatile storyteller strikes a sympathetic note and i see the fog all here...the problem is not the woman but what society has made of her too"},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"My Life as a Man is not nearly so consistently enjoyable as Portnoy's Complaint, but it is the product of a more painful period in the author's life. Additionally, as an anthology of early Zuckerman variations, it is essential reading for those who want to understand more about the later Zuckerman novels and their author. This can be a painful read, and it doesn't meet the conventional expectations of a novel; and yet it has the same moving and inexorable rhythm Roth has been perfecting for over half a century. As always, the indelible turns of phrase and roaringly hilarious dialogue scattered throughout makes it more than worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"The marriage portrayed here is even scarier than the one in Revolutionary Road. There's lots of talk and analysis in this book, but little understanding, since all the characters--spouses, lovers, siblings, therapists--misunderstand each other and construct their own, ridiculously divergent interpretations of shared situations and events. This book is full of Roth's familiar rambling intensity and wickedly truthful, vivid characterizations, but lacks the last degree of maturity and finesse that he began to achieve a few years after this novel."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"Also recommended is Roth's MY LIFE AS A MAN, narrated by Dan John Miller who lends a spicy and vivid reading of a long marriage ended by death and fueled by moral blackmail - even after death. A fine pick for any lending library."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"I promise to keep this review short because I know there is nothing more unpleasant than a long review...did he like, or not like the book?....Yes, this book is a masterpiece: this is early-middle Roth when he is just starting to discover himself as a man and a writer...A must read for anyone thinking about becoming a writer."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"For any writers of fiction, English majors, or just avid readers, this is a must-read. Book snobs and other elitists will smile and feel self-satisfied at the abundance of literary allusions and then cringe when they see their own pretentiousness put in print (I know I did), while everyone else will be hooked by the shocking candor and absurd sexual confessions.The first part of the novel is comprised of two short stories that are supposed to have been written by Peter Tarnopol, who tells his \\"True Story\\" in the second part. These varying levels of narration allow the reader to examine the relationship between Peter's work and the actual events in his life, and thus also Roth's (if you do a little background reading). Much of what Peter doesn't say in his own account (and he says A LOT) is represented in how he portrays his \\"real-life\\" relationships in the preceding stories.The fact that the two stories are, in fact, before the \\"actual\\" events that inspire them makes it difficult to grasp the entire novel at once without rereading it, and the novel is rich and complex (and short) enough that this is possible.The prose itself is a delight to read. So much of the novel is introspection as opposed to action that it was in danger of losing my interest. At moments, it certainly did, but I always came back to it. The tone and style made dozens of pages of mental deliberation over a single event interesting enough to pay attention to.Although I obviously enjoyed the novel and affirm its literary merit, I was annoyed by Roth's portrayal of women. A novel that examines what it means to be \\"a man\\" is a little distasteful to me to begin with, and it didn't help that nearly all the women in the story are some combination of sex-crazed (and yet also frigid...?), mentally unstable, and completely devoted to the indecisive, ineffectual, wife-beating protagonist. However, what the book ultimately says about women depends on the degree of trust and sympathy the reader is meant to have for the narrator, which is certainly up for debate."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"I really hate those reviews that say &quot;if a man wrote this...&quot; or &quot;if you said the same thing about Jews, Catholics, etc.&quot; So I won't say that. This is an abusive relationship that you tend not to hear about - with the exception of Phil Hartman's marriage - where the woman abuses the husband. While most of the time she doesn't outright hit him, the fear and intimidation that she perpetrates makes him into a shaky wreck.Philip Roth tries to make this as manic as possible, but it keeps falling into the sense of entrapment and pain. While most of the book concerns the protagonist trying to get out of the relationship either emotionally or physically, you see him being pulled back in by his own lack of self-esteem and his stupid decisions. The scenes with Dr. Spievogel are great as the doctor both knows enough to help a little, but not enough to provide a cure for him.Toward the end when the wife finally kills herself Roth tries to give some sympathy to the woman, but he's spent 100s of pages describing what a hell it is to live with her. You feel both sympathy and revulsion at this sordid marriage.This is a good book, but it's a depressing book full of pathos. Just as the main character is trapped in this marriage, you feel trapped along with him. Eventually that wears on you and you need to read something light afterwards."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"Philip Roth tells his story from his perspective. After this novel, he became involved with British actress, Claire Bloom, for a long-term relationship. Their marriage in 1990 ended in divorce by 1995. Roth writes from his own personal experience in this book about his troubled relationships with women particularly his first wife who might have been equally troubled. Unlike Roth, she didn't have something to console her misery. I could see the misogyny in his writings and I could understand why some heterosexual men are misogynists. It's because the women that they seek most of the time are often pretentious gold-diggers at times. The men I'm often attracted to are never attracted to me but always somebody else, male or female. I'm at the personal point in my life where I'm complete without a partner to share my life with. We're all brainwashed from the time that we are born to get married and produce children. Even now, those professional couples are opting out of children all together. Well, when you work 16 hour days, why would you want to come home to screaming children who spend their days in day care centers, with nannies, or au pairs? Roth places a lot of equal blame on himself as well as his former wife. Women have reared from infancy and brainwashed with bridal magazines including myself to think that's your future--to get married and have kids. Men are lucky in that department. The gender gap is either growing far apart or needless to say that now that homosexuality has become mainstream in our society that it could be seen as a likely alternative to heterosexuality. Either way, you must remember that unless you are complete by yourself. Nobody else is going to complete you. While divorce and relationships are as timeless problems as the earth's age, when people get married, they have certain expectations of their partners. When the partners finally live together, other sides of them emerge. It's like when you see your favorite star walking around without make-up in real life. You're like what happened to them. It's like a layer of skin that slowly unravels in any marriage."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"I must read Phillip Roth's books, but this one is hard to getinto. The reader needs to know that the first two stories inthe book are drafts of a novel by the author described inthe third story. Everybody is named Zuckerman. I'd suggeststarting with the last half of the book, then reading in order, reading out of order, or skipping the first two stories.Please review it here if you read it \\"out of order.\\" Thanks."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"Philip Roth's sixth novel, \\"My Life as a Man,\\" first appeared in 1974, after the author spent several years trying to use the material of his first marriage (to one Margaret Martinson) in a fictionalized setting. Readers of Roth's autobiography, \\"The Facts\\" (1988), know that his brief cohabitation and extensive legal battles with Martinson were harrowing enough to leave psychological wounds the author continued to lick for decades following her death in a car accident. \\"My Life as a Man,\\" according to \\"The Facts,\\" was a book that took an enormous toll, both artistic and emotional, on the author. But it's a good thing he was able to write it, because what we have is a tremendously gripping, chilling, bitter and often hilarious look at the dark side of \\"romantic\\" relationships.The first section of the book, entitled \\"Useful Fictions,\\" includes two stories \\"by Tarnopol\\" documenting his carefree childhood and eventual entanglement with the psychopathic \\"Lydia.\\" Then the novel itself starts, under the title \\"My True Story.\\" What follows is enough to make anyone feel fortunate for a) being single or b) having a stable relationship. Martinson, who was \\"Lydia\\" in the first section, is here renamed \\"Maureen,\\" and is one of the most unforgettable women in American literature. Self-loathing, neurotic, violent, manic-depressive, grasping, hateful and literally insane, her relentless attempts to control and keep \\"Tarnopol\\" (Roth) are what gives these pages such intensity. Her hatred for Tarnopol and his hatred for her make this book unputdownable. Reading \\"The Facts,\\" one learns that much, if not most, of what occurs here actually took place in real life. No wonder Roth has \\"women issues\\" (or so the critics always say).This remains one of Roth's most intelligent, finely crafted books. His use of dialogue is virtually unparalleled in modern fiction, and his sentences are as chiselled and graceful as one would expect of an artist of his caliber. In short, \\"My Life as a Man,\\" though not the most uplifting book of our time, is an extraordinary (and extraordinarily bleak) accomplishment."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"Roth's considerable abilities are clearly in evidence here: narrative force; powerful intelligence; an unblinking examination of the human heart and mind; an unsparing honesty. But so too are his weaknesses: a truly obsessive concern with men-women relations; an unmistakably bitter tone when he speaks about women; a story that in the end succumbs to its obsessions and anger rather than transcends them, or even finds a feasible accomodation. The endless, fruitless, explorations of the protagonist's pysche finally become too much for the reader; the work begs to be shortened. Still,there are many fine, perceptive (and funny) moments in this book. Roth, even not at his very best, demands reading and consideration."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"I would not recommend this book as a gift for newlyweds or those contemplating entering marriage. One might read this tale wondering why anybody would ever marry. The fact that this story is based on Roth's first marriage gave me a certain feeling of discomfort. And while I may gape at the terrible car wreck on the highway, I still do not feel a sense of bliss about it. In the same way, I have trouble taking pleasure in Roth's pain.\\"My Life as a Man\\" is a unique work of fiction that begins as a work of fiction by the main character. It then evolves into the \\"real\\" events that inspired the character to write his story. Both stories show the main character trapped in a nightmarish marriage. In the \\"real\\" story, Peter Tarnopol's story is more unnerving. No reasonable means would cause his wife to agree to a divorce. At points, it causes Peter to evolve into the same frightening psychopath that his wife already was. Had Tarnopol not told us so early in the story, the reader can easily forsee the marriage only ending in death.Although this may be a work of fiction, the knowledge that it is based on the real life experience of an author that I enjoy is a little disturbing. This may have something to do with why this is one of the few Roth novels that I have had trouble enjoying. Readers should not judge Philip Roth on this work. I would recommend Portnoy's Complaint and The Plot Against America."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"This guy I was interested in had told me that this was one of his favorite books and better at describing his life as a Jewish man than Portnoy's Complaint. Now, I had read Portnoy's Complaint in college, thought it was funny, touching, but it definitely had moments of misogyny. My Life As A Man, however, seems mostly sad with more unrealistic portraits of women. Obviously, I don't know Philip Roth personally, so it's not for me to say if it's autobiographical or not, but there is a lot of pain that comes from male-female relationships gone wrong in this text. The women in the book are crazy, neurotic &quot;shiksas&quot; who go out of their way to drive Peter Tarnapol to a breakdown. On one hand, Peter has his lying, manipulative wife, and the other, his neurotic, needy girlfriend. I always feel that Roth's female characters do not represent real women, and although I dislike labels, I put this book down when done and thought &quot;what a bunch of misogynistic crap.&quot; A good study of dysfunctional relationships, but I don't feel like Peter ever really reaches into his soul to figure out why he gets involved with the wrong women. Obviously not something to structure your life around, nevertheless, this book was a interesting read. Roth has an excellent command of the English language."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"I don't know off hand how many Roth books I've read now, but I suspect it's easily in the two digits. I've also read more essays, reviews and entire books of criticism of Roth than any sane person should. A common criticism of his work is that he portrays women poorly, that he is in fact a misogynist.Maybe it's because I didn't graduate from college and was therefore able to avoid any sort of Gender Studies class, but I never really had a problem with his portrayal of women. He typically has two extreme versions of women in his novels.Woman 1 : Simple, easy to get along with. There to please. Lacking any sort of personality or sense of self.Woman 2 : Bold, articulate, straight forward. Demanding and challenging.In most of his stories, his protagonist will at some point have to decide between these two types of women. They always struggle to choose and the outcome is never the same. While I have considered that it would be nice if he'd occasionally write about a more balanced woman, I don't think that every book I read has to incorporate every type of person ever, so I mostly scoff and roll my eyes at the more feminist criticisms of his work.Then, I read this book.Stop the presses, it's true : Philip Roth hates women. Knowing as much as I do about his background, it is clear to me that this book was a direct attack on his first wife, who died well before the book was written. This novel is the story of their relationship, their downfall and her eventual death. It reads as a bitter, scathing, one-sided and completely unfair assessment of their relationship. The woman is a crazy person, he is perfect. All of their problems were her fault.It was gossipy, hostile and downright unpleasant to read. I will not be reading this again and I'm hoping to soon forget it.That said, the prose was beautiful. He wrote some interesting tidbits about Chicago and the first 1/4 of the book, before he got nasty, was intriguing enough.In summation : Uh, don't read this unless you really, really hate women."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"This book is well-known to be heavily autobiographical, but despite that or perhaps due to that, it is a very elucidating, entertaining psychological study of a Jewish intellectual - though, certainly applicable to any of us - contending with women and marriage. More specifically, it is the exploration of the disintegration of thirty-something Peter Tarnopol's life which at one time was so promising, but took a decidedly downward turn after marrying Maureen Johnson of Elmira, NY, and continuing with his long connection with Susan McCall after his separation from Maureen.Peter is an unlikely candidate for failure of any sort having been adored and encouraged (a bit dominated) by his mother from childhood, graduated summa cum laude from college, written several successful short stories, and employed as a college literature instructor - all before age twenty-five. His attractiveness to nubile, sexually aggressive shiksas was taken in stride - superficial attachments only. However, being well versed in great literature, he found that his relatively easy life was insufficient, not serious enough. He needed to experience the full range of life, including a certain amount of pain and suffering. It is at this point that wounded, abused, though attractive, non-Jewish women enter his life.Maureen ingeniously plays on Peter's sympathies by claiming abuse by previous husbands/boyfriends and poor treatment by many in her various artistic endeavors. The irrationality that seems to have taken over his life is best seen in his proposal for marriage despite being well aware of her pathological tendencies, including constant lying and violence. His suffering goes beyond anything he could have imagined. He cannot conduct classes because he fears his wife's screaming intrusions and is finally reduced to knocking on his older brother's door blubbering incoherently. A separation shortly follows - divorce being nearly impossible to obtain in NY, and then he begins a relationship with Susan, a young widow and a rather passive sort, who adores him. However, given his perfectionist inclinations, he has to remake her. He encourages her to overcome her fears of speaking and to re-enter college, but of greatest importance, both to him and then to her, is to literally work at waking her dormant sexual response.The depth of Peter's psychological state is first seen in two recently written short stories, clearly meant to be commentary on his life, that he sends to his yuppyish, older sister in CA. The first, \\"Salad Days,\\" describes his comfortable early life with only the annoyance of military service to contend with. His dealings with the daughter of the \\"Zipper King,\\" Sharon Shatzky, a girl willing to please him in every way imaginable, is the high point of those \\"easeful days.\\" Far more relevant to his current situation is \\"Courting Disaster,\\" where he pursues the divorced Lydia Ketterer, a woman who survived the sexual abuse of her father and an emotional breakdown. It is just such neediness in women that grips Peter; despite her singular unattractiveness, the leading character, Nathan Zuckerman, in this story cannot escape her hold. Nathan even appeals to the reader, questioning the plausibility that he is in this predicament.Most important to understanding the full range of Peter's mental torment, even ranging back to the possibility that his ideal childhood actually had cracks now having an impact, is his five-year-long association with psychoanalyst Dr. Spielvogel. The contradictions in his life are repeatedly discussed at length, revolving mostly around his attraction to flawed women, his inability to cut his losses and leave, and his fear that abandonment may cause irreparable harm. It is at times a contentious battle: Peter either rejecting or accepting the doctor's suggestions and analysis.In some respects the book is repetitious, the two short stories covering similar ground to the main story, although there are some subtle differences. The multi-page letters written to and by Peter get a bit long, but overall the book is filled with sharp, emotional dialog that holds the interest. At times the book is almost comedic in the excesses of speech and actions. The book is very much male- and Peter-centric as it treats his desire for some sort of simplistic perfectionism and his subsequent torment when that does not occur sympathetically. Generally, the author, in this story, holds women to be useful as sexual objects and problematic beyond that. Yet counter points do slip in. Zuckerman recognizes many years down the road the \\"character, intelligence, and imagination in the bounteousness of [Sharon's] sexuality,\\" and the \\"balance she managed to maintain between a bold and vivacious animality and a tender, compliant nature.\\" \\"It was in that tension, rather than in the sexuality alone, that her appeal resided.\\" In the end, it seems like Peter is the flawed soul, unable to fully grasp the sexual and intellectual complexity of the female persona."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"This novel is in two parts: the first consists of two stories about Nathan Zuckerman, his loves and his marriage to Lydia, which ends with her suicide; the second is about Peter Tarnapol and his disastrous marriage to vampire-like Maureen. Both sections are \\"written\\" by Tarnapol (the first as \\"fiction\\" the second as \\"autobiography\\"), and part of what Roth is exploring in this novel is the boundary between an author's real life and his fictions. Can an author learn things about the life he's actually living from the fiction he creates? It seems in this case, at least, Tarnapol learns very little, probably because his fictions are too closely parallel to his reality. Tarnapol has entered into a relationship and then married Maureen thinking he is going to \\"save\\" her from her calamitous past (two destructive marriages) only to realize that he has become her victim. How many writers can be both venomous and hilarious at the same time the way Roth is? And he is at his best in this novel. With almost every novel since GOODBYE, COLUMBUS Roth had become better and better at his craft; MY LIFE AS A MAN was his best novel up to that point (1974). Excellent."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"'I could be his Muse, if only he'd let me.'- An entry from Maureen Tarnopol's diaryPeter Tarnopol has recently battled his way through a horrific marriage. As it stands, he still deals with his ex-wife, Maureen, as she fights for a greater amount of his weekly salary, of which she currently receives one hundred (1970s) American dollars from a total that is not much higher. Tarnopol, a writer who initially showed great promise but who, though he writes and writes and writes, seems unable to produce anything of any great quality, still suffers mentally from the three years he was married. He visits a psychiatrist, Dr Speilvogel, and has recently begun a new relationship with the astonishingly submissive Susan, who seems to exist purely to help Tarnopol through his rough times.He has written something, however. Two short stories, both dealing with Nathan Zuckerman, a character who shares roughly the same biography with Tarnopol, who himself shares a remarkable similarity to the real author, Philip Roth. This novel is the first that directly examines the relationship an author has with their writing and, through the thin disguise of Tarnopol, allows Roth to dissect and lay bare the horror and tragedy of his first marriage, to Margaret Martinson.Tarnopol's life parallels Roth's in ways that are so similar it is difficult to believe Roth's claim that he does not write about himself. Indeed, in other works it is clear that he has polished, altered, added to and changed the biography of himself from which he draws his fiction - as do many authors. But in this novel, the key elements of each man's life are too similar, too identical for this to be anything but a confession disguised as a, well, a confession.Peter Tarnopol is a charming, intelligent, witty man who has had remarkably difficulty in escaping the clutches of his wife Maureen, for all that they are separated. Initially successful as an academic and then as an author, the reader is introduced to little scenes and examinations of Tarnopol's life before he fell under the sway of Maureen. In these Tarnopol was confident, clear in his path through life, and manifestly devoted to literature. We learn his daily schedule, his ideas on writing and reading, his hopes for a future that extends infinitely with repeated days that are very much the same as before. There is, of course, a rub: '...at twenty-five, for all my dedication to the art of fiction, for all the discipline and seriousness (and awe) with which I approached the Flaubertian vocation, I still wanted my life to be somewhat original, and if not violent, at least interesting, when the day's work was done.' And there is his downfall. Tarnopol's methodical, orderly life is shattered by the addition of someone who is not orderly, who will not allow themselves to become trapped into the compartmentalised structure that is Tarnpol's life.And who can blame Maureen? It is of course important to remember, as it is with any story recounting a divorce, that the person telling the tale is somewhat biased. For all their good intentions - and it seems that Tarnopol does not have good intentions so much as he wants to rid himself of the difficulty of his late twenties life through the cleansing burn of cathartic revelation - the divorcee, the divorcee, the separated, the broken-hearted - their story is tainted by a desire to show themselves in a better light than the other person, whomever they may be. It is to the credit of Tarnopol, however, that in his confession he does not stray from revealing the negatives of his own personality, though one of course must wonder if this is what he did reveal, what behaviour did he leave to rot in the dark corners of the relationship?There is a sense that what Tarnopol wants is not life but literature. Flaubert and Tolstoy are referred to most often, with plenty of other authors scattered throughout. Tarnopol is a writer in the sense that he cannot seem to allow himself fully into the world of the non-writers. He is bewildered, bemused, confused, destroyed, caught up in and thrown about by life, when all he wants to do - professes to do - is write. Then write, Tarnopol! Yet it is of course the inexorable pull of 'reality', the 'real life' that everyone else seems to have, that draws him from this shell of literature-as-everything to life-as-something, even if his life turns out wrong.It goes without saying that if the character of Tarnopol is not liked, then the novel will not be enjoyable. Indeed, there is nothing to this novel without Tarnopol. This novel is Tarnopol, in every sense of the term. This is the greatest strength of the work if Tarnopol's charm is received well, but if the reader finds him insufferable, then the novel fails. The plot is slim, and is written with a jumping back and forth style that sometimes comes across as overly complicated. As is often the case with Roth's work, if the story was told in a strictly chronological order it would be a) Not a Roth novel and b) Not particularly interesting.As mentioned, Roth's own life parallels - or more accurately, Tarnopol's created life parallels Roth - the difficulties experienced within the novel. Both Maureen Tarnopol and Margaret Martinson purchased urine from a pregnant black woman to trick their partner into staying with them by faking a pregnancy test. Both Maureen and Margaret died in car accidents. Is this important to the enjoyment of the novel? No, it is not. But it is important in the sense that from great tragedy a writer - in every sense of the Flaubertian term - can emerge. Roth - and, we presume, Tarnopol - managed to rise from the ashes of a disastrous relationship to continue the pursuit of literature. Lucky for us."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"Much of Roth's later obsession with the boundaries between fiction and fact are evident in this book. FIrst we read two short stories--one funny, one more bitter, but both dark. Then we learn the two short stories are those of a struggling author who has fallen into the depths of depression after a difficult relationship. OF course the narrator pulls no punches--he is a hater of women, though I'm not sure that we are meant to take his view of the world as a given. Clearly he is messed up--even his psychologist thinks so, though the books also bashes the idea that a psychoanalyst is an impartial judge. This is fascinating, at times disturbing stuff, but well worth it. And I still love my wife."},{"Title":"My Life as a Man","review":"Philip Roth is a great comic writer. At his best he is one of the funniest writers who has ever written. This work too has many wonderful passages, and brilliant dialogues. It is filled with 'good parts' which seem at the highest level of comic writing. But Roth is also obsessed by his own obsessions and this book tells the same story three times.The opening story is to my mind the best telling of all. And the book as I read it became especially repetitive in its last long account of Tarnapol's imprisoning marriage.Roth does a lot of post- modern trickery in this work, with one fictional writer writing about another, and with characters from Salinger giving us Salingerlike prose in their opinions of Tarnapol's work. I somehow find all these tricks irrelevant and useless.The book is structurally flawed and its redemption is not in all its games of perspective, but rather in that lively language which makes Roth when he is good the best comic writer of all."},{"Title":"Latin for the Illiterati: Exorcizing the Ghosts of a Dead Language","review":"This is a book which might well bore the serious student of Latin for whom it was not written.

This overview is followed by a review of the criticism from more \\"established\\" schools of thought (i.e., feminism and the social sciences). This collection does not seek to rectify the critiques of those fields with Queer Theory; it simply draws attention to the current critiques. Corber and Valocchi offer these criticisms a basis for critical examination of their texts that the reader-- even a Queer Theory novice-- can then apply to the texts held within _Queer Studies_.This collection is clearly designed to give classrooms a single text to work from when teaching queer studies. While a more advanced understanding of Queer Theory would require reading some of its founding works (e.g., Michel Foucault's _History of Sexuality Volume 1_, Judith P. Butler's _Gender Trouble_, Michael Warner's _The Trouble With Normal_, and etc.) this collection is helpful for the new student of queer theory._Queer Studies_ manages to be queer from cover to cover and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a broad overview of the field of Queer Theory."},{"Title":"Life with an Idiot","review":"This book was published in 2004 and contained 18 short stories. The translator's introduction said that they were written between 1978 and 1990 and 14 of them had been published in the USSR in 1991. Before that, a number had circulated there privately, since the author was unable to publish through official channels between 1979 and 1988.For this reader, the most powerful story by far was \\"The Parakeet,\\" in which a sadistic official justified to a father what had happened to his son, in the style of Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor, updated for the modern age. I'd encountered this work in an earlier anthology -- once read, it's not easy to forget -- and was looking in this collection for stories with the same impact.Unfortunately, for me nothing here matched the power of that story. A few pieces had some interest for the way they went all out to shock the reader (an automobile drive through pedestrians in \\"Three Meetings,\\" a mother seducing her son and worse in \\"Mother\\"). A few were interesting for other things (a drive around the countryside and insight into people's gullibility in \\"S--t-Sucker,\\" the depiction of a fearful intellectual realizing that any denunciation was permitted in \\"Boldino Autumn\\").For the rest, I couldn't penetrate the baffling narratives or forest of historical and literary allusions -- the 20 pages of endnotes by the translator didn't help much. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to agree with Vladimir Sorokin that \\"Life with an Idiot,\\" the first story in the collection, was the best short story of the 20th century.The introduction helped in understanding roughly where Erofeyev was coming from -- his rage at Soviet-era conformity and determination to shatter all boundaries by focusing on the grotesque, combined with much reading in Russian philosophy, history and literary anecdotes. Together with an interest in layers of parody and irony, types of discourse, and play with the Russian language, at which he was said to be adroit. Readers who like experimental writing -- of the type that appeared in Glasnost: An Anthology of Russian Literature under Gorbachev (1990) -- might enjoy this collection much more than I did. Those who're looking mainly for interesting narratives and characters -- like those that appeared in anthology The Wild Beach and Other Stories (1992) -- might be disappointed."},{"Title":"Life with an Idiot","review":"Add a few parts Franz Kafka, some Fyodor Dostoevsky, a few pinches of Luis-Ferdinand Celine, then a dash of Le Comte de Lautreamont and stir. Simmer while continuing to stir; never let cool, and voila! you get Victor Erofeyev's Life with an Idiot.These are tales told inside the author's head; it only happens to be that you are reading them. His words read like the thoughts inside the fragmented mental meanderings of a well read man who's been \`dragged through the mud' a few thousand times; they can fluctuate from formal, to slang, to nineteenth century, in a split blink of an eye; point of view, thought and dialogue sometimes blend and shift from sentence to sentence. (Truly shocking if one is too well oriented towards Dickens, but the reward of reading this tiny book is far, far from trivial.) It isn't to say that this book is surreal exactly, but I would consider it closer to a dream; if a caustic and violent, though hilarious, one. And just as one can reflect on a dream one can read this book and read it and read it and read it again and have different interpretations each re-read. The book also has the flavor of fables and/or fairy tales; the incredible -though all too real- imagery and scenes in the stories remind the reader of the brothers Grimm, but of course told from 1980's soviet Russia!But don't be fooled, the relevance of these stories to the contemporary human condition is not lost in the swashbuckling style of this word-slinger. As sited in the first paragraph, these antecedents of Erofeyev have paved the path for this new voice whose latter-day observations of this decaying world cannot do otherwise but reflect it.

Perhaps a dashing hero discovered them while escaping enemies? No. Real archaeologists spend countless hours researching information on a particular subject and only then does on-site excavation begin.This book is for those that want to know more. Brain Fagan takes a subject that many are interested in and actually puts it into perspective. Most people don't understand the numerous factors that are involoved in archaeology. The book provides a wonderful introduction to those willing to get their feet wet.I highly recommend this book to the armchair archaeologists that want to know more about the craft and science. This is a great pre-requisite to The Oxford Companion to Archaeology (a book edited by Fagan as well)."},{"Title":"Archaeology: A Brief Introduction (7th Edition)","review":"Brian Fagan is a lively writer with a clear enthusiasm for his profession., an enthusiasm that is in fact quite contagious. The scientific progression of archaeology has historically taken a somewhat circuitous course, with different theories and methods competing for the limelight. With this is mind, one can understand what a difficult task it would be to sum up this history, methodology and theory in one short book. Overall, Mr. Fagan has done an admirable job, and peppers the book with illustrative examples form prehistory. Nonetheless, there are some sections (particularly on archaeological theory) where I found myself reading and re-reading sentences trying to dissect exactly what he was trying to get at. I came away with a solid, though not complete, understanding of archaeologic fundamentals and the reality of archaeology -- and for a more complete picture, I will likely move on to longer, and more advanced, books."},{"Title":"Archaeology: A Brief Introduction (7th Edition)","review":"Got this book used for an exceptional price.

I've read most of the book in my spare time and have found it has really increased my scope of understanding. We had an orientation for the class about a week ago and our professor introduced us to what kind of work we would be doing with what kind of artifacts and at no time was I lost in technical jargon (there was lots) but would have been had I not read this book.

Bergel discovered that the head of the German Department and others were Nazi supporters who spread pro-Nazi propaganda (p.1). After Bergel refused to join them he was fired for \\"incompetence\\". The President and Trustees of Rutgers colluded in this decision. In 1940 this Department Head, Friedrich j. Hauptmann fled to Europe and became part of the Nazi propaganda machine (p.2). When this affair was reopened in 1985 after 50 years, the President of Rutgers refused to correct this injustice. So a committee was formed to investigate and report their findings (p.6).Chapter 2 tells of the political organization at Rutgers (p.8). There was little self-governance, it was like a petty kingdom. It gives the background of Hauptmann and Bergel: little in common but their nationality (p.12). The rise of Hitler gained attention in American and controversy (pp.14-15). Bergel, a Social Democrat, opposed defenders of Hitlerism; this led to enmity with Hauptmann. Professor Albert Holzmann, head of the Rutgers German Department, was the main supporter of Nazi Germany (p.17). A change in rules provided the objective criteria for subjective judgment (pp.18-19). The effects of the Great Depression was the reduction in students and government aid, and a surplus of teachers (fewer students). Bergel had the least service, and there were other factors (p.26). But Bergel believed that political bias was the sole explanation (p.30). \\"Diversity\\" (?) was practiced at Rutgers and elsewhere (p.35).Chapter 5 explains how student activists created \\"The Crisis\\" by drawing attention to Bergel's dismissal to the general public. The ACLU investigated (p.51). Student Alan Silver contacted Frederick Woltman of the \\"New York World Telegram\\". An academic conflict had created a political problem. Chapter 6 tells of the hearings that allowed each side to state their views. Hauptmann did not believe in \\"freedom to differ\\" (p.61). Students testified for Bergel, and for Hauptmann. Hauptmann compared Nazi anti-Semitism to US exclusion of Japanese (p.65). Bergel admitted he did not attend routine meetings (p.69), and his demeanor displeased the trustees (p.70). The report of the trustees blamed Bergel (pp.73-74).The criticisms of the trustees seem justified historically. But Bergel's supporters and allies didn't protest much (p.78). Chapter 7 has \\"The Aftermath\\". After Hauptmann disappeared in 1940, the College leaders kept it covered up (Chapter 8). Hauptmann returned to Germany by 1941 and worked for the Nazis in Slovakia. The war's end found him arrested in August 194, but later released and never prosecuted (p.106). Hauptmann died in 1978 (Chapter 9).The \`Epilogue' tells of the Interim Report that was publicized by the New Brunswick \\"Home News\\". Rutgers protected its prior decision, however it turned out. The authors compare the treatment of this story by journalists and by historians (p.112). But journalists have to produce a product every day for paying customers, historian are kept writers who do not face the same pressures. Neither Rutgers nor Bergel were totally in the right. But Clothier and Corwin weren't forthright and open (p.117)."},{"Title":"Michelin 1998 Ireland (Main Road Maps)","review":"Michelin maps were great for our trip!

Different anatomists and other scientists described the new species; however sometimes they were described more than once.Taxonomy is the discipline which attempts to assign one name to each species and so taxonomists need to know which was the FIRST original description to give the describer proper credit.Occasionally, an older description is found to be valid and species may be added or removed, so the list gets updated from time to time. The most current list is always available on my website.The Original Descriptions were the only part of my work on Translations of the names of the reptiles and amphibians of North America which were printed.

The author, Moses Coit Tyler, explains his motivations in his Preface.This is a long-since, out-of-print book that is certainly very much worth your read. Be aware at the onset, however, that history from this period can be saccharine, sometimes to the point of outlandishness. You will be pleasantly impressed with the detail and insight in the early chapters and maybe nonplussed with the author's hyper-adoration in his latter chapters.This author has a point to prove - that being that Governor Patrick Henry is one of the MOST laudable of the Founders. Most 21st century readers are willing to accept their heros bearing the blemishes of humanity: in the 19th century, heros were apparently acceptable only in saintly perfection. Tyler is probably correct in his high esteem for Governor Henry; but, the historian who begins his research with a point to prove, often ends as an author who has sacrificed impartiality, leaving readers unsure of where facts begin and end, or how to refine fact from hyperbole.Much of the appeal of the book is viewing history from a different chronological perspective, but as good as it is...don't let this be your only biography of Henry. You will find a very appealing Patrick Henry with a less mawkish delivery in Thomas S. Kidd's:Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots.-----kindle edition-----Well done, given the analogue to digital transfer process and the editing that goes with it.

Because in this book, there are many sparkling insights into the way that science is practised.It takes a while for Latour to get going as he is quite verbose in the early section, where he discusses his &quot;anthropological&quot; approach to science studies. However, after that, he makes a couple of points that as far as I know, he was the first philosopher of science to make.First, Latour demonstrates the intimate relationship between the publication of scientific papers, scientific prestige, laboratory finances and actual experiments. He makes the seemingly obvious, though not so when the book came out, that the possibility of experiments in a lab requires the influx of an amazing out of money. The acquisition of this research money takes up a large proportion of the time of the head honcho scientist in a laboratory .Second, Latour shows that entities in science are always defined by a network of properties that are experimentally determined. Scientific entities are hardly ever seen as objects with a few simple analytical properties. In fact, the more properties the better. And it doesn't matter if the mesh of properties is convoluted and seemingly contradictory. For each property concerned, there must be a vast array of material techniques to measure, control and manipulate that property. A new entity in science is accepted as real only when there are enough inter-locking properties to guarantee its existence. No method, by itself, is ever convincing.Latour points out that once an object is deemed to be real, scientists often invert the logic and argue that the reason why the combined set of experiments worked in the first place was that the object was in fact real. Whether this inversion of logic stands up to philosophical scrutiny - I do not know - but I have seen many practising scientists make this jump in logic. I've even used it myself. It is here that the &quot;realist&quot; and &quot;anti-realist&quot; debate rages. However, I think Latour reports it just as he sees it.Third, Latour carries out an analysis of scientific texts, which I have yet to see anywhere else. Scientific statments take on 5 modalities - from speculative hypothesis to proven statements to unspoken assumption. Latour gives a account of how the modalities of each statement are modified by how every other scientist in the field cites the statement in future scientific papers. They can ignore it, attack it as a useless hypothesis, bolster it by citing it as a supporting statement, adulate it by assuming that is a proven statement, and finally they just assume it's true. This scrutiny occurs continuously both inside the lab and in conferences.However, the difference between this process in the sciences as opposed to the humanities, is that these statements are often associated with machines that act in the material world. Proving a statement means that a material effect is generated.Using this method, Latour can analyse the fortunes of the scientists in a lab. And analysing the citations of scientific papers results in a reasonably good definition of scientific credibility. As a grad student in a biophysics lab, I've seen this happen - albeit on an intuitive level.Although Latour has since gone onto to more and more abstract studies, the beauty of Laboratory Life is that it is firmly grounded in the actual practises of an existing laboratory, the Guillemen Lab at the Salks Institute."},{"Title":"Laboratory Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts","review":"As a graduate student, I have gradually acknowledged the hidden rules of practicing sciences that, unfortunately, has never disclosed themselves during the regular programs. This book demistifies science and its practioners in the field using scientific methodology. This book becomes my favorite text at the expanse of T. Kuhn."},{"Title":"Laboratory Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts","review":"I give this book a high rating because of its influence in the field. It is the first case study of laboratory science ever published, and is often quoted in anthropology, sociology, and philosophy of science. The book's conclusion is social constructivist in nature, to a very extreme degree. Scientific facts are not discovered, they are constructed through social processes. The actual study was done by Latour, a French philosopher, and the method was to assume strangeness. That is, Latour pretended he didn't know anything about what the scientists were doing and tried to make up (construct) an account. The usual problems with relativism plague Latour and Woolgar's brand of social constructivism, most notably issues with reflexivity. If scientific accounts are constructed and do not have to do with the phenomena, why should we think that Laboratory Life tells us anything about the phenomena of laboratory science? Their answer is that we shouldn't. The only question in evaluating texts is, &quot;are you convinced?&quot; If not, fine. Come up with a better (more persuasive) account. People who think that science, philosophy, and academe in general should have something to do with the real world will be horribly frustrated by this conclusion. But everyone should be frustrated by the fact that the conclusion just doesn't follow from the data Latour gathered. It seems to come entirely from prior convictions of the authors. I recommend reading the book, however, because of its popularity and because it is a fantastic exemplar of a bad relativist and constructivist argument. Get the revised edition, which has a postscript and extra references. For a chuckle, look up some of the reviews (cited in the 2nd ed. references) from scientific journals. They are mostly cheerful recognitions of the book's subject matter (laboratory science) without any reference to--or argument with--the strong anti-realist claims. It makes you wonder if these people acctually read the book."},{"Title":"Laboratory Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts","review":"Latour's book &quot;Science in Action&quot; is more trendy... but I suggest you read this earlier book instead.

Every seminarian had to have a copy of this book when it was first published. It was and still is, in my opinion, the best presentation of interior workings of a Church Council. It is a light enjoyable read giving insights into the politics of the Council and introducing all the major characters, including Pope John XXIII. For the person who wants a brief introduction to the development of the various documents of the Council this book is an excellent start... A must read for those who want to see what happens behind the closed doors of an Ecumenical Council."},{"Title":"Vatican Council II","review":"This book is simply a classic, written by a man who was present in Rome throughout the council and had unparalleled connections. The liberal/conservative story of the Council, like it or not, is the true story of the Council, and Rynne was right that at the time the liberals won the day. Of course they did. Otherwise, how explain the strength of the later Curia-driven backlash and the restorationism that has afflicted the Church for the last 25 years? Subsequent attempts to present it differently skew the truth. This is the truth about the Council, even if it doesn't say the last word about its subsequent fortunes. And it is damn well written!"},{"Title":"Vatican Council II","review":"A shrewd, candid, wonderfully written insider's account of what actually happened at the Second Vatican Council, the decisive turning point in the history of modern Catholicism. The original version of these stories appeared as a series in \\"The New Yorker,\\" and brought smiles to the faces and hope to the hearts of thoughtful Catholics all over the country and beyond. The desperate, dishonest, and sneering comments by industrious Catholic rightists, still huffing and puffing about the 1960s, the decade of Vatican II, the Civil Rights movement, the Catholic Peace movement, the efforts to re-energize movements to care about poor people, to secure the rights of women, and to take responsibility for the endangered natural environment, tell you all you will ever need to know about their version of Jesus' \\"Love one another....\\" This particular sect of reactionary Catholics has been spewing contempt on democratic values since the late 18th century, while cozzying up to a long line of corrupt aristocrats, fascists, megalomaniacs, and cynical thugs. Being honest about history is the path with heart for Catholics today. Just telling the truth will re-activate the long-stalled renewal of our church. Trust Paul Lakeland, a distinguished Catholic theologian, and trust what the Holy Spirit is accomplishing even in these sad and painful times. And meanwhile--enjoy this terrific, heartening book."},{"Title":"Vatican Council II","review":"Rynne offered the world a liberal fantasy of what 'the spirit of the Council' was all about. Acording to him, the council was pastoral, but not dogmatic. How then to explain those dogmatic constitutions on the church and on relevation, with all those troublesome endorsements of Trent and Vatican I? According to him, the council was about openess, freedom, and tolerance. But the Council's claim of the Catholic Church to be the true Church founded by Christ and of the duty for all Catholics to assent to the teaching of the magisterium on faith and morals somehow gets lost.The book has interest as a relic of mid '60's liberal dreams. But for those of us who have given up our love beads and our sandalwood incense, it's all a bit embarrassing.For a better take on the Council, read Wiltgen's The Rhine Flows into the Tiber."},{"Title":"Vatican Council II","review":"I got a copy Xavier Rynne book that non-catholic friend picked up at a Garage sale for around $ .50. Established Church doctrine is criticized in a variety places throughout this post-modern text, including the Petrine text.Thats about what it is worth.

Vater Rynne confuses what the Council actually said with what he wished it had said.For a better grip on the Council, read John Paul II, one of the great heroes and interpreters of the real Council."},{"Title":"Tales of Love & Loss","review":"My understanding from the forward to \\"Tales of Love and Loss\\" is that Hamsun was primarily a novelist who \\"played around with\\" the short story early in his career. He apparently lost interest in the style because his mid and later career shunned the short story. Too bad because \\"Tales of Love and Loss\\" proves that he was adept at it.The 20 stories in this collection are all sketches of different personalities in different settings. From Norway to the New World and then back to the Old, we encounter a variety of characters. We meet an unsuccessful lecturer, a man with a talent for spending other people's money, a man in the midst of the Paris uprising, a father who sets out to teach his wayward son a lesson about gambling, a woman who knew how to out-fox her scheming husband, a prairie cook who got even in the cruelest of ways, a woman whose life was changed forever by an otherwise forgettable event, and many others.I got a kick traveling over the Mayan countryside in Yucatan while reading a Norwegian writer tell a tale that took place in my home state of North Dakota. Hamsun shows some of his gift for the bizarre side of the human psyche but most of the stories seem to be people and events he knew or stories he heard first hand.I have read 8 novels of Hamsun and have looked forward to reading more. However, I had come to near the end of the rope of those available in English. (If I had known about Hamsun when I was in college, I wouldn't have dropped Norwegian after one semester). Two years ago or so I couldn't find any books by Hamsun that I didn't already have. He apparently is undergoing a rebirth of popularity because there seemed to be more books available now than I thought he had written. Many will cite \\"Hunger\\" or \\"Mysteries\\" as his best but my favorite is still \\"Growth of the Soil\\". I'm looking forward to aquiring some of these new releases while they last. If I'm not mistaken, there should be one more collection of short stories out there. After reading \\"Tales of Love and Loss\\", my appetite is whet."},{"Title":"Tales of Love & Loss","review":"This is a selection of twenty stories, taken from Hamsun's three published volumes of short stories (Siesta, Brushwood, and Striving Life). In the introduction, the editor comments that \\"the short stories provide a fascinating glimpse of an author shedding one literary skin to reveal another\\". And, indeed, the diversity of style is one of the most interesting things about the collection. From relatively straightforward ghost stories to the dark humor of \\"A Lecture Tour\\", Tales of Love and Loss paint a picture of an author with a wide variety of skills and interest.Hamsun train spotters will notice character and plot linkages between these stories and several of the novels. In general, even though I really enjoyed the volume I am not sure that it is where I would begin with Hamsun. He was primarily a novelist, and as good as these stories are I have to think that they are to some degree benefiting from the reflected light of his greater works."},{"Title":"Tales of Love & Loss","review":"Anyone who is a fan of Hamsun's two most highly-regarded novels ('Hunger' and 'Mysteries') will feel blessed should they stumble upon this not-so-well-known collection of stories. Hamsun is at his best in these timeless tales that carve out a place for Hamsun along with Franz Kafka, Dostoyevsky, Ernest Hemingway, Roman Payne, Sam North, Edgar Poe, et al. as a master of the short story."},{"Title":"Tales of Love & Loss","review":"Having read all of the Hamsun novels available in English translations, this collection of short stories was, for me, like the last course at the end of a fine meal. There is a bit of the Hamsun that admirers already know from the novels, but also includes further insight into the author's life in late 19th and early 20th century America.

As I began reading and realized that the author was writing about all types of love (between lovers, parents, children, etc.), my instant reaction was that this book isn't what I initially anticipated. I was so impressed with the author's willingness to bare her soul and allow herself to be vulnerable - she shared what were undoubtedly real experiences.I live in New York and was reading the book on the Subway. When I looked up while flipping from one page to the next I noticed that the person standing beside me was reading over my shoulder - as we looked at each other after reading the page, we both said \\"WOW!\\"The \\"Pain of Loving\\" draws you in and opens your mind to experiences you may have never had. The beauty is that after reading the book you feel as if you know someone who's gone through these things. The depth of my compassion has been broadened as a result of reading Brenda Lee Mason's book and I am so grateful that she was brave enough to write it and share a bit of herself with us all."},{"Title":"The Pain of Loving","review":"A great book with an enormous amount of emotion and truth to it.

It gives you a guided tour through video game history by looking at and discussing the art of many historic games. The book has lots and lots of color pictures from popular video games, and offers running commentary on their importantance. Also there are several brief interviews with artists that worked on some of these projects. They share some of their philosophies of character development. There is also some brief discussion about character development workflow.This book isn't so much instructional as it is inspirational. I don't think you can read (or skim) through this book without getting some new, fresh, ideas of characters for your own game."},{"Title":"The Art of Game Characters","review":"Unless you care to know about the history. There's not enough information or detail. Other books likeBasics of Game Designby Michael E. Moore,The Ultimate Guide to Video Game Writing and Designby Flint Dille and John Zuur Platten has more indepth on characters. Sure there's no pretty pictures of characters, but game guides or art books have them(plenty of them). Example:Art of the Mass Effect Universegives you the pictures of characters and their examples/concepts the process that they went through to get what they wanted.In other words, if you have money to spare and/or would like to know history, otherwise choose wisely on what you are looking for exactly, weather it be concepts(pictures) or descriptions.

Although some might complain that the book lacks real technical information (it does), there are some great pointers and \\"concept sketches-to-life\\" pics.

It is full of great photographs and descriptive text.This is a great book for a lay-person who may be interested in the martial arts because it explains the traditional philosophy of the martial arts and general principles that many schools have in common. This makes it a good place to begin learning about the martial arts in general.The textbook also includes tests at the end of each chapter so you can see what you learned and review some of the most important principles of that particular chapter.

He is recognized and never refuses a challenge. Our young reporter is now the story and not only fights against crimes and thuggery, but is also defatigable. Snowy is cute and smart, but has little luck unless it is with saving Tintin's life. The antagonists are completely off-putting and make the reader cheer once defeated. Thomson and Thompson are here, as is Doctor Mueller who is to return into Tintin's adventures in the future.The Black Island has some funny language and translation - and no not referring to the 'Scottish' - stirring drawings and is the first of the edition and series to come with the band on top featuring the mugs of the heroes. By now the series has really hits its stride and one looks forward toKing Ottokar's Sceptre (The Adventures of Tintin)."},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"Herge, The Black Island (Methuen, 1938)One of Tintin's earlier adventures, The Black Island takes place in the British Isles. Tintin and Snowy are after a gang of forgers whilst pursued by their fairweather friends Thomson and Thompson, who have been assigned to the case (which has, of course, been pinned on Tintin).As it's one of the early books, this is pretty straightforward stuff, though Herge here began showing the depth that would make Tintin such an enduring figure later in the series, weaving the side jokes and comic relief into the plot itself.

Sadly, I came away disappointed.The plot is simply bad. While Tintin is well-known for his intelligent sleuthing, this entire book revolves around luck and circumstance.This is not an adequate example of the caliber material we Tintin fans expect."},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"I've long considered this my favourite Tintin book, although I must admit that I'm not entirely sure the reason for this. The original appeared in 1937, but it was redrawn in both 1943 and 1966, which might explain the very excellent detail; this was the only book Herge redrew more than once, and if you consider the most recent version it was actually his third-last publication (followed only by Flight 714 in 1968 and Tintin and the Picaros in 1976). Notably, it was also the first appearance of Dr JW M&uuml;ller, who later has a major role in Land of Black Gold, and a very small role as the local military buffoon \\"Mull Pasha\\" in The Red Sea Sharks. Although the high quality of the artwork makes it look like a recent Tintin adventure, the absence of Captain Haddock and Cuthbert Calculus, as well as the unfriendliness of Thomson and Thompson towards Tintin, colour it as an earlier episode that would have appeared around the time of Cigars of the Pharaoh when Thomson and Thompson were not sure whether Tintin was friend or foe; nonetheless, the \\"Tintin on his own\\" gives the feel of a clean, unhindered story (i.e. no unnecessary comic relief from Captain Haddock hitting himself on the head, etc.).In \\"The Black Island\\", Tintin steps into action on page one when he is shot by the crew of a downed aircraft who turn out to be smugglers; by page three he has already been framed and is the quarry of detectives Thomson and Thompson. He chases his attackers, and comes across Dr JW Muller, who considers him a threat and is ready to have him killed. There are great action sequences as Tintin and M&uuml;ller fight, a fire breaks out, the inept local fire brigade can't find the key to open the garage door, and then M&uuml;ller is implicated trying to prevent the fire being put out at his own house (because he wants Tintin to burn inside). Great action sequences follow, including a crazy train chase (another one), an escapade with a tanker of Loch Lomond whisky (hello, Snowy, you lush), a foggy flight to Scotland, and a proper exploration of The Black Island where Tintin meets... Ranko!"},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"Belgian artist Herge wrote \\"The Black Island\\", featuring his cartoon hero Tintin, a young journalist and adventurer, in the 1930's, then refurbished the artwork in the 1950's. The result is a classic mystery of the pre-Captain Haddock days that will be appreciated by Tintin fans.The story opens, shockingly, with Tintin's near fatal encounter with two men and an unregistered plane on a country field. As the two bumbling detectives Thomson and Thompson explain to the recovering Tintin, the whole thing is pretty fishy. Tintin and his faithful dog Snowy take up the case, identifying a gang of forgers and tracking them across the English Channel, through the English countryside, and ultimately to their lair on a remote island in Scotland. The sequence in Scotland features lots of Scottish dialect by men in kilts, and includes an unexpected encounter in a half-ruined castle with a real monster.\\"The Black Island\\" introduces Dr. Muller, a nasty Germanic villain who will make a return appearance in a later adventure. The story itself sets the pattern of the Tintin adventures, as Tintin's amateur sleuthing draws him into one exotic sequence of danger after another, broken up by the periodic touch of humor. \\"The Black Island\\" is very highly recommended to Tintin fans of all ages."},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"My reviews for this series will be useless - I was a huge childhood fan"},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"\\"The Black Island\\" is a pretty exciting Tintin adventure, set in and around Britain, and the first to feature one of Tintin's better known enemies, Dr Muller.While Tintin and his dog Snowy are on a walk, a he spots a plane that looks like it's in a bit of trouble. Tintin goes to see if they need help, but is shot on the spot. He is sent to hospital, but luckily only has a grazed rib. While in hospital, he hears that a similar plane has crashed up in England.

He is framed, he's arrested, he's pursued by Thompson and Thomson (who are usually his friends) he's caught in a burning building. Will he find his attackers and discover what they are up to? Will he survive the beast of the Black Island?It's a pretty simple adventure, though it's full of action sequences, mainly chases, which are pretty engaging for a comic strip.

Here, the Belgian reporter crosses the English channel and fights money counterfeiters first in England and then in Scotland, where he sports a Scottish kilt. Much of the action happens across what is shown to be a quaint English countryside. Part of the plot, at least, seems to be aped from Alfred Hitchcock's then popular movie The Thirty Nine Steps. Famously (for Tintin fans, at least) the album was redrawn in the mid 60s, at the request of the English publishers, who considered its description of Great Britain to be factually incorrect. There is not much difference between the two versions, in fact, except that 30s era cars become 60s era cars, in the second version, which is the widely available today (the 30s version was never colorized, to my knowledge). Muller, a villain who would later appear in later albums, first appears here. The Black Island also marks the first appearence in the series of a TV set, more than a decade before it became a common household item in Europe."},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"this book was full of action and good quality, however it gets dreary and boring at some points.i think this would be a good book for beginners."},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"\\"The Black Island\\" is one of the best in the Tintin series, with an appealing setting: first, a wide-open beautiful countryside with cottages and mansions, then a mysterious castle on an island. It introduces Dr. Muller, one of the better villains of the Tintin series. Herge's more interesting villains like Dr. Muller often were recurrent; we see him later in the Tintin series.\\"The Black Island\\" is the first of the series to be set in Tintin's broader home of Western Europe. It is set in Scotland; Tintin at one point wears a kilt. The lightness and beauty of the countryside also have a countervailing aura of darkness as Tintin is on the trail of counterfeiters. Although the Loch Ness Monster is not presented, something else is. A distinguishing factor, unusual for the Tintin series, is that the sea and boats take a back seat to the airplane.I am not sure about the timeline of Herge's art with respect to his drawings of Tintin in the earlier colored edition of \\"The Black Island.\\" But with this edition, Tintin as drawn by Herge has reached full development. Although still a boy, his body and head are bigger and rounded out, serving well to reflect the breadth of his a heroic soul, and his poise is now fully commanding. How he is drawn here is how he would be drawn going forward. But one thing that never really shows itself is a true personality. Tintin's personality is his actions, aplomb, and heroism.\\"The Black Island\\" also marks a watershed in Herge's ability to present a story with great transition and flow, in contrast to its choppy and disjointed predecessor, \\"The Broken Ear,\\" and some of the books before it. Everything moves neatly from panel to panel, with wit and humor, and at all times the reader is clear on what is going on. Herge's humor also achieves its long-lasting latter-day bite and imagination, contributing to the flow. Herge showed himself to be a master of slapstick from here onward -- it may have been slapstick, but it was always very witty and imaginative, often focusing on the irony of the spoken word preceding the event.I rate this book five stars not just because of the strong plot and excellent atmosphere, but because Snowy and the twin detectives, Thomson and Thompson, are in some of their funniest scenes (take a hint with what I said about airplanes). Snowy is also a hero, but in the most important case, the good results outweigh the nature of Snowy's actions behind them."},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"got this for my son for xmas. he really enjoys reading it. and im glad he likes it too. its easy reading. great thing to buy if your wanting to encourage reading more."},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"got this for my son for xmas. he really enjoys reading it. and im glad he likes it too. its easy reading. great thing to buy if your wanting to encourage reading more."},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"We have been reading the TinTin books to my grandson since he was three (he is now five).

Amazon's prices on new paperbacks are better than Powell's."},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"'The Black Island' is a major return to form after 'The Broken Ear', and one of my very favourite Tintin adventures. Set in England and Scotland, Herge utilises a very British whimsy and deadpan surrealism to chart the the young reporter's Richard Hannay-like hunt for a shady gang of forgers and fifth columnists (the adventure was serialised in 1937) - in fact the book's tone, mixing exciting mystery and bizarre humour anticipates that quintessentially English TV series, 'The Avengers'.Much of the book's pleasure lies in Herge's threading of visual motifs to pattern the story - the spluttering airplane that begins the adventure followed by a doomed cat and mouse chase between hero and villains, leading to the Thom(p)sons comandeering a mechanic as pilot even though he doesn't know how to fly, and hilariously hijacking a prestigious aerial show; or the reappearances of striking black against the appropriately muted English colours, from hapless detectives the Thom(p)sons, to the equally hapless firemen, to the haunted Black Island itself, a craggy rock crowned by a crumbling castle (whose passages and portals will delight amateur Freudians) with ominously black birds spiralling out of it, to the berserk monster who gaurds it, to the policemen who attempt to rescue Tintin.One extraordinary conceit displays Herge's masterful method of imperceptibly furthering the plot by seemingly digressive comedy, as Snowy's forlorn attempts to eat a found bone and drink leaking whisky reveal elements of the uncanny mystery. Another subplot, involving firemen who mislay the keys to the station during an emergency, and then have to chase a magpie to retrieve them, is pure Surrealism in the style of Rene Clair or (later on) Monty Python. Other jokes rework old favourites from silent cinema. The recreation of English villages and countryside, and the pub-sodden ghost-lore of Scotland, surpasses even TV's 'Ripping Yarns', while the furniture in this 60s reworking is to die for.Fundamental to the pleasure of the Tintin adventures is Herge's intimate knowledge of the way dogs behave - their loyalty diverted by appetite; their happiness; their need for reassurance and sleep; the bad-temper when faced with giants and terror of creepy crawlies. Rereading these adventures with two girls of my own has added untold pleasure to these books."},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"The Black Island is perhaps the greatest Tintin adventure.

The landscape scenes around Tintin are superb. The drawing is great, and the plot, sublime. The suspense is incredible, too. No one will take him to the Black Island. Even though everyone is scared out of their minds, Tintin decides to go, risking everything...There is something special about this adventure I can't really describe. A feeling I can't put into words...I love all the others passionately, but this one in particular, is perhaps my favorite among my favorites..."},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"I prefer books like this that are not full of blood, guts, tortured darkness, sex, etc. I mean I look forward to handing down my comics/sharing my comics with my son. I don't buy books that lean on those cheap tricks to tell their story. A good writer can build suspense and action and adventure without devoting 10 panels straight of fighting. I was desensitized to that stuff I saw so much of it in movies and books for awhile, and I am happier having trimmed it out of my life to a great extent. Now I seek items like this book that can tell a great story without grossing me out.Having said that this book is good clean adventure. It goes to a great locale in Scotalnd, and the artist does a fine job of giving you some flavor of the region. He does great with the accents too. Now Tintin gets shot, but it is a minor scene without blood, like the old west shows. This is a most enjoyable adventure.Now at times the dialog goes from full and interesting to too simple (jarringly so) as if the writer had worked on it on different timeperiods, and sometimes does not seem fluid. But that makes me wonder how much is just lost in the translation from the original French language. TinTin races or maybe rushes from one mini-adventure into the next at a breathtaking pace that does not always allow for the characters motivations to be explained and so some stereotyping does occur. The thought ballons of the dog are not neccesary and cheapen the story, to my view.Even with these minor complaints this is a fun book. Reading it maeks you feel as if you have stumbled onto secret treasure since these books are notnpart of the American mainstream. The art is great, and the locales, even the costumes are obviously researched with a very period sense. The castle is very well drawn and the draftsmanship of buildings, vehicles, and landscapes are superb. This softcover edition has great paper, strong cover material, good binding, and very nice color job in inking.While I think that the story development/plotlines and dialog work of comic book artist/writer Carl Barks is superior, I really enjoyed this book.I understand that of the 20 plus Tintin books, there are some real jewels. This book was enough to hook my interest.I look forward to reading the rest."},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"The black Island is probably one of the best comicbooks ever drawn, adding a fine pencil to a well told story.

However, \\"The Black Island\\" is certainly the epitome of this type of Tintin adventure. Herg&eacute; really pours it on pretty much from start to finish. This might be slapstick but it is nonstop slapstick from Tintin trying to stop the Thom(p)sons from arresting him to Snowy getting the better of a gorilla (but not a spider). Tintin might end up unconscious more often in this story than all of his other adventures combined. The beginning is simple enough. Tintin sees a plane land with engine trouble. Noticing it is an unregistered plane he offers to help and is immediately shot (do not worry, the bullet only grazes his ribs). Of course Tintin wants to get to the bottom of this mystery but it is hard to collect clues when people are trying to kill you and you have no clue why.As you can tell from the cover illustration of \\"The Black Island\\" Tintin gets to wear a kilt, not to mention a bonnie bonnet as the titular piece of property happens to be in Scotland. This raises a big question for me: How do you do a Scottish accent in French (or Spanish or German or any other language into which the Adventures of Tintin have been translated)? Ye can nae tell me it be an easy bit of business tae do, laddie. This might not be the best Tintin adventure and there are certainly funnier sequences to be found down the road, but all things considered \\"The Black Island\\" has got to be the funniest of Herg&eacute; stories."},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"The Black Island is the seventh story in the Adventures of Tintin series, and one of the most beautiful to look at. It differs greatly in appearance from its immediate predecessor, The Broken Ear, bearing much more of a resemblance to the later tales. This is due to Herge's redoing the artwork and story long after its original incarnation (as a serial in the French children's magazine, Le Petit Vingtieme).The story is frought with peril as is the case with the vast majority of Tintin adventures, but in this case it is not as interesting as the beautiful artwork (particularly in the case of the island scenes themselves - breathtaking! Look at the detail in those rocks). The Black Island is also noteworthy in that it introduces the character of the villainous Doctor Muller, who appears again in two later stories, The Land of Black Gold (under the alias Professor Smith) and The Red Sea Sharks (there calling himself Mull Pasha, but playing a smaller role).The Black Island occurs chronologically several tales before the entrance into the series of several of the most important characters (Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, Bianca Castafiore, etc.), so we encounter here a much smaller cast: Tintin, Snowy, and the Thompson twins are the only prominent characters.L'ile Noire (its title in French, of course) is a beautifully composed book which is a must-have for any Tintin fan and worth at least one read-through by everyone else."},{"Title":"The Black Island (Adventures of Tintin)","review":"This book is very well written and the drawings are excellent.

He has good reason to make the journey, having witnessed an unmarked plane landing in a nearby field while out for a walk and, by the end of page one Tintin is shot by the pilot as he goes to investigate. Recovering in hospital, he learns from Thompson and Thomson that the same plane has been reported crash-landing in Sussex, and Tintin accordingly sets out with Snowy to get to the bottom of the mystery.Like many of Tintin's earliest adventures, the ones initially serialised in the Petit Vingti&egrave;me in the late 1920s and 1930s, the story takes the form of a linear line, with a rolling series of events taking Tintin from one place to the next, getting involved in mishaps and picking up clues along the way. Reworked for colour album publication, the story in The Black Island still doesn't get any more complex than Tintin following a trail, being hampered by criminals trying to shake him off along the way - permanently if possible - with a bit more slapstick than usual (Tintin even knocking himself out by standing on a rake at one point). The pacing however is excellent, with twists and thrills on every page and lovely clear-line artwork that has a wonderful sense of openness and movement.Like all of Herg&eacute;'s Tintin work, the use of locations and the evocation of mood is superb. Although the book followed the usual route of publication for the early Tintin adventures, moving from a 128 page black-and-white strip to a redrawn and coloured 62-page book, Herg&eacute; went to the trouble of revising The Black Island again in 1965, prior to the book's first UK publication, sending an assistant to gather reference materials to ensure relevance and correct some basic errors in the previous editions. You could still criticise the sometimes clich&eacute;d olde-worlde mysticism and the fact that Tintin dons a kilt to better blend in with the locals, but the drawings in The Black Island are beautiful and they do capture an essence of Scotland in a manner that would fire the imagination of its young readers and still have resonance for some older Tintin fans."},{"Title":"Darwinism and other essays,: By John Fiske","review":"John Fiske was one of the most widely read historians and most thorough historical researchers of the late 19th Century. His historical work ties with the then-new concept of biological evolution because Fiske saw the same pattern of outside forces, combining to shape human history. He knew Charles Darwin personally, and traveled to England to meet Darwin and his colleagues. Darwin wrote that Fiske was one of the first Americans who understood his message.So, this book is an account from two perspectives: endorsement of the theory of evolution as an insight into nature, and expansion of that theory to account for changes in history.Some of Fiske's scientific notions are distinctively Nineteenth Century, and that provides some perspective and \\"local color\\" too. For anyone who wants to understand the intellectual revolution that was taking place in Europe and North America in the late Nineteenth Century, this book comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Bigger Secrets ~ More Than 125 Things They Prayed You'd Never Find Out","review":"You probably have not read my review of &quot;Big Secrets&quot;, so you have no idea of my absolute disdain for that work.

The thing I like best about them is Poundstone's own honesty--he doesn't keep any secrets of his own. He tells you exactly _how_ he found out what he found out.A Shriner may pledge that if he divulges the secrets of his order, he may incur &quot;the penalty of having my eyeballs pierced to the center with a three-edged blade.&quot; But Poundstone discovered a Masonic supply house (&quot;The Geo. Lauterer Corporation&quot;) that works by mail order and doesn't check ID, ordered a selection of titles, and tells us all of the inside skinny on IAOM and Tubal-Cain.&quot;Big Secrets&quot; tells as much as Poundstone could find out about the secret formula for Coca-Cola and Kentucky Fried Chicken. It tells how the Rorschach test works and how to cheat on it. It tells several methods by which magicians saw a woman in two (you see, one of them is patented, so if you write the patent office and ask for patent #1,458,575...)&quot;Bigger Secrets&quot; is equally good, maybe better. I think my favorite is his description of what the Rosicrucians are really like, but his explanation of how David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty Vanish and his analysis of backward and &quot;subliminal&quot; messages in records and movies are also excellent."},{"Title":"Bigger Secrets ~ More Than 125 Things They Prayed You'd Never Find Out","review":"Bigger Secrets, the best of Poundstone's Secrets trilogy, solves the mysteries behind everything from the ingredients in heavily-guarded recipes tobackwards masking in records.

If the human being is doomed to fallibility, perhaps we might learn &quot;how to love amid the encroachments,&quot; as Dunn suggests in his uniquely poignant plainspokenness.But if, after so many books of thwarted longing, Dunn's observations on &quot;how boring sorrows are&quot; is not enough of a refreshment to his seasoned readers, then the playful, imaginative and engaging section of poems in which he escorts a cadre of famous authors through the landscape of his Native New Jersey serves as a remarkable new dimension to Dunn's distinctive and persistent voice.&quot;Because the famous usually have little to say/to each other after the first paeans of praise,&quot; Dunn explains, &quot;the poet thought that for their own sakes/he'd have them live in separate towns.&quot; Pivoting off of this introductory poem, Dunn leaps into a succession of poems with titles such as &quot;Chekhov in Port Republic,&quot; &quot;Charlotte Bronte in Leeds Point,&quot; &quot;George Eliot in Beach Haven,&quot; and &quot;Twain in Atlantic City.&quot;With his imagination tuned to a fever pitch, these particular poems read like short stories in verse, brimful of ideas, wit and confidence, guaranteeing the well-versed reader's pleasure. &quot;Occasionally the weak survive/because the god that doesn't exist/wants to give us something to misinterpret/That's what Crane was thinking as he washed up on Longport Beach,&quot; Dunn narrates in &quot;Stephen Crane in Longport.&quot;While Dunn's playfulness here is more indicative of the work of Billy Collins or Deborah Garrison, still his voice maintains its gravity and cunning as he delves beneath the hearts of his subjects, revealing the alienation that burdened the young, brilliant Stephen Crane: &quot;It's pointless, Crane wanted to say/wherever you're all going/but he knew they'd think he was lying/or maybe not even hear him.&quot;Though a familiar tinge of helplessness enervates the book's tendency towards an awareness of the world's smaller, more manageable delights, it does not overwhelm or sour Dunn's attempt to emerge from the smolder and ruin of Different Hours. Local Visitations is likely one of Dunn's boldest and brightest books, suggesting that the resignation pervading Different Hours is only a temporary waiting room for those whose eyes are fixed on that &quot;meaningful task waiting to be found.&quot;"},{"Title":"Local Visitations: Poems","review":"Local Visitations is a selection of free-verse poetry by Pulitzer prize-winner Stephen Dunn. Elegant and brief, these poems study the foibles of heroes who are only human.

There's not one/who doesn't sleep with an eye open.//Our of necessity the small have banded/with the large, the large with the large/of different species. When dark comes/they form an enormous circle.//It's all, after years of night-whispers/and long-range cries, coming together.//To make a new world the American animals/know there must be sacrifices.

(Of course, it's a bit dated now; the authors thought the Katyn massacre was at the hands of the Germans when in fact the Soviets did it and framed the Germans.) I felt obliged to read every name. Someone has got to remember these people.The list is only half the book, though. The other half is about the state of medicine in Poland during the war, and what efforts were made to keep people healthy in spite of the atmosphere. Given the situation, the doctors' dedication to their patients was amazing. I learned a lot from this book and wish there were more like it, to tell everyone's story."},{"Title":"Out of the Tempest","review":"This was a wonderful read.

It is such an inspirational story that has touched me in so many ways.

There is an inevitable tendency to look at the religious perspective, focusing acutely on the human sacrifice and also on the Spanish conquest but the author shifts away (whilst having an opinion on the role of the victim) from these well-trodden paths to discussing the greater mores and individual experiences of the society.There is an extremely interesting chapter discussing the roles of wives, in particular the ascribing of fertility and maternal aspects and the circumscribing of any 'political' role. This, in turn, leads to a further discussion on the role of the mother and the 'growing' eidetism that permeates cultural perception.The text concludes with a brief chapter on the final destruction of Tenochitlan rounding off a work that brilliantly analyses Aztec ceremony and the individual's place within this society at the end of an Empire."},{"Title":"Aztecs","review":"There is really no other book quite like this on the subject. To get into it, you should have already read a book about everyday Aztec life (Soustelle or Bray for example), and have a basic knowledge of the Aztec gods, who Montezuma II was, and about the Spanish conquest. If you now know the basic facts, Clendinnen's book will make the ancient city of Mexico come to life. She doesn't explain so much what the Aztecs did and said, but why. Human sacrifice, ceremonial cannibalism, a macabre pantheon- these alien aesthetics are given a human face. We begin to see the local young warrior carrying the same small-time glamor around his neighborhood as a high school quarterback. Refreshingly, as much ink is spilled over women and children as men. Certain insights of hers are unforgettable (e.g., unlike British boarding schools, Aztecs had no use for the gentlemanly loser, winning was all.) Her writing is above a high school level, but is generally clear and direct. If you know who Tezcatlipoca and Malinche are, you will love this book. If not, come back to it when you do, to take it to the next level."},{"Title":"Aztecs","review":"A lot of books are available about Precolumbian civilizations, especially mesoamerican; Aztecs and Mayas are the most learned of all. BUT, we read always the same informations for a long time. Inga CLENDINNEN gives us &quot;An Interpretation&quot; : what kind of civilization has rizen on the plateau of Mexico-Tenochtitlan ? How to explain Aztecs's power in a region where so many people had developped cities and values such as Olmecs (in TEOTIHUACAN) or Toltecs (in TULA) ? We discover first the City and its meaning. Then, we enter the mentality of the peoples who entertain LIFE by their Death (the Victims), their Work (Warriors, Priests, Merchant) or their personal place in the society (Males, Wives, Mothers). Third, we enter the Sacred and we begin to understand how the Rituals may consolidate the society with the Fear of others... before being the plea of a revolt of vassal populations. AZTECS were strong by their military organization but weak by their believes : an entire world fearing the sun could not been able to born another day, organizing war to provide their temples with victims to their Gods, such a world had to find its limits. When the Spaniards came with their &quot;magic&quot;... Aztecs resist, but only two years. The Death of the Empire is to find in its structures self. The same, with other contexts, explains the fall of the Ancient Indian Worlds, facing the Spaniards, the French or the Englishmen. Understanding how to be strong meant to become weak, for Native Americans old civilizations, may permit the Renaissance of New Indian worlds; but here, I go beyond the Interpretation of the Author. The Book tells us how to enter in Aztecs Civilization Construction, as we visit an Architecture, a Mecanism...

She rebuffs their attempts at friendship until they finally stop offering it - leaving Carol as alone and unhappy as the cranky downstairs neighbor lady. When Carol's mother expresses concern that Carol has \\"no talent for friends\\", Carol is frightened. Could she, too, end up a friendless old nag like Miss Tyler? She is forced to face this question as she watches the neighborhood girls have fun together while no longer bothering to try to include her. Carol wishes for a second chance to make friends, but it doesn't seem likely, until an emergency forces her to stop putting herself first, and shows the other children that she is capable of caring about and giving to others.This is one of those \\"old fashioned\\" books (written around the 1950's!) that I inherited from my mother's elementary classroom library and grew up reading over and over.

An entry in her late sister's diary reveals the name of the man who fathered Jenna's niece. Does Jenna have the nerve to meet and check out the man, and to inform him he has a daughter? On the pretense of researching her latest mystery novel, she checks herself and Blair into the motel he owns. Even though Jenna thinks that Hank Logan has the right to know about his daughter, can he be the father that Blair needs, or will he reject her the same way he did her mother -- as the diary implies. Jenna hopes their month long stay at the motel will give her a chance to find out.Former cop Hank Logan wants nothing more than to renovate and run his motel. Since the tragic death of his fianc&eacute;e three years ago, he doesn't want any complications or commitments. When Jenna Stanton and her niece, Blair, check in, however, he gets just what he doesn't want -- complications by the bucketful. Jenna claims she's there to research a new mystery novel she's writing. After a while, Hank doesn't buy it, and neither does Blair, seeing as how Jenna doesn't travel too far away from the motel.Oh, what a tangled web we weave...Hank Logan is a tough nut to crack, one of Ms. Templeton's most &quot;alpha&quot; males to date, and she does a wonderful job with him. Jenna may have her own agenda, and Blair may not be her biological child, but Jenna is as protective as a mother bear with her cub where Blair's concerned. All three of these characters, as well as the well-developed secondary characters, create mischief and mayhem that combine to create a tender, poignant family tale. Hank Logan doesn't stand a chance against Jenna, Blair, and his family and friends as they try to break down the wall around his heart.Karen Templeton's talent and skill at writing family stories shines again in this tale about secrets and lies, misunderstandings and misconceptions.

Summaries of every play tell you about the play prior to watching it on stage or on screen. This book is for everyone--Lit. majors, actors, or if you just want to know more about Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Shakespeare For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"&quot;Exquisite,&quot; as Judi Dench writes in her forward, a treat for anyone who enjoys Shakespeare and an accessible guide for those who want to learn more about him and his work. Authors John Doyle and Ray Lischner are acutely attune to the difficulties one faces when encountering Shakespeare, whether for pleasure or required reading, and pare down the excesses of language into a digestible, humorous guide.Act-by-act summaries of the plays form the bulk of this book, but a biography and introduction to the Elizabethan era (Chapter 2, &quot;Will's World&quot;) as well as the essentials to understanding Shakespeare's work receive a fair amount of attention. Part II is devoted entirely to language, with a small glossary of commonly used words and keys to the many puns and jokes in the plays. Particularly helpful is Chapter 6, &quot;How to Read Shakespeare's English.&quot; In Part III, the authors introduce structure, themes, and common character types and explore the actual staging of a play. In addition to his dramatic works, the book also discusses Shakespeare's sonnets and various other poems.You'll find these elements in many introductory works, but few contain as much information and are as easy to read. The authors do all they can to facilitate modern readers - scorecards to track characters and their actions, video suggestions, photos from stage and film productions, and international festivals. After reading this book, you'll be ready to discuss any topic on Shakespeare, from the ten greatest Shakespearean performers to the Dark Lady of the sonnets to whether &quot;Cymbeline&quot; is a comedy, tragedy, or history."},{"Title":"Shakespeare For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"This book is brought to you by the same folks who publish all the &quot;. . .

I have been known to snicker at these books, as I'm rather computer-dweebic, and don't need computer-dummy books.It turns out that my next screenplay involves Shakespeare, and before I started writing, I needed to do some research on the bloke and his works. At the local library, I found &quot;Shakespeare for Dummies.&quot; I scanned the book, then nearly choked on swallowing a dollop of pride as I toted the book through the checkout.It's not easy to be expert at something and at the same time to be able to explain it clearly to beginners (or dummies). These authors definitely do have that talent.Open the cover, and first thing, there's a listing of all of the dude's plays with a one or two sentence summary -- the lay of the land!The book goes on to cover the life and times of William; explanations of his brand of English, the theatrical world he worked in, etc. Deeper into the book, there are two- to three-page summaries of each play, with recommendations for videos of each play.The authors' wholistic approach is very informative, and they take a good-natured approach to a topic that could be oh-so-scholarly.My screenplay, by the way, is titled Learning Shakespeare.

If I may be so presumptuous as to place myself in the latter category, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this book. It provides comparatively brief summaries of each of the plays, but little perspective on what makes one play more profound, more respected, more &quot;required&quot; reading than another. A reader might just as easily conclude that *Titus Andronicus* is as important as *Hamlet*; that *Romeo and Juliet* is no less a tragedy than *Lear*; that *Henry 6 or 8* is as well written as *Henry's 4 and 5*. Moreover, the book-cover blurb promises to teach the reader how to read the Sonnets (totalling 154), yet the authors provide no more than 2 glib paragraphs about the sonnet cycle.The authors' recommendations about films and editions are too succinct or limited to be of much help.

In the process Poggeler may even convince you these phrases have a meaning!Continually emphasizing that Heidegger can only be understood (as the title indicates) as constantly on a \\"path\\" or \\"way\\" and never as offering up definitive conclusions, Poggeler shows how his interest in the Christian experience of time, problems of logic and language, the hermeneutics of facticity or historicity, the \\"seminal element\\" uncovered by the first Greek thinkers, the confrontation with Nietzsche, the reflections on Holderlin and the possibility of the holy and a new beginning, and other elements all feed into Heidegger's unique synthesis.Poggeler does a good job of showing how in different ways Heidegger tracks the problem of how, in the \\"appropriative event\\" which brings humanity and being together in truth or sense, concealment or mystery is always necessary as well, something which for Heidegger has been forgotten in Western metaphysics, with drastic consequences."},{"Title":"Emily and the Scot","review":"When Emily Fitzgerald's older brother Richard went mad with the desire to inherit his father's title and attempted to murder their half-brother Ewan MacLaughlin, the scandal tainted the entire family. Now Ewan and his new wife, Anna, are living happily ever after in Scotland, Richard has been sent out of the country for treatment, and Emily and her mother are left behind, forced to deal on their own with the contempt of Regency London society. After Alexander Cross, the Viscount Stanton, proposes to Emily on a bet, she just can't take it anymore. She packs her bags and heads for Scotland to visit her Ewan and get away from the stares of society. But from the second she arrives at MacLaughlin Castle, Emily gets off to a terrible start with Ewan's cousin, Jamie. She mistakes him for a servant, and angry at Emily's treatment of him. Jamie deliberately embarrasses her. But could something deeper be hidden behind their heated exchanges of insults, maybe even love? While not as good as Kathryn Smith's first book for this series, Anna and the Duke, this was still an enjoyable historical love story, and I recommend it to fans of the Avon True Romance series."},{"Title":"Emily and the Scot","review":"Emily and the Scot is a sequel to Anna and the Duke. This time, the two major characters are Ewan's cousin Jaime and Ewans step-sister, Emily. I do not think this book was better than the first. I was expecting a long, steady plot that involved danger like in the first, but I was disappointed when I found how it turned out. What I did find was, when any sort of problems that might have led to a great climax as in the first came about, they were solved a little easier than expected. The Main characters were very stubborn and seemed to be more along the lines of flat characters than dynamic. Fortunatly, the ending was cool - it's the best term. I felt there could have been a better confilct between someone and the two characters. I felt a little 'angry' at them because they were so stubborn towards eachother that I felt like saying out loud 'kiss her already!' Finally, the happy ending helped ease the annoyance.I enjoyed this book anyway. I felt the ending was very cute, but it made me feel that there could - or should - have a third book added on to this little section."},{"Title":"Emily and the Scot","review":"this book was ok. but it didn\`t have as much passion and dedication as anna and the duke did."},{"Title":"Emily and the Scot","review":"I really loved this book. I just suggest you read Anna and the Duke first because if you read it second (like I did), it kind of messes things up becuase you know what's going to happen.

So she decides not to stay in London and goes to stay with Ewan and his wife Anna (see what I mean about reading Anna and the Duke first?) in the land she has always wanted to see: Scotland.

Jamie is a rough, hard working man, who is content with his simple life in Scotland. But all that changes when Emily comes into his life. Though they take an instant dislike to each other, throughout the novel, Jamie and Emily's feelings change.This novel is one of my favorite Avon True Romances. Both Emily and Jamie are very likeable characters and their chemistry is adorable!

Fearing more scandal for turning down the proposal, she decides to vacation with Ewan in Scotland. She would be enjoying her vacation but Ewan's cousin, Jaime, and her are constantly arguing. Emily highly doubts that her and the brash scot will ever get along.This book is the sequel to a previous Avon True Romance, Anna and the Duke, but it's not really necessary to read that one to understand this one. Emily and the Scot is a watered down but well done type of love/hate story. Although Emily and Jamie never really hated each other their personalities just grate against one another's. The characters were vibrant and the romance managed to remain interesting throughout the entire book. I also really enjoyed the ending. The author showed great restraint in making it a happy but realistic one. Emily and the Scot and Anna and the Duke are two of the best books this series has to offer and I highly recommend them both."},{"Title":"Emily and the Scot","review":"I have only read three of this series, but I do think this one has been the best so far.

She should be grateful anyone would want her to begin with, but doesn't want a boring life. She moves in with her 1/2 brother Ewan (From Anna and the Duke) and meets his cousin (from the other side of the family-he and Emily are not related) anbd they take an instant disliking to one another.

But when Emily first sees him she mistakes him for a servant and asks him to carry her luggage.

There is an almost inexhaustible number of books, pamphlets, and magazine articles about buried and sunken treasure, lost mines, unfound pirate loot, etc. The number of good, accurate, reliable works on these subjects is far fewer. Again, unfortunately, this book clearly falls into the later category.The back cover promises a \\"...factual accounting of lost ships.\\" Further, \\"Whenever possible, every effort was made to add actual interviews with many of the survivors of these horrific sea-going tales.\\" Why the editors bothered to state this is not at all clear, as most of the disasters recounted here happened so long ago the survivors are long gone.First of all, there are no sources offered for any of the provided information. The re-creation of conversations forces the reader to wonder how it was possible for the author(s) to know what was said. Many of these \\"treasure wrecks\\" in fact had or no longer have any treasure - the City of Rio de Janeiro and the Brother Jonathan are two obvious examples.Finally, the prose is remarkably bad - indeed, at times it becomes almost unreadable. Perhaps these accounts are re-written from magazine articles and in their effort to re-write them the editors managed (mangled) to make it sound like a bad translation from a difficult foreign language.Read Potter's \\"Homewrecker\\" - The Treasure Diver's Guide. Read Capt. Bowen's remarkable books about Great Lakes' shipwrecks. Read some genuine first-hand accounts of sea disasters - there are many out there.But there certainly is no point or purpose in reading this book.PS: Although the cover promises tales of \\"Pirate Treasure\\" the editors forgot to include such a chapter or chapters! Typical for this effort, however."},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"&quot;The Tragedy and Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama&quot; almost tests the limits of credulity. It weren't for the fact that I've heard of some of these events from other sources, I would have been hard-pressed to believe it. As it were, the book reads like a fictional screenplay of a small town in the complete grip of a criminal syndicate. The crooks own the cops, the courts and everything in between. The author, Margaret Anne Barnes, details efforts by local citizens to stop the lawlessness, but things come to a head when the state attorney general-elect is assassinated and a variation of martial law is declared. These events make for fascinating reading, and it makes me wonder why this story isn't better known. However, the book does suffer from some rather florid writing and improbable dialogue used to recreate conversations that were held a long time ago. Barnes' use of language in recapturing these dialogues weakens the book to the point that, at times, it sounds like an old pulp novel where there are only purely good people and purely evil people. Despite this simplistic weakness, however, the book does stand as a good example of local history."},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"The book is a true story of an American city controlled by racketeers and the efforts of a few courageous citizens in restoring law and order. Anyone unfamiliar with Phenix City's past will be amazed to read about one of the most bizarre crimes in American history - the assasination of a candidate for Alabama Attorney General by State and local officials. As a result, Phenix City became the only American city placed under martial law since Reconstruction. The book should be read by anyone interested in State and local government. Although the events in the book occurred many years ago, the lessons of Phenix City's story are timeless. The reader will learn how public apathy toward crime and corrupt politics can lead to the deprivation of the most basic civil rights. Moreover, the reader will learn of the extreme price that good citizens may have to pay to restore those rights."},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"Margaret Anne Barnes book- The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama was an &quot;eye- opener&quot; for me.

Her research was impecable and the heroic Bentleys and Britons are legendary to those of us who read of their suffering in the Columbus Ledger.

The book captivates you and you will be unable to put it down until the final chapter."},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"The Phenix City story is still being written. There are secrets that have been kept and families that still have a stake in the shadows being perpetuated. During the late 40s and early 50s, there was a black market baby adoption racket. The children who were sold are today, still seeking their truths of who they really are. It is unfortunate that those still living that have first hand information refuse to help.

Truth can be what it is.And that's the way it is with the Phenix City story. Ace Atkins' book \\"Wicked City,\\" a story of Phenix City is excellent, very well done and highly recommended.But it pales in comparison to what really happened in Phenix City, how it was, how it happened, how it came to be and what it was like to live there. The tentacles of corruption reached throughout Alabama politics (then as now perhaps?)If Ace Atkins had written all of this in his novel, readers would have said, \\"too impossible to be true...\\" But it was.The \\"real deal\\" is what this book is about. And it's gory and dirty. Yet, as the book's title implies, this book is not only about what was wrong with and in Phenix City and how it came to be, it also relates how it was corrected.Could Phenix City happen again today? In Alabama or anywhere in the United States? Most would say \\"no,\\" but don't bet on it. Read this book. It could scare you.Frankly, this book is poorly edited at times--referring to the 26th circuit in one paragraph, then, in the very next paragraph, referring to the same circuit as the 27th circuit. And the formatting leaves something to be desired, some lines at the bottom of a page are repeated at the top of the next page, that kind of thing. But they are minor when compared to the power of the story that is told within these pages."},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"I grew up in Alabama and now live in North Mississippi famous for the \\"State Line Mob \\".When they ran the bad actors out of Phenix City, some of them came to our area and were absorbed by the above group, so after reading \\" Wicked City\\" by Ace Atkins which is a fictionalized account of the Phenix City story, decided to read this book which is non-fiction. Great read. It is mind boggling. The depth of corruption, murder and mayhem perpitrated on this small town was unbelievable, reaching all the way to the highest office in the State. Opened my eyes to dark period of my southern heritage."},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"For those who grew up in Phenix City, this is a very enthralling look at how things were in the 50's when the mob and the gamblers &quot;Lawlessly&quot; ran the town...holding the town at bay in fear of murders, bombings and destruction. It teaches you a lot about the history of the buildings, the many names you have always been familiarized with (lawyers, judges, buisnesses, streets) while uncovering the sins and evilness of the gamblers that once dominated...and the crooked politics that took place during those times. It will provoke you to take a closer look at some of the old buildings and places as you pass them next time; and, you will never see Phenix City the same way again. This book is hard to put down. It is one of those non-fictional books that you will probably read several times, based merely on the intrigue of all the secrets you will uncover and things you will learn about &quot;The Tragedy and Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"I live across the river, in Columbus, GA, from Phenix City.

People are cheated, beaten, locked up in jail and even murdered to protect an illegal way of life. It really is hard to believe that something like this could happen even in the 1950's. Phenix City had been so corrupt for so long that it took the National Gaurd to clean it up. I could only imagine what it would be like for something like that to happen today.If you enjoy reading a bit of history in the gambling business, this is a great book. I don't know how accurate it is but from what I've heard, it's one of the best."},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"It's not as easy a read as Murder in Coweta County but still a good actual account of how America has had its pockets of crime over the years. This one account is chilling and you can hardly believe this sort of thing is ever allowed. I'm sure we've not seen the last of true accounts like this one but if you want an account that's easy to understand, this is a good one."},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"Having lived in Columbus and hearing the story and watching the movie it was fun to read the book. What a tragedy this could happen. Great book, prompt shipping"},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"This book had some Alabama history that I didn't know. I bet it isn't taught in the schools. As for it being the most corrupt city in the country, I don't know. I would think that title would go to Hot Springs AK. at the time. That is just my opinion. That aside it is a very good book. Try and see the movie based on the book, it is interesting also."},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"This book was really well written, and informative! I dont read a lot of books at all but it definitely grabbed my attention.

I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good read!"},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"I had seen a movie about Phenix City and wanted to get more infoon the subject.

Anyone interested in corruption and crime in an American city would like this book."},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"As my wife's grandfather had a substantial role in the business of vice in Phenix City, it was with eagerness and excitement that I read this book. Although he was not mentioned by name (he preferred to be behind-the-scenes), I was not disappointed in the book. The understandably cloudy story of his life was made clearer by the vivid picture of Phenix City during that time which was painted by Ms Barnes. A remarkable book which has a permanent place on the shelves of my family's library."},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"please sent me something to ored this boo"},{"Title":"The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama","review":"this book was worse than the movie. a few true stories, no one shot the heels off a woman.

If you have children, or even if your children are grown and gone like mine, you will still get chuckles and remember when!"},{"Title":"Just Wait Till You Have Children of Your Own","review":"For anyone is a parent of a teenager, or anyone who is interested in reading more about that complex, and turbulent dynamic, this book is for you. I first read this book when I was eleven years old, and it just got me reading and enjoying more of Erma Bombeck's unique and broad brand of humor. To top that off, the little comic interludes, illustrating themes and common day-to-day interactions between parents and children, are drawn beautifully by Bil Keane, who went on to illustrate the successful comic strip, \\"Family Circus,\\" for years.Whether Erma Bombeck is taking on housekeeping, driving lessons, or hairstyles, she is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. Granted, this book was originally written in the 1970s and there is a slightly dated hippie quality to the look of the teenagers in this book, the themes ring true today, as much as thirty years ago. Parents and their teenage children speak different languages, diverge greatly in their tastes in music, friends, romantic partners and lifestyle. Yet, God has put them together, to teach one another lessons in adversity, communication (or lack thereof) and exasperation!Bombeck's talent shines brightly here. I also reccomend you check out \\"Motherhood: The Second Oldest Profession,\\" \\"The Grass is Greener Over the Septic Tank,\\" \\"If Life is a Bowl of Cherries, What am I Doing in the Pits?\\", and \\"When You Begin to Look Like Your Passport Photo, It's Time to Go Home.\\" They are also great examples of her comedic writing, and warm insight into life and its day-to-day mini-disasters!"},{"Title":"Just Wait Till You Have Children of Your Own","review":"I've been a fan of Erma Bombeck since *long* before \\"The Grass is Always Greener..\\" and teaming her yolks with Bil Keane was a stroke - of genius. Never picturing the Keane children before in a post-pubescent manner, the effect on the text was stunning. Did Jeffy really grow mutton-chop sideburns? Was Dolly suffering emetophilia as Ms. Bombeck suggests? In so many ways, this book is like Disney's \\"The Lion King,\\" only without the Uncle Scar, and the part with the hyenas. I'd recommend it highly for the witty text, but the binding was a problem as the pages tend to slip out if you bend the book open too far. Still, four stars for Mrs. Bombeck and Bil!"},{"Title":"Just Wait Till You Have Children of Your Own","review":"Pairing Bil Keane (Of \\"Family Circus\\" fame) and Erma Bombeck was a stroke of genius. These two work very well together - it's a shame they didn't do more work together.Of course, the title is the \\"mother's curse\\" - if you had a mom, you may remember her using that line on you. I often wonder if that's why some people don't have children.This book takes you thru \\"expert\\" advice - and than shows you how the situation plays out in the real world. If you are a parent of a teen, you may want this book just so you can remember they don't stay teenagers forever (they _don't_ , really - tho sometimes it's hard to believe).So get this book, find a quiet spot (HA! what's that, the bathroom?) and enjoy - it's cheaper and more fun that psychotherapy."},{"Title":"Just Wait Till You Have Children of Your Own","review":"The book was first published in 1970 and the text and the illustrations are showing their age. Let's face it, the kids who where teenagers in it are now in their mid to late 40s. Of course with the 2000s being into the 1970s retro look and sound, maybe what's old is new.That's not to say it wasn't a quick and enjoyable read and Bil Keane's illustrations are humorous too. I recommend flipping through the book once just to enjoy his illustrations. Imagine the Family Circus kids as hippy teenagers. Actually come to think of it, the Family Circus kids probably are actually in their mid to late forties as well."},{"Title":"Just Wait Till You Have Children of Your Own","review":"This is the best book I have ever read!!! I love it. It explains the situtation so well. It is just great. You have to read it to know what I am talking about!"},{"Title":"Just Wait Till You Have Children of Your Own","review":"If you like funny stories that ring true about being a parent, Erma Bombeck's the writer for you. If you want hysterical drawings of teenagers, Bil Keane is your cartoonist. They create a championship team of angst-relieving humorists for parents waiting up until 4 a.m. for the teenager who was supposed to be home at 10:30 p.m., and cannot be located.The book was originally written about 25 years ago, so you will occasionally need to go back in time to understand the humor. The hair stories are all like that. Suffice to say, female and male teenagers wore very long hair then. It was often difficult to tell to which sex a person belonged. The humorous possibilities of this are wonderful, and well exploited.I had the opportunity to meet Ms. Bombeck many years ago, and found her to be as self-effacing and interesting in person as her writing shows her to be. Much humor in books is aimed at putting down someone else. But Ms. Bombeck mixes lots of love with her humor, and the humor is often aimed at herself and other adults. That's what makes this book and its humor so heart-warming, even though she and Mr. Keane share eloquently about the frustrations of being a parent (especially a Mom).If you are not familiar with her humor, it has a lot in common with slapstick. She takes an ordinary situation that often will not run smoothly (like teaching one's child to drive) and piles every single thing that ever goes wrong into one, nonstop, fast-paced incident. As disaster after disaster occurs, you find yourself overloaded with emotional discharges that can only be relieved by a good belly laugh. Think of it as an innoculation against frustration when a less challenging incident occurs.The topics covered are pretty encyclopedic. You will learn about selective memory (forgetting to do chores, but remembering what one received at a certain age if a sibling gets more), driving lessons (how the other parent undermines the more cautious one), the futility of trying to keep up with swiftly changing styles (even the Mom who tries to keep up cannot, because she doesn't know how the styles changed during that day at school), how the telephone disappears until the teenagers leave the house, teenagers' fear of being embarrassed by their parents, the agonies of family vacations, the fall of parental intelligence as the teenagers get older (in the eyes of the children), loud music, money, proms, braces, boy or girl friends, worrying, and arguments.Ms. Bombeck had three children, and uses them as her source of material. What she does especially well is capture the busyness of being a parent. When a special opportunity to make a connection comes along, it always seems like there are 6 other things that have to be done simultaneously. Her indirect message is to get rid of the busyness and focus on the connections on those rare occasions when they arise. I heartily agree with that.The chapters are done in an amusing point-counterpoint style. The point is to quote some famous authority on parenting at the beginning of the chapter (many of whom were childless) who describes what parents should be doing. Then Ms. Bombeck describes the reality of what parents are up against as the counterpoint. Then she humorously wrings her hands over the futility of following the advice. This style works very well. Following the counterpoint perspective will also help free you from trying to follow impossibly high standards that will only drive you crazy.But, at bottom (despite the sarcastic remarks), this is a loving book. Ms. Bombeck and Mr. Keane have lots of love for the teenagers and the parents. It's that love that makes the humor work, and makes this book add up to the following advice: Love 'em and enjoy 'em as teenagers . . . just the way they are.After you finish laughing along with this book, go do something nice for a teenager. Then give yourself a good feeling for doing that. And repeat the process. The more you do it, the better you'll enjoy it.And don't tell them: Just wait until you have children of your own. It doesn't work as a threat. Feel free to shout that imprecation though to the top of your lungs when they are temporarily out of the house. It'll make you feel great!Keep smiling and laughing. It's the only relief . . . until they finally outgrow being teenagers!"},{"Title":"Just Wait Till You Have Children of Your Own","review":"There are books to take to the beach, and there are books to snuggle up with on a cold winter night. I think this Keane/Bombeck effort is a rainy-day book, the kind of day you wonder whether or not you should have sent the kids to school with rain slickers. Oh and make sure you've got a good cup of coffee and a doughnut when you're reading this book. Or maybe wheat toast."},{"Title":"Just Wait Till You Have Children of Your Own","review":"Honestly, darlinks, I just love this book. Famed columnist Erma Bombeck teamed up with &quot;Family Circus&quot;'s Bil Keane to create an unusual and enjoyable book.Both of them write/draw columns/cartoons that talk about raising teenagers in the 70s (when this was originally published, I think) Keane's cartoons are not &quot;Family Circus&quot; in later years, but instead are sometimes-surreal glimpses of seventies parents and kids, such as the girl who has what appears to be a palm-tree-like growth of hair on her head, or the boy carrying a restaurant's worth of food to his room.Ms. Bombeck covers adolescent embarrassment, sex talks with parents, haircuts of the time, and so on. Her columns are funny, witty, and most of all, ACCURATE--especially with Keane's cute cartoons. Too bad it's such a short book--I could read this stuff forever."},{"Title":"Just Wait Till You Have Children of Your Own","review":"I am however used to digesting my Keane in smaller doses that is to say less words and more pictures. But I did find Ms. Bombeck's observations to be right in line with Keanes vis a vis the way kids are these days, what with their hijinks and antics. Maybe they can do another collaborative effort together only with more pictures this time. And maybe Ms. Bombeck can let us know what Grandpa is up to!"},{"Title":"Just Wait Till You Have Children of Your Own","review":"This is a must-read for all parents.

I've read it at school,work,and constantly get asked,'Just what in the world is so funny?!\\" And I've had this book(actually,pages,since it has completely fallen apart from numerous years of wear and tear and many moves) since '96,when I was 11 years old,and without fail,it is still so funny and relevent.The end still makes me tear up,when they are going over how they wish kids would grow up,then you look around your empty nest home,straightening up things that are not messy for once,and realize your kids do grow up and will leave.I feel emotional thinking about that now! All these years later,lol. I just had to write a little review for one of my most fav books,and I would recommend it to anyone,kids,no kids,we all need a great dose of love and laughter in this life.God Bless Erma and Bill for this Gem!

Fortunately, I got over that phase and reached the point where I can at least chuckle at most of it again. This book is very similar to other writings and TV shows in the 1970s time frame that dealt with the so-called \\"generation gap\\" - the two that come to my mind are the old animated TV series \\"Wait Till Your Father Gets Home\\" and some episodes of \\"All in the Family\\". Because the book was written in the late 60s/ early 70s, some of the jokes, such as those dealing with transistor radios and hair length, seem dated today. One wishes Erma had updated the book to deal with newer styles - can you imagine the fun she would have had commenting on neon-pink Mohawks and iPods? It's still a fun read especially for those of us who remember the 70s.Bil Keane's drawings are an interesting addition, since they're not nearly as sappy sweet as his \\"Family Circus\\" strip - and who'd have thunk squeaky-clean Bil would be so good at drawing sexy teenage girls in miniskirts?"},{"Title":"Great Dads: A Celebration of Fatherhood","review":"My father passed away a year ago.

These famous people may seem very distant from all of us, but I'm sure any reader will feel as I did when I read the book: &quot;these tales are descriptions of my Dad.&quot;Reading &quot;Great Dads&quot; is a must for any son or daughter.

If you've read and enjoyed any of the Weiss & Hickman books, but wanted more of an adult flare then I recommend this for you."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This has to be one of the most enthralling, wonderfully gripping reads I've ever come across. Anne Bishop truly has a gift, and it's displayed here at its best.Her talent is for creating unique, fascinatingly dark worlds, and complex, interesting characters. As a longtime fan of fantasy, I can tell you it gets very tiring to see the same midieval, knights-and-castles settings, time and time again. Anne Bishop steers clear of that, crafting a unique, detailed world that will draw you in at once and refuse to let you go. Her books are wonderfully dark and sensual, although that certainly makes them not for the young or light-hearted--there is sex, violence, and other dark themes in abundance.The brilliance of her characters is best demonstrated in Daemon Sadi. Between his sadism, refusal to harm children, and devotion towards Jaenelle, he's a wonderfully interesting character--and so complex it's sometimes difficult to tell whose side he's truly on. By the time the book is over, you genuinely care about her characters, and you want to see them emerge triumphant.A warning, however. As already said, her books are both dark and sensual, and they have characters with names such as Saeten and Lucivar--something some readers might have objections to, although there don't seem to be any parallels between the characters and the origin of their names. I wouldn't recommend these for anyone under the of 13, or easily offended Christians.I would, however, recommend them to anyone else. If you like fantasy, dark fantasy, horror, or romance, give them a try. You'll find yourself swept away to a world beyond your wildest dreams, caught up in an enthrallingly horrific story of love, with romance, action, comedy, and everything else you could possibly want in a book."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I was truely astonished at how good these books were. I had been recommended by someone I knew online. Parents, these had definite adult content... anyone else, I would recommend these to anyone.It's about a powerful young girl who goes through such horror and terror that she constantly struggles, not only against others, but with herself.It's also about the men who love her. A father, a brother, a lover. You really FEEL for each of these characters as the story progresses, and although the future looks bleak, you continue to hope for each of them.The tale is also about power and the misuse of it. But it's mainly about the main characters. The worldbuilding is right on, but you stay involved because of Jaenelle, Daemon, Saetan and Lucifer.If you are a fantasy fan, pick one up.. it's come highly recommended! ;)"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"The Black Jewels Trilogy is a puzzling paradox: full of sound and fury, and yet the apocalypse signifies little.The writing is an odd mix of trying to be dark and black and sepulchural, but that language, along with the brutality of the Blood, never gets a reasonable counterbalance. There are Queens upon Queens upon Queens... yet we never see a vignette of a Queen doing her job well, as a contrast to the corruption that underlies the entire Blood structure. The Blood are supposed to be caretakers of the land and the landens... and yet the landens hardly make an appearance, so the reader never gets a sense of what that relationship is like. Nearly everyone that the main characters deal with is a Prince or a Queen or a Warlord or some permutation thereof, or else that minor character is a one-note caricature. Bishop creates some interesting concepts, but the exposition needed to make those concepts come to life is left out: how does one catch a Wind, for example? Instead, there are pages devoted to being a \\"snarly male\\" and what amounts to a great deal of posturing with ultimately no resolution besides vamping around and glowering, with gory bloodletting as the author wishes.Our heroine, Jaenelle, is dreams-made-flesh, the Blood's own Witch, and (sadly) a Mary Sue. All the good guys who see her love her immediately; she quickly makes friends of all the other characters we're supposed to like, she has Unbelieveable Cosmic Powers and thirteen uncut Black Jewels; she has \\"haunted sapphire eyes,\\" she has her own brand of ultra-black Jewel. She is best friends with the Unicorns and Tigers and Spiders and Scelties and Dragons. She is able to provoke a \\"response\\" in Daemon Sadi (look! it's \\"Demon\\" with an \\"ae\\" in it! how witty!) when no other female can do so in thousands of years. Couldn't we have seen a flaw in Jaenelle that didn't involve her propensity to completely overextend herself in the service of others?The overarching premise of a corrupt system waiting for a messiah to come and reform it is workable, and there are some good moments in the series - one that springs to mind is the scene between Witch and her grandmother Alexandra, when Alexandra rejects the very savior she wished for. Ultimately, the world ends... but this reader was left unaffected."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Being a fantasy novel this can get rather complex with all the different worlds and races but fear not, Mrs. Bishop does a WONDERFUL job of explaining as she goes along. She doesn't spoon feed you details but she weaves them intricately in the story and, soon enough, you'll feel like you know everyone and anyone that ever lived in this place.The very basic break down of the plot is as follows. There is a world made up of three Realms and each Realm is divided into Territories, which are ruled by their respective Queens. In this world, women are the rulers and men are their guardians, second in command, etc. The Jewels they were born with divide people and, as they make the Offering to the Darkness, by the Jewels they then acquire. The Darkness is the good power, not the evil one. The lighter the jewel, the less power the person has. Black is the most powerful and only a handful of people have ever had this Jewel after they made the Offering. None have been actually been born a Black. Until now.A long time before our story beings, a witch had a vision that one day the Queen will come that will have the power to unite the warring territories. She will be a born Black Queen with more power than anyone has ever seen. She will be the living embodiment of the dreams of those who have throughout the centuries hoped for a fair and just Queen to rule them all. She is thus called the Dream Made Flesh. The trilogy is the story if this Queen, Janelle, and we follow her from the time she is barely 7 to the time she comes into full power and the final full-scale war breaks out.I could go into more plot details but this booked is packed with so much we would be here forever so I will just insert what is needed as I review. Also, as I am aware that most readers that wander into this blog are primarily Romance readers, I will point out a few things that may help those who've never read Fantasy.The first and most important thing to remember is that this is a Fantasy book that has romance, and not the other way around. As such, you will see a lot of things that may not be expected in the Romance genre. In spite of this I strongly believe that Romance lovers will absolutely enjoy this book.Second of all, you must keep in mind that none of the races are human as this takes place in another Universe. Some of their behavior towards children, etc may, at first, rub you the wrong way. Keep an open mind and don't try to read between the lines. Bishop is very clear and, when she means incest, she will say it out loud. No, none of the good guys think having sex with a minor is a good idea, in fact, they are repulsed by this but they do have strong feelings for Jaenelle even as a small child because it is the Dark power in her that is calling to the power in them. The males protect and serve their Queen with almost blind devotion and this is explained thoroughly enough that you can understand the difference between them loving their future Queen and them being in love with a child.Third thing to keep in mind, and rather important for those that may have never read anything but Romance, this book is dark. This is nothing out of the ordinary, unless you've never read Fantasy before and therefore I am warning you. People die and are killed in more ways than one, children are abused, slaves are tortured, sex is used to break people and things WILL get dark and gloomy. Do NOT let any of this stop you reading this book. Bishop doesn't hold back but she presents it all in a way that doesn't scream cheap horror. Maybe someone else would have come off as simply trying to shock the readers to give the book more umph but Anne knows exactly what she is doing. Some of the characters have too much power and all this is necessary to bring them down to our level and to make the struggles more real. Without the darkness the rest of the story, the way the characters were shaped, the actions they take, and just about the entire thing wouldn't be believable. Not for one minute do you doubt that these people are in danger, that the balance of power can shift at any moment and, most important, that anyone can die.If a book doesn't keep you on the edge on your seat and truly makes you wonder if any of the good guys will survive then it's not a good book at all. There would be no need to read a book like this if you could tell, at every turn, what would happen. Fantasy books thrive on suspense. They revolve around quests or wars against races, etc. The writer HAS to keep the reader hooked on the story, caring about the characters yet not being able to determine who wins or lose. Mrs Bishop does one hell of a good job with this. People will die that you wish wouldn't have but this is exactly what happens in a war and it helps keep the book and characters real. Unlike in Romance or other genres, the fantasy genre has no rules as the writer creates the races and universe they inhabit. Without trying for some realism there would be no way for readers to know the dangers the characters are in and, no suspense and no tension mean no reader interest. You don't want to read a story where nothing ever happens now do you?These are just warnings but they should not stop anyone from reading this. I can't stress it enough just how damn wonderful this book is. Bishop has an incredible way with words. She paints this picture for you and you can clearly see everything that goes on, feel everything these people feel. Her characters are nothing short of amazing, every single one of them. With so many races, so many characters, and so many things going one you'd think at some point Mrs. Bishop will lose track of something. I didn't find one thing, character or scene out of place or blown out of proportion. Everything was as it should have been.The characters are some of the best I've ever read. Every single one of them. The villains are truly evil and thus make the danger feel real. Jaenelle is presented, from the get go, as an all powerful being so you think it would be hard to care for her if nothing can threaten her. Bishop quickly makes you forget about this. She is a strong woman yet she never comes of as having a Xena complex or thinking she is above everyone else. Far from it. Daemon is one very tortured soul if I've ever seen one. Forget anyone you've ever read about. THIS man was tortured. For centuries. He is cool, can be ruthless yet the love he has for Jaenelle is nothing short of sweet and so damn intense it will tear your heart out at times.I must say that, for a fantasy novel, this book is pretty strong in the romance department as the love between the main characters is a VERY omportant part of the plot (for various reasons I cannot give away so as not to give too much of the story). Suffice it to say Romance readers will NOT be dissapointed in the least bit. I dare say this romance rivals some of the best I've read to date."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I will start by saying anyone who compares these books with Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Legacy series doesn't get the latter series. Ms. Carey uses exquisite, well-turned prose and a well-thought out alternative Europe for her setting. Her characters are rich, appropriate to their melieu and not at risk of sounding 'goofy' or anachronistic. She pays attention to the 'big picture' as well as the small details and makes the reader a comfortable, eager confidente in world-changing events of which the main character is a knowing participant and instigator.Ms. Bishop does not do these things. She writes stock characters whose plights and behavior have proven appealing to the average female fantasy reader over the years and, thus, a moneymaker. The characters do not advance the story so much as become props for scenes and the author simply progresses the story by advancing a few weeks/months/years in each chapter.She writes a world that is at once richly imagined in some respects, e.g., the different planes and their types of denizens, the connection between one's magical ability and certain stones or jewels; and poorly realized in others, e.g., no connective history, no attempt to give the reader a grasp on the melieu/technology/beliefs of the time but simply borrowing a few medieval details because they're necessary.The characters, as I said before, are stock Mary Sues. The abused and all powerful child on whose shoulders the fate of the world rests; the attractive (to the reader) guardian who takes said child under his wing but manages to miss all the signs that 'Something Is Wrong' until it's too late to prevent it in every book of the three; the smoldering love interest that inflames reader's imagination but would get a swat on the nose with a rolled newspaper if the other characters had a chance to act of their own accord; the requisite evil queen who stalks around making unreasonable 'hurry up and do that' demands because, well, she's just drawn that way.Oh, and there's some sex. Not well written, some of it objectionable (implied kinky paederasty for starters). I like well-written, well-integrated story-type sex as much as the next person. Granted Ms. Carey seems to get carried away with her own darker kink in the first Kushiel book but it actually gives you insight into the characters as well as being titillating. Ms. Bishop does not manage to titillate nor tell me anything new or interesting about the characters when sex takes the stage.Beyond stock characters their behavior strikes me as... well... how a real person would want to be treated by such characters, rather than how such characters would actually behave and interact with each other. As an example, one of the primary characters, Saetan SaDiablo, is the King of Hell. Yes, everyone has a gooey inside but from the first page we're seein' the softer side of Sears, if you get my point. This man doesn't seem imposing, dangerous, powerful, ancient, dangerous, prescient, charismatic, evil, dangerous, although we're told he's supposed to be these things (operative word here is 'told' not shown). He comes across as harried, unprepared, tired, cranky and incapable of dealing with a child (granted a child with a wild magical talent) despite his vast experience and power. Other characters come across in the same fashion, particularly in relating to the heroine, Jaenelle Angelline (get it? angels and devils?). Powerful, literally mythic figures in some cases, are made homely, unimposing and sometimes laughable. The only character who comes close to achieving the promise of his reputation is the heroine's love interest, Daemon Sadi. IMHO this is because Ms. Bishop had the hots for him, and even he falls into the exasperated, clunky average Joe trap at some points in the books when dealing with the heroine. Or he becomes unattractive, whiney Martyr Man (another requisite for such characters).The gender posturing, while explained as natural to magical characters, comes across as manufactured to explain this inconsstent behavior.Beyond all this the same situations and elevation/progression of plot and tension were reused in each book. Almost to some of the very same situations, with places and names changed to fool the reader. In the third book there are hints Ms. Bishop might have given some thought to creating a more complex struggle between the good guys and the bad guys but nothing comes of it.I did buy all three and did read all three over a week's time and frankly, I came away feeling like I'd had Chinese food. I was hungry for something more engaging half an hour later. If you are looking for mental chewing gum that will push the proper buttons for you, this series will do it. If you're looking for something better plotted, a well-created world and complex characters you're better off giving this series a pass."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I am quite new to the whole fantasy genre, but thanks to Anne and the world she created, I am quite sure, I am now and forever hooked. A friend of mine is an avid fantasy reader and devours books. She recommended Anne Bishop. I actually bought the trilogy (all in one) and would recommend new readers do the same. Once you start, once you're immersed, you can't stop. For me it's like a drug. I would lie in bed reading, glance up and realise it was 3am in the morning, because I \\"Needed\\" to read one last chapter, which became another and another. The world that Anne imagines, creates and brings to life is beautiful. You fall in love with the characters and become a part of their lives. You won't want to leave. The world and concepts that she creates are unique and intriguing. I have now read every single book she has written up to and including her latest Twilights Dawn. I cried and I actually found my self laughing out loud alot whilst reading her books. I hope I can find other books and Authors that I enjoy as much as these ones. P.S If you can recommend any let me know."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I read this book over five years ago. And i can't stop thinking about this book. I fell in love with this storythe only thing i did not like. Was the way ANNE BISHOPended the story. Don't get me wrong this is a very goodbook. But i thout there was more to the books then therewas (the ending was weak).I loved this book you will to."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"After a much needed hiatus from multi-book serials, I was finally ready to delve back into the fiction-fantasy realm. The Black Jewels trilogy had sat in my TBR pile for quite some time and upon the urging of a friend I finally started this trilogy.I started out apprehensive but intrigued with the fantasy premise of jewels denoting a person's birthright. But by the time I pushed through the end of the trilogy, I knew I was done with this trilogy and with Anne Bishop.In the first book, it seemed that Bishop had written a provocative, dark fantasy series. The plot began with an interesting premise wherein it's the female who rules supreme. In this world, the magic revolves around the Black Jewels, the darker jewel being the most powerful. Each person is born with a birthright jewel that ranges from white to black and that jewel is a container their power; a person can obtain a darker jewel after making an offering to the darkness.At first,this appeared to seque into a great set up winthin a fascinating world wherein the interaction between the caste system and the magical jewel power created a complex social system.However, as the story and characters unfolded, the plot devolved into a world of explicit violence, rape, torture, and illicit sex. I did like the build up to the main protagonists - Jaenelle, Saetan, Daemon, and Lucivar but I never loved any of them or really related to them as vibrant or heroic chatacters.I wouldn't categorized the Black Jewels triology as a dark fantasy either, it just a overly ambitious plotline that's assaults the reader with gratuitous sexual violence, sadistic pedophiles, cartoonishly evil villains/villainesses, brutal child rapes, incest, graphic torture and castrations. While the subject matter is dark, violent, and twisted, this does not a dark fantasy make.Overall, the world Bishop world has created is not a place I would want to ever live in or re-visit and I'm content to end my journey with the series at this trlogy."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I loved the entire series, was glued to every word. It seemed very fresh and original, and I loved Jaenelle and them all. Great series. Easy read, perfect for anyone who loves high fantasy."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"When I began the first installment, Daughter of the Blood, I was less than impressed. I struggled at first understanding the multilayered hierarchy of Bishop's Realms. If you feel overwhelmed by the rankings (Warlord, Prince, Warlord Prince etc.) or the jewels, or maybe the differences in demon-dead and regular dead, perservere! Suddenly, maybe a third of the way through the novel, everything clicked and I was engrossed in lovable and frightening characters.I was near the end of Daughter of the Blood when I realized I had yet to secure the next two novels. I usually depend on my public library, but my entire county didn't carry the rest of the trilogy! I ordered this lovely collection, and waited about two days between finishing the first novel and receiving my new book.I really reccommend this giant installment, its nice to have all three books together, and its not too unwieldy. I think the cover is beautiful. Take it from a closet fantasy novel addict, this is one of the greats, with characters you wish you could hang out with!But- its not for the faint of heart, or for young readers. There is a reason it is described as \\"dark fantasy\\". I skipped a passage in Daughter of the Blood that was a little too wince-worthy, and I usually have nerves of steel. Very sensual, very dark. Some cringe inducing violence. Not for a thirteen year old, in my opinion. One reading will have you hooked!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I love this trilogy. The first fantasy series I've ever read and now I am hooked on fantasy. Anne Bishop has combined all the things I love most about fiction in these stories; Romance, adventure, fantasy, humor and suspense. The characters are unforgettable long after you put the books down. There are so many memorable moments that pull at your heart. Who else is going to create a Hell in which you actually find yourself wishing you were in it. I found myself wishing Saeten and his sons were my own father and brother. I've read these books at least 3 times and still when I reread them I'm impressed. The four stars are because I fell in love with so many characters and felt that any of them could carry their own stories. So there should be more Black jewel stories.I read these books several years ago and have reread them several times since. My favorite is the first book Daughter of the Blood. I was drawn into the story very easily and hated to see it end. That's the sign of a good book. What I liked most about all the stories is the relationship between Saetan and his sons. I was touched at how tender and caring a father he was and found myself wishing I had those kinds of relationships in my own life. If people like these characters populated the world we would be a lot better off.I even loved the dark theme of the novels though I usually like and read upbeat romances. There is a romance in the story but it is very subtle and for me could have been stronger but this is a fantasy novel so I accept that.My one complaint is that there were some consistency issues with the series. At the beginning Saetan called his son \\"Namesake\\" but it was dropped in latter books.There are so many tender and funny moments that you have to let it slide.I loved these stories but by the end they lose some of their steam. Still I found myself wishing for another story and found some satisfaction with one of her other novels which is a prequel to this \\"The invisible Ring.\\" SO if you like these books you will love that one too.Romancefantasy"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I picked this omnibus edition up on a whim. I'm so glad i did! it was excellent. While i would have liked to get in Jaenelle's head a little more, i can understand why the author told the story for everyone but Jaenelle's point of view. The males were strong presences, which i have loved! Lucivar,Daemon and Saetan were just great, and The Coven and boyos were great friends for Jaenelle."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"How many times was this phrase in the trilogy? I am surpised the series was not named the Everything has a Price Trilogy....To begin with,this beginning of this journey started off with so much strength, granted the S & M was a bit much, but interesting just the same (Anne Rice takes out the initial shock with her classic Sleeping Beauty Series). You come to love the characters Daemon, Saetan, and Luciver. You also just love to hate the evil witches that control them, but secretly inside are tickled that they have power over men. Yet, how can anyone write one amazing book, follow it with decent transitional book, only to have a pathetic ending with not hint of what Bishop is capable of? I don't get it.There was so much build up between Deamon and Janelle. It is what kept me reading. I was extremely disappointed with the sexual tension (or lack of) between Jaenelle and Daemon in the last book. There was much anticipation for when they would finally be united; and it was like having the air slowly seep out of a balloon. It was painful to read, there was not breathtaking romance or giddy happiness. Such a disappointment. At a certain point, I no longer wanted to read the final book. It took everything in me to finish it.I find Anne Bishop to be a very talented writer with wonderful, descriptive writing. She knows how to weave a story and tell it well. She can come up with interesting characters such as the kindred animals and the various races of the world. However, she is weak when it comes to wrapping it all together. The more characters she adds, the more confusing the names become, making the reader just skim through with out getting attached to any of them.She creates a world that is supposed to be controlled by intelligent, strong women but in the end it appears that the men still have the underlying spotlight. It is very obvious that Bishop is extremely attached to her male characters and makes them more interesting then the females. Her female characters seem to have the same catty personality, snappy, easily irritated, demanding, and horny (except for Jaenelle). Does someone have a certain impression on women?Bishop never gives the main character, Jaenelle, her own section to portray what is in her mind. Jaenelle is always portrayed through someone else's point of view; which makes her seem unreachable and not real. One minute she is strong, next she is weak. Very confusing to know what makes up Jaenelle.Finally, Bishop's idea of reversing roles and having women as the dominating species is not new to a storyline but fun to read. But she does not pull it off well. The men are all cautious of the women and trying to tiptoe around them, but then they are commanding women around with clever methods and witty dialogue. It also seems like the men do all the scheming on the good side, but women do all the scheming on the bad side (another one of Bishop's ideas on women?). The whole book just seemed like an excuse to write about men conquering over controlling women, but in the end they still do not have equality. Even with such domination over them, the men still love, protect and stand in awe of the women. It really contradicts itself and is hard to swallow. I honestly think Bishop is not even sure about her own characters and the role they play. It feels like she is struggling to explain why these men stay with such difficult women.Overall, I would recommend the first book, Daughter of the Blood, the story is so very interesting. Of course if you read the first, you need to read the last two would just to have some conclusion (even thought it is weak). So reader beware do not have any expectation and you may enjoy the ride.However, I have not given up on Anne Bishop. I anticipate more of her work. I find her writing to be engaging and filled with much potential. She may have butchered this trilogy, but I have faith in her and will give her future books a chance."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Praises first:Ms Bishop writes extremely well, even though she indulges in some stereotyped phrased she repeats all too often: when you have reached page 400 you too shall complain about the abundance of \\"too\\" \\"too softly\\" and \\"snarl(ed)\\".Her dialogues are teasing and witty, she can sketch personalities and physical details vividly enough; her main characters are endearing.Flaws, then:a young extraordinarily gifted girl misunderstood by her own family gets some friends and becomes a most powerful queen.That is the basic plot stretched to a 1200 pages length.Ms Bishop is gifted but she is not gifted enough to make such a long read worthwhile; in this trilogy very few things actually happen, the rest is witty dialogue and skilled, superficial depiction of emotions, passions, hatred and depravity.Her main characters are strong and vivid, but after a couple of hundred pages they necessarily tend to become repetitive; side characters are sometimes left to themselves and become little more than shadows.The setting is striking, at first: the idea of three non too clearly connected worlds where the dead are not necessarily so is compelling but after some time one has to realise that this idea slipped off her hands somewhere and the society described here ends up being a very classist XIX century England.Last but not least, a few but very disturbing typos and inconsistencies; e.g. the lovely side character of Morton who actually dies two times: I realise it must have been hard to edit such a volume but this is still no excuse.In my opinion you will be able to enjoy this novel if you have your mind set on reading a romance; fantasy readers will be disturbed by some very good basic ideas put to very bad use."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"There is much to like about a new fantasy world, free from the cliches of the usual magic person coming-of-age-story. Our heroine evolves from odd child through tragic victim to supreme queen who always gets her way through manipulation, and everyone adores her for it. The major characters have interesting magical powers, and descriptions of the culture are exotic with great beauty and savage terror.It's a good read even though the plotting is strangely uneven. A major character is literally left rotting in prison for 1/3 of the trilogy. Our heroine lies traumatized and unconscious for many months. However, villains get satisfactory come-uppances by the conclusion.I was put off by the sexual cruelty. Apparently, males are so testosterone-laden and unpredictable that they must be \\"controlled\\" by females through use of a genital ring, rather like training a dog with an electric collar. It was reminiscent of the more extreme women's movement rhetoric of the '80s. I disliked the concept of a boarding school for child molestation disguised as a psychiatric facility. Also, the concept that a witch could be mentally and psychically rendered useless by non-concensual sex was incomprehensible; real witches are much more resilient."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This series is not in the least \\"original\\" and there is nothing \\"unique\\" about the world, the magic system, or the society. Bishop's general theme here is reversing the aesthetic of traditional fantasy concepts. This is potentially a fun twist, but hardly \\"original.\\" Most fantasy fans will have encountered permutations of these ideas again and again.You can think of Bishop's world as being analogous to the subterranean Dark Elves of classic fantasy (like Forgotten Realms and D&D;). The culture is matriarchal with males as slaves, power comes from Darkness, the (unexplored and therefore shallow) religion seems to feature a kind of night goddess.Bishop definitely gave detailed thought to her magic system...but the aspects Bishop explained were far too formulaic (colors of jewels corresponding with power level--sounds like a video game from the 80's!). The possibly more interesting aspects, well, Bishop forgot to explain them. The result is a magic system that feels like the result of a kindergarten art project--possibly good intentions, but very unskilled execution.The characters have occasional moments of interesting behavior and intriguing characterization, but Bishop forgets the cardinal rule of descriptive writing and good characterization -- \\"show, don't tell.\\" The idea of the \\"Saetan\\" character -- you see what she did there? Saetan ... like Satan, huh? -- is cute, though not revolutionary by any means. However, after his initial introduction, you wonder why the author bothered to draw the comparison.Bishop begins to set up good characters and scenarios and then fails to follow through.Her writing style suffers from the same inconsistency, oscillating between absorbing and juvenile.\\"Inconsistent\\" would be my buzzword for this series. The execution of each concept lacks any sense of subtlety and is taken to an extreme, making the entire series into an apparently unintentional parody."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I've read this book few months back, and still can't decide what to think of it.IMO, the first book Daughter of the Blood was the best, and after that I just started to feel annoyed with this trilogy.The characters, while very interesting, started to be overly melodramatic (this refers mostly to Daemon \\"oh, does she love me, will she love me after all I've done, been...\\" and similar).For me, the most interesting characters were Surreal and Lucivar, and I think that the story would be a lot better if it focused more on them and there story and not just on Jaenelle, whom I didn't find at all believable as a real person (maybe that would be different if we actually had some of hers POVs). She was just too powerful, with almost not a flaw, and everyone who met her liked her instantly...The main conflict between good and evil was also not that believable, almost all of the good guys had one of the three most powerful jewels, and the villains not even one, but still they were that major treat to all of them. The action scenes were just felt contrived, just to point out how really powerful Jaenelle really was and added nothing to the plot.Then there was that Ring of Obedience and other similar stuff.Still, writing style was pretty decent and the world is very interesting with all those interesting races (just wish it was fleshed out a bit more).IMO, this book would be suitable mostly for young teenage girls and everyone who feels like one ;)."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I had never imagined a world so dark and yet so completely compatable with many aspects of this world.

Hamilton...with out the gay sex overtone (and the actual feminist tone of LKH)- with a chunk of wild fantasy thrown in.The lead female character is a typical 'perfect' Mary Sue. In fact, she is the epitome of Mary Sue. She is perfect, beautiful, everyone loves her and she, of course, saves the world. Of for darn sake, can't she at least be a little chunky or something?She suffers neglect and abuse as a child, so I suppose that is supposed to make her likable.The premise is that it is matriarchal society and that women rule. Bah. Mostly they have sex with men whom they put torture devices on their gentitals. Supposedly women have all political power...yet there seem to be plenty of powerful males that take advantage too.Even under female rule there are whorehouses where men can pay to sleep with women.Ah...okay.Where were the warrioress'? Where were the men being seduced and left pregnant?The plot was full of holes and the trilogy could have been written in one book if a good editor took it in hand.Let's just mention that the lead male character, a grown man, falls in love with the female character when she is a child. He gets a hard on for a little girl, I kid you not.So the author makes him go insane for 13 years so the kid can grow up.Let's also mention that the lead male and his brother are so powerful that they can basically 'blow up' people's minds at will. The lead male also can seduce women at will. Yet they spend centuries with with lo-jacks on their gentitals as sex slaves.....The lead male character, pedophilia aside, could have been a wonderful complex character had the author not made so many side trips. By the time he meets his grown up love, he's reduced to staring with longing. Neither really spend any time getting to know each other. They are named soulmates by the author from the beginning, so I guess she decided it was okay for them to have a little awkwardness and then hit the sack.The mentor figure is male. Where is the strong female character?The author has a wonderful imaginination in creating the fantasy world. That's about all I can say that is nice."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I was in a book store looking for a new books to read when a woman showed this to me.

I felt like I was watching a movie...the book made me laugh, cry, and scream in anger (no really, just ask anyone who watched me read it) and sigh in relief.

Because that's all Jaenelle Angelline is. She's beautiful, she's incredibly, unbelievably, soul-crushingly powerful, and everyone loves her at first sight. She's the kind of character a 12-year-old makes up before skipping merrily off to the Neopets roleplaying boards to score herself a hawt b/f.And then of course, there's the angst. Oh so much angst. Poor, poor Jaenelle. Normally I like angst. But there's a point when enough is enough, and it just annoys you rather than making you feel sorry for the character. Given the vast power that Jaenelle commands, you'd think she could easily dispose of her adversaries in the blink of an eye, right? But no, she doesn't want to do that because Big Daddy Saetan tells her that killing is bad, mmkay? For the most powerful witch alive, she's sure wishy-washy. Moreover, for comimg from a supposedly female-dominated society, she's surprisingly okay with letting a male tell her what to do. Oh wait! If she wanted to stand on her own that would make her BAD! And EVIL! You'll note that the villains, Dorothea and Hekatah, do not have male advisors. But all the good, gentle, wonderful members of Jaenelle's clique do. Hmmm.Then there's Daemon. Daemon squicks me. He's a creepy stalker who, no matter how much he tries to deny them and insist he's not like his background character of a cousin Kartane, has pedophilic tendencies. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but Black Widows are a female-only caste, yes? Daemon is one, which makes him a Gary Stu. Saetan as well. A couple of Gary Stus that roar and snarl and threaten, but in the end are paper tigers; they never really DO much of anything. Well, unless you count how Daemon gets aroused by the most bizarre things (Jaenelle gruesomely splatters her would-be rapist all over the room, and now Daemon is hot in the pants? WHAT?), or whines and mopes that Jaenelle is not interested in sleeping with him right NOW NOW NOW. And then there's always Saetan moping and drinking bloodwi--I'm sorry, yarbarah. Because it's just not cool unless you have a pseudo-vampire around.You'll also note that the less-powerful members of Jaenelle's court are merely mentioned, and then shunted off to the background. Jaenelle just keeps them around to look better than she is, like a high-school beauty queen being \\"friends\\" with a less-attractive girl so she looks all the prettier. Unless you have a Green jewel or better, you're not getting more than a brief mention in this series, baby. Oh, and you'd better be a Queen. Or a Queen/Healer. Or the super-special Queen/Healer/Black Widow combo with a side of fries. Because, don't you know? Only the popular and powerful people are important to Jaenelle, duh. Those \\"lesser\\" Blood are all bad. And landens? Animals, really. Not even worth mentioning beyond how unreasonably frightened they are of the Blood, and how half-Blood are discriminated against by everybody.It's sad though, since a lot of these lesser characters are more interesting than Jaenelle and her clique. Like the little girl who was rescued by Kaelas and KaeAskavi. It seems she was just forgotten in favor of more Janelle and Daemon angst, teehee. A lot could have been done with her.I'll finish with this: if you like these books, you'd probably like Twilight too. They're on the same level of bad, with similarly shallow characters to boot."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly, reading it all in one day.

If you are not shopping here, you are missing out."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I have yet to read the book. The only reason I am reviewing it now is because I am tired of the emails from Amazon asking me to review this. Sorry this isn't helpful at all. :D"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I used to be a more prodigous reader of the fantasy genre but stopped for a time. This series was recommended by a friend and I am happy that I took her recommendation.This is a wonderfully written series and I could not put the book down. I would read it late into the night and get up early to read it before work. It is an utterly absorbing, magical read that will entrance you.The series is set in a world where Darkness reigns and a person's power is determined by the color of their Jewels. The realm is a matriarchal society and the Women of the Blood who wear Jewels are dominant over the men because of the magical powers that they are born with and develop. The darker a witches jewels the stronger she is. The Blood Males who wear Jewels can also be extremely powerful, but they are born to serve and obey their Queens and the Women of the Blood.The story is about a vicious and ruthless power struggle between the Realm's two most powerful Queens: Dorothea, the High Priestess of Hayll, and Hekatah, the self-proclaimed Dark Priestess of Hell. Over time these women have become obsessed with power and have used the powerful women and men of the blood who serve them as disposable pawns in their attempt to grab more power. Their courts have become places of darkness and perversion and the women of the blood have become cruel and use their power to demean, infect and harm those around them.The story is also about a young woman whose birth fulfills an ancient prophecy, a witch who is \\"Dream made flesh\\"; Jaenelle Angelline is the prophecy and is born Witch. Jaenelle is extremely powerful, she is fiercely loyal to her friends and family, and she is also dangerous when metting out judgement as Witch. When she is a young girl, Jaenelle's family places her in an asylum due to her power that they do not understand and mistrust. In this institution, she is subjected to horrors which are performed on her as well as other children of the Blood who are inmates there.Jaenelle has the ability to travel between the Realms and into different lands when she is not institutionalized. During her travels she begins meeting and befriending the creatures and people who live there. During her travles she meets Saetan, the High Lord of Hell, who becomes her adopted father. She also has her adopted brother, Prince Lucivar Yaslana and Warlord Prince Daemon Sadi who becomes her Consort. She meets others along her travels who are instrumental in teaching her more about her powers, the Craft, leadership and friendship.The three books follow the evolution of Jaenelle's life and her education in the Craft, her developing friendships with the boyo's and her court of Queens who will serve with and for her, and learning about herself and the events that have shaped her. When she reaches the age of maturity she makes her Offering to the Darkness and becomes the powerful Queen of the Dark Court at Ebon Askavi. During her reign as Queen she knows she must rid the Realms of the cruel darkness that has engulfed it. This also includes cleansing her own people, the Blood, who have become infected with darkness. To take this step, to cleanse the Realm, to protect her people, could mean losing all that she loves. She must make many difficult and painful choices along the way.I can't recommend these books enough and I honestly could not put them down when I began reading them. 5 stars seems insufficient for how truly transporting and well written they are."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"First, allow me to begin by stating this may be one of the best books I have read this year. Since I read on average 3 to 4 books a week (lately it has been between 5 or 6),that I think is really saying something. The story focuses on a bunch of central characters and how they react to the main character, Jeanelle, throughout the various realms. The plot grabs you at the beginning of the book (like two pages in) and keeps you focused until the very end.The story I must say is very complex and deals with various stages of life for both the main character and the supporting main characters, as well as the numerous conflicts they must face. Most would think this story would be too complicated because of the various events that are thrown at you almost every two pages, but it is not. And I think that is widely due to the superb writing of the author. These characters make you feel for them through gain and loss as they struggle to pull the realms time and time again away from chaos.An added plus is I picked up the first three books in one volume!! That was a saving point for me because as soon as I had completed the first novel, I just had to start the next. If I had bought them seperately one at a time, I probably would have went nuts waiting for the next book to arrive. Wheew! Dodged a bullet there. I cannot say enough about how fantastic this book is without spoiling some of the plot. Since I am very new to the fantasy genre (previously strictly paranormal), my opinion may be alittle bit biased, but I thinl I know a good story when I read it. I encourage all to try the BLACK JEWELS TRILOGY."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This book is Amazing. The very first paragraph caught me and the book never let go. I am an avid reader, of all books, and anymore it has become increasingly difficult to find a book with the power to grab your attention in the first 100 pages let alone the first paragraph. I will not sum up the book for you; my only advice would be to buy the book. The best way to describe this book is \\"All Encompasing.\\""},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I do not write reviews but....this was the best book I've read in years!!!! I had a lot of trouble putting it down to go to work and stayed up late to finish it. I can't say enough about \\"The Black Jewels\\"Trilogy. If you like fantasy and the kind of writing that makes the world and the people in it come alive and jump off the page at you..then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I bought this book on a friend's recommendation and feel in love from the first line. Fantastic, complex characters that you'll fall in love with, a world unlike any other I've read in fantasy and that's saying a lot given the number of fantasy novels out there.I really enjoyed having the entire trilogy together as the 2nd and 3rd book really wouldn't do well as stand alones and individually the book are smaller than what I normally read. Together though they read like one tasty, satisfying novel. Erotic without being lewd, complex without being confusing. A must have for any reader of dark fantasy."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"A collection that touches everyone who reads it. A story of devotion to a person that moves you to be greater than yourself. Of men in such awe of their queen that they will stand as her warrior no matter what the risk. Of women so strong that they will stand against society to protect the men they love. A story about abuse, magic, tragedy, and success. I would recommend this book to almost anyone but a small warning.This book takes place in a world divided. Where the powerful magic seeded within the female of the societed can either be protected and nurtured- or destroyed...through rape. It is INDEED gruesome but worth it, every page. Just not a book for the youthful."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"The fact that I actually finished book 2 surprises me because I was disappointed with this author. I think I continued after the first book because there is a great story line here that had a lot of promise. In the first book, there was very little character development except for Daemon - who basically was absent from the second book. And, to be quite frank, parts of Book 1 read like a bad soft porn novel. In the second book there is even less understanding of the main personalities. The character development that does take place is shallow, repetative, and stereotypical - like Lucivar's rougish smile and Saetan's fatherly exasperated chuckles. There is very little dialog in the first book and for the first half of the second book. It makes the main character, Janelle, seem vapid at best. We never \\"see\\" through her eyes, or understand her through her conversations. New people are thrust into the story without any warning or explanation, and after a while, you just don't care anymore. Even the vocabulary chosen for the narration was boring. I felt unattached to most of the characters and, after reading the reviews of the third book, will not continue the trilogy."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I actually found this trilogy pretty good. That being said, even though it didn't end with as much closure as I would have liked, I'm done. Not interested enough to read the sequels. I do have a big problem with all this talk of Dark Fantasy, though. I just don't get it. So, a few of the characters have names based on the words \\"demon\\" \\"lucifer\\" and \\"satan\\"... but they don't really do anything that bad. The High Lord of Hell who has lived like 50,000 years and maybe did some bad stuff in his past somewhere turns out to be nothing more than a doting, somewhat bumbling grandfather... okaaay, so that's \\"Dark\\"? One of the plot points in the books is an adolescent bumbling romance (where one of the characters is supposed to be thousands of years old) that will probably make you feel like someone is scratching a blackboard with their nails... okaaay, so that's \\"Dark\\"? In fact there is a fair amount of bumbling going on throughout. The really really bad guys do so much bumbling that you're never too worried about the ultimate outcome. It's not like there are these characters that you like, that you are rooting for, who do a lot of bad things to people who don't deserve it, making you feel somewhat guilty for liking them. Nothing like that. Even the bad things done to people who do deserve it are few and far between.The darkest aspect of this series is that a lot of the plot revolves around the sexual molestation and abuse of pre-pubescent girls and the horrible torture of men via a ring on their sex organs. I found these things very very disturbing, and I think it's worth warning people about it, but that doesn't make it \\"Dark\\". There are plenty of fiction books set in the modern day world that deal with victims of sexual abuse and how those victims overcome their past etc. But these books are not touted as \\"Dark Fiction.\\" It's just fiction.So there are a lot of words in this book that *sound* dark, like witch, demon dead, hell, sataen, warlock, dark priest, etc, but very little content that earns the title \\"Dark Fantasy\\". In fact, if not for the central themes of sexual abuse and torture, I would say the whole thing has a very strong \\"young adult fiction\\" feel to it--especially the third book. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the majority of 4 or 5 star reviews were by adolescents/college students. That would explain a lot. Certainly, there are interesting ideas and characters and truth be told I don't regret having invested as much time as I did reading these three books. But, I can't give the books a strong recommendation and I'm just not interested in reading what happens next.If you are intrigued by the concept and excited by all the rave reviews, that's great, just don't go into it expecting too much, or you may be disappointed."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This is a great trilogy; however Bishop's writing style becomes a bit redundant by the third book. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this book for some good fictional fun."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"A friend in Adelaide, South Australia, gave me this book to read on the plane for my trip home. I've now read every book in the series and have patiently waited for the continuing books in the series as they've come out. I loved it. I love the dark, slightly twisted world that has been created by Anne Bishop and keep the series on my watch list. This series is among my favorites and I hope to see many more in the years to come."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Fanfiction is a unique phenomenon that is best kept to fanfiction.net and the websites of kids who don't know any better. But when fanfiction actually becomes publishable material, things start go down into a downward spiral. Naturally some people are able to disguise it but why they even bother to do so is odd considering there is a certain hint of the author's fanfiction-itis revealed through the prose and storytelling. The Black Jewels Trilogy doesn't even try and hide that, making its popularity a contradiction.The story involves realms being ruled by Dorothea and Hekatah, two evil witches who run a corrupt matriarchal society where men can become slaves for women at the drop of a hat. This type of slavery involves sex too, but apparently sex is the only real evil in the world because all the villains are doubtlessly into S&M; along with mutilating a guy's genitals. Anything else is apparently unheard of and it comes off as excessive and insipid rather than genuinely traumatic.So now in this warped universe, Jaenelle, the reincarnation of the goddess Witch is born, and the rebellious powers are glad for this savior. But Dorothea and Hekatah will do everything in their power to kill her or ally themselves with her.The writing is something fitting a teenager's fanfiction site, not something publishable. The characters all glower and snarl at each other, and everyone is jumpy or timid in each other's presence. I was appalled at the minimalist approach towards paragraphs, instead with lines like, \\"He was handsome. (line break) He was dangerous. (line break) And he had her in his sights. Oh yes. (line break) She was going to have the time of her life. (end chapter)\\" It's poor writing but it does ensure lots of trees are killed to fatten the book up with illusions of content.Calling these books creepy is like saying Stalin was just some obnoxious cretin. Every single one of the villains is completely sex-depraved, wanting to have sex with anything and everything that moves along with being unable to control these urges. On the other hand, the protagonists are completely gentle, only having meaningful romantic sex despite their bedroom experience and questionable histories. Even then, they have warped tastes though they're painted as saintly paragons. The protagonist Jaenelle, due to being the goddess Witch, is lusted after by the heroes even when she's only twelve. There's one silly scene where the great Daemon Sadi, feared all over for his power and can scare or satisfy someone just by looking at them, actually gets aroused in her presence and has to move away from the prepubescent Jaenelle because he's afraid her head will knock into his...well, you know.Speaking of the heroes, labeling that epithet upon them is like calling the lazy underachievers in your class who have a guaranteed future flipping burgers the valedictorians. Not only are their histories questionable, since one is Saetan, the High Lord of Hell, but they're also grossly incompetent. As an example, you can imagine just how great Saetan is. Well for all his power, he just sits in his little study, twiddling his thumbs and drinking wine even though he possesses enough power to demolish the bad guys like a hot knife through butter, not counting the absurd powers working for him like his butler who is equal to Dorothea and Hekatah in strength. While you can imagine that he has disreputable tendencies being the ruler of Hell, he's actually a total pushover since he whines about how much he can't be a good father to Jaenelle and aside from a few people with bad pasts in Hell, everyone seems a little too happy or at the very least, keeps their mental imbalances to a minimum.It's this constant positive vibe that's unsettling since there is clearly evil on the loose, bad things are happening, but the good guys do nothing to destroy the evil until it's too late, instead fooling around with romance novels and learning how to paint. When the evil does act, everyone reacts like it's the second coming of the apocalypse despite the total heroes' excessive power and resourcefulness, allowing them to counter any difficulty with ease, which does happen. Afterwards, the bad guys are forgotten about until they try yet another half-hearted plan doomed to failure. If these \\"monsters of the week,\\" scenarios were abandoned along with all the inane posturing done by the heroes who have nothing better to do than act cute with each other, the trilogy could have been trimmed into one book or at least replaced with a steady narrative that dispensed with fluff.It becomes frustrating really, when a plot from the first book is considered involving Jaenelle's dysfunctional family, who clearly is emotionally abusing her, perhaps with other abuses going on too given the wretched nature of both this family and the world. At the same time, Daemon is staying there watching over Jaenelle and given his wild personality, you think he'd be putting a stop to this right? No he just sits by.Jaenelle, the savior of the land, is a notorious offender when it comes to the idiocy of the good guys. Here she is portrayed as eventually being able to decimate armies in the blink of an eye but she is consistently passive, moving along at the whims of the other protagonists. For all her glamor as the savior of the land and the strongest sorceress alive, she's weak in personality, unfitting considering her strength which is rarely if ever utilized.Character personalities concerning quirks and archetypes are inconsistent too. Take for example Saetan, who is not only ludicrously powerful but also quite the ladies' man as well as would be expected to be brutal from the hard life he's lived. But his villainy forgotten because he's too busy figuring out how to brew a certain kind of tea or is too busy admiring how cute Jaenelle looks in a dress and his lady killer persona seems a contradiction as he meanders around on a cane from one boring location to the next. However when some promiscuous student of an old friend of his starts flirting with him, then he gets angry.There's another problem, concerning the world building. Daemon and Lucivar are depicted as Eyrien, winged people. But they never use their wings for anything meaningful, only to stretch out and strut around with. We never get any meaningful description of what type of wings these are either. It's almost like the author just wanted winged guys around because winged guys are cool. Other times, there are characters such as the kindred, intelligent wolves, and unicorns. But these characters just again, strut around and never do anything meaningful aside from being there as otherworldly fantasy creatures. Really there was enormous potential lost here. There could have been an Eyrien hierarchal society, where people with feathery wings are depicted as higher than people with bat wings, or different Eyrien societies composed of people of differing wing types, kind of like our society of different ethnic groups. The world could have been layered but instead it comes off as a Neopets infested nightmare.The different realms are also poorly described. I have no idea what Hell is supposed to look like aside from all the Harpies and cute little demon children about, which despite the grisly nature associated with such creatures, are portrayed as everyone else, with no special duties or functions like the original Harpies of Greek myth. Given Saetan's gentility, I imagine Hell as just some elaborately designed cavern with jewels sparkling everywhere and dark nobles flouting about looking beautiful. There is no real indication of what time period the world is supposed to imitate or the level of technology utilized.Other times I found myself frustrated with how often everyone was freaking rich and beautiful. Really, that's actually the premise of the characters: They're all rich, beautiful, preppy, and powerful, subtracting the beautiful point for the bad guys. They can travel to other realms in the blink of an eye, no explanation given. One character Surreal, a murderous prostitute, works at a brothel where they actually have academics discussing poetry there, a library, and all the clientele are usually decent folks. Isn't this just a little too gentle?By the way, the few brutal locations out there are strictly the bad guys' territory, and any good guy that has been associated with them is due to a dark and angsty past or a currently troubling predicament, but there's nothing permanent associated with these locations because once their problems are solved, the good guys are all clean and proper, emotional scars only showing up when it comes to A: The big bad rearing its ugly head again, or B: Posturing over Jaenelle's issues which despite their severity, are given far too little authorial respect since their treatment is emphasized through being beaten over the head with them but not through any real alleviation.Saetan is typified as constantly drinking wine. I understood the intent was to make the character come off as noble and refined but I just thought we had an alcoholic as the main character. It was perhaps prophetic, since later Saetan decides he wants to get as drunk as possible. I wished that he would get drunk, wake up, and figured out he let loose a dirty secret that quickly became the gossip in Hell. Then he would go on a mass purge of the denizens of Hell, impaling people's heads on pikes, and waged war on the living realms, the other subplots quickly forgotten. That would be something worth reading about."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I love this series and anything Ann writes. I loaned my first copy of this book out so many times, I had to order a fresh one for me to keep.Fascinating concept and the characters have become like family to me."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Wow, I really don't understand why so many people like this series. It was cliche and predictable; I could see the ending from a mile away! The characters were weak, and held back the plot of the story (Every freakin' character has unlimited magical powers! The lead female character is such a Mary Sue that I actually thought the author was joking. Also, why is every character unbelievabley gorgeous? That was a big pet peeve of mine while reading the series). I had to force myself to finish the books. BAD BAD BAD. If you are a reader of mature adult fantasy, do not subject yourself to these horrible books (no offense). One last thought...just because the story takes place in \\"hell\\" and has sex in it does not mean it is an \\"adult\\" story. Why did so many reviewers warn of offensive content? I felt like I was reading a children's book! Man, it feels good getting this off my chest."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"As far as I can see, there was nothing to particularly recommend these books. The ideas behind them were nothing special, the writing was clunky, and i found the plot boring and repetitive.

If I were you I'd save my money."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Weak, predictable and boring.I read the first book and decided that I could not be bothered with this level of drab. I found it incoherent and just plain dull. Could not bring myself to pick up volume two."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This trilogy was relatively good. Some of the language used by the author in dialogue and description seemed forced and out of place for the story line. Also, some of the events and/or actions of the characters seemed to not fit for me. Attempting to understand the world created by Bishop was sometimes a daunting task that required me to stop reading and think about who or what a character was. The first two books were a little hard to get into for me, but the third was wonderful and I couldn't put it down. I would buy another novel by Bishop, if only to give her a second chance."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I can't tell you exactly what it is about this trilogy (and The Invisible Ring, a novel that takes place in the same universe) that keeps me coming back. It might be the originality - everything about this series is new and different. It might be the characters. I tend to think that it is the universe itself that Anne Bishop has created - so intricate and detailed!The first book of the trilogy (Daughter of the Blood) was much more gruesome than the other two, so if you are squeamish, push your way past it. It will be worth it!I have only one complaint about this series: all of the likeable female characters tend to follow the stereotype found in so much fantasy today: beautiful but stubborn; proud and bitchy but with a heart of gold. Only Wilhemena doesn't fit this stereotype, and she is my favorite character for it.All in all, an amazing read. I would recommend this to anyone who likes dark fantasy."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I am so far past an avid reader that it borders on insanity. In fact, I would bet I read somewhere between 500-1000 books a year. Having said that, this is one of those rare authors who actually makes me laugh and cry while reading. Bishop's characters are beautifully developed, and wonderfully portrayed. These books pull you in, and keep you there. Definitely one of my favorite authors, and I have read my softcover version of this so often I had to tape the cover."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Good story, but the series ends in disappointment.

But she is writing stories that sing to you page after page of the human condition, of love and suffering and the ever present lesson that \\"everything has it's price.\\" And it's also interesting reading for anyone who has suffered any kind of sexual abuse-the heroine finds her way out of her suffering with grace and does so in a way that is accessible and empathetic. Kudos! Anyway, if you don't own this book, like fantasy and enjoy character driven fiction, this book should be on your shelves."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This is my favorite book of all time!

But as much as I loved those books, nothing compared to when I read Anne Bishop's Black Jewels Trilogy. She takes you into a world of complete imagining, complete with well relatable characters, complex, but rich worlds, and an ever changing story line that keeps you riveted. I won't go into much detail, since when I do I tend to give things away. But if you're an avid fantasy buff, with a added liking for love stories, this is by far one of the greatest reads I've come across. 5 stars easily!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"i've read plenty of fantasy books, but this is the first time i decided to explore a dark fantasy book. so glad i did!! i could not put this book down!

As you become wrapped up in each of the characters, the story twists and turns in order to fabricate a tale of good, evil, love, hate, and innocence. Anne Bishop's writing is cunning and moving; This story will draw you in and have you hooked."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Anne Bishop's extraordinary \\"Black Jewels Trilogy\\" is one of the most original, truly spectacular reads I have had in a long time. I am not a big fan of science fiction or fantasy novels, but I became totally absorbed at the beginning of the first novel, \\"Daughter of the Blood,\\" and remained riveted by Ms. Bishop's narrative until the last page of the thrilling conclusion in \\"Queen of the Darkness.\\"Ms. Bishop has created a unique world and populated it with some of the most unusual characters I have met in literature. This is a world where Darkness reigns and power is determined by the color of one's Jewels. In the hierarchy of the three Realms, Women of the Blood who wear Jewels are naturally dominant because of their innate magical powers. Blood Males who wear Jewels can also be extremely powerful, but they are born to serve their Queens. And magical strength is measured by a person's Jewels - the darker the Jewel's color, the more powerful the possessor.Bishop paints a vivid portrait of two women in a terrible and vicious power struggle. Dorothea, the High Priestess of Hayll, and Hekatah, the self-proclaimed Dark Priestess of Hell, were created to be noble caretakers of the Realms. They have each perverted their Craft and their purpose, infected those who serve them, and threaten to destroy the Realms to fulfill their insatiable greed for power.The plot revolves around a young woman whose birth fulfills an ancient prophecy. Jaenelle Angelline is born Witch. She is the \\"dream made flesh.\\" By the age of five she is extremely powerful, fiercely loyal, tremendously tender and capable of terribly destructive anger. This young girl-child is also an outcast amongst her own people and has no idea who or what she is or will be. Most of her birth family, unable to appreciate her exceptional powers and abilities, believe she is mad and she is periodically put in an asylum where horrors are performed on the children who are inmates there. When she is not institutionalized, Jaenelle travels between Realms into different lands, befriending the creatures who live there - from her adopted father, Saetan the High Lord of Hell, to her adopted brother, Prince Lucivar Yaslana, and Warlord Prince Daemon Sadi, who will become more important to her than any living soul. Also included in her inner circle are the demon-dead, unicorns, harpies, Healers and Black Widow Queens, Kindred, etc.. They will all impart wisdom to her and teach her aspects of the Craft. They all have important roles to play in the trilogy.The three books trace Jaenelle's life, her education in the Craft, her developing friendships, the terrible hardships she undergoes in her attempts to discover who and what she really is and her efforts to escape from the evil forces that threaten to destroy her. When Jaenelle finally reaches maturity, makes her Offering to the Darkness and becomes Queen of the Dark Court at Ebon Askavi in the Realm of Karleer, she is faced with Realms in chaos and the threat of terrible war and destruction. The Blood, corrupted by the wicked Priestesses must be cleansed. To do this and save everyone and everything she cares for, Jaenelle must make a terrible and shocking decision.Anne Bishop's prose is beautifully crafted, deliciously rich and evocative. Her storytelling is nothing short of top-notch. The author upends the stereotype of Darkness and shows the reader, time and again, how exquisite the Dark can be. Her wry wit is ever present and the narrative is spellbinding. This series is outstanding and I cannot recommend it highly enough! An easy 5 Stars!JANA"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"The Black Jewels Trilogy is one of the most fascinating and spellbinding fantasy series I have ever read. Most important, readers must read this trilogy in its entirety in order to fully appreciate it. In this novel, Anne Bishop creates a supernatural matriarchal society controlled by witches and portrays an interesting view of male and female roles in this type of environment. The story centers around a young girl, Jaenelle, thought to be a living myth who would restore a culture being lost during a time of corruption. The series portrays Jaenelle's development from witch to queen from the perspective of three males who would play an important part in her life. Not for the squeamish, Bishop generates a very dark, sad, and disturbing mood filled with horror, sex, and violence...but she does such a great job with character development that the reader begins to empathize with the characters and appreciate their quest for happiness in this dark world. This novel has everything-action, romance, drama, comedy. I gave the Black Jewels Trilogy 5 stars because (for me) it was a fantastic read - I was unenable to tear myself away from the book and I became so engrossed with the characters, I was literally sad to read the last page."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I love to read but I takes a hell of a book to hold me for 1,204 pages. I would suggest the Black Jewels Trilogy to any lover of fantasy.Bishop creates a wonderfully unique world of &quot;The blood&quot; where the strongest are powerful female witches. They rule all the kingdoms in each realm and the men of the blood have an inherent need to serve them.The story begins with a prophecy of a witch that will come and bring an end to the corruption that has plagued the realms.Thousands of years later we meet Jaenelle. A mysterious child that has powers beyond the comprehension of those that encounter her, mainly the stories three heroes; Saetan, Lucivar and Daemon. I am sure the similarities to the names of the devil was on purpose. Saetan is the high lord of hell and the other two are his sons.Anyway if you can get past the fact that all the good guys are from hell. And Bishops overuse of the word snarl, your are in for a real treat.Black Jewels trilogy is a colorful layered adventure of rich well developed characters, a dark powerful plot and even a romatic tale that is not offered up as a cheap lighthearted relief, but is etched right into the violence and pain that takes place."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"In my experience, the more impressive a book is, the harder it is to review. You want your review to do justice to a truly great book, knowing full well that a few hundred words can never truly express your feelings. Now, I find myself trying to do justice to not one fabulous book, but three of the most original, unique, and unbelievably amazing books I have ever read. With The Black Jewels Trilogy (consisting of Daughter of the Blood, Heir to the Shadows, and Queen of the Darkness), Anne Bishop has taken the literature of dark fantasy to heights I never even dreamed of. She has created a universe I can barely begin to describe, a realm of kingdoms ruled by women, in the form of witches, priestesses, and Black Widow queens, where the strongest of men are forced into the role of consort to the most vindictive of mistresses. Bishop turns good and evil upside down in this masterful literary vision, giving us heroes the likes of Saetan the High Lord of Hayll, his sons Daemon Sadi and Lucivar, and one very special and very powerful young lady named Jaenelle Angelline.Ancient prophecies have foretold the coming of a powerful witch, one who would in reality be not a mere human female but &quot;dreams made flesh,&quot; nothing short of Witch herself. She comes in the form of a tremendously brave little girl, whom we first meet at the age of twelve or so when she comes to Hayll seeking instruction in the Craft from none other than Saetan himself. Human beings don't just come over into the land of the demon-dead, and Saetan quickly recognizes who this young girl truly is and will become. Jaenelle is terrible at the simple magic of the Craft, yet the true strength of her powers is almost infinite. She refuses to speak about her home life, for reasons that gradually become quite clear. Treated as an outcast by her family, she is subject to occasional stays in Briarwood. Briarwood is not what it seems; this &quot;hospital&quot; is in fact a place of unspeakable evil. Briarwood is in essence a poison, and there is no cure for Briarwood. Happenstance lands Daemon Sadi in the home of Jaenelle's grandmother as a consort, but even his undying love and recognition of whom and what Jaenelle really is cannot save her from a most brutal and unforgivable of fates. Daemon, like his estranged father Saetan, does wear the black jewels, however, and he uses all of his magical powers to save the physical life of Jaenelle, falling into the pits of the Twisted Kingdom of insanity in the process.Saetan claims the girl as his own, and under his care she does gradually recover, but her innocence is gone. As the story progresses, she grows into her role as Witch, gathering among her inner circle the young Black Widow queens of adjacent lands as well as the Kindred, animals who wear the Blood jewels but are not recognized by the &quot;enlightened&quot; rulers of the realm of Terreille - high priestess Hekatah and the dark queen Dorothea, two of the most nefarious and thoroughly corrupt souls ever created by the hand of man or woman. The fate of Daemon, one of the most unique and fascinating characters I've ever encountered, is left hanging in the balance over the course of the entire second book of the trilogy, and his eventual return rekindles a needed spirit of innocent romance to a story defined by darkness and evil. Once Jaenelle makes the Dark Offering and ascends the throne of Ebon Askavi, establishing a Dark Court consisting of the most powerful men and women in the realms, the final conflict of good and evil draws nigh. While the question of victory is, one supposes, never much in doubt, Bishop creates a magical sense of suspense and hesitation on the part of the reader as he/she embarks on the final steps of this wondrous journey. The most beloved of characters suffer much, and the fate of Jaenelle herself is very much left in doubt.I can't really even begin to describe the wonder and magic this trilogy possesses. It is quite unlike anything I have ever read before, featuring wholly unique and fascinating characters in droves. There is no strict demarcation between good and evil here, as Bishop stands tradition on its head, giving even minor characters more life than I can find in most of my fellow human beings. Some may refer to the romance elements of this story in a condescending manner, and some might look askance at the love Daemon Sadi feels for a twelve-year-old Jaenelle, but this is no prurient tale of lust. The love these remarkable characters feel for one another is of remarkable, noble depth in all manner of different forms, and the ultimate romance of Daemon and the adult Jaenelle is one of almost heart-wrenching innocence.If you are searching for something different, something that will completely captivate you in the form of a world unlike any you have yet encountered in your literary journeys, The Black Jewels Trilogy stands ready to redefine your very conception of the literature of dark fantasy. This is fantasy that should appeal to women as well as men, for this is not just another work of fantasy built around warlike dwarves, ethereal elves, and heroic battles fought by stereotypical male characters. The Black Jewels Trilogy is literature of the highest order, more than earning author Anne Bishop the title I now personally bestow upon her: the Queen of Dark Fantasy."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"These books will draw you in, I don't think it was a slow start, but I've read Jordan and THAT is slow. Within 3 chapters, if not sooner, you will be hooked. I can truly say that no other fantasy book has ever captivated me the way these books have.I originally bought them as separate books and in less than 3 years they have utterly fallen apart (taped together, ratty looking books that are still being read). They have been read that many times, by me and friends I have convinced to give them a try. They too have fallen for the characters and plot, even those who hate fantasy and have frequently made fun of me for my love of all things fantasy.Some complain that it seems that the \\"evil\\" people are \\"good\\" because of the names of the main characters. I would disagree, I think that is really just part of Anne Bishop's ability to make you think. Just because the main male characters are called Saetan, Daemon, and Lucivar doesn't make them evil. Anne Bishop made REAL people out of characters. Good doesn't always mean all sweetness and light, it also means knowing when to take a stand and not being nice about it. It also means looking beneath the surface, because those who seem to have the best intentions may, in fact, be out to get you.I have now ordered this combined version in the hopes of restoring my collection. I will say that the ending left me wanting SOOO much more. I was craving a more satisfying end, but isn't that what a really good story is about? Not everything turns out how you want it to, and Anne Bishop has included that in this story. I still wanted and craved the \\"happily ever after\\" perfect ending where everyone goes back to happy, quiet lives. Do we ever grow out of that?As an adult I could truly appreciate so much of her story. I would, however, monitor how young of a child I gave it to. It is a bit erotic and explicit. I didn't mind and in fact the eroticism made me all the more pleased with the books. For an adult it is truly a full set that fulfills every craving and desire we have in fantasy books."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"A very interesting fantasy series. The first book in the series (Daughter of the Blood) is by far the best.What makes this trilogy interesting is the whole fantasy world that Anne Bishop constructs (a system of magic/witchcraft based on Jewels... basically the darker the Jewels the more powerful the witch) and a whole host of well integrated fantasy characters (unicorns, Eyriens, harpies, etc).And the main characters are very interesting and complex as well (Lucivar, Saetan, Daemon, Janelle) my favorite being Daemon in the first book.Now her comes my criticisms of the series... The first book was awesome, and especially how it revelled in the sadism of the Daemon character. But after the first book Daemon is pansified.Moreover, the author has a hard time making her characters realistic in the sense that hero/heroines are always monolithically good and the villians are always monolithially bad.The author also gets incredibly graphic, sensual and brutal some moments, and then practically censors the next sensual or brutal incident. Some consistency would be desirable.It would also be nice to have an explanation of why it is that despite that fact that hero and heroines have so much power and the willingness to brutally use it, they still can't effectly deal with the villians in this series till the end of the third book.All in all I would give the first book a 4, the second a 2.5 and the third a 3."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I have to hand it to Ms. Bishop in developing one of the most perfectly paced fantasy novel series I've ever read. I've probably averaged reading about 30-40 fantasy/sci-fi novels a year over the past few decades, but I cannot honestly recall the last time I have so thoroughly enjoyed a fantasy series. Everything about this story fits perfectly, the setting (while using many familiar sounding names) is unique and not what I expected, the characters are allowed time to evolve and grow, the romance (so sue me, I'm a sucker for that stuff) develops far better than most romantic sub-plots and never feels forced or even remotely clich&eacute;, and there is a constant shift and development of the story that keeps it from ever growing stale or boring.If there was one thing I was worried about going into reading these novels, it was the description of the series being a dark fantasy. I like dark novels well enough I guess, but I often get tired of authors crafting this downward spiral that hurls the protagonists ever deeper along a path of angst and despair until the very last moment when they finally prevail against the twisted manipulations the evil antagonists have been leading them along for the length of the book.It's refreshing for an author to turn those tables a little bit. While there are some pretty sadistic (pun intended) and terrible events that take place, even to our beloved 12 year old Jaenelle in the first novel, for every act of depravity is one of kindness and love. Bishop does not force us down this path of continued despair, but lets us breathe relief every bit as often as she attempts to appall us. What's more, the protagonists often discover plots against them fairly soon and not just take revenge every bit as harsh as the actions planned against them, but often launch their own plots in return that catch the enemy off guard. So while a lot of the subject matter in the book may be dark and often gruesome, the story itself didn't feel even half as dark as a lot of other series out there that shy away from certain depraved acts this one embraces.If there is one thing about the series I didn't care for, it was that there a numerous huge jumps in the timeline of the series where several times we are asked to shift months and years ahead in the lives of the characters. These jumps forward definitely serve a purpose as they allows for the addition of several characters and enhances the sense of belief of how some of them grow and change without us having to know all the details, but it broke up the continuity a little too much for my preference.As a side note, I'm not sure how many potential readers catch this or not, but there is a fourth book after this one titled \\"Dreams Made Flesh\\" that is a set of four short stories and is an absolute must read. Like most, I read it after the originally trilogy. However, some might prefer from a timeline perspective to buy \\"Dreams Made Flesh\\" along with the Black Jewels trilogy and intersperse it with them, reading the first and third short stories after the first book of the trilogy (they occur before it in the timeline, but answer questions that are best left vague in the first book to enjoy it more,) the second short story takes place between the second book and third books so can be read then, and the last short story takes place immediately after the trilogy ends."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Sigh....I have mixed feelings about this series. Anne Bishop has many good ideas here, including a truly original magic system (with the Jewels and the Blood). She has constructed many varied and interesting races, and has created a unique villain and method of threat. The idea that Dorothea and her Hayllians, as members of a race with millenia-long lifespans, are able to prepare the territories of the shorter-lived races for conquest by means of a \\"subtle cultural poisoning\\" that unfolds so slowly--over the course of centuries--that the shorter-lived races can't see what is happening until it's too late--is one that I found intensely interesting and convincing. The idea of the Abyss as the source of all power and life--and as such, the members of Bishop's land venerate Mother Night and the Darkness--was also intriguing, as was the idea that some of her intelligent animals could also be Blood. I found the character of Daemon Sadi, who has been waiting centuries for his prophesied lover, to be one of the most fascinating in the series. Like I said, this trilogy was chock-full of good ideas.And yet...and yet...and yet...I felt that in the end, this trilogy ultimately failed to live up to its potential. For all the interesting trappings, this trilogy was essentially a Mary Sue adventure wrapped in a pretty cover. Her characters, even Sadi, all felt somehow not quite three-dimensional. I was unable to distinguish many members of Jaenelle's court from each other. The various territories also failed to stand out--there was Terreille, and Ebon Askavi, and Kaeleer, and uh.... At times the threats that faced Jaenelle just felt ludicrous and over-the-top--I never really \\"bought\\" the concept of Briarwood, for example--and it felt like characters such as Surreal and Titian and so on should be doing more, being more, than they were. It was intensely frustrating to me because, as I said previously, Anne Bishop does have *really good* ideas, but I felt that she simply lacked the skills to develop them to their full potential. Her reach exceeded her grasp. In some ways--and I know I stand alone on this--I preferred THE INVISIBLE RING to this trilogy, precisely because it is less ambitious--she sets her sights on a goal that is more within her abilities, and doing so, succeeds there where I feel she fails here.I hope she continues writing in this world. Perhaps as she continues to explore this world and these ideas, and maybe gains more familiarity with it, her writing will gain the depth and substance that I feel it lacks now. Even if it doesn't, I would still not mind seeing more of it; the books aren't *bad,* just overly ambitious, and ambition is not always a bad thing, even if unrealized."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"These books were amazing! I bought them in June and finished all three in one week! I just re-read them again a few weeks ago and I can't tell you enough how much I loved them! And after you read these I highly suggest you read Dreams Made Flesh. Ties in alot of short stories to the three main books. In my opinion, even if you don't like sci-fi or fantasy (which I don't), these books are a great read!!!!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This is a big, fat read that will be (or ought to be) enjoyed by most adult fans of fantasy fiction as long as they don't get uptight about the theme. Yes, the good guys are what you normally think of as the bad guys, there is sex and violence (sometimes simultaneously) and there's role reversal and demons drinking blood and so forth. It's not your average wizards 'n warlocks fantasy, that's for sure. And the story spans multiple parallel worlds, which takes a while to get the hang of. But once you're into it, you have to stay to the end, and that's the mark of a good read.As other reviewers have pointed out, there is a lot of repetition of the same words and phrases but you probably won't notice unless someone draws your attention to it, after which you will notice each and every repetition of the verb \\"to snarl\\". Live with it, and any other minor flaws you come across, and you'll enjoy it. Unless you have strong ethical or religious objections to the good guys - and the bad guys, come to think of it - being demons, that is. If so, you really shouldn't have bought the book, should you?This is not a deep, meaningful read, and I think almost everyone has observed that aside from the phrase repetitions, the world and how it works is far better defined and more inventive than most of the characters, the really good characters lack a decent back story, and the work as a whole, despite its length, is a bit on the lightweight side intellectually. As long as you know that and you aren't expecting the book to deliver more than it intends, you shouldn't be disappointed. It's the first time I've read a work of \\"dark fantasy\\" - I didn't even know the genre existed - and so it was intriguing to see accepted conventions turned on their heads. Personally I'm happy to return to worlds in which the good guys always wear white and the demons get their well-deserved desserts, but this was still a fascinating trip to the Dark Side and more enjoyable than I might have expected."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Truly one of my favorite books of all time. The characters are perfect. I'd read anything about them just to hear more about their lives, feelings, and thoughts. Even the minor characters have attached hooks in my heart. I had taken this book out of the library and after reading two pages into it I knew I had to run out and buy this book as soon as possible. This book grabbed me and sucked me into the lives and minds of the characters. I can't even count how many times I've read and reread this book. Excellent, wonderful, a feel great emotional ride. Awesome."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"You'll be happy you read the rest of the series. I have to agree with debeehr about the lack of depth in both the characters and the plot. Hence, why I barely made it through the first book. The book does gain momentum, but it never reaches its full potential. A good read, nevertheless."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Okay, so it's not Salinger and it doesn't involve the dust bowl or the oppression of French peasants, but this is the greatest book ever written. It will make you laugh and cry and forget to breathe. The worst thing I can say about this book is: don't start reading it if you have to work in the morning. There are plenty of reviews that summarize the book, another summary from me would be redundant. Don't read the summary, buy this book, read this book, you will love this book.I read chronically, I wander the halls at work with a book in hand, I accepted my current job at a pay cut because I'd have time to read at work. My subject matter of choice is just about anything. I've read all the \\"classics\\" in several languages and this book is still better. It is fresh and engaging. This is the first book I've read in years that actually managed to surprise me. If I found a Genie in a bottle and he offered to let me go live in any book in the world, this would be the one I would live in. The Blood are brutal and brilliant and alive. Reading about Bishop's world will make you hungry, it will make you want to live a bigger brighter life without making you hate the one you have. I hate reviews that ramble forever and really don't tell me anything, and now I've gone and written one of them. So, I'll just say, Read This Book, it is much better than this review :) and I apologise for my discoherent ranting."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Wow. THE BLACK JEWELS TRILOGY by Anne Bishop is imaginative and utterly fascinating. The book is over 1,000 pages, which I read in 3 days. Actually, I couldn't tear myself away from the book, it was that engrossing. A fantasy based on Hell, THE BLACK JEWELS TRILOGY is set in a world similar to ours, except it is a warring matriarchal society ruled by witches, many of whom control men and other witches through sexual deviancy. There are three heroes in this book: Saetan (the dead father and mentor), Lucivar (the angry winged fighter and brother), and Daemon (the sadistic pleasure slave and lover). The heroine is Jaenelle Angelline, the abused young girl who grows up to be Witch, beloved and most powerful queen of all witches. The unconditional love that binds them together is touching, and makes you want to read more and more about these fascinating characters as they grow together and face war. Seriously, I don't think 1,000 pages is enough (!!!); I could have happily read more. The story, however, isn't for everyone: there is a lot of sexual torture in this book (not too graphic), as well as severe violence. I cried a couple times reading this, especially when it came to attacks on the Kindred. If you can handle the fact that a lot of characters die, you'll be okay. One other (good) thing I'd like to point out is while this book isn't a romance per say, it is rather romantic, with a delicious and frustrating love story as the major thread holding the trilogy together. PS. I just found out it does have a sequel (big fat yeah!!!) called DREAMS MADE FLESH."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Ok, the series has its problems. I don't like the \\"kindred\\" - I find them very annoying. Don't like the secondary characters either. I hate it when we have to read through sections of the villains plotting against Jaenelle...it's juvenile and condescending, as if the author has to spell out for the readers what is going on, when everything is actually really obvious. \\"Look how evil the bad guys are! They smirk!\\" And everyone in the book needs to exclaim \\"Mother Night\\" or some such nonsense every time one of the females acts quirky or Jaenelle, who they know is supergirl, does something powerful.Now. I really like the world from the story. I love Daemon and Saetan. I am fond of Lucivar and Jaenelle. I enjoy their interactions immensely. The first one is definitely my favorite and I would actually rate it 4 stars."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I'm a big fan of fantasy novels, a la Kushiel series, etc, and this trilogy is every bit as good!Another alternate world, where women rule, and men are treated as slaves to their ruler's every whim. The Blood, holding powers vast and dangerous, the males have grown stronger than their female rulers, and are waiting for a Queen they can serve without being beaten and degraded. A prophesy, telling of the arrival of one such queen.... and she's a little girl.Anne Bishop brings her worlds to life, with cruel and cold women, drunk on power; sensual men, who delight in destruction, waiting for the chance to overthrow those who they hate, a young girl, wise beyond her years, who will inspire love and devotion in their hearts -- and spark a war that will span three kingdoms, even to Hell itself.This is an excellent version of the book to buy, with all three volumes wrapped up in one. At least you'll never lose one of the books! Also a benefit, as the first and second novels end on a bit of a cliffhangar, so it's a relief to have the next one close at hand. Anne Bishop paints a world at once real and comletely fantasical, with a multitude of races, and amazing powers, infinite cruelty, and enduring love. She effortlessly weaves together complex storylines, somehow resolving them all into a complete and complex whole. The result is a magnificent book that you will not want to put down. Amazing."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Having read all these books, I was a little disappointed at the end of the trilogy--mostly because of my high expectations due to the glowing reviews that the triolgy had garnered here on Amazon.The premise of the books is interesting--a dysfunctional (male witches are forced to wear penis rings that enslave them to ruling female witches) matriarchal society of witches and warlocks, both human and animal, is saved by a \\"super-witch\\" who is brought to life through the dreams (read: ideals) of the oppressed in the society. The setting is a combination of traditional high fantasy with 19th century victorian trappings.Other notables: the \\"good guys\\" share names like Saetan, Daemon and Lucivar (although, disappointingly, the \\"bad guys\\" are not named Jesus, Moses or Peter) and, for good measure, are mostly undead.Unfortunately, the book suffers from romance novel cliches (sexy, powerful, beautiful males saving sexy, powerful, beautiful damsels in distress and vice-versa) and certain uses of language that, after the first 100 or so pages, make one want to smack one's head against a hard surface repeatedly. Readers: you know what I am talking about--\\"too softly\\" and \\"snarled\\" are the main offenders here. I won't even get into \\"snarly\\" (shudders).Instead of being used sparingly for effect (I mean, does anyone 'snarl' that often, other than werewolves? If so, I recommend a trip to the vet to get your rabies shot updated.), these phrases are used so frequently that the reader is left whimpering in terror at future (and inevitable) uses of the phrases as the story progresses.Fans of fantasy will have no real doubt who wins in the end and will probably enjoy at least parts of the series. However, the romantic cliches and the hyperbolic and oft repeated descriptive language mars the overall effect. That said, I suspect teens will love the books for their vivid portrayals of antihero protagonists. Older readers will have to decide whether wading through the clumsy writing in order to follow the narrative is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Wow. I just keep saying that when I think about this trilogy. The world in which it takes place is so complex and so well-crafted that I would place it right up there with Frank Herbert's Dune series. Yeah, it's that good.Two things prevented me from giving it 5 stars: 1. the complexity hits you hard and fast, no easing you into things, so it took a good 50+ pages to become immersed in the story (not that it isn't worth it, mind you), and 2. I'm not sure how to put this, and it really is as much of a compliment as a drawback... but, there are a few fundamental elements in the book that make perfect sense when you're reading it and don't seem at all silly or farfetched, until later when you start thinking about it out of context or you're trying to explain it to someone else... then you get the vague sense that you may have, very cleverly, been duped. Maybe what I'm trying to say is that some of the premises on which this fictional world are built, are not as elegant or maybe just don't resonate as strongly with me as a book I would give 5 stars.At any rate I still couldn't put the darn thing down, and kept sneaking in reading time whenever possible until I finished it, then I immediately ordered the follow up books. So, obviously, my minor objections are really inconsequential.One side note: the sheer size and weight of this book gave me a serious case of \\"reader's thumbs\\"... you know when your thumb joints start to ache and the fleshy part between your thumb and index finger gets raw from holding a book too long? Yeah, so, you may want to consider buying the individual books rather than the 3-in-1 version."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"While I cannot hope to write as graceful a review as every other person before me has, I will try to tell you what I can about this book, and why is should be part of your collection.The book (though there are actually three combined into one lovely volume) is about a very original world. I won't delve too deep into it, because part of the fun is figuring it out as you go, getting all the tidbits and making your own dreams of it. But, this world, this is what grabbed me the most. It's not like all the other fantasy books I've read; where there's always the set 'bad guy' and the 'good guys' and oh woe is me, someone must save us all.While that concept is present in this book, it is not drawn out and used as the only tagline. There are so many other pieces to this great piece of writing!Beyond the world, there are the characters. The deliciously real characters who I myself end up crying for, and getting angry about. Anne Bishop really draws you in and you start to know them so well... there are so many things about them, you feel like you could walk past them on the street. They do things that you think they would do, that you know is what that character would want to do. It is all very well done, gracefully, and well-fleshed so that they are believable, likable, and in some cases, absolutely despicable.The plot is wonderfully twisted. There are so many strands of it that are to be pieced together, it's like a treasure hunt. And each chapter that gives you another lead, another piece... it's so lovely. And then a few things click, and you mentally go 'ooooh, that's why he did that!' And the way all the conflicts meet up in the end, how everything comes together so well; it's a piece of art.And the romance, of course. My boyfriend stuck out his tongue and refused when he'd heard me mention that, though I know he was reading it when I slept... but it is a focal point. Enough that women will swoon, but not enough, I think, to turn men away from reading and enjoying this book.With all the different characters, situations, and happenings in this book, there will surely be a thing for you to love and connect with, something to draw you in. If you give it a chance, I can assure you, you will not be disappointed. So... read some more reviews, think it over, and then do it, and enjoy reading about the life of the SaDiablo line, and all those who are drawn into their plight... :)"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"True, the Black Jewels Trilogy is a very dark fantasy trilogy with a hint of bondage. Especially the first book has a violent theme. People are being hurt, abused, whipped and even raped. But somehow this magnificent writer succeeds despite these scenes of horror to make it a story about hope, of doing the right thing, and most of all about love. Fatherly love, brotherly love and the love between a man and a woman. It is just wonderful.The characters are fun, warm, scary and lovable all at the same time and impossible to forget once you get to know them. The trilogy as a whole gives you an equal amount of tragedy, love, hurt and laughter. A painful but pleasurable read. It is not a book for children and neither for the squeamish readers. But I will recommend them to any one else.In my opinion. this trilogy as well as the sequel \\"Dreams Made Flesh\\" are the best fantasy books I have ever read and I look thoroughly forward to reading the next book in the series which is scheduled for release in 2008.And a note about the names of the characters: Saetan, Daemon, Lucivar. Do not be fooled or scared. Remember there is also a Lady Angelline - in other words, these books are not, I repeat NOT about worshipping the devil. The names just give it all a twist.Read the books - and make sure to buy them as well as they are the sort of books that you will want to reread every once in a while."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I read the black jewels trilogy on the recommendation of a friend. Unfortunately I find that the writing is very uneven, and there is not much continuity. It feels somewhat like a mixture of Anne Rice and Jacqueline Carey, with none of the finesse of either.It would probably appeal to readers of fantasy/romance novels like Cristine Freehan. There is not much intricacy in the plots, the S&M; seem to be thrown in without much thought and the characters have powerful emotions but lack depth or wit.I do not recommend this book as a good fantasy novel."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I was very dissapointed. The whole idea of the book is great, but the book is just a big dissapointment.

As others have said the prose of often quite beautiful, and I expected it to draw me in at any minute, but it never quite did. There was at least one other point in the story where the brutality actually had me gagging, and I put the book down for at least a week to recover.There is a fair amount of only slightly less nauseating, senseless brutality, sort of masquerading as sensuality.Reading the first book, I found myself wondering if the author hated men and/or was into sado-masochism.All of the second book and most of the third made me feel like I was reading a \\"Harlequin Romance\\" rather than the \\"critically acclaimed\\" books that these claimed to be.I mean, really, the waiflike, emaciated, often injured or ill heroine that big strong men will give their lives for her... the hero who has to come back from the \\"twisted kingdom\\" (insanity) to be with her... it's just a little too too, don't you think?I do realize that this is fantasy, however for anyone with a religious background (most of whom probably wouldn't read this anyway) the not-even thinly veiled attempt at make Saetan a warm and fuzzy being, as well as his sons \\"Lucivar\\", and \\"Daemon\\" being heros of the story... and that the \\"Demon dead\\" and Hell itself being okay places... well... some could easily find this offensive (and I will admit I had a hard time with it.)For me this was far from the \\"imaginative\\" set of characters that one reviewer called them.

Anne Bishop is a wonderful writer who, even though is writing about a different place, alows the reader to connect with the main characters, and the way she writes her stories, it makes it seem like you're really in one of the three relms living with Janelle and her kindred friends."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"It is really all I can say about this trilogy.At every step of this series I was intrigued. there was nota single moment of boredom. it was truely fascinating! I am not going to write a complete description, you can read other reviews for that. this trilogy is unlike any other I have read and I recommend it for any who love sci-fi/fantasy."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"It was trite. There were a few catch frases of the book that i couldn't stand to see by the end because they were used on almost every page, i.e. \\"Hell's Fire!\\" etc. etc. Every character seems to respond to things in the same way, and really ended up lacking true personality in some basic ways. I am also very bothered by the lack of backround information. Normally i don't have a problem figuring things out, but I am half way through the second book and I still don't really know who is related or what any of the places are. It needs a map and a family tree or character guide in it or something, because there is not enough backround given to really understand any of that. She made up an entire fantasy world, and expects me to just know where everything is. WELL IT's MADE UP! HOW AND I SUPPOSED TO FIGURE THIS STUFF OUT IF SHE DOESN'T TELL ME??!?! There is just something missing.I read it after reading Jaqueline Carey's Kushiel series, and thought it did not come close to the depth and eloquent style Carey has. The plot line was predictable, but interesting enough, and I will probably finish it, but never read it again."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"A completely believable world that draws you in from the first chapter. A dramatic yet deeply personalized story with excellent character development. What I love most about this book is the unique world Anne Bishop has created and the opportunity to live and ponder the ethical and emotional dilemmas she so expertly presents."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"If you like cheesy romance and S&M; you'll probably like this one.This book has some good characters and a very interesting world. The design for magic was well thought up and implemented.It did, however, have a few problems.This book has difficulty portraying males. What they say and do is somewhat off the mark. Unfortunately, the author was not able to keep their dialogue and actions consistent with what men actually say, think and do. This happens because of the author's repetitive injections of sexual tension and fear. Emotion is a great tool but this collection is somewhat over-the-top. Every action, decision, event is fraught with emotional dilemmas, hesitation and irritating sayings like \\"mother dark\\", \\"darkness protect us\\". It's just too much! When the plot finally plods forward again, a sense of relief washes over you. Kate Elliot is able to use emotion and tension in a much more effective manner (Crown of Stars). If you are looking for well designed relationships, emotion and use of character look elsewhere.Some will like this, some will hate it. I didn't hate it, but I wouldn't recommend it to people who really like George R.R. Martin, Gene Wolfe, Kate Elliot, Robbin Hobb or Sara Douglas."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I absolutely loved the idea behind the book...however, the story is very shallow. When I finished the first book I realised there was nothing to look forward to in the sequel...! Yes the character of Saetan is charming and funny, but that is it. There is no plot, no intrigue, you just follow the evolution of the different characters. The heroine left me indifferent ( didn't hate or love her), she is just boring. No suspense, so predictable. I ended up skipping sentences, than paragraphs, finally whole pages!!! Not worth the trouble."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"It was great to have the three books in one. No delay, right on to the next. Anne Bishop is a new author for me and I enjoyed immensely the story in places I would not have imagined. Characters were well developed, but not hard to follow. Many tortuous twists and unexpected events. Her ending left me wanting to find out more. I don't know if there a 4th but I would read it if so. She has quite an imagination and created a compelling read about strong women and their strong men. Only weakness might be the romance angle but I remained hopeful to the end."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I'm going to start my review with an overall feeling - reading the book itself was like being submersed in lukewarm water. No big thrills, not heart racing for the characters plight, no tear-jerking sentiments or feeling of connection with the characters...Don't get me wrong, I liked reading it. Like I said, I don't often read - I get too sucked into it, and never get to what I need to do. My usual choice of books don't involve fantasy (even though I love fantasy), and certainly not fantasy that is definitely not meant for all ages. So I'm glad to have started with this book. But we'll get to that...I had a lot of problems with the book - first of all, the moment I met Jaenelle, I hated her! The moment you meet her, already one of the characters gives her a nickname and is captivated by her eyes! Oh, her frickin' eyes! They have all her conversations FOR her. If you don't know what I mean, something along the lines like this - She looked at him with her haunted sapphire eyes. She was pleading with her eyes. He could see something behind those eyes. THOSE EYES!! - Every conversation, just look at her eyes, and they speak for her! And the author CONSTANTLY talked about \\"Dreams made flesh\\" or \\"Everything has a price.\\" It was like - give it a REST!! Which is why I had such a problem with the second book. It should have been called, \\"Jaenelle - the Teenage Years.\\"I like the character, Daemon, which is why I kept reading. Even though I didn't like Jaenelle, I wanted to see what happened with Daemon. Bishop did disappoint me with some things with him which I won't spoil, but I'll say I think it would have worked better keeping it in other character's perspective instead of giving us insight into what he was doing from his point of view. I also loved Lucivar...not so much when he was interacting with Jaenelle, but I wish, wish, wish she could have developed his character more, because he seemed so...unfinished. And he intrigued me the most because of the snippets of personality we saw with him. I felt like it was Lucivar: as seen with Jaenelle! Not as in depth with him as with Daemon, and HIS life was pretty much wrapped around Jaenelle, too, but it wasn't quite as BLATANT as Lucivar.I won't keep going, because I have a lot of complaints, but just finish with my main annoyance with this book. She has so much that she can work with, and she doesn't even touch it!! Like, I thought, in the second book, as she made such an effort to have Saetan comment that there were two triads of power in the group of teenagers, something would COME of that, but she did NOTHING with it. The very characters in said triads of powers were hardly even mentioned but as ornaments in her court. Really, I think she had some good ideas, but failed at the delivery.But like I said, it wasn't NOT worth reading for me. I did like some of the characters, and the world was somewhat intriguing (though she doesn't go in depth), but I wish she had better story telling skills. Then I would have re-read the book as soon as I finished it."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Anne Bishop has created a realistic world in The Black Jewels trilogy. I am hooked!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"If I could give this book 10 stars I would. I first became introduced to Anne Bishop's works through the novel \\"Dreams Made Flesh\\". After I read it about 12 times I finnaly bought The Black Jewels Trilogy. And I have never been dissapointed. I read it over and over and I have yet to get bored with it. It's a great book and it will hold any reader captive."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I got this book from a relative for my birthday. I must say that I wasn't sure how I would feel about it, but I was into it as soon as I read the first page. Over 1200 pages is a lot to read, but avid readers read books that large over and over. I would recommend this book to anyone who like fantasy because it ensnared my awareness and during the times when I have read it, everything around me has become insignificant. This book is magical, and will delight book readers alike."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Loved it! Excellent imagery, the story [engrossed] me in and did not let go until I finished the whole thing!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Anne Bishop is a goddess of the fantasy genre. I couldn't read these books fast enough the first time, and have found myself reading them over and over again! She covers every kind of mystical being imaginable, from shape-shifters and unicorns, to demons and sorcerers. She provides just enough detail to entice, without being verbose and overly \\"romantic.\\" This is a fantastic read -- recommended for ANYONE!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"The deepth of these books is amazing. Every character is well formed, never flat. Jaenelle is both loving and sometimes innocent, while also so strong while Witch that her anger can shatter even the strongest. Daemon is both dark and terrifying in his abilities yet kind and gentle with those who deserve it. Lucivar looks out for Jaenelle by acting the older brother but also submits to his Queen when all he has had is pain with other women. The list goes on. The dialogue is realistic and often keeps you laughing for hours. And yes, the unifying theme can be summed up as 'everything has a price'. Because it does. Choices aren't either totally positive or negative. The point of choice is that something else is undone or unchosen. And everything that happens in these books has a price - just as our world does."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I picked up this book on a whim and I'm so glad I did! As a lifelong reader of SciFi-Fantasy I find it difficult to find a writer with a \\"fresh\\" plot and Anne Bishop deals it out in spades. Not too many writers can haul out the old female-dominated world plot and make it seem new.The heroes are lovable, multi-dimensional and strong (I'd give anything to meet Lucivar in a dark alley). I hope Ms Bishop continues to write in this world for years to come.I will add that these books are not for everyone, they are very dark with a lot of deviant sex and may offend some."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"The Black Jewels Trilogy is a fantastic read that captures the reader and doesn't let go till the last word. The characters are brilliantly designed and they suck you into their world. In realms which The Blood are the People with magic, their strength determined by their jewels and title. Three Warlod Princes, all very powerful, come together in this epic tale where love and danger meld together and honouring the ways of the blood is all but lost, these three are different from the corrupt people of Terrielle, they honour the ways of the blood.There is a hope for the Blood, &quot;there is one who is dreams made flesh, she is not just any witch, but Witch&quot;. She will be more powerful and terrifying than any who has come before her. Though she is fragile and already she is beginning to fall apart.Throughout the trilogy each character changes and grows. This book will make you cry and laugh out loud. Anne bishop truly knows how to express human emotion in a world that is severly lacking."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Ok so some of you won't find it nearly as amusing if your a bible thumper (but then again most wouldn't be picking up this sort of book) but its got dark, rich history and vivid characters that makes one not want to put it down."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I was given this book by a friend who raved about how wonderful of a book it was, but about a quarter through it, I closed the thing and never looked back! I was annoyed at the way Ms. Bishop's entire plot revolves around nothing but incest, bad porn, sexual perversion of every sort, and...nothing much else. She has created a world where her own 'Mary Sue' has been given permission to run amuck with unimaginable power...and yet she has no ability whatsoever to help those who need it most.Every time the story would begin to have something, she killed it by inserting the most disgusting acts of human sexual perversion known to man and then some. Mothers sexually attracted to their children, guys having stuff cut off just for fun...she tried to make those in power look terrible, but instead, she made herself come off as perverse!I don't recommend this book to ANYONE who isn't interested in feeling sick to their stomachs after reading it, but if that's your cup of tea, go right ahead!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I really enjoyed the first book, a pretty good political thriller/fantasy novel and a fast read. Unfortunately Jannelle the child is much more interesting than Jannelle the woman and the later two books devolved into a romance novel, not my taste. I think Ladvarian killed it for me; holy Albert Payson Terhune, but this is kitschy (and I own two shelties that I spoil rotten)."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"the emotional outbursts the characters would inflict upon the reader was very much like watching a B movie. the actor/character was required by the directer/author to respond to a situation but the viewer/reader is not quite sure what they are responding to. i found myself often thinking to myself \\"why is this person flailing about?\\". character development is poor. the attempt to be secretive about a characters person was taken to the extreme and left me very disinterested. now couple that with a constant stream of grotesque impossible situations. what was with someone, who can only be described as having god like power, being controlled by a ring around his organ that could administer pain? pain that he could, if he really wanted to, overcome and obliterate people? why would he not take back control for good? this is only the third book I can ever remember not finishing it is so bad."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I haven't finished this book yet, but so far I am not impressed and having a very difficult time getting into it. I'm having to force myself to read it; with a good book, I have to force myself to put it down. Maybe it will get better....."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Throughout all three of these books, I found myself constantly wishing that the storyline would follow anyone other than the main characters. Don't get me wrong! Bishop's prose and her descriptions of the world of the Blood are beautiful, yet the characters inhabbiting it fall flat.They had little to work with in terms of a creative plot, of course, which is quite sad for a world that had a lot of potential. There was never a moment when I felt the main characters were in danger; when the sides are set up as the High Lord Saetan, his two immensely strong sons- the irresistable Daemon and the wolfish Lucivar- along with the foretold witch Jaenelle, who has more power than those three put together, AGAINST two greedy, trite hags who show no sense of maturity or sense, then it's easy to see how the tension might be lost.Jaenelle comes across as flawless, benevolent, popular, and humble, without ever a moment of perhaps haughtiness over her incredible powers. Witch, the entity deep within Jaenelle's consious, might have been more interesting to read about, but she's hardly given the limelight. The insufferable Daemon, too, never has a moment in which he's put in his place; instead, he's always right. I just found myself completely detached from ever caring about these flat, boring characters- or their group of highly powerful friends who are merely listed off as being Jaenelle's fan group and then never given personalities.The books are redeemed, somewhat, by what an intriguing world it is that Bishop's created: I wanted to hear more about the Spider Dream Weavers, or the island of children, or more about the jewel caste system established in this society. There is never a clear explaination of it; Bishop more expects you to pick it up as you go along. Yet it would have been nice to have some chapters with lighter-jewel characters who then might be in danger for their lives. Thank goodness for Surreal- she was the one character in the books who was likeable, amusing, and relatable.All in all, though different from your usual fantasy in the fact that it features some of the darker entities of fantasy as its protagonists, THE BLACK JEWELS TRILOGY was only average in actually executing a unique and deep storyline. Smart, powerful villains were desperately needed."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I enjoyed this series, but there were some serious flaws. The biggest, for me, was characterization/character development; the characters were inconsistent and pretty much static. Also, the ending was disappointing - so much tension and then... nothing.As I said, I did enjoy the series. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone though."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"If you're looking for an incredible read that keeps you turning the pages voraciously, this is the trilogy to get! Ms. Bishop is a shining star in the world of fantasy and sci-fi. The characters and multi-level plotlines became more intriguing as the stories progressed, The world Ms. Bishop has created is so complete, one could seriosuly believe the author has some secret knowledge of it's true existence. I did find the first few chapters to be a bit confusing as there are so many rules and characters that are presented, but once you get through the beginning, everything flows, makes sense, and captivates the reader. There is a healthy mixture of suspense, adventure, love, and even aspects that are morbidly fascinating. In my humble opinion, you are not going to want this series to end and you'll be thinking of the story long after you've read the last page. I have high hopes for Ms. Bishop to write more stories that take place in the Jeweled realms. The author has written The Invisible Ring. It is a nice story that does take place in this world and you do see some familiar characters. However, it wasn't as riviting as the trilogy. Read the Black Jewels Trilogy. You'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I slogged through all three books because someone dear to me effused over this Trilogy. Yeccchh! Anne Bishop had a few very interesting ideas that she could have developed into a good novel. But this trilogy dragged on and on and the potentially interesting story development only made the occasional cameo appearance before being submerged into an unending series of murky, often grotesque, vignettes. She attempted to liven up flat dialog with overused \\"sentence enhancers\\" not unlike a teenager using the \\"F\\" word many, many times in a single sentence. Her characters never spoke; they snarled, swore, glared, gave icy looks etc... And no wonder, for they were all enraged, sexually tense or frustrated... all the time. It must have been quite exhausting, I was certainly getting tired just reading it. Perhaps because the story just wouldn't develop, Bishop kept tossing in \\"story enhancers\\" like blood drinking, torture, S&M, child molestation and let's not forget the parent-child incest to keep our attention. It was chock full of gratuitous violence and rape. I don't think she left out a single loathsome act-but if she did I'm sure it will be in her next book! I would not recommend this book-especially to teen readers."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This is absolutely wonderful. The whole series is great and well written. The Black Jewels trilogy is the best, the heart, of this series. After reading this I have now read all of the rest of her books. Anne Bishop is my new favorite author and I will be buying her books in hardback as they come out.Warning: these are not G rated. I would give them at least an R for both sex and violence."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"For the more mature readers - there's nothing really graphic, but I would have a hard time applying a rating to them (PG, PG-13, R... can't decide). The magic wielder's power is tied to the color of the jewel they wear. And it's a world where Sataan is a father figure. Definitely worth the price! I re-read these constantly (I alternate between this an Harry Potter!)One thing that any reader needs to leave at the door when reading these (or in my opinion, almost anything in this genre) is the notion that HUGE age differences matter, in the case of the Queen here and her \\"mate\\" there are thousands of years between them - and he even meets her when she is a young girl (no pedophilia, but again, definitely a big gap between them). And it's great to see a female lead/hero in this genre too - someone who doesn't need to be \\"saved\\" but saves others. Love Ms Bishop's stuff. And the collateral stories are very good too!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I could not put this dark fantastic trilogy down. Captured on page one; I was extremely glad I had all three books in one complete story line. Anne Bishop has become a new favorite, she created Queendoms steeped in malovent power vs compassionate power, magic jewels, hope, dispair, family dynamics, and love. Absloute Power, Death and Hell take on new meanings in this world ruled by 'Mother Night' and her 'Consort'. WOW...I just recieved books 3(Invisible Ring), 4(Dreams Made Flesh), & 5(Tangled Webs) of Anne Bishop's 'Black Jewel Series'; and, get to reimmerse myself in the lives of the people of the jewels. I would like to complete up this review by highly recommending reading the following Kim Harrison humor seeped dark fantasy series...start a new favorite story line withDead Witch Walking (The Hollows, Book 1) and,[[ASIN:0061567310 The Good, the Bad, and the Undead (The Hollows, Book 2). I loved living in 'The Hollows' through six of Kim Harrison's books."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"The heroes are powerful, sensual, and almost eternal. The heroine is stronger than anyone knows, including herself. The villains are cruel and sadistically complete in their torture. Ironically the heroes and heroine are considered insane and evil in the extreme. The villains have labeled themselves as the epitome of good. It's not so different from the real world but it's a view of the world that some people don't want to admit to.This psychologically tumultuous series is a deep read that all cynics should love. If you've ever been called evil when you've done something good, then your heart will feel it's found a home in this series. Take on the warped perspective of the under-appreciated intelligence."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I simply LOVE this series. The characters are well rounded and believable, the dialog is great. I just can't say how much I like these books!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Wow. That is all I can say. This is an amazing book! I first read it when I was 14, because my friend lend me Daughter of the Blood, and then, I couldn't get enough of them! I finished it off within 3 days and borrowed the next two off of her. I reluctently gave them back to her, and went off to buy this version, with all three stories in one novel. Anne Bishop is an amazing author and I highly reccomend her books to all those that like fantasy books!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Any avid bibliophile knows about the unread pile sitting by her/his bedside waiting to be read. The Black Jewels trilogy was way down on the bottom of the pile, but I figured I'd give it a shot.Lightning strikes again! The Black Jewels trilogy was one of those series that one doesn't want to end and makes a reader pester the author for more.Having grown up in a fairly religious household, the character names and where much of the action took place really played with my head--and that's a good thing. This series forced me out of my comfort zone and to rethink my preconceived ideas about good and evil, masculine and feminine, especially when it comes to fantasy, where sometimes the whole good/evil dichomtomy becomes stale. It is NOT for everyone. The Black Jewels trilogy is DARK. It is violent, it is bloody and what befalls some of the characters is downright horrific. However, it is also hopeful and in some instances quite lighthearted.Because of her skilled characterizations and the gripping (sometimes painful) narrative, the SaDiablo men--Saetan, Daemon and Lucivar--are not merely amazing, but even downright sexy. They are a different and refreshing take on the \\"alpha male\\". Yes, they are dominant and capable of great violence and greater passions, but they serve Queens with a deep code of honor that is constantly tested. They accept the powerful women in their lives as equals. What Daemon does in the final novel 'Queen of the Darkness' in order to buy time for Witch had me up several nights re-reading that part.Ms. Bishop also skewers the notion of the peaceful matriarchal society by creating some of the cruelest female Witches ever written--Heketah and Dorothea SaDiablo. However, these women aren't just evil for the sake of being that way, it's how they amass such power over everyone that makes them so compelling and fiendishly nasty. You just know that they and those whom they've corrupted are eventually going to get theirs, but it's one hell of an emotional rollercoaster.Men in this world live to serve as long as those whom they serve are worthy and treat them with respect. The idea of the jewels as conduits of powers was one that in the hands of a less skillful writer would have easily become just another trite plot device.Jaenelle was a reminder as to what the power of Witch--the dream made flesh--should have been, rather than what it had become. She grows from her tragic childhood into a young woman with far more power than anyone had forseen, and the knowledge of what such power entails. Jaenelle's not Wonder Woman, and she makes mistakes along the path to her destiny. She's not perfect, and in spite of being so powerful finds that simple Craft tasks are beyond her. Jaenelle can do very bad things to those who get on her bad side, but she cannot cook.Other characters are just as vivid--one of my favorites being Surreal, the Dea al Mon ex-courtesan/assassin with her own pain to bear and vengeance to take; and Karla, the young Queen of Glacia who isn't fazed by the SaDiablo males and who enjoys yanking their chains every once in a while. The non-human Kindred are just as fully fleshed out, especially the adorable and highly protective Ladvarian, as any of the human characters. Ms. Bishop doesn't scrimp and she makes it more than clear that an 800 pound Arcerian cat named Kaelas isn't just cute window dressing, but capable of inflicting some serious damage.Here's the deal and another HUGE reason why the Black Jewels trilogy stands out--yes the heroes/heroines are powerful and yes they have the ability to wipe the floor (or in this case cleanse the realm) of all evil. But as it's said with great power comes great responsibility, and in this case even great sacrifice. Overall, the Black Jewels trilogy is about families--the ones we're born with and the ones we create. It's about love, loyalty, cruelty and revenge.This series has done what I thought had almost become impossible--breathed new life into a genre that I enjoy, but also realize has become quite stale. This world was as intense, as bloody and as intriguing as any I've read thus far and I can only hope Ms. Bishop will return to it soon."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"If you're any kind of fantasy fan, you've read the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Well, let me tell you: this was better. While it lacked the songs of LOTR and (for better or for worse) could not seem to match Tom Bombadil, the Black Jewels Trilogy more than matched Tolkien's masterpiece in its epic feel, and, in its character development, readability, and sheer addictiveness, far surpassed LOTR. In fact,BJT is the best trilogy of any genre I've ever read.But BJT is very, very dark. Yes, there is humor, excitement, and romance. But there is also stomach-turning sexual perversion, chilling cruelty, and bloodcurdling violence. Two of the main characters are sex slaves, and another one is an assassin/prostitute. In fact, one of my male friends said that the scene in which an insufficiently submissive Warlord is \\"shaved\\" [...]was the single most disturbing and frightening thing he'd ever read.Reader, beware. I first picked up Daughter of the Blood three years ago,when I was 14. In retrospect, if I was ready for it then, it was only just barely (this is considering the fact that I read The Godfather when I was 12). So you might think twice before offering it to your fantasy loving pre-teen (Sabriel, by Garth Nix, is a better choice). For those of you who can take it, though, I guarantee that this will be one of the most rewarding reading experiences ever."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is exciting and entertaining and very hard to put down.The books are fascinating, intense, and memorable. The dark, very magical world Bishop created, in which females are dominant, was one of the more interesting and original fantasy worlds I've read about. I especially liked the magic system, which depends on a hierarcy of different coloured jewels. The darker the jewel someone wears, the more powerful is their magic. And there is a lot of magic in these books--fights are fought more with magic than with weapons. But I like that.The characters are great also--I especially loved Daemon. I've never met a character so filled with contradictions. So cruel, and so yet so kind. (And so sexy!)My only complaint about the series, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that the second two books lost some of the dark, erotic, mysterious feel that the first book had, and contained a lot of cheesy wisecracks which annoyed me somewhat. It seemed to me that Bishop was trying to lighten the mood, and this disappointed me because I was enjoying the dark mood. (Not that the characters joking around wasn't funny, but it didn't really match with the first book.) However, by the second half of the third book, when the real Daemon returns, the mood becomes darker and more intense again.The ending is suitably dramatic, although I wished Bishop had included a bit more detail--it felt somewhat rushed. Yet it was satisfying enough.These books do contain some sex and violence, but nothing that I found overly graphic or offensive.All in all, these books were a great read. Not great literature, but highly entertaining. I'll remember Daemon, Jaenelle, Saetan, and Lucivar for quite some time. In fact, I think that I'm going to miss them..."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This was a very interesting trilogy. To call it dark fantasy is certainly accurate although to me is not quite enough. This is more in the vein of some of the vampire novels I have read since it is more of a mixing of equal parts fantasy, horror, romance, and even a little S&M. Not necessarily everyone's cup of tea. I enjoyed the books although some of the ideas were a little disturbing. There is a definite feel of violence to many of the more sexual aspects of this book that young people or those who have had past experience with sexual violence may find disturbing. I would also say that I too felt the writing was slightly inconsistent and found some of the dialogue between characters to be a little trite. Still, overall the books were entertaining, but probably suited to specific audiences only."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"It's the Black Jewels Trilogy in one book.

As for this omnibus edition itself, this was my first time reading it here and I must say, it had one major plus of containing the whole trilogy in one place.

For 4 days, I did nothing else with my spare time but read this!!!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This book is one of the most innovative novels I've ever had the privledge to read. It is amazing to see what Bishop does with this world that she created. This novel is built on emotional dvelopment and character development that isn't found in every novel. I've read this book over and over again and will never get tired of it. This novel is emotional investing and once you pick it up it is hard to put it back down."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I enjoyed this series start to finish. It was unique and kept my interest from the very beginning.I'm a sucker for the anti or \\"broken\\" hero and this series is chock full of them.I also loved how the strong, vital men in the series deal or try to deal with Witch. Anne has a brilliant way with words and used them to create a breathtaking series I hope to see much much more of."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I loved this book. I was so disappointed when I finished it, because I wanted it to keep going! This was the first Anne Bishop book I've ever read, and I love her writing style. I found myself laughing and crying and really caring about the characters. I'm usually not a big fantasy reader, but I think this book has made me change my mind. I really became concerned about what happened to Jaenelle and Daemon and the other quirky cast of characters. I don't want to give the story away, but let's just say it's unique. I think Bishop is extremely creative and I just can't gush about this trilogy enough. I can't wait to read Dreams Made Flesh next."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This book was absolutely wonderful. This is a trilogy that is best bought together, because it is one of those that you HAVE to finish the entire trilogy. The story is put together well, the descriptions are excellent, and the characters are the kind that you feel like you actually know by the end. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new author to read, and I would recommend any book written by Anne Bishop, as I have read them all. Just make sure you set some time away to read the entire thing!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This series is my Favorite. The characters are wonderful, the dialog is engaging. I found myself laughing and crying while reading. This is the type of book I wish I could find more of."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I thought Anne Bishop did an excellent job bringing her characters to life. It made me feel as if that world really did exist. I hope that she continues with the story of Janelle. I for one would be waiting for her next release with bated breath.Once you understood her terminology, it became easier to follow. If you're a fan of supernatural fantasy then you will love this trilogy. This was my first experience with a book by Anne Bishop, but I will purchase more of her novels because of this one. I know I won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is my all-time favorite of any books I have ever read. Anne Bishop paints a highly detailed picture of a marvelous world, with characters full of depth and feeling. The story is compelling, and once the book sinks its claws into you, you won't want to put it down. There are two more books outside this trilogy (The Invisible Ring and Dreams Made Flesh) and I'm still waiting for more."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I have never been interested in fantasy books or movies. This was my very first fantasy read and it blew me away. I am in the military on deployment and picked up Daughter of the Blood in our ship's library out of boredom and was hooked. Reading it was like eating a Krispy Kreme donut. I HAD TO HAVE MORE. I emailed a friend back home and had her look up the rest of the books and order the trilogy for me. All three were fabulous. I read Queen of Darkness a chapter a day because I didn't want the story to end any time soon it was so captivating. I love all three of these books and Anne Bishop has created a true and die hard fantasy reader for life!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I know this book was at least nominated for some very prestigious awards, but frankly, I wasn't that impressed. The books get better as she moves through the trilogy, but if I hadn't picked up the omnibus, I'd never have bothered to pick up the other two in the series to find out. The plot is paper thin and makes me wonder about her emotional life as a child. Briarwood seems part bad Jane Eyre inspired perversion, part not-so-lurid attempt at trying to be naughty.The 'naughty' theme recurs in the novel. Male anatomy is alternately referred to as the bland 'organ' or the same goshdarn schoolage vulgar terminology that I'm not quite sure this review allows me to duplicate. Let's just say that I made a drinking game with the rule that you drink only when you read the word 'balls' and I was hammered by the end of one evening's read.Second, people seem titillated by her s/m stuff. To which I say, WHAT S/M STUFF? I've read steamier stuff in a Harlequin. The love plot is unbelievable. I never though Ewan MacGregor and Natalie Portman could ever be surpassed in their lack of sexual chemistry, until I reached Daemon and Jaenelle.The author seems to forget, from chapter to chapter, what just happened. One character gets his finger chopped off in one of the books, but seems to suffer no ill effect, not even a band-aid, at the end of the novel. A character whose mouth was blasted by 'demon witchfire' is talking up a storm 10 pages later. Jaenelle fears sex not because of what happened to her at Briarwood, and spends a half a page freaking out that she might be frigid, but when she does have sex, we aren't even in her head at all to see how these tensions resolved.I have a shameful attraction to schlocky fantasy, but even this was below par for me. I was intrigued by the magical system, but none of the stuff I wanted to see (just how IS Daemon so mean?, what does an Offering To Darkness entail? How come all other witches get 'broken' if they have sex too young, but it doesnt' effect Jaenelle?) was really covered. I got the book because I came across a short story in a mystery anthology that she wrote in this universe, and while it seems from that story that she knows what she's doing, this trilogy seems rather like getting a skeleton or a first draft. I much prefer Sara Douglass, whose novel Threshold kept me glued to the pages for a whole weekend, to this piece of fluff. IF the author doesn't care enough to maintain continuity in her own storylines, why should I care enough to read it?"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Anne Bishop's Dark Jewels series has many of the hallmarks of a good dark fantasy novel--elements of horror, interesting perspectives, etc. The denizens of her worlds worship the \\"negative\\" aspects of the dichotomy rather than the \\"positive\\"--dark instead of light, descent instead of ascent, female instead of male. In this trilogy, magic users known as the Blood form the ruling class of several parallel worlds. When the book starts many of the queens have grown weak and arrogant, and petty intrigues have started to corrupt the minor courts. The Blood anxiously await the arrival of Witch, a sorceress of untold power who will serve as a sort of dark messiah for their kind. Bishop tells the story of this dark messiah--a girl named Jaenelle Angelline--over the course of this trilogy.I felt Bishop's trilogy was a solid example of dark fantasy, save for one glaring error: her protagonist. Much like Jean Auel's Ayla, Jaenelle suffers from one crucial flaw: that is, she doesn't have any flaws. Jaenelle suffers from Mary Sue Syndrome, a characterization flaw that I find absolutely insufferable. The character is so perfect, so devoid of any human flaw, that she becomes wooden and not believable at all. At first one would think that of course Jaenelle would have very few flaws--she IS a messiah, after all. But there are ways to make a person powerful without sacrificing believability--I felt like Ms. Bishop failed to do this with Jaenelle.Other than the annoying and unrealistic main character, I enjoyed this trilogy. The world is compelling and detailed, the magic system intriguing, the dark mythos well-drawn and inventive. Sensual and often barbed, this trilogy will appeal to any fan of dark fantasy.So should you read this series? In spite of my misgivings, yeah. Black Jewels is worth reading for its interesting take on male-female power systems, its inversion of our traditional mythos, and its sometimes witty dialogue. But its weak characterization rules it out from a place on my favorite shelf. If you're looking for some really good dark fantasy take a peek at Garth Nix's wonderful Sabriel,and its sequels Lirael and Abhorsen(ostensibly meant for young adults, but I'd recommend them for full-fledged adults as well)."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"It got me hooked by the first book. This book kept me up at night reading it, and when that happens, I give it five stars.The story talks about a society where females rule and males are subdued by them. Men and rival witches \\"break\\" young women before they reach maturity to strip them of their power, and mature ones slave males.Then a young witch starts traveling between the realms, and those who love her try to shield her from all who want to destroy her, including a family that does not understand her.Some people will find the sexual scenes too intense. If you are offended by reading sadism and bondage, then do not buy this book. I bought the first book to try it out, and one week later I was buying the next two parts. The three books make a feeble attempt to stand on their own, but they are really one book split in three: you won't get as much by reading then in disorder or getting just one of them.To give you some bearings on my taste, that may be similar to yours: I liked the Kushiel trilogy (a little better than this book, in fact) for the complexity of its characters and plot; and I disliked \\"A Kiss of Shadows\\", because it had more sex than story."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"These are the three most darkly beautiful books I have ever read. I found myself worrying about the characters even when I wasn't reading the books (which was not often)! The three things I love most about these novels are the role reversal(females rule males,males love to serve), the magic(separated into castes and levels of power), and the twisted humor that tickles my funnybone just fine. Where else can you find the High Lord of Hell being totally flabbergasted by things an eight year old girl asks about men? YOU MUST READ THESE IF YOU LIKE ANY TYPE OF FANTASY. THEY HAVE EVERYTHING."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"The book I bought did not have the gold border, though when I bought it the picture didn't either. (I don't know if this is an issue but I thought I should mention it). The trilogy itself is a bit slow and NOT for children. I repeat; NOT for children. The setting being a matriarchy, gender is central to the story and Ms. Bishop has no problem whatsoever telling every detail(if you get my drift). The story is interesting and very unique; I enjoyed the books overall but would only recommend it to a mature crowd."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Spectacular book(s), have read all of them and then reread them at least a dozen times. Once I get started I just dont want to put any of them down. Would recommend them to anyone over age 16."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I was a senior in high school when I received this book as a gift for Easter. I read the synopsis for the trilogy and it definitely sounded like something I'd love to read, but I wasn't expecting to become completely engrossed in the story, completely blown away by the story, completely in love with the characters, crying at certain events, and actually reading this 1,000 page + epic.The Black Jewels Trilogy isn't just about the most powerful Witch named Jaenelle, who doesn't know who she truly is until I believe Book 2 or somewhere in Book 3. It's about the other characters around her who have been or will be effected by her. Book 1: Daughter of The Blood introduces the reader to the plot in the beginning but then becomes a sad tale of magic, slavery, but the situations characters are involved in are things people of our mundane world go through. After Book 1 ends and you loved it, the other two books are equally as great, but get ready for the real drama and brace yourself for the end of Book 3.This version of the Trilogy is long, true enough, but if you love Book One as much as I did, you'll be grateful you didn't have to get up to get the next two novels. This series is multi-genre: comedy, romance, drama, horror, and fantasy. There is alot of violence in this trilogy, fantasy violence and otherwise and there's also sex scenes and heavy sexual themes. Like another customer stated, this novel is not for the faint of heart.If you like fantasy novels like the Kushiel's Legacy Trilogy then this Trilogy is definitely not something you'd want to pass up!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I loved this trilogy. There are other sequels out there now, and they're okay, but this trilogy is some seriously great reading! I only wish the other sequels were as good. If you like dragons, magic, love and justice, you will like this trilogy."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Demons and witches. Dark, sexy, and well written. Interesting characters, great world building. A fun read, and a page turner."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I cracked open this book about three years ago while waiting for my husband to get off work, and bought it 5 minutes later. I think I have reread it around 15 times since that day. This series is rich in detail, characterization, world building, and dialogue. Every time I read the stories I fall in love all over again with the characters, and find things that I have no idea I missed or have forgotten.I feel that the author, Ms. Bishop, has truly created a unique world that blends elements we can relate to and magic. Her way of story telling creates vivid pictures to go alone with her words. I enjoy the way she does not shy away from harsh sense, or try and candy coat the way people can treat each other or animals. For all the violence, there is an equal amount of empathy and compassion show by other characters.The main character Janelle is a blend of ferocious power and deep heart. You get a wonderful balance of invincibility and delicate ego that can be swept away. She doesn't want what she was born with, but accepts is as necessary to protect those that she loves more than life. The other characters swirl around her in an intricate dance that feeds off of and into her personality.This trilogy is a classic for that will continue to be well read into the future."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I've followed this series religiously since the author was still writing book #2; better than Harry Potter the characters have a depth to them and a relentless, seductive, dangerous beauty. This trilogy can be read again and again with the same enjoyment as the first time. I laughed, I cried and I fell in love with the characters, over and over again. From the moment you open the first page, you just can't put it down."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"One of the the very best stories I have ever read. Anne Bishop creates a breathtaking world with her writing, and characters that you come to love. It's not an 'easy' story. And it's not always a pretty one. It's complicated. Like many of her characters. But that is why I love it. I don't want to always read mindless cookie cutter type novels. Sometimes I want to drawn into a story that is complicated, where characters HAVE to develop, where the world isn't all pink bows and sugar cookies. A story that draws you in and keeps you there. Daemon and Janelle's story IS complicated. Yes...he's centuries older than her when he firsts meets her. And she is a child. But he KNOWS that she is his soulmate the moment he lays eyes on her. He sees that in her. He just has to wait for her to grow up. Which he does. There was no depravity there regardless of one other reviewers opinion.This story does have torture in it. It has EVIL. It has some bad things happening to good people. It has champions who battle evil, that sometimes falter in their quest to rid the world of that evil and it's about their fight to find love.If you like a tale with stong women characters, with classic good vs evil set on an epic scale, with a world brought to life with excellent writing and character development, then this is a series for you. There is love, betrayal, humor, love, desperation...so many things that I can't even touch on. Get this book. I think you'll love it as much as I do. There is a happy ending....but they had to WORK for it.However, If you like your romance with fluff and only mild violence, slight antagonism between characters, and easily fixed 'heartbreak' before the hero and heroine kiss and make up to get their happily ever after...then this is NOT the story for you. Look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I love this book! I'm very happy to have the all in one volume which fits great in my bookcase--So awesome! I'm very happy with my purchase!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This is an entrancing series which though confusing at first due to the constant change of set and character perspective will have you quickly addicted once you adapt. It transfuses normal day life with magic in a way which is both realistic and extraordinary in the same breath. Bishop takes you on adventure in every day life involved with the mysterious adventures of a child, the eccentricities and hard ships of the older generations, and the jaded experiences of those who have lived in monotonous doom. The plot is well laid out and has a simple yet action filled sequence throughout the three books. Pick it up and set aside some time to enjoy it, otherwise you may end up forgetting your obligations while you read."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"The Black Jewels: Trilogy: Daughter of the Blood / Heir to the Shadows / Queen of the DarknessThis is an awesome way to keep up with the books! You only have the one volume! I would highly recommend anyone who loves The Black Jewels Trilogy to get it! You would never have to worry about loosing one of the books in the set ever again and it is cheaper than getting each of the books."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"If you love fantasy &amp; are tired of wading through Robert Jordan's endless descriptions of EVERYTHING, read these books. I have read all of Anne Bishop's books &amp; this trilogy is her best. I would recommend reading the Invisible Ring first though. It will give you a good overview of the way their world works before you dive into the whole trilogy. The Invisible Ring could be read alone, but once you start the trilogy you cannot stop. Buy all 3 together!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I read this trilogy when it came out years ago, and have re-read it quite a few times since then. I believe it was my first introduction to dark fantasy, and I still use it as a measuring stick for other novels.Yes, Jaenelle is something of a Mary Sue. Who cares? Most of the greatest characters in literature are such. Elizabeth Bennett, anyone? For many, the whole point of recreational reading is to escape, and what better way to do so than to find a character in whom you can see little bits of yourself?I actually get angry at people who so pretentiously try to criticize the use of archetypal characters. They're archetypal for a reason, folks. They work. They're interesting. They're us.I found the Realms to be completely entrancing. I fell in love with every character as if he or she was my best friend. In fact, I continue to do so each time I re-read this trilogy. Especially the men. Can you say hot? Holy cow! The Sadist can play with me any time. Seriously."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Seven hundred years ago, a prophesy foretold the coming of the greatest and strongest of all Queens. Now, in a world where women rule, and the \\"good guys\\" live in darkness, a once beautiful society has been corrupted, twisted almost beyond recognition by two sadistic and power hungry women. Into this world of violence and power is born a girl with the ability to change things. Only she may not make it to adulthood, if a group of estranged compatriots don't band together to protect her.Against my better judgment, I finally followed the advice of a good friend and picked up this book. When I say 'better judgment' what I really mean is 'time management.' I was right too, my time management went out the window as soon as I picked up the first book in the Black Jewel Trilogy - because I couldn't put it down. It took maybe two pages, and I felt my self drawn completely into the story - a rare gift of any novel.One of the greatest aspects of this novel is its complexity. No character is completely evil, and none completely good. There are only varying shades of grey, some much darker than the others, some much lighter. There are times when the reader cannot help but feel pity or compassion - or at least an academic sense of understanding - for the most reviled of characters. Or shock at the ruthless cruelty of essentially good characters.Anyone who claims that fantasy cannot be completely character driven should read this book.Anne Bishop has infused this incredible work with an undercurrent of dark sexuality, and not just in the struggles of the characters who undergo often torturous sexual experiences. While the violence, and violent sexualities, are not gratuitous - each scene designed to reveal something new and substantial - this is not for the faint of heart. Or the faint of stomach.This book is by no means a children's novel. It is dark, ruthless, and disturbing, not to mention graphic. However, it's brutality is balanced by scenes of intense sweetness, and by the intense personal struggles each character undergoes as they try to unravel the tangled web of their lives.Fascinating, haunting, and breathtaking. A must for any adult fantasy reader."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"All round great book about a young girls life from her cruel upbringing to her crisis packed adulthood, never a dull moment.The way the book moves through the four main characters lives is brilliant you cant help but cringe at all four of there tragic pasts and smile at there moments of happiness and strength.By the end of the book you feel like you know janelle as your own daughter and you understand why everyone wants to protect her with all the strength they have in them.Daemon, Saeton and Lucivar are great characters powerful, angry and yet very weak at times.No book is perfect and at times i found it convenient how easy people will distrust each other or peoples honor will prevent them from killing dangerous enemies, though the plot must go on so this is easily forgivable.Also alas what other readers are saying is true the word snarl or snarled appeared as often as the word 'the' in the book but if thats enough reason to turn you off a quality book then it is your loss."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I just loved all three books. I couldn't wait till to see how it ended."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"First, let me start by saying I LOVE to read. I have 2 copies of some books, 1 set in hardcopy and a digital copy to read on my phone. I'll even scan and convert some pooks to PDF form just so that I can bring them around on my iPhone because iBooks doesn't carry them yet. My father read to me as a child, and I had an adult library card and was checking out the Illiad before left elementary school. I LOVE BOOKS.That being said, these were the WORST books I've ever read.Rape? Every flavor is represented, from child rape, adult rape, drug induced rape, and gang rape. Heck, in the third book, one character skillfully rapes his father without actually raping him. You figure it out. In fact, some of the rape I mentioned above even gets mixed together, like drug induced child rape.Murder? Don't get me started.Torture? In graphic detail. Heck, mutilation of genitals is practically a theme of the books. You'll never think of \\"shaving\\" quite the same way again.Characters who drink blood? Why not? In fact, let's even make them the 'good' guys.Poorly developed characters? You're in luck! There's 3 whole books of them! The entire main cast is there to make the main character, Janelle, look better. Everyone will love her because hey, the author says so!If you're a fan of Robert Jordan, smaller characters come in and out of the stage to help provide exposition, move the plot, or to be an external voice of the author. Small characters in this series are around solely to make Janelle look better by being weaker and easily pushed aside or forgotten. And if you aren't nobility in these books, you might as well be a rat. The hierarchy is set up to literally put Janelle on the top of the heap as \\"Dreams made flesh\\", but she certainly isn't the dream of any character I saw, except Daemon Sadi... and the earlier pages of that relationship bordered on child pedophilia. Her sole purpose is to be brutalized by her family (as a ploy by the author to make us care about her more) while she sits around on her hands till the 'climax' of the third book, which is painfully forced and terrible designed.Even the most powerful side characters are weak and ineffectual. The most powerful of them all, Saetan, drops about 100 IQ points in the final book. He gives himself over to the bad guys, tortured by the evil ladies in charge (even by one of his own sons is forced to join in) and nearly killed because even with all his power and experience, the vast kingdom at his command, and the court that Janelle has put together, the best plan he can develop is to put himself in danger and *hope* Janelle will get angry enough to stop it. This from the man who led a *successful* prior war against these same villains.Want some bad writing? Every character snarls, growls, and glowers at each other, constantly. In the second book snarl was being used on almost every page in one of the chapters. You won't go further than five pages without seeing the same emotes used over, and over, and over again. People will even snarl at each other over breakfast.How about a terrible look at love and romance? Apparently, true love means staking your claim, possession, ownership, mind games, and power struggles. How about a character who's more than several hundred years old getting aroused by a child? Sure, why not? That's perfectly normal, right? Forget talking to each other with meaningful conversation, let's just stick to, \\"You're mine\\", or \\"You belong to me.\\" The conversation about what sex means to the author and how it plays out in these books is better left to a psychologist and a priest.Look, if you want some great writing, pick up Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time Series. If you want some fantastic horror, grab some Stephen King books. Need some fantasy? Dive in to R.A. Salvatore. Want an amazing trilogy? Pick up Lord of the Rings and read them cover to cover. THAT'S a 5 star trilogy.Just because an author decided to make characters named Saetan, Lucivar, Daemon Sadi, and Witch good guys and turn Darkness into the power of right, doesn't make her a genius. It means she's being controversial to BE controversial, and it doesn't make the plot, character development, or fantasy world any better. It also doesn't clean up poor writing and gratuitous sexual depravity.Skip these books and pick up something else. You'll sleep better, and if you still don't believe me, read the 1 star reviews for this book... they give out the most truth of any of the reviews you'll read."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This was an amazing series filled with realistic, characters that had real flaws. The fantasy world created within these pages is filled with it's own political battles for power, familial ties and a love that tries to transcend time. In this world, women have the final say, and the men that love them have to do all they can to keep them safe. This is a highly recommended series to anyone that enjoys reading about love, political battles for power or the dark fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"The three stories in the Black Jewels Triology demonstrate Anne Bishop at her best. They are fun, interesting, and enjoyable reads all. The good guys live in hell, and what is better than that? I am a huge fan of sci-fi fantasy novels and am pretty selective about what I reccomend to others, but I would reccomend these books. There is court intrigue, family drama, love, redemption, romance, magic, and magical creatures contained within these pages."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This series (all contained in one book now)is tied, in my opinion, with The Song of Ice and Fire series as the greatest ever written. The characters are amazingly deep and easy to get attached to. In this series the lines between what is 'Good' and what is 'Evil' are often blurred, and morals often war with honour. It'll make you laugh out loud (thus getting a few funny looks) and will also choke you up in a few places. In other words... read the series, read the series, read the series."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I won't bore you with the plot summary and just give you my recommendation:Read this if you like dark fantasy with witches, demon dead, hell, etc. If this isn't your cup of tea, steer clear because it is too long to try to get through if you really aren't into the dark stuff.Maybe I would give this 2.5 stars If I could... not sure.Okay, I have to say that I am not an experienced fantasy reader. I picked up the Sevenwaters Trilogy and absolutely loved it and was searching for something comparable. However, the Black Jewels Trilogy is much different and not as enjoyable for me. I'm not sure if it was the demon dead, the blood sucking, the male slaves, hell, or what. It just didn't grab me and I didn't enjoy it even though I really really wanted to. Sorry, not for me but I could see how others could get into it."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Daughter of the Blood by Anne Bishop is a captivating story full of adventures and science-fiction thrills. It is an interesting book and the plot is full of weird twists and turns I would recommend this to someone who has a flair for the dramatics and a creative imagination. This book requires a knowledge of English and would be better for adults or mature teens.This story is interesting because the perspective is from three people who are connected to the main character. This is absorbing because the reader doesn't know the main characters thoughts and motives. It creates a fascinating insight on Jeanelle, the main character.The story, Daughter of the Blood, is about a propheciesed Witch. She is supposed to unite all the realms under one ruler. The story starts out with the introduction of Jeanelle through Lucivars eyes. She is five years old at this time. The plot continues when Anee Bishop introduces the other characters, Saetan asn Daemon.I liked this story becasue the perfect genius with which the plot is sewn together and pieced together is gratifying to read. This book ws a little strange and sometimes I had to re-read. However, if a reader has enough patience to figure things out, this book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I found this book to be a very interesting read.It was very well written and the story was very good.I also just thought I'd mention that in expressing their dislike for this book, one reviewer said \\"I never though Ewan MacGregor and Natalie Portman could ever be surpassed in their lack of sexual chemistry, until I reached Daemon and Jaenelle\\"...there isn't supposed to be an sexual chemistry between Ewan MacGregor and Natalie Portman--it's between Hayden Christianson and Natalie Portman."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I have read a great deal of trilogies but none can compare with this one. It made me cry more than any other book I have read. I am writing this in response because of another review I read by which I was greatly offended. I realize that not everyone may like these books, and I don't expect everyone who reads them to fall in love with them as I have. However to write a review and give a book a bad rating when you have admitted that you have not read it, as Pstanton \\"peter_stanton\\" did is disgraceful. I realize that the heros in these books are out of the ordinary but that is what makes the trilogy so interesting and unique and just because you are a Christian conservative who does not approve of the charater's identities does not mean it gives you the right to comment on a book you have not even read."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is well written and keeps you on your toes. It captivates the imagination and makes you feel a part of the Blood world. The only thing I did not like, was the ending. It was kind of abrupt. Other than that I would recommend this book to anyone interested in fantasy."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I absolutely love the Dark Jewels universe and these stories. The authors style pulls your whole-heartedly into the story and envelops you in the character's world.

I cried when I was done, as much from the story, as from sadness that it was over."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"If you interested in fantasy this trilogy is a must read. This is what I would like to see more of; as contemporary fantasy. Within this story lies much of the true human condition that is hinted in others or not discussed.

True gem."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Fast moving, sympathetic characters, plot twists - but very dark.

I think the story line is seriously lacking--in that I'm not really sure what the major problem is. I really like the characters, although I think they are a bit underdeveloped. A lot of times when I'm reading the story, I have to stop and think, \\"Wait, what? How/why did that just happen?\\" Most of the time I feel as if I am wading half-blind through an unknown, midnight-dark cavern. It's as if the writer is writing but occasionally forgets to fill the reader in on pieces of important information, either in regards to a character's thoughts or the significance of a sentence. But then, maybe I'm just not used to her writing and have been spoiled by George Martin.Overall I'm disappointed it wasn't as good as I had anticipated, I had high hopes for some of these characters. Maybe the story gets better by the third book, but unless the author has seriously altered her writing style, I can't see how. Some parts are amusing and/or entertaining, which has kept me going with it thus far. Plus I plain just want to see how it turns out. I wouldn't really waste your time on it (although it has proven to be a relatively quick read) if you have more important things to dive into."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I am a reader, in paticular of fantasy. I have read Asiov, Scott Card, Donaldson, McCaffery, Meyers, Tolkien, Rice, Jordan, Goodkind, Brooks and so many more that names would take up all of the available space for this review.The Black Jewels books are my favorites. I have read them at least a dozen times, and I never get tired of the story or the characters. I find them compelling and unique and unlike anything else that I have ever read. The stories are dark, twisted, and eerily romantic. Over the years since I bought the first book in paperback (a copy which I have read so many times that it is falling apart and had to be replaced by this anthology) I have recommended the books to many of my friends and to date have only had one dislike the series in anyway. For most of them, it has become a beloved addiction and the subject of an untold number of conversations.Give them a chance, and make sure to read at least the first 50 pages of Daughter of the Blood--you have to give yourself time to be emersed in the world which is different from any other you will have experienced."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This book is imaginative and beautiful, but I wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE who is very empathetic or emotional - it will tear your apart while you keep reading, hoping that something happy will come along. It almost never does. I had nightmares about this book for weeks."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I really enjoyed the first book \\"Daughter of the Blood.\\" Anne Bishop introduces an interesting world of intrigue, magic and eroticism. The character development starts out really well. I fell in love with all three main male characters Lucivar, Daemon and Saetan. I like the humor and wit. The idea of a matriarchal is society rather refreshing.And I found the emotional conflict between the little witch girl Jaenelle and her dysfunctional family very compelling.After reading this book I felt as if I have finally found a new series I could fall in love with.The second book left me a bit disappointed. The main bad villains of the story are completely incompetent. Hekatah's and Dorothea's feeble attempts to seize power are almost laughable. I felt no great sense of peril for the main characters, making the overall plot a bit boring and uninspiring. The only thing that really kept me reading was Lucivar. If it wasn't for him, I would have given up after the first couple of chapters. Can't take much more of the \\"hair fluffing.\\"The third book was a disaster, but yet I still kept reading. The most disappointing thing about this book is how Daemon's character develops. He becomes a shadow of his former self. A totally whiny pussy. What happened to the notorious sadist?Some of the most annoying things are the repetitiveness of the words and phrases used. \\"Snarling\\", \\"Haunted Sapphire Eyes\\", \\"Everything has a price\\" and \\"that midnight voice\\" are just some of the phrases that almost made me destroy the book.Jaenelle is an utter disappointment. There is nothing queenly or inspiring about her. She was quite boring. Surreal would have been a more interesting witch in my opinion.I gave it 3 stars because, despite all the flaws, the plot kept me entertained for some strange reason."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"While reading I fondly referred to this as the bad fantasy monstrosity, but the honest truth is that, despite a fantasy setting, too many characters, and somewhat unrealistic characterization, this trilogy held my attention and made for an interesting, new, exposing if not entirely unique, read. I would recommend it to those with the time for 1000 pages and the ability to suspend disbelief so far as fantasy is concerned, but I would recommend it.I'll state outright that I don't read or like very much fantasy but rather prefer science fiction. However, The Black Jewels Trilogy turns out to be lengthy, addicting, and relatively believable as far as fantasy goes. There's a clear progression of plot that keeps the reader interest throughout the length, magic has boundaries and rules and is therefore more believable, and the underlying world in which this all happens--a failing matriarchy--is new enough, and precious enough to the reader that it is worthwhile to hold with the story and see how things turn out. All of those aspects made the book much better than I had predicted it would be, and I enjoyed reading it much more than I expected.There are a number of drawbacks to the novel--there have to be, or I wouldn't still refer to it as bad fantasy. There are two many characters and their personalities are at the same time too limited, too cut-out and delineated, and also too extreme, unrealistically passionate or sexual or powerful. Unrealistic characters always make reading less enjoyable and lessen the impact and believability of the text. Furthermore, the end of the books is (without giving everything away) anti-climactic and unrealistic. The battle, as it were, happens outside and goes unwitnessed. Furthermore, it is based on a system of segregating people based on good and bad blood, a concept that I just can't believe in--it implies that repentance and forgiveness are impossible and that bad people are always bad and good people always good. The idea bothered me a lot and ruined the ending in my eyes.In the end, however, this is a lengthy, attention-grabbing, if imperfect bad fantasy monstrosity of a trilogy that makes for an amusing, interesting, fun read. This isn't the sort of text I would normally pick up for myself, but I enjoyed the chance to read it."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Although I enjoyed this trilogy, it left much to be desired. The main male character Daemon is a really good character. But I found myself wishing I could read about his life instead of all the other stuff in the book. The main female character is poorly characterized...I didn't really care that much about her. In fact, i liked her better in the first book when she was a child than when she grew up in the second and third books. Also, the second book of the series was very dissapointing and boring. Mostly because Daemon is hardly in it, and then because it was just boring. The third book was better though since Daemon came back and the plot moved forward. I guess you could say the only reason I liked the books at all was because of Daemon. There were many, many problems with the books:1. The writing. It is very, very, very repetative. It was like, you just wanted to scream 'buy a thesaurus!!!' She wrote 'snarled' so many times it was like it showed up three times on every page. and i'm not exaggerating. And she used the phrase 'he/she said too softly' for almost every character! it does little to make the characters distinct.2. The story. Besides Daemon the story is very corny at times. I mean there's a character named Saeton who lives in Hell. And while he's supposed to be threatening (i think?) there is never any evidence of this. He's like a grandpa, and not even an interesting grandpa. Also, the villains are very dissapointing. Sure...they're bad...but they're pretty much just stupid. And you begin to wonder why the good characters are even worrying about them at all. There is also a lot of tell and not as much show as there should be. Not very good for any book but esp one of this type. Also the love story leaves so much to be desired. The author goes into great detail when she's talking about seduction of other characters, as a side plot, but in the central love story she barely describes their first night together. Also Jaenelle and Daemon hardly have any relationship. They meet when she is a child, and it was the most interesting part of their whole relationship!3. The World. The world is interesting, i'll give it that. But while the book claims over and over, there is no law against murder, because this is supposed to be a world of dark fantasy and the morals go with that, there is all this uproar over child molestation. What sense does that make? Either go with what you claim, that the morality is based in darkness, or don't claim it. There is also a lot left unexplained. What is the offering to the darkness? Why is there one? And I must have missed a lot of stuff on the SaDiablo family because suddenly there were these people who were related but I had no idea how? Also I thought there were more than three realms. The geography of the place needed to be explained more, esp since it is so integral to the main plot. ETC.4. The Characters. Now, Daemon is one of my fave characters I've ever read about, up there with Lestat. But I think it may have more to do with my own imagination than with the book. The author says a lot about how he used to destroy whole courts and he's called the Sadist, but while we get to see certain glimpes of this, it is so not enough. I found myself wanting to read his backstory, but never getting it. Also his relationship with his half brother Lucivar was very confusing. The reader only gets the latest stuff about it, but nothing to back it up with, as a backstory would do. Lucivar himself was a nice character...in the beginning, but near the end he's changed into this sort of stereotype of a macho male. As are most of the other males. Jaenelle is disappointing when she grows up. She's just sort of quiet and alone alot, and we don't get to see why she's like this or get into her head hardly at all. Saetan is almost like a blank to me, I didn't see him as a person at all. And there are so many queens and warlord princes in the background I never really cared about any of them really.Anyway, I would recommend this book for people who want an easy, fun read, esp if they like to find good new characters (Daemon). I did have a lot of fun with it despite it's many flaws. I guess it's kind of a guilty pleasure type read."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"The author has developed an interesting world: there are parallel realms populated by magic and non-magic beings (ranging from plain humans to dragons), an interesting magic system (with levels, but also specialized castes), a decent-sized cast. Unfortunately the trilogy suffers from lots of problems that are impossible to ignore when stumbling over them many times in hundreds of pages. Note that this review may contain spoilers.First there's the rampant overuse of 'taboo' subjects like S&M;, rape, incest and pedophilia - it's not innovative, daring or edgy, just unrealistically widespread and pointless. Consider that in the first half of the trilogy, two of the three leading men are continuously being 'punished' by excruciating pain from rings attached to their sexual organs, the female protagonist lives in a children's mental hospital visited by 'uncles' who rape and kill the occupants (without the families ever noticing), the evil witch has intercourse with children - including her own son, another main female character was produced when her mother was violated (later killed), there's some father-daughter incest in the family of the female protagonist, and it just goes on and on and on. The second half of the trilogy is a bit more restrained in this regard, but still treats us to some real gems in this department.The trilogy also suffers from a typical fantasy problem: excessively powerful characters. This problem is however enhanced by the most asymmetric distribution of power between good and evil I've ever seen.The magic system consists of 13 different power levels, symbolized by colored jewels - the darker the color, the more powerful (black being the most powerful). A black-jeweled individual is powerful enough to destroy a good part of a city and kill/disable hundreds or thousands of weaker individuals in one outburst of power. Somebody is considered to have basically no chance when fighting a person with a darker jewel.Given this, consider the power distribution in the book: on the evil side, there are two red-jeweled witches (level 10) and for the rest the obligatory cannon fodder. On the good side, we have the only two black-jeweled men (Saetan and Daemon, level 13) and the only black-jeweled woman in the world, two level 12 men (also the only ones in the world), one level 11 woman, a dragon with undefined tremendous power (who never uses it) and the main female protagonist - Jaenelle. Jaenelle has, as a child, the power equivalent to dozens of regular black-jeweled persons. When she grows up, she goes to a previously unknown level that is darker than black; according to Daemon her power is the equivalent of *thousands* of black-jeweled men, making her probably more powerful than the rest of the world put together. Just to top it off, at the end of the book she gets yet another special power level created, just for her, though we are not told what that level actually means.By the second half of the trilogy, we have all this effectively infinite power (plus the cannon fodder that on the good side is actually roughly the strength as the evil witches) gathered in one place, yet somehow unable to eradicate the wimpy evil. Hazard a guess as to what damage all the good power causes in the first 95% of the book... it makes the two evil witches ugly. Yep, that's it.The ridiculousness of this situation is emphasized by the fact that Saetan has a red-jeweled *butler* - in other words, the guy who opens the door and brings the coffee on the good side is as strong as the strongest evil character.Third are the unrealistic characters: everyone is incredibly handsome, infinitely rich if they need money (we are told Daemon pays a 2 mln gold coin bribe and could do it again if necessary and he even owns a secret private island somewhere - all of that achieved with secret investments while being a pleasure slave?!), extremely powerful (see above), telepathic, has the ability to transport him-/herself over vast distances using 'the webs' or gates and several of the characters have the ability to resist and produce poison as well as interpret the future or heal dangerous injuries.In fact the super-rich Daemon is so drop-dead gorgeous and hot that he can satisfy women sexually - yet leave them longing for more for days afterward - just by looking at them.The difference between good and evil is that the good ones are very nice, caring, sentimental and wimpy, while the evil ones are stupidly backstabbing evil and love S&M.;For example on the good side we have Saetan, black-jeweled, natural Black Widow, 50000 years old High Lord of Hell and High Priest of the Hourglass (sounds tough and impressive, right?) who we see giving a foot massage to some other guy, and whining about wanting to borrow a romance novel. All guys on the good side are douchebags and almost all women annoying spoilt brats.On the evil side the two witches continue to come up with all kinds of small, stupid plans to get Jaenelle in their power. A plan fails? No matter, kill the one responsible and go to the next stupid plan lined up. Not unlike Pinky and The Brain - I was waiting for \\"Gee, what do you want do to tonight?\\" \\"Same thing we do every night, try to take over the world.\\". In the end they *almost* get the obvious idea (war), but that doesn't quite work out because they get distracted by a pathetic kidnapping scheme that's doomed to fail. Frustratingly stupid really. The only thing that's more stupid is that the infinitely powerful Jaenelle spends most of her time in the book being completely exhausted and emaciated due to dealing with side-effects of these plans or her own incompetence - however stupid and transparent the plan, Jaenelle is going to almost-but-not-quite die or lose her powers fighting it.Fourth problem is that the language chosen by the author makes suspense of disbelief difficult. There's repetition (humans snarling, 'males' versus 'females', fruitless attempts of the super-powerful to get drunk (they usually can't because they're so damn powerful), continuous complaints about how exasperating this or that is), words that simply don't fit in a fantasy setting (powerful wizards/warlords over and over again referred to as \\"boyos\\", shopping sprees), unrealistic amenities (running hot and cold water, the presence of a \\"Dr.\\" who is in charge of the mental hospital - while medicine is in all other cases done by Healers with no academic title), Bond-like gadgets (manufactured by the super-powerful Jaenelle in the second half of the book).Last but not least, the world is not properly explained. In time, you do get an idea of how it's organized, but as the purpose of the book is not to let you puzzle on this, it should be explained beforehand, or in an appendix or whatever. The scale of the world is also not clear: characters effectively jump between places (because they're so powerful and can travel \\"the webs\\" - we have no idea at what speed this is or how long it takes in most cases) and between parallel realms - they don't ever walk or use a horse for more than two miles or so. Jaenelle knows just about everyone in the book and just about everyone knows who she is and adores her on the first meeting (unless they're evil). The result is that the Black Jewels universe feels very small and claustrofobic.Two stars for the idea, half a star for the writing style. Rounded down because I think it's very overrated at this point."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"If I had to sum up this book in one word it would be \\"disappointing\\". Ms. Bishop creates a beautiful hierarchy of power with the Blood and drawing their power from Jewels, the delicate psychic roadways of the Winds, and an interesting take on death with the Demon Dead and Guardians. The geography of the different lands, the different races of creatures that occupied them, and the involvement of the Kindred were all wonderfully detailed and fresh. These aspects of the story are fascinating, well developed, and highly imaginative, and I truly wish the actual storyline could live up to this promise.In contrast of the terrific world she created, Ms. Bishop's characters could not be any more two-dimensional and tiresome. For all of her attempts to write \\"Dark Fantasy\\" and to challenge traditional images of hell/darkness (with names like Saetan, Daemon, and Lucivar) she creates some pretty standard, dull heroes and villains. No one hero is capable of doing anything wrong--Jaenelle most of all. I don't think I've read a heroine this mind-numbing in a long time. For a story like this to work, there needs to be actual, palpable danger for the heroine and the heroine's world. There was no question or danger here--Jaenelle was all powerful, pure hearted, and of course could overcome the simple-minded evil Queens. Hardly scintillating material.So far as writing skills go, I am entirely done with the word \\"snarl\\". There are other adjectives to describe guttural noises.Even on a romance front, I was disappointed. Daemon, the only true attempt at a multidimensional character, felt like a washed-out letdown by Book 3. There was some nice tension from the first book--I enjoyed Daemon's struggle--but it led to absolutely no payoff. When Witch and he finally get it on, it's almost laughable.In short, the whole story felt contrived. Ms. Bishop creates dark scenes (like rape or murder) with no real consequence (everyone is *really* ok), an entirely dull love story, and \\"danger\\" without there really being any threat.Ms. Bishop is the true Sadi here--these books give the ghost of promise and tease the reader seductively...only to find the results flaccid and leaving the reader completely unfulfilled.A (generous) two and a half-stars."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I recently stumbled onto this particular genre. And I can't believe how lucky I am. Where have I been all my life? It's fun. It's fantastic. It's absolutely amazing to me that someone can create an entire reality like this.Anyway.

It is that good."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This collection of the Black Jewels Trilogy bu Anne Bishop is a diamond among glass in dark fantasy novels. Dark, fantastic, sensual, breath-taking, funny, page-turning masterpeice. Whatever Anne Bishop was thinking when she wrote this, we need more authors like her. This Trilogy is full of mystery, self-doubt, betrayal, trust, love, longing, a father's love, a lover's cry, a desperate need to protect.This Trilogy is \\"Dreams Made Flesh\\", so to speak. This is a must read for Piers Anthony fans and Anne McCaffery Fans alike. This is a must read for ALL fantasy fans."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I originally bought this book because I liked the cover and needed something with meat to it. I'm a fast reader, what can I say?! I didn't intend that this series would be anything but a distraction.It made me a fan, and I can't say I'm sorry. I read the book in a week flat, couldn't put the thing down. Bishop has a way of portraying her characters to make them three-dimensional--something the reader cares about even long after the book has been put down.I won't spend time summarizing the plot or the characters, since I always feel robbed if I accidentally read a spoiler hidden in a synopsis. I'll spare any future readers that much. I will recommend this book to lovers of sci-fi, fantasy, or even romance, since there are some adult themes. This book is irresistable, and I've got a sneaking suspicion that it won't rest on my bookshelf very long before I've got to pick it up again."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This book was absolutely wonderful. This is a trilogy that is best bought together, because it is one of those that you HAVE to finish the entire trilogy. The story is put together well, the descriptions are excellent, and the characters are the kind that you feel like you actually know by the end. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new author to read, and I would recommend any book written by Anne Bishop, as I have read them all. Just make sure you set some time away to read the entire thing!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"If you're tired of elves, dwarves and dragons, you must try this series. I found Bishop's world and characters to be some of the most intriguingly crafted that I've read. And you might as well buy the compendium edition, because you'll be aggravated if you have to wait to get the second book; the first book is a cliff-hanger.The trilogy is not high literature, but it is replete with compelling characters, true humor, and a world and premise that will capture your imagination.It is also sexy in an often dark way--not to the extent of Carey's Kushiel series but, if you loathed that, you might find yourself disturbed.Very high recommendation!"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Have you ever read I a peice of fiction in which the illusion is so complete, so perfect, you forget that it is fiction and are swept away? So much so that you can't stand the thought of the book ending, having to leave the novles world is actually somewhat painful?Well this book caused that affect in me. It was the first ever to do so, and it is at the top of a short list of books that I've re read. In Short it is an absolute favorite. Now my praises aside, about the book.Warning: This book is very dark, and very graphic in some places. if you are new to the dark fantasy genre you might want to start a little lighter and a little shorter. However if you enjoy long!! Densely woven,intricately detailed epic stories, that will touch, enrage and disturb at the same time and very often on the same page. then this is the book for you. Orginal plots are somewhat rare in the world of fantasy, you get one here. Black jewels, takes all the motifs we know( dragons, demons, witches magic.) And some we don't, stands them on their heads and spins them around. Hate, power, evil, redemption, love, magic death, life, rage, and honor. Could you want more.There is a sort of loose prequel to Black Jewels, called The Invisible Ring. You don't have to read it first though, also if you love TBJT and need to Find out what happens to a certain queen and her consort, not to mention lots of other must know info Read Dreams Made Flesh. All three books by anne Bishop. More to come, says the author in 2008.Happy Reading"},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"The Black Jewels Triliogy, especialsy in this three-in-one set, is a GREAT read. I spent many a late night getting to know the charactors of this story. I am really glad that I now have this series in my personal library. I have been buying all of Anne Bishop's other books because these charactors really grow on you. I do have a warning for the faint of heart though... this series has some very descriptive \\"bad\\" things that the main charactor experiences. These sections are very strongly persuasive as far as not liking the \\"bad guys\\" goes.The blood drinkers/dead/night walkers in this book technicly classify this series as a \\"vampire\\" story but it is NOT a - \\"I vant to suck your blood\\" - kind of thing. Totaly unexpected \\"vampire\\" activity.I was enchanted with the range of creatures Bishop created in this book. They added a new depth to all of the charactors personalities.Over-all, i really love this series."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"What I will always love about the Black Jewels books is their originality. None of the traditional fantasy races and plots, i.e. someone starting out as a peasant and slowly discovering they have the power, and then becoming a superhero. This world is unique and stands on its own. The \\"craft\\" is also pretty unique, but you have to be careful not to try to over-analyze it all. Psychic shields. Sight shields. Physical shields. Seduction tendrils. Someone can \\"vanish\\" a dagger or a suitcase and sort of call 'em back in whever they want. But you won't get a long description of where things go when they're vanished. There's a few things like that which go unexplained, and it works better that way. It's part of this world, that's just the way it works. Dive in and don't pick it apart. Let the imagination take over and enjoy. I couldn't put the stuff down once I got past the funky character names. I will admit, at first I saw these main characters coming at me like \\"Saetan\\" and \\"Daemon\\" and \\"Lucivar\\" and it kind of took a little getting used to, but once you get a little more into it they develop their own feel and the names no longer matter.I couldn't quite give the trilogy 5 stars though. I picked the books up again about 2 years later and read them again, and they weren't quite as juicy the second time. Like a few other people, I started to get turned off by all the \\"frozen mask\\" expressions and snarls, and how every sentence anyone says has to come with descriptions of that person's facial expressions that really aren't completely plausible, like golden warm eyes turning pale yellow right after someone says one more thing. Anything anyone says causes someone else to have some kind of facial reaction or a snarl, or to freeze solid with terror or anger. That gets tiring after a while. I understand why you would use it, because it helps to convey the sense that when you're dealing with the Blood, you're not dealing with humans. They are much more than human, so their expressions and demeanors have to be capable of much more along with it I guess. I'm glad she wrote the sequel book of short stories to wrap up the question of whether or not Jaenelle and Daemon get a happily ever after. Get it along with this main trilogy and pick it up right after you put this down."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is amazing, addicting, and fascinating. You never want it to end. I connected with the characters and thought of them as my friends. Their wishes become my own. That's great since I usually root for the villain. It's obvious from the first chapter why this trilogy is award winning. I loved this book so much I started drawing sketches of the characters. Talk about being obsessed!! Jaenelle Angelline is Witch, dreams made into flesh. She is the most powerful witch ever born and ever will be born. She has to be raised carefully so that she does not become evil. This book is about her life from childhood to adulthood her friends, and her enemies. Any person that reads fantasy should not miss this Jewel."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"(not 5 stars...I goofed! Its a decent 4 star though)This series was allot of fun.

This book doesn't shy away from topics of sex, violence or the ugliest side of human emotions. A well crafted storyline and nicely designed world with characters (witches, demon-dead, warlords) you will hate and like, and some you will hate again. The only drawback of the story was the authors overuse of certain discriptive words such as snarl or snarling (really over 100 times), it seemed at times the only discription used. With that aside, overall the book was an enjoyable and disturbing read into the quest for love, the quest for power and how both can be ruthless and maddening."},{"Title":"Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"Anne Bishop's masterpiece of fantasy will take you on a roller coaster ride of emotions.

It is the perfect guide for any young man interested in playing collegiate baseball and also for anyone who needs information on a particular college program."},{"Title":"Queen of the 'B's: Ida Lupino Behind the Camera (Contributions to the Study of Popular Culture)","review":"This anthology will be the starting point for future studies of the directorial work of Ida Lupino.The back matter contains much information of value to researchers. There are lists of the films directed by Lupino, giving the plots, production details and the names of those associated with each film (the lists relating to motion pictures are more complete than those for her television shows), a bibliography of writings about Lupino, and a list of various research resources.The book includes a brief introduction by editor Annette Kuhn, and features an article on each of Lupino's major motion pictures. Each article opens with a summary of the plot, followed by an analysis of the characters and their actions. These are accompanied by an article on television shows directed by Lupino; but this is less focused than the other articles, because her television output was massive, disparate, and often conducted under conditions that limited her role.The articles give no more than passing attention to such technical aspects of Lupino's work as lighting, casting, set design, and camera work. Many of the contributors posit fresh assessments of Lupino's work in response to earlier critics who argued that she was not really a feminist. But the authors' failure to define feminism hampers their collective efforts. The volume properly gives attention to the films Lupino directed as an independent producer. In these, she tackled topics such as unwanted pregnancies, rape, and bigamy, that the major studios avoided. But, in evaluating much of her later work, it is difficult to gauge the extent of her influence as a director.The articles are of inconsistent quality. In what is perhaps the best of them, Diane Waldman gives a well structured and carefully documented assessment of the 1949 film, \\"Not Wanted.\\" Rejecting an interpretation based exclusively on the film itself, Waldman describes the contemporary treatment of unwed mothers, the theme of this movie, and follows this with an explanation of the changes in the motion picture industry that made life easier for independent producers like Lupino. Then, drawing on the records of the Production Code Administration, she illustrates some of the issues that concerned censors, and how producers/directors negotiated with censors to get scripts approved.Unfortunately, not all of the articles are up to this standard. Especially problematical is the article by Mary Beth Haralovich, Janet Jakobsen, and Susan White (hereinafter, \\"the reviewers\\") about \\"The Trouble With Angels\\" (TTWA) a 1966 film based on Jane Trahey's novel, Life With Mother Superior, that follows the experiences of Mary Clancy and Rachel Devery in their three years at St. Francis Academy. The reviewers adopt the approach that Waldman rejected. They focus on the film, rather than its director, and treat the film as if it were entirely Lupino's creation, although it reflects Trahey's novel and Blanche Hanalis' screenplay, as well as Lupino's direction. The reviewers ignore the question posed in Kuhn's introduction regarding the themes of motion pictures: \\"To what extent are these attributable solely to the director?\\" Their conclusions are apparently grounded only in their personal interpretation of the film, and not on Trahey's book, Lupino's other films, or her personal life style. For them, the film is like a Rorschach test, and their conclusions may reflect what was in their minds, rather than what was in the mind of Lupino herself.The reviewers tend to find sexual symbolism in nearly every event, and in curiously unexpected ways. Thus, when Mary persuades several of her classmates to adopt aliases, the reviewers contend that their adopted names \\"play on the ambiguity of the \`nunnery' as a locus of chastity or as a place of ill repute.\\" The reviewers see smoking as \\"the signifier of implied sexuality\\" between Mary and her friend Rachel--one smoking scene \\"establishes a number of possibilities for queer relationships.\\" (Although they call attention to other aspects of the movie's opening credit sequence, which features cartoon-like representations of some characters, the reviewers fail to comment on the implications of the scene in which Mary, having lit a cigar, is struck down by lightning and then admonished by a large hand that descends from above to shake a critical finger at Mary--a scene that seems to suggest divine disapproval of smoking and whatever it might signify.) The reviewers see the fate of a sister, who was imprisoned and perhaps raped by the Nazis, as an indication of \\"the realities of violence inflicted upon women and nuns,\\" as though these groups were special targets of Nazi persecution. The sorrow and loneliness of women in a home for the aged, the reviewers tell us, is \\"a woman's fate if she chooses the heterosexual world,\\" as though only those who lived a heterosexual life style experienced the consequences of aging.The reviewers emphasize the importance of \\"gazes.\\" They acknowledge that there are spiritual gazes as well as sensual ones; but it is the latter that occupy nearly all of their attention. But, in interpreting sensual gazes, problems arise because the female body \\"has traditionally been made to stand in for all visually-oriented sensuality.\\" Thus, the \\"male gaze,\\" the \\"female desiring gaze,\\" and the \\"lesbian gaze\\" all have a woman for their object. Not only that, but a woman may employ any one of the three gazes. For example, after hearing Mary's uncle George remark that \\"business affairs keep me extremely busy,\\" the Mother Superior glances through the window at George's glamorous \\"secretary\\" and luxury convertible. The timing of her glance, the camera shot of the secretary and the car, and the Reverend Mother's sarcastic remark, \\"I'm extremely interested in hearing all about your devotion to Mary,\\" all suggest that the Mother Superior's glance reflects deep skepticism regarding George's statement. And this impression is confirmed by the shooting schedule for this scene: \\"Mother Superior ready to expel Mary and Rachel when she spots Uncle George's 'secretary' waiting outside at the car. He tries to sell his devotion to his niece, but Mother Superior doesn't buy.\\" To the reviewers, however, it appears that the Reverend Mother \\"has adopted the 'male gaze'\\" toward the secretary. Later, when the Mother Superior's expression seems to reflect dismay at the skimpy uniforms worn by the St. Francis band, the reviewers explain that she has again adopted the \\"male gaze.\\" The reviewers do not explain how sensual gazes may be distinguished from spiritual ones, or how one type of sensual gaze may be distinguished from another. Nor do they present any evidence that Trahey, or Hanalis, or Lupino shared their interpretation of gazes.The reviewers conclude that Mary's decision to become a nun was not about religion, but about \\"how to escape the lot of women in general,\\" reflecting her awareness of \\"the dangers of the heterosexual world outside the convent.\\" The reviewers fail to comment on Mary's Catholic upbringing and her questionable family life (centered on her philandering uncle) as factors that might have caused her to view the sisters as a surrogate family, and predisposed her to become a nun. On the other hand, the reviewers tell us, in a grotesquely unperceptive sentence, that Rachel \\"is not sure which life calls her--the convent or the heterosexual outside world.\\" Actually, it is quite clear which life calls her. Pretty clearly, Rachel is not a Catholic (among other things, she cannot make the sign of the cross), and, unlike Mary, she has a loving family to whom she can return. Rachel shows keen interest in hearing about the French boy Mary meets during one summer vacation; and those for whom she expresses admiration (Jack Lemmon, Mr. Petrie, Burt Lancaster) are all men. When it seems that Sister Constance will return to civilian life, Rachel finds it quite appropriate that Sister Constance, who had been \\"trapped into being a nun,\\" might now reunite with a long lost lover. When Mary asks for something to stuff in the window to keep out the snow, Rachel offers a magazine whose cover features a picture of the Pope! Upon learning that Mary plans to become a nun, Rachel is shocked and initially characterizes Mary as a \\"traitor.\\" Rachel is in fact a foil to Mary. Their experiences suggest why one girl would choose the convent while another would not.Of course, if one accepts the reviewers' interpretation, it raises fresh questions. Would Rosalind Russell (the Mother Superior in TTWA), who was a devout Catholic, and Hayley Mills (Mary), whose vast popularity would have been severely undermined by any deviation from traditional gender roles, have agreed to perform in a film in which a Catholic school was compared with \\"a place of ill repute,\\" and in which and sisters and students exchanged \\"lesbian\\" gazes and contemplated homosexual activity? The reviewers do not cite any evidence that Lupino would have involved Russell and Mills, without their informed consent, in a film that might be extremely offensive to their sensibilities. In fact, the readily available evidence suggests that Lupino's gender orientation was somewhat conventional. To a biographer, she denied that she was a lesbian, and asserted that she did not trust women. She was married three times, and had a romantic interest in Humphrey Bogart. One writer remarked of Lupino's films that \\"the solutions to women's problems within the films are often conventional, even conservative, more reinforcing of 1950s ideology than undercutting it.\\" In her introduction, Kuhn noted that Lupino was perhaps \\"something of a disappointment for feminist film criticism.\\" Late in her career, Lupino commented regretfully, \\"I did so many westerns and action shows I was looked upon as a director who could not direct a man and a woman story.\\" She does not sound like someone who would have directed the movie described by the reviewers.In her introduction, Kuhn argues that Lupino's films deserve a careful reassessment from a feminist perspective. But she warns that such a reassessment \\"exposes the snares that beset the very idea of a feminist canon. Whose work is to qualify for entry, and on what grounds?\\" Does 1950s feminism differ from 1960s feminism? Is it appropriate to speak of feminism as a unified philosophy? That is but one of the conceptual problems that faced the contributors. An equal or greater problem is that the screenplays for the great majority of the films Lupino directed were written by others. As Kuhn observes, \\"Lupino nearly always directed other writers' material.\\" Lists in the back matter indicate that Lupino wrote the screenplays for four of the six films she directed for her own film companies. But, in the years from 1955 to 1969, during which she directed nearly 60 television shows, there was only one for which she wrote the screenplay. In their discussion of Lupino's television work, Mary Kearney and James Moran criticize some articles about Lupino for focusing \\"not on her skill as a director, but on the spectacle of her female body and its \`feminine accoutrements.'\\" But the contributors to this volume also generally neglect her directorial skill. This neglect may be due largely to Lupino's failure to keep records about her work as a director. But, curiously, it seems that none of the contributors sought evidence of Lupino's feminism in her own life style or among her personal associations, organizational affiliations, or public statements. And some of her statements (\\"I hate women who order men around.\\") seem anything but feminist. Lupino was the only female director who produced a substantial body of work during the 1950s and 1960s; and it is appropriate to ask whether she was a feminist. But her motion picture career may not provide an answer to this question. And the presence of feminist influence, or its absence, may not be the most important aspect of Lupino's cinematic career.But, when all is said and done, this book is worth a careful reading. It contains much food for thought."},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"I finished Angel of Music by Carrie Hernandez three days ago. Usually my reviews are written the day of or day after completion of the book, yet with this one, I found that my mind had too much to explore still for me to set my thoughts down upon it. Even now, I find words difficult in expressing what I think, for truly, I shall continue to think on this book for a great many more weeks to come.I am certain not everyone would find this book a must-read, but I would surely think myself deprived if I should ever find my library without it. Angel of Music is a rare and precious jewel in my collection and I can only hope that Carrie Hernandez finds more inspiration so that I can fill my shelves with her books.__________________________Please read the full review at:[...]"},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"BRAVA! BRAVA! BRAVISIMA! Carrie has done it right! Her stories prove that detailed research is its own reward! With prose that wrenches at the heart, she gives us a look at why Carlotta is who and what she is! What a stroke of genius to do a story about The Diva! And her Erik leaps off the pages the way Leroux portrayed him, a VERY conflicted man. Despite all the fans' wishful thinking, Erik is really NOT a nice guy. He is a killer, he has little, if any, conscience about his actions, and Carrie has brought this fact to full light. And I always wandered what would make such a genius as Erik, fall in 'love' with a self-absorbed young soprano. Now I know. Thank you Carrie! You have done right by M. Leroux, Erik, and La Carlotta! This is a must have for all Phantom Phans!"},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"The recurring theme of the stories in \\"Angel of Music\\" is the interaction between Lotte and her Angel. Of the 3 tales, the 2nd, \\"Phantoms of the Mind\\", had the most interesting twist, although it is the saddest. The relationship between Erik and the child Lotte is poignant. Her dealings with Christine and her father are filled with the pain she suffers after Erik escapes the gypsies, and her true identity provides some insight into the characters and personalities about which Leroux wrote in his original. The last story, \\"The Portal\\", provides a look at what life might have been like if Christine had returned and tried to have a normal life with Erik. In this tale, we see the consequences suffered in that attempt and the child (Lotte) which results. Lotte demonstrates the type of temperament a child might have inherited from Erik. Overall, I enjoyed this book. It delivers 3 different, but interesting insights into the interdependence of the Angel and those he touches."},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"I think that this book should be a must own for any phantom fan. Buy Susan Kay's Phantom first, but make this second on your list. Well written, and very imaginative, while still being believable enough to lose yourself in each of the stories. You'll wish they were longer, as I did!"},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"I was very excited to get this book because I had heard of Carrie Hernandez's love for Phantom so I thought it would deffinatley be a good read. I was right! The book has three different stories, the original story of \\"Little Lotte\\" that Christine's Father told her about in almost all Phantom Versions. The second story is then about who \\"Lotte\\" actually is and that REALLY suprised me once I figured out who she was...and yet I see it fitting too. The third story is about a child who discovers the true identity of her mother and father...perhaps a little too late.an excellent book for any PHANS :-D"},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"Just read Carrie Hernandez's \\"Angel\\". It is simply excellent and loaded with intrigue, mystery, suspense, adventure, love, hate, passion and sometimes a contorted humor. Carrie has that rare ability to paint pictures with words, and her words roll across the pages like an artist's brush across a canvas. A must read. Bravo! Ten Stars!"},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"This book is just gorgeous.Carrie's Phantom tales are lovely and touching.I really recommend you read this book: it's a true treasure.Sandra (Ladyghost)."},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"Carrie Hernandez's 'Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera' is comprised of two short stories and a novella. ***Please note: this book contains adult situations and would not be appropriate for minors.***'Little Lotte' is a charming short story, based on Leroux's novel. It is a take-off of Raoul's recollection of his visits to the Daae's, and is so well-written that it could easily be seamlessly inserted into any English translation of Leroux's novel. Anyway, the story begins with Papa Daae buying Christine the red scarf, much as we find it in Leroux's novel, with some fleshing out. It then goes into the story behind the tale 'Little Lotte' that Papa Daae tells the children. The result is a charming story of finding the beauty in everyday things that even the children of today would love.'Phantoms of the Mind' is the novella. Carrie Hernandez has intertwined the stories of all of the main players of the POTO in an amazing way. It starts off with a little girl, Charlotte (nicknamed Lotte), going to the local circus. Eager to find acceptance, she offers to clean the cages for the gypsies who run the circus, and stumbles upon a man in a cage. She befriends the man, and the story quickly takes off. Soon we are shown a side of Christine, Papa Daae, the managers, Carlotta, and others, that most of us have never imagined. This novella is pure genius, and I would recommend it to anyone over the age of eighteen. It does contain adult situations, so I would not recommend it for minors. I have relayed most of it to my daughter (12), leaving out the parts that are not appropriate for her age.'The Portal', a short story, is an alternate ending to Leroux's POTO. Carrie Hernandez is such a talented writer that I loved it in spite of the fact that I did not agree with parts of it. The lengths Erik goes to to be with his love are amazing, yet believable. Christine's future is tragic, but realistic. There is a child, but I will not spoil the story by telling you whose it is. Nor will I delve into Christine's marital status, although we are told in the first sentence. I know there are many readers and phans who would like this one as much, if not more than, I did. And, I thoroughly enjoyed it.I really do not have any negative comments about the book, and I tend to be very opinionated. If there were anything lacking, I'd be all over it. This book would be a welcome addition to any phan's library."},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"Like millions of others, I have been a Phan for many years and have read everything I could get my hands on, especially the Phan phiction online and published phic novels. I couldn't wait to read this book, especially given Ms. Hernandez's \\"Phantom\\" background i.e. her website and the much missed magazine and anthologies. While the twist on Little Lotte's true identity was surprising and even a little sad, and the tale of Christine and Raoul charming and sweet, I was completely turned off by \\"The Portal\\". I got so tired of Erik's \\"stench\\", the vapid and spaced-out Christine/zombie, and the mischevious brat who made Susan Kay's young Erik seem almost saintly. I think the stench references were offensive and mean. Yes, M. Leroux wrote that Erik's hands \\"smelled of death\\", but it was not essential to the original story so I couldn't see why it was so important to bring it up again and again in \\"The Portal\\". We all understand that Erik was a \\"living corpse\\" in appearance but I don't think Leroux meant he truly was a rotting corpse. It just seemed gross and irrelevant. As for Christine, this was not the girl who visited Erik many times unaccompanied, actually lived with him for a fortnight, and eventually was willing to sacrifice herself for Raoul. Even after the author's explanation for her behaviour it just didn't make sense to me. Lastly, the child's role in all this. It seemed like all the nasty things she did were only to make her seem more like \\"daddy\\" and not a cry for attention from her poor, hapless mother. I couldn't even sympathize with her. All in all the book is worth a read, especially for \\"Phantoms of the Mind\\". If not for \\"The Portal\\", I would have given the book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"This is a marvelous book for any phantom fan. The way the author connects everything first written by Gaston LeRoux is mind boggling. You will feel pity, awe, amazement, and you will feel the pain that lies in Erik's heart. Everything that happens in this book will make you truly wonder about the underlining message possibly left my LeRoux when he first wrote the Phantom of the Opera."},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"This is the sixth Phantom related book that I've read since recently seeing the 2004 movie version of POTO which I LOVE. This book is one of my favorites!! I can describe it in one word....\\"SURPRISE\\". I don't want to give things away about it but if you love POTO then you just HAVE to read this book."},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"I'm obsessed with Phantom of the Opera, so anything that deals with it I'm there. I found this book by accident and was intrigued by its cover. I have an open mind when I read fanfics because I respect people's views and opinions and also their fantasies. I must admit, I was a little skeptical at first with this book, but I must say I truly did enjoyed it. Carrie Hernandez' approach to the real story behind \\"Little Lotte\\" (which is what the whole book concentrates on) is quite interesting. I was extremely shocked when finding out who the REAL Little Lotte was, and after pondering for a bit about it...it all makes sense. This book is based on the original novel, which I find it to be more intriguing since many fics take after the musical (I'm not saying it's bad, it's just a good change). I have to say that Carrie Hernandez did a wonderful job with this book and I highly recommend it to anybody who is interested or is just obsessed with Phantom of the Opera."},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"I found this book to be fascinating! Hernandez has a keen insight into the human condition. I was especially moved by the section on Little Lotte. My daughter Jan is now reading the book. When I get it back I am anxious to reread that section.What a beautiful approach to life! I have ordered three copies which will make great Christmas gifts. I am looking forward to Carrie Hernandez's next novel. If you can become a fan after one book...Count me in."},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"This book is three stories that all have one thing in common; Erik. (The Phantom.)I finished reading this book yesterday, and I absolutely loved it. well, most of it actually.I was not too fond of the first story, \\"The Story of Little Lotte,\\" though it wasn't actually a bad story, it just wasn't my style. the second story (Phantoms of the Mind) however, nearly tore my heart in two. it was just so sad and filled with despair I thought I might have some sort of breakdown from the pain it made me feel. I haven't read a story that has done that to me in quite a while. I also hated it because of the unfairness that the real Little Lotte had to go through in the story, I even hated her character at times. but the story was still good to me, it was written very nicely and it made me really feel. I know I will be reading that particular story again and again. the last story in the book, \\"The Portal,\\" was one I found rather bittersweet. the zombie-like state he apparently had Christine mostly stuck in was the only really \\"bitter\\" part. I don't think Erik would have screwed up like that so badly, but then, who can really say? perhaps it helps more if one looks at it as an accident. moving on, I loved his child. I felt she was very much Erik's, and I loved their talk at the end. very sweet to end the book with. I did feel like it was left a little too open in the end though, even with the epilogue, but I also perceive that as wanting more, meaning I truly did love this book, and the author did a great job."},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"I can't possible say how long I wanted to read this book after all the good reviews of it, it was like an enigma that I had to possess... So you can imagine my disappoint when I finished the book and realized it was only ehh.The first little Lotte story was nice a a good start but it was really only a forerunner..The real cream was &#34;Phantoms of the Mind&#34; I was really and pleasantly surprised with that story (especially with who Little Lotte was) I wish the whole book had been this story and I would have given it five stars and a firm recommendation. But as is such &#34;The Portal&#34; pulls the book back (not in a good way) and is so predictable it feels trite. The high cost of this book just does make up for only one good story, I couldn't rate it any higher than 3 stars."},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"\\"Angel of Music\\" is a wonderful set of three well-written short stories. Each one focuses on Little Lotte and her relationship with the Angel of Music. In combination, these stories give a greater understanding of Leroux's book.I enjoyed the first two stories very much, but I didn't care much for \\"The Portal,\\" although parts of it were very interesting. I didn't like the repeated references to Erik's repulsive odor, which resembled that of rotting flesh. We know Erik's facial deformity was quite alarming, and that Leroux said Erik's hands smelled of death. I believe Leroux was speaking figuratively, referring to the fact that Erik had committed multiple murders, not that Erik literally smelled like a decaying corpse.Aside from this, however, these short stories are very innovative, interesting and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Angel of Music: Tales of the Phantom of the Opera","review":"This book with its compilation of stories was actually the first Phantom literature I ever came across. All others have paled beside it. Surprising that there are so few reviews for this author. Her Phantom is real and tormented; one can almost palpate his presence on the pages. The plots have depth and stunning twists, dark and sinister is the range of emotions Hernandez explores. I only wish she would write more, as I would definitely read whatever she published, regardless of whether it was based on the Phantom of the Opera. I highly recommend the book, though it might give grammar-aged children more than a few nightmares."},{"Title":"Tongues of Flame (Deep South Books)","review":"I just heard Miss Brown give a reading from this volume, and I must say it was a very well-told story.

The characterizations are a bit better, though not by much, and it seemed to have a touch more Star Wars feel than the others, which hardly seemed to be Star Wars books they were so far from what the characters are supposed to be. The plot was a little more believable too, though some parts of it were still very silly. It had a higher sense of drama too, in that it actually HAD a sense of drama. This would be a good series for kids twelve and under, though older fans probably won't like them."},{"Title":"Prophets of the Dark Side (Star Wars: Jedi Prince, Book 6)","review":"I liked this book because it involves on the things of a good book.

Jack is now living on the west coast, and we miss him. I keep his book Goodnight, Grace Notes at my bedside, not just to remember his fine performances, but because his poems are great company. Jack writes mostly about ordinary things: traffic, cars that break down, sport teams that fail, childhood fistfights, but just when you've had a good laugh or are nodding in recognition, he peels back your skin to show the pulse of truth throbbing beneath. \\"Careful What You Wish For\\" is the perfect example. It always catches me by surprise and never fails to move me. If you have the opportunity, see Jack live.

In my bookcase by an alphabetical coincidence Heller is next to Hasek and it has always seemed to me to be a very appropriate pairing: John Yossarian and Jozef Svejk, the two great antiheroes of the 20th century, both gamely trying to stay alive despite the best efforts of boneheaded superiors to kill them for the greater glory of whatever the cause du jour is. For those who dont like the narrative style I suggest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms, which is easier to read and is also antiwar; for those who don't like the politics of Catch-22, well, what can I say? You either get the joke or you don't. There is a word for people like you: Nately&quot;How old are you? &quot;I'll be 20 next July,&quot; Nately said. &quot;If you live,&quot; the old man said.

Not only does it entertain the reader with its mentally deranged characters, it actually has an important message. Everyone can relate to at least one character in this convincing anti-war novel.

When you read Mr. Heller's work, you are waxed into the setting and see-saw back and forth between the same pivotal scenes over and over again--living life the way that Yossarian does. For anyone that dislikes this novel, I recommend watching the movie one time. It will resolve some of the questions I have seen in other people's reviews.I do not recommend watching the movie INSTEAD of reading the book.

Indeed, Yossarian lives!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is the definitive modern satire and deals with all of our society's 'pet themes' like racism, human idiosyncrasy, the horror of war, bureaucratic obtuseness and imprisoned lives. The distinguishing feature of this novel however is how much FUN it is to read: a pleasure from the first chapter to the last. Heller's caustic, poignant humor had me chuckling at least once per page throughout, something no other book has ever done for me. The acumen he displays in exposing our often circular reasoning was particularly memorable and is immortalized in the phrase Catch-22.The book is far from a technical masterpiece - it is certainly not written in iambic pentameter - but the simple, lucid style and accessible register facilitates the progression of the story perfectly. As Albert Einstein said &quot;Things should be as simple as possible - but not any simpler&quot; and Heller honours this axiom very well. The only &quot;difficult&quot; element of style is the non-chronological plot structure, which can be confusing at times. Yet, even this serves a purpose, that is, to create an atmosphere of confusion that adds to the overall effect the novel has on the reader.The delightful entertainment value of Catch-22 is an essential element of, and adds greatly to, its central virtue: the satiric exposure of human inadequacies. However much fun the novel is to read it remains a social commentary that - below the surface - is as frightening as any Stephen King novel. Heller strips reality bare, eliminating the hue of our opinions, the bells-and-whistles and comforting rationalizations; forcing the reader to look at the world - and himself - impartially. Pablo Picasso once said that &quot;Art is a lie that makes us see the truth&quot;, and Heller's artistic masterpiece shows us that reality is more frightening than fiction and after reading this novel I'm sure you'd agree."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book can be difficult to read because it is filled with humor. You will constantly be rereading paragraphs to make sure you read correctly. Heller will show you some of the silliness of humanity and western culture. This book is excellent light reading for anyone over 14, but its meaning is powerful. A Classic. Long Live Yossarian!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"i don't know what's up with the one and two-star reviewers, but i guess it's the sign of the times. writer tony medina once said that america is the dumbest country in the world, and i'd have to agree. people have become so accustomed to the john grishams and steven kings that they cringe at the thought of reading something that might stimulate their minds, that may cause them to see the world differently...i love the way heller manipulates language throughout the novel. sometimes it's b.s.( like an abbott and costello &quot; who's on first routine, where you never get the answer,cos you're not supposed to )others, it reveals alot about a country where truth and image can be manufactured, where nothing is ever what it seems...some parts of the book made me laugh out loud ( ex. the scene in the resteraunt when yossarian is having dinner with the italian girl and she tells him she doesn't want to sleep with him, then asks him if he wants to sleep with her and his response: &quot; i just want to have dinner with you. &quot; totally cracked me up. now the scene with the crab apples makes perfect sense !and there were scenes in the novel that brought chills to my spine and left me outraged ( snowden's death and aarfy's nonchalant murder of a hooker and his blase confession of it, made me wonder are humans really intelligent forms of life, or just another notch on the food chain.this book will never be dated. its more than relevant today, now that we have a supreme-court appointed president and a conservative high court ready to wreck havoc on our freedoms. and most people are just sitting by and watching it happen like sheep. no one is getting angry.this book ranks among the catcher in the rye, the autobiograpy of malcolm x, on the road, and ellison's the invisible man as books that really touched me and made me think. and you can't get that from reality t.v"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is a modern masterpiece, an intricate, deliberate, perfect combination of wry sarcasm, raw wit, and bitter cynicism scattered amongst the lives of desperate men trying to live up to their ideals from within the greatest conflict of the modern age. Heller's text of Catch-22 is a recipe for delicious humor and refreshing insight that make the bitter pills he's pushing down your throat slide down so much more smoothly, almost too easily. As an author, Heller will not rest until you, as the reader, are his equal as a cynic. He pulls it off masterfully, too, his persuasion of patriots into perversion of their most beloved creeds, his destruction of the reader's regard for respected traditions and accepted notions about America. Through the words of the brash, self-centered Captain Yossarian as well as the from the perch of omniscient narrator, Heller tells it like it is (says he). The world is a petty place, and survival is job one. That Yossarian, as the antihero, would shamelessly sabotage the arrangement of a dangerous support mission rather than risk his neck to help out others reflects a Darwinian influence that resounds without compassion. &quot;The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on,&quot; rants Yossarian as he argues with the overly intellectual Clevinger. Yossarian displays no qualms as he announces, with conviction, &quot;It doesn't make a damned bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead.&quot; What makes Heller's work in this novel so excellent is the fact although his ideas are morally bankrupt and bleak, he masks their horrid faces masterfully with his ingenious strokes of hilarity. The outstanding comedy put forth by Catch-22 is surely enough proof that Joseph Heller is none other than the Devil. And we should all love him for it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Book Description The novel Catch-22 shows a unique view of World War II. The Story is told in third person and focuses on a colorful character named Yossarian. It takes place in Italy during WWII. The men in the squadron attempt to do their missions and survive. However they keep getting caught in absurd rules that present a no-win situation. The story unfold turning from hilarious comedy to a serious plot. The book is very entertaining as the men try to beat the bureaucratic military system.Review Catch-22 provides extreme entertainment and with a wonderful plot and hilarious comedy. It is a classic satire. It provides a new point of view for war, showing the craziness and absurdities of war. The book starts off being kind of hard to follow with Heller's unique use of paradoxes and oxymoron's. That plus the fact that the story is not told in chronological order makes it a little rough at first. However once into the book it is one of the best books ever written.Catch-22 is a set of rules that the men in the airforce have to follow. At first some of them are confusing and contradicting, but once the reader has a feeling for the style it becomes funny. Everything contradicting everything else the characters soon go crazy. If one wishes to find out what a catch-22 really is then should read this awesome book by Joseph Heller."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Ignore the length of this big book -- it's like a series of wacky SNL skits fused with a morbid and very cynical worldview, and it goes by very quickly...."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is most definately the best book I have ever read. Heller brilliantly portrays the hellish experiences of war with hilarity and horror. Catch-22 is full of ironic contradictions and farcical ancedotes. However, Heller in no way evades or desensitizes the atrocities of war. Fortunately, just when Heller begins to use excessive military jargon, he digresses to a comedic story about one of the men. The keeps the average civilian enraptured. Heller's masterpiece is a book for the satirically minded. Catch-22 should be read by all."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The definitive post war satire should be consumed and appreciated by all literarys. Heller brilliantly manipulates his vast array of characters in hilarious situations, poignantly weaving the doomed bombadier Yossarian's tale into the catastrophic ironies of the war so often overlooked by the populace. In Yossarian, Heller created one of the great characters of modern literature, and with Catch-22 he set the standard for literature surrounding the second world war. The literary world will miss the words of Joseph Heller, which always seemed to be precise and discerning."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller successfully utilizes detailed character developement, an extremely sarcastic tone, and a confusing placement of events, in which he jumps from scene to scene in no particular order, in order to create a humorous yet realistic image of war and the politics that surround war. Heller titles many of his chapters after a character in the novel. This proves how important the characters are; rather than center the novel around events, Heller centers his novel around the characters. Which makes perfect sense. War may involve events, but more importantly, it involves people. Most of Heller's chapters also begin with a description of the character they are titled after. The first sentence of the chapter titled &quot;Colonel Cathart&quot;, Heller begins with &quot;Colonel Cathart was a slick, successful, slipshod, unhappy man of thirty-six who lumbered when he walked...&quot; Although how he walks has absolutely nothing to do with any of the major events of the novel, Heller tells us this in order to give a more personal image of Colonel Cathart. Colonel Cathart is a character in the war; he creates the events, the events do not create him. Heller not only developes his characters without leaving out any personal details, but also portrays the war and its charaters with much humor and sarcasm. It is impossible to read through this novel and not atleast smile. I even laughed out loud a few times. The tone may seem incredibly funny; however, the message is very grim. Heller is telling a story of war. The people in this war, as hilarious as they seem, are really very depressing. Every character has their own set of &quot;issues&quot;. Yossarian, for example, loves every woman he sees. If he lives through the war (another &quot;issue&quot;-obsession with death), he will probably have a very hard time finding a mate. These psycological and emotional damages are the ones Heller is attempting to portray. Usually the funnier it seems, the more devastating, realistically speaking, its effects are. Heller also has a tendency to put all of his events out of order. Perhaps this is to show how the veterans of the war see things, or to show that the events really aren't as important as the people. Either way, it makes the novel somewhat hard to follow, but does make us look more to the characters and their feelings rather than the events taken place. As human beings, we like to take the easier route, and following the character developement is much easier than following the confusing plotline, or lack there of. Overall, the novel was incredibly insightful. Most &quot;war books&quot; are very serious, but Heller's light tone makes Catch-22 stand out. However, we must not forget the underlying message. War damages people mentally, emotionally, and physically forever, even after it's over."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I have to say that of all the fiction books I have read, this is quite probably the best. The quirky logic and pacifist bias appeals to my sense of humour very much. This, combined with the strong feel of madness and nonsense, combines to make a literary work of art. The theme of madness can be well illustrated by Milo's (the fictional mess officer) syndicate, which seems to make a profit while somehow taking terrible losses. I must object to M. Besselink's view, although we are all entitled to our own opinions, but I think that this is a novel that cannot be read if you are not ready for it. Many people will dismiss it as ridiculous and over-complicated - they ought not to read it, as such genius should not be scorned. A must read on the basis that it is a modern literary classic, and will remain so as long as we retain the military and armed conflicts exist."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is truely a wonderful book. It is both extremely funny and sometimes shocking. There are so many memorable characters, it is hard to keep track. You really see the insanity of the military and war.

It's been on my must-read list for years now. It's a comic, tragic, disturbing, stream-of-consciousness comment not only on military life, but on humanity. There's a cast of hundreds, so sometimes it's hard to remember who's who, but it all makes sense by the end of the book. This one's a keeper - I'll read it again before long."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I, as you have noticed probably from my strong rating of it, contend that this book is wonderful, a view into what humanity really is: an intense, inspeperable blend of humor and tragedy. Not that I have any real expereince with the problems covered in this book, being only 14, but I do appreciate its wry and exitentialist views, which tend to lighten even the darkest scenes (especially the last few chapters in hte book) with its juxtapositioning and genius at its utmost highest. Well, there is my opinion, little good it will do the potential buyer, but I still hope that someone reads this and realizes what a wondrous book this is, and that they should read the book for the sheer humanity that you can extract from it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I was looking at the past reviews of this book, interested to see the expected raves but more interesting was the critics of this book, yes it is anti war..but in a tongue in cheek way a soldier would see war. The politics that send him to fight another are soon forgotten in a battle or the bordom of a war... he will hate his leaders who are keeping him away from his loved ones, soldiers in a drawn out war loose the first excitment of this adventure, they see dead and the horrors of war. The characters who are tied up in this insanity see nothing of the big picture, only their daily dramas, they have the right to think all is insane.So this book reflects this, it shows how us normal people survive in a very unusual situation."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"In today's society, the term catch-22 has become a cliche, however, when reading the novel, one becomes more aware of its true meaning and the desperate situation in puts many pilots, such as Yossarian in.Heller's novel Catch-22 is a satircal comedy about world war II in which Yossarian, the main character, is frustrated because people he hasn't met keep trying to kill him while he is bombing their town. Although the plot sounds a little odd, Heller ties together stories of pilots in Yossarian's squadron into his own life to allow his readers to realize that war is truly a horrible thing.Catch-22 is a satire in that not only is it funny and ironic, but the situations presented are exaggerated, though not made up. From Milo Minderbender's philosphy of &quot;everybody has a share&quot; to Cathcart's attempt to avoid religion and God in prayers, readers will find themselves laughing, a little shocked, and touched.I highly recommend this novel not just for war novel readers, but for everyone who is interested in reading a novel truly worth the time."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"THE cleverest book EVER written. Heller is a true genius-hilarious at the same time as being poignant. A disturbingly real look at the horrors of war, THE epitemy of satire in literature.

It brings to the light how silly war is, and it does so in humorous manner. It's ironic ina sense that it sets things up and then completely blows it off.

Also, it reveals many problems that society is faced with today, and need I say, it does so humorously."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I thought the book was well written and funny at the beginning, but at the end it became a little agravating.

And past the unfunny jokes, I felt like I was getting beaten over the head with the war-is-crazy, beaurocracy-is-endless message. He could have accomplished the same thing in 300 less pages.

One myth is that war is &quot;meaningless&quot;, &quot;useless&quot; or &quot;insane.&quot; Another myth is that Catch-22 is a good book. The reality of this second myth was brought home to me when I attempted to read this book. I gave up in disgust after 80 pages. I felt as though I was reading a children's fairy tale rather than a serious piece of literature. This is a horrible and insulting book. The &quot;plot&quot; (if one can call it a plot) is pointless and the writing is sarcastic and juvenile. We are told by fans of the book that the author intended it to be read this way, as a clever statement about &quot;the insanity of war.&quot;What a load of rubbish. War is ugly and brutal, but it is not &quot;insane.&quot; Many American wars were fought because people believed passionately in a noble cause and were willing to fight to defend that cause against those who would vanquish it. Among these were the Revolutionary War (democratic government), the Civil War (individuals' rights vs. states' rights) and World War II (the defeat of fascism). Catch-22 is an adolescent little book which is applauded by people who believe that nothing is worth fighting for."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This novel is widely regarded as a comic masterpiece. The best I can say about it is that occasionally - and I mean once every hundred pages or so - it makes an acute observation about human nature, war, or bureaucracy.

Got me. I have no idea. Another reviewer said that you could skip chapters and not miss anything. I agree. I first attempted this novel a few years ago. I quit in less than 50 pages, so bored was I. I picked it up again recently, and I'm now less than 50 pages from finishing. What an unfulfilling reading experience this is. There is no central unifying theme or plot - other than that war is hell and the military rarely makes sense. But we knew that, right? As for the whole catch-22 business, sure, that is amusing the first twenty times, but it gets old quickly. This story could have been told in 50 pages and even that would have been too much.Why then, if it is so bad, am I about to finish it? You know how it is. You start reading, and you become determined to complete it, just to say you did. There is no enjoyment in it though. I am looking forward to getting done so that I can read something else. My advice? Don't read this novel. Read the ingredients on food packages in your cupboard instead. You'll have more fun."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I first read Catch-22 when I was in high school in the '70s. I hated it. But throughout my life I kept bumping into people who worshiped this book as if it was a great missing chapter from the Bible. So, I recently decided to give it another try. I'm older and wiser now, I thought, so maybe I might finally &quot;get&quot; whatever it was I missed in the first reading decades ago. I should have stuck with my initial teenage impressions. This book bored me in '70s and it still bored me in the '90s. Great charactor names like... Major Major Major Major! Wow, that's really funny! Whew! This book is a stinker. I don't need Joseph Heller to tell me that war is hell. Why do you?"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"All I can say about this book is that \\"I don't get it.\\" Or what I do get, I don't like. This book is dripping with sarcasm and cynicism, and fails to make any point, in my opinion. Yes, the world is a cynical place, filled with cynical people, and often times large institutions behave in ways that don't make sense. I see this every day in life, so writing a book about this aspect of the world does nothing except breed more cynicism. I have enough, thank you. The characters are flat, the story is... ...weird..., and the apparent point and purpose of the story was waaaay over done. Like I said, I just didn't get it. I do not often put a book down without finishing it, but I figured my life is too short to waste on this supposed \\"great piece of literary work\\".

Second, it has too many mini-stories. It has lots of short stories that doesn't relate to any of the other stories and they are usually pretty boring. Third this is none sense.

Heller is seemingly willing to expend untold pages of drivel to bring off a joke, as in how Major Major became Major Major Major.

MAIN POINT IN CATCH 22: Nothing is worth fighting for."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 lays out an entirely radical yet competent way of explaining war, or rather, of explaining the inexplicability of war. Portrayed through confusion and satire, Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is simultaneously humourous and cutting. Given to similarly amusing and sickening, Heller says all there is to say about the insanity and inhumanity of war.Catch-22 opens during World War II with John Yossarian, a bomber in the Air Force, most fixedly in the hospital with liver problems. However, Yossarian is not actually sick, but is feinting disease to isolate himself from the death of war. A naturally high temperature leads doctors to believe Yossarian is sick when he is not. When Yossarian finally leaves the hospital and goes back to his unit, he finds himself stationed on the island of Pianosa, near the Italian coast and the Mediterranean Sea. It is not clear whether the hospital scene comes before after the next part Yossarian narrates, because his narrative jumps back and forth through time. It is part of the confusion which controls the reader's perception of the nonsensicality of war. Out of the hospital, it seems like nobody seems to truly understand that there is a war going on except for Yossarian. In fact, Yossarian is so set on the death involved with war that he believes that everyone is trying to kill him specifically. He finds it infuriating that &quot;millions of people&quot; are trying to kill for no fault of his own. As he says in an argument with Clevinger about the pointlessness and misdirection of war, &quot;The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.&quot; In this perception, Yossarian is unique and practical, decisively demanding that his life is more important than national ideals or abstract principles. He is completely determined to gain immortality or die trying. The largest perceived threat on Yossarian's life at the moment is his air missions, and so attempts to find a way to be grounded. Yossarian asks Doc Daneeka if he would be grounded if he were found to be crazy. Daneeka tells him yes, but there's a catch: Catch-22 says that there's a rule that says for any pilot to be grounded for reasons of insanity must first ask to be grounded. However, anyone who asks to be grounded must obviously be sane. This is Yossarian's first encounter with Catch-22, but it comes back to meet him and others again and again. The most poignant description of Catch-22 is given near the end of the book by an old woman mourning in the ruins of what was once a city. She sums it up by saying that &quot;[The soldiers] have the right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.&quot; This is portrayed through every bureaucratic move throughout the entire novel. Higher ranking officers do things to their subordinates simply because they can, or because they believe it will give them a good reputation or promotion. Yossarian and his companions are simply inhuman resources for their blindly ambitious superior officers to take advantage of. Their officers would rather their men took pictures of their bombing runs that looked impressive rather than actually accomplish anything. On top of this, the men can never leave, because higher ranking officials simply raise the number of missions they are required to run before leaving. In this way, all the men are retained within the authorities control. All this is done simply because they can. Because &quot;they have the right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.&quot; Catch-22 is, in essence, the law that makes war and murder &quot;legal,&quot; the mind-set that moralizes any immoral act, the entire mechanism under which the army can feasiblely run. Without Catch-22, war could not exist, because of morals, values, ethics, individualism, and anything else that governs rational human thought.A perfect example of the completely nonsensical nature of the surroundings is the power positions. In this story, the mess officer Milo Minderbinder is the one of the most powerful people in the world. He has such a hold on economics that he practically control the entire world. He bombs his own camp as a result of a deal with Germany, he employs the use of every air force in the world for his monetary benefit. Because he controls so much of the market, he manages to buy a shipment of eggs at 7 cents an egg and sell them at 5 cents an egg and still make a profit. He manages this because he is in control of both the company which buys the eggs and the company which sells them. Through subtle and ridiculous manipulation of the market, he probably has more control than any other person in the world.In sharp contrast to this whimsical, comic nature of Milo is the gory, reoccurring scene of Snowden. Yossarian began his downward spiral into cynicism with the death of his copilot Snowden. Throughout the novel, the story slow unwinds of the traumatic experience of Snowden being shot while with Yossarian, and Snowden dying slowly in Yossarian's arms with his entrails splattered all over Yossarian's uniform. Snowden's final words were simply &quot;I'm cold.&quot;Catch-22 is, in my opinion, one of the greatest books written on the insanity of war. The mechanisms Heller uses in his novel to portray confusion which may be hindrances only enhance the entire read of the novel. While many war stories manage to encompass the horror and meaninglessness of war, few if any other manage to do so with so much wit and humour. Nothing is more sickening then to find yourself emotionally connecting the horrible death of a human being with the abstract orders of an ambitious power seeker. Heller's story of the pursuit of life and the tragedy of death finds both the core values and issues at and, as well as the humour and insanity forever present in that never-ending reality: war."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is simply the funniest book ever written. It is, in places, a deeply dark satire of the futility of war; where the lives of ordinary men are risked for the unattainable ideals and pointless pursuits of others. The reason that this book is so impossible to put down is that one moment it will have you rolling on the floor in laughing hysterically and the next crying uncontrollably over the tradgedy of the characters' situation. If I could only own one book, it would unquestionably be this one. If you read it once you'll read it a thousand times. Buy, read, enjoy.

It's an allegorical critique of Capitalism and the whole Western system. In the twilight of socialism that has descended since the fall of Communism, the book's critique seems unduly harsh, but the warning message is worth remembering.What is &quot;Catch-22?&quot; There are at least a dozen examples in the book, and seem very difffernt. What they have in common is that each one is really saying &quot;the rules of the system prevent reform of the system.&quot; Examples include &quot;you can only enter the Major's office when he isn't in it,&quot; and &quot;you can get out of the war if you're crazy, but if you ASK, it proves you're not crazy.&quot;Milo, the arch Capitalist, is in many ways the worst villain in the book. Milo traffics with the enemy, steals medical supplies (leaving his worthless IOU), and even contracts to bomb his own side. The corruption of Milo's money reaches far up the chain of command, and many of the worst absurdities are tracable to Milo's schemes.The only way around the system is to break the rules -- to overthrow it. The new recruits who throw out the personal effects of the dead man in Yossarian's tent show how in a small way; Orr demonstrates it in a large way, and the fact that Orr ends up in Sweden points to socialism as a solution to the problems of the capitalist world.Obviously, in today's world, the example of Sweden doesn't look so appealing, and the Capitalist West has shown substantial ability to reform itself inside its own rules. Still, the book is a great read, and the lesson is worth learning, if only as an example of what we have avoided -- and need to continue to avoid."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22, which, Shakespeare-like, added a new word to the language, is a funny book on one level, but not so funny when viewed from a different angle. Many reviews and opinions of this book mention the phrases &quot;anti-war&quot; and &quot;pacifist&quot;. I do not see anti-war sentiment in this novel (a la Johnny Got His Gun or All Quiet on the Western Front)- rather, I see a criticism of the military itself. While the doings of Milo, Cathcart, Major Major, etc. are a bit exaggerated, they simply reflect common procedure not just in the service, but in any large bureaucratic organization... think about your own work experiences!I found the book to be a bit tedious near the end (the whole incident with Nately's whore and after); it is almost as if Heller was afraid to go &quot;all the way&quot; with the experimentally hilarious style which carries the book up until that point, and settled for a more traditional ending. In any case, it's an enjoyable and thought-provoking novel."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I have read Catch-22 over 20 times, and though some may find this a bit compulsive, I find Heller's classic one of the few antidotes (antivenins?) to postpostmodern existence.In one of Heller's last interviews before his death last year, he said he believed there were no solutions to modern existence, to the problems with society: All one can do is run. So I do. Every time life gets to be too much, I follow Heller's advice and run straight for the solacing lunacy of Yossarian &amp; Co.

Never before has the pretzel logic of characters like these been used so effectively to explain the horrors of war. The same idea is presented over and over(the notion of Catch-22) and it never gets tired. It is so entertaining and so moving that you, like me, may return to the first page right after you finish."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"War is a summary of all possible tragic events. Here the main character, Yossarian, is someone who recognizes that absurdity has become a way of life for a world were logic reasoning has been twisted to support a group of persons who could not care less about their fellow beings.The problem for someone, as him, who suddenly becomes &quot;enlightened&quot; is that he can no longer be understood. Besides he can no longer be in communion with life as it was before. From that perspective everything that occurs becomes absurd, and what is absurd is usually funny. Here is the strength of the book, it proves that once you can laugh about the situations you are living, you are in control of your life andabove those persons who try to keep you under their grip."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is an american masterpeice. It really can not be characterized under any descriptions a mind can muster. It is a true masterpiece that deserves a read even if you are the most fanatical advocate of war. it is long, but when its over you will be wishing for 450 more pages to spend with yossarian and the rest of the group"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"A fantastic novel that I read long ago, actually better now that I am a little older. Recounting the misadventures of a flight squadron and its hero/fool Yossarian. Heller makes it clear that everything has a catch, in this tale of damned if you do, damned if you don't. Each character is in a situation that is result of counteracting forces rather than free will. Hard to put down and sad when it finally ends. I highly recommend Catch 22."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is one of my top 5 or 6 novels of the twentieth century. It has everything that makes it eternally relevant - the jokes, the characters, the situation - it could be anywhere, any time, any war. This book cannot date, and it will be read in a hundred years time and still be funny. But it isn't just a humorous book. The war scenes are very real and very powerful, and there is a lingering sense of death and horror in many passages. This is what makes it so good - it is a 3D portrait of the modern world. Our hopes and our flaws are captured forever."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read this book twice this year, upon purchase from my college book store. It has become my favorite book since, and my &quot;guide&quot; and companion. I have read critical essays on this book, and have had time to contemplate it. Yes, I agree that the book is &quot;anti-war&quot; and at times, &quot;incoherent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;However, it wasn't so much &quot;anti-war&quot; as it was anti-establishment.(Many of the readers will recall the unforgettable villains such as--many of them, caricatures representing the inherent flaws of the war establishment-- Milo Minderbinder, Generals Peckem and Scheisskopf, Lt. Col Korn, Col. Cathcart, Capt. Black , ex-PFC Wintergreen, Cpl Whitcomb.) And if it had been &quot;incoherent&quot; and &quot;disorganized,&quot; it was because the author had deliberately planned the story to capture the absurdity and irrational logic of the establishment. In the midst of the corrupt and at times, inept corporate/military machine is our hero, Yossarian, and his squadronmates who are pitted in a struggle against the horror of war, and their own self-serving superiors and bureaucrats and an entrepreneur whose only collective interest is to enlarge their fold at the expense of human lives.&lt;/p&gt;Unlike many other books that have clumsily tried to emulate its inimitable style since its publication,--Winston Groom's FORREST GUMP comes to my mind--CATCH-22 balances exceptional hillarity with a biting warning against the absurd totalian logic of the system we often take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;Moreover, it gives us hope through Yossarian's--and perhaps, Orr's--final triumph against the Milo-Cathcart-Korn-Wintergreen Axis when they tried to subvert him in his weakest moment. Where George Orwell depressed his readers with the capitulation of Winston Smith to Big Brother/O'Brien in his 1984, Heller's main message in the book --that one can triumph against the establishment if he has the courage--offered me hopes.&lt;/p&gt;That is why it will always remain my favorite book. I cannot praise this companion/guide enough. (Novelist and former Secretary of the Navy, James Webb called this book his &quot;soulmate&quot; on the battlefields of Vietnam.) But I will say this. That if there been a rating scale of 10 stars, then I will give it 10 stars+.&lt;/p&gt;"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I disagree with the reviewer who said that readers should try not to be offended given the current global situation; this book is more relevant now than ever, for the war of today is even more disjointed and Catch-22ish than World War II ever was. This novel is simply brilliant, and despite its bleakness it does end on a hopeful note and is hilarious throughout with its cruel and unrelented exposures of the insanity of the military, such as the colonel who arbitrarily raises the missions to get his picture in the Saturday Evening Post and the chaplain's interrogation (in which he is found guilty of all the crimes he would ever commit; of course he is guilty, they are HIS infractions!). Through it all, Yossarian, the only sane character in the madness, tries to get himself grounded but finds himself repeatedly blocked by Catch-22, and tries in vain to convince others around him that he is crazy while at the same time they are all crazy around him. The novel reads like a dream, completely out of sequence and often making no sense, but in the world of Catch-22 everything you know is wrong, and afterwards you begin to question everything you know. The final paragraph, even though it's only three sentences, is a gleeful twist on itself and is the perfect ending to a perfect novel."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is awesome. Heller took the generally depressing and played out theme of war and came up with a hilarious piece of literature that shows both the humor and the horror of war. Characters like Yossarian, Milo, and Colonel Cathcart make you laugh out loud while characters such as Snowden amd once again Yossarian make you feel the pain and pressure of living life day to day not knowing if you'll see the next. The stress of being constantly in danger has driven the whole squadron of bombers insane but their antics make for a humorous storyline. Heller manipulates the device of absurdity to mold the story into a hilarious chain of events as Yossarian does everything in his power and some things that aren't within his power to avoid flying even one more mission. The characters are well developed (a new one in each chapter) and each one seems to have his own absurd, definitive quality that makes him decidedly Helleresque. If you want a well written novel that will make you laugh out loud, Catch-22 is your best bet."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I would first like to inform other reviewers that I am a high school junior, read this as part of a choice novel project, and had no trouble grasping the ideas that Joseph Heller presented within his Catch-22.The sarcastic attitude of this novel is conspicuous, and all bonds with reality are dropped with the first character introductions. The humor that has previously been criticized I found to be easy to understand, not monotonous, and a unique aspect to illustrate WW2. This is not to say the humor is for all, because Heller uses many paradoxes (look up definition of \\"catch-22\\"), simple one line contradictions, and subtle word choices to draw a laugh-all which represent the personality of the novel.Yes, there are many characters, probably over fifty, yet grasping the names is not important at all times. Of course you quickly get associated with Yossarian and the other main characters, and chapters do reintroduce people from the early parts of the book. This may be annoying, yet each character is distinct, and there is little chance of confusing Milo, and entrepeneur, with Havermeyer, the elite pilot. In truth, the novel lacks a linear time, but chooses, rather, to define the novel through numerous character sketches, focusing them loosely around Yossarian. By the later chapters of the novel, Heller subtly introduces the gruesome truths of the war, balancing the early humor with more realistic look. It is through this transition that the weight of the situation is elucidated, and by contrasting the final chapters with the first, Heller is able to attract our attention and force us to analyze the war.What is the novel about? There is no simple answer, yet if I attempt to state it in a single sentence Catch-22's theme, it would be \\"The only true fault of America's once the war began, was that we as a nation began to glorify war, without truly understanding the implications of our actions.\\"What is the idea behind catch-22 as a statement? Read the book. Enjoy. Open your eyes with laughter and tears. Perhaps you won't like the satirical tone, but I would suggest to all that you try."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It's difficult to write anything meaningfully different about Catch-22 that hasn't already been written. Rather than attempt that, I'll offer my personal experience with this book. I first read it as a teenager, in the mid-1970s. I'd read MASH (Hooker) before reading Catch-22 and was much more impressed with that book (and television series) than I was with Heller's work. Catch-22, I thought, was a part of the same genre: smart-ass anti-war books. It was funny, but bogged down in places and at times simply bored me - the whole bit with Milo Minderbinder, for example. And Major Major was a one-note gag that I quickly dismissed. To be honest, the part of the book that stuck with me throughout the years was Yossarian's having written, \\"I yearn for you tragically. A.T. Tappman, Chaplain, U.S. Army,\\" and the first two lines of the book.Fast forward to now - 2002: I'm in my early forties and, it is to be hoped, somewhat wiser and more experienced. For no good reason I've decided to re-read the book (I happened upon it in the back of a closet while looking for another book). A few pages in, I couldn't believe how differently I saw the book, the characters and how differently I interpreted Heller's message. After completing the book, I'd discovered that Heller hadn't written an anti-war book, or an anti-Army or anti-government book -- he's written an anti-institution book! The experiences he recorded occur daily in numerous corporations, government bureaucracies, school systems, society -- any setting in which an individual is faced with his anonymity and utter replace-ability in an institution. Major Major, far from being a one-gag joke, is the perfect archetype for the well-meaning mid-level functionary who finds himself powerless to affect change and simply chooses to operate \\"below the radar,\\" as they say, biding his time and trying to avoid being noticed until he's retired. Milo Minderbinders really do get ahead, and Lieutenant Scheisskopfs really get promoted to the top through no effort of their own!Yossarian was the main character of the book, but the true hero was Orr, who'd figured everything out and used the system to break free. He left tracks for Yossarian to follow, and, we can hope, Yossarian made it past Nately's whore to freedom as well. And, after all these years, I can understand the first two lines of the book.A few random musings: One - Having just seen the series finale to The X-Files, I'm struck by the correctness of fit between the two universes. Two - I bought a paperback edition of this book (Dell) in 1979. It is the same book I just finished re-reading, yellowed and somewhat aged, but otherwise in good condition. Quite a contrast to the novel (Time-Warner) I picked up last month that literally falls apart page by page as I read it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I'm almost at a loss to describe just how great this book is, but I'll give it a go anyway. Suffice it to say Mr. Heller's tale of war, courage, and madness is as relevant today as it was on its first printing. It's a book that will make you laugh, make you think, and make your heart ache all at the same time.This is the story of Yossarian, an American bombardier stationed on Pianosa under the command of the vain Colonel Cathcart. No matter how many missions Yossarian and his comrades fly, the colonel demands more of them, gradually raising the number from twenty-five all the way up to eighty. Yossarian becomes increasingly desperate to escape the certain death he knows is waiting for him, especially as his friends are seemingly knocked off one-by-one not just by German gunners but sometimes by friendly fire or outright bizarre circumstances--like being smothered by a cat. Surrounded by pompous, preening, madmen like Cathcart, Yossarian turns out to be the only sane person on the base because he still has at least a shred of conscience.The satiric wit employed to paint the Army Air Force as bumbling stooges might have seemed ridiculous until a few years ago. Now with Gulf War II and soldiers being sent on four, five, or more tours of duty it doesn't seem quite so far-fetched that a Colonel Cathcart or General Peckem could really exist.As good as this book is it can be a challenge keeping all the characters straight and all the events in proper order. And like a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" skit this goes on a little longer than it should until the bit starts to lose some of its impact. The end is tremendous as Yossarian does the only thing he can do in the face of overwhelming stupidity and madness.If you're a fan of M*A*S*H the movie or TV show then this book is right up your alley with its wisecracking antiheroes and bumbling commanders. Really to me \\"Catch-22\\" seems like the precursor to that movie/series only on a grander scale.And hey this is one of the only books to add a new word to the dictionary, so that's neat too. Go ahead and give this a read; you won't be disappointed.That is all."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a brilliant story of logic and sense. Chronicling bombardier pilot John Yossarian's years in World War Two Italy, on the fictional island of Pianosa, the story brutally satirizes war, politics, and a myriad of human flaws. Heller blends a deep and complex narrative with sharp, intelligent humor to create a classic as thoroughly enjoyable as it is intellectually rewarding. Catch-22 is a must-read, one of the very finest pieces of twentieth century American literature.The story begins with Yossarian lying in a hospital bed, feigning liver disease in order to avoid flying on potentially deadly bombing raids. He is charged there with censoring the letters sent between soldiers and their loved ones at home and amuses himself by altering the letters in creative ways, often completely changing their meanings. Already the army bureaucracy is criticized, both for its questionable intentions in having the letters censored at all, and for allowing Yossarian to ruin them. Soon a new patient check into Yossarian's ward, a Texan. He \\"turned out to be good-natured, generous, and likeable. In three days nobody could stand him.\\" The patients' reaction to their amiable fellow sets the stage for a story full of such paradoxes and ironies. At the heart of the confusion in this instance is the Texan's extreme patriotism. The veteran soldiers in the room have become disillusioned with concepts like patriotism and honor and are repulsed by the Texan's reflection of their former naivet&eacute;. As each soldier miraculously recovers and returns to duty, we laugh at the absurdity of their overreaction, but we also wonder at the idea of being so repulsed by an ostensibly good quality like patriotism.The entire episode in the hospital, during which many important characters are introduced and recurring plot elements are brought into the narrative, is over in a few pages. Heller's writing is dense, but reads quickly and smoothly, so much so that readers who revisit a chapter, particularly after finishing the book, will find much more there than the first reading uncovered. In fact, Catch-22 practically mandates re-reading, as the story is often told out-of-order, from frequently changing viewpoints, and with crucial information revealed only after it is needed. Though Yossarian is the book's central character, each chapter brings a new soldier, officer, or civilian into the spotlight, exploring events from his or her perspective as contrasted with Yossarian's relatively sane view.The first character to receive this treatment is Clevinger. Unlike most of the book's military characters, Clevinger is intelligent, well educated, and highly principled. His unfailing optimism is frequently contrasted with Yossarian's outright pessimism. Almost immediately after his introduction, Clevinger has tries to change Yossarian's dark outlook.\\"They're trying to kill me,\\" Yossarian told him calmly.\\"No one's trying to kill you,\\" Clevinger cried.\\"Then why are they shooting at me?\\" Yossarian asked.\\"They're shooting at everyone,\\" Clevinger answered. \\"They're trying to kill everyone.\\"\\"And what difference does that make?\\"Both men make perfectly rational arguments, and both truly believe their words, and yet they couldn't agree more. Unfortunately for Clevinger, fate seems to prove Yossarian right. Not long after their exchange, Clevinger is put on trial in military court, apparently for no other crime than being \\"smart,\\" (and therefore a threat). The trial is perfectly absurd, and hilarious. A bellicose colonel demands to know the exact time at which Clevinger didn't deny his guilt, but refuses to tell him with what crime he is being charged. After much confused suttering, Clevinger exasperatedly admits \\"I always didn't say you couldn't find me guilty!\\" The colonel, finally appeased, says \\"That's much better, Mr Clevinger.\\"The trial is side-splitting, but its implied accusations are frightening. The blatant injustice in the military court goes entirely unquestioned by all but the accused. Not a soul questions the court's completely invalid logic or its motivations in attacking one of the most sincerely good men in the camp without cause. Yossarian's belief that the world conspires against the sane seems entirely justified as Clevinger searches desperately for some truth to hold onto, still unwilling to believe that Yossarian's worst fears might have been realized.Yossarian begins to devote himself entirely to escaping the war when his squadron's commander, Colonel Cathcart, develops a habit of lengthening his men's tours of duty whenever one nears completion. By raising the number of missions required of each man, he hopes to develop the best squad in the army and get promoted to general, but his absurd rule effectively pronounces a death sentence upon his men. Yossarian in particular is horrified, but struggles to find any way around Cathcart in the military's virtual dictatorship of insane and incompetent men.As the story progresses, Catch-22 darkens as Heller focuses on the facts of war and death. Everything Yossarian sees in Pianosa convinces him further that his own countrymen are out to kill him. The war becomes less and less of a reality as the men of the base gain a sense of the war's futility and the inevitability of their deaths. While Heller's sharp wit remains about him, it focuses more on true insanity than the quirks and character flaws that originally defined his characters. Each man on the island has his own battle with death and must decide what he believes, yet none of them can change the realities of their situation.As death looms over the island, each man reacts differently, but always in extreme and exaggerated ways. Many go into denial about their fates; others go mad trying to escape their combat duties. Yossarian grows distrustful of everybody and tries one desperate escape after another, obsessed with saving himself. Each character's fate has far reaching implications and serves to advance Heller's anti-war and anti bureaucracy crusade, but it is the result of Yossarian's quest for sanity that writes the final words on war, death, and sanity itself."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It's a really scary thing to be sane in a world that is insane. That's pretty much Yossarian's problem. He knows that the war going on around him and the people controlling things are crazy. Life, for Yossarian, is one enormous Catch-22; it often seems to be run by forces either hostile or totally indifferent to the human condition. All humanity can come up with is a sort of economic/power hierarchy through which they try to remain blind to the state of life. Capitalism has run amok, as have bureaucracies. Yossarian is alientated and trapped in near-despair and trying to figure out how a sane man is to live in a world that is against him?Catch-22 is one of the truly great novels of the twentieth century because it is so honest and so penetrating. It's not just a war novel; Catch-22 is a novel that really encompasses the current human dilemma. Yossarian is really an Everyman character trying to live in the postmodern age. His choice is seemingly whether he should choose to die as a victim of the crazy world or choose a living death by buying into the insanity. That's why this novel is so affecting and why Yossarian resonates with so many people. He's in the same situation. He faces the same choices in this life. Ultimately, Catch-22 is a towering novel for its hope as Yossarian finally finds the courage to live.I can't really say enough good about Catch-22. It's is funny and touching and so human. It's really a novel that shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I was made to read this book as a class assignment way back when and for once I was grateful!Very humorous and deep with an odd kind of spiraling writing style. The &quot;anti-war or not&quot; discussion is always hot on this satire classic and it's my bet the author would be proud of it.To me the war itself was the central Catch-22;the war that no one wishes to fight MUST be fought.Men who do not wish to kill MUST or be killed by other men with no wish to kill them...etc.I don't think it's anti-war necessarily;just against the pure acceptance of the idea without regret.The Armed Forces,war movies,Tom Clancy books,etc. never seem to acknowledge that in every heroic soldier there is probably a little Yossarian wondering how this all happened and why he must be a part of it(I thought Yosarrian found the other characters insane because he was the only one who questioned why they was there).I think it is the genius(and bravery)of writers like Joseph Heller and Kurt Vonnegut to HIGHLIGHT this and keep wars (and war movies...) from becoming like Lieutenant Scieisskopf's parades: all looks and no truth.One of my favorites.Now tell me why I'm wrong!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is quite simply one of the best books I have ever written. Each character is as normal as he is insane. While the way the book is written might take a while to get used to after about 50 pages any reader will be captivated. The story while a satire really makes you think about the whole idea of war in general as being honorable yet insane at the same time. For while it seems honorable on the surface to fight for what is right everyone's life is at least somewhat driven by self motivation and survival. After reading &quot;Catch 22&quot; you will view the world and everyone around you differently.

The novel through juxtaposition conveys the madness of war and illuminates yossarians battle about who is the enemy, the people shooting at his plane or the people who keep sending him out into the face of danger. Heller has captured not only one mans reaction to a war but a whole host of characters and how they individually deal with a war situation. the book also covers topics of propoganda, neo-liberal reforms, madness and sexual starvation and its effects. this is a book i would recommend to anyone who has a taste for confusing humour."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Sorry. I didn't like it. I tried to read it for school and found it incredibly hard to get through. The writing is bad and the jokes are not that funny.

Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I found the book, like a majority of the characters in Catch-22, crazy. Basically, after 80 pages, the story was still stagnating. There were plenty of quirky, rebellious characters but all the absurdity just didn't come together for me. Yeah, there was Yossarian who was paranoid about getting killed, Hungry Joe who yelled in his sleep, Aadvark the navigator who couldn't navigate... So?I kept asking myself, what the hell were all of them doing? Where was the story going? Nowhere. The characters were simply busy being eccentric amidst the madness of war. Which perhaps was what Heller was trying to portray. Afterall, it was only 10 years after WWII when the book was first published and I guess it connected with a lot of readers then. The message behind the book is still relevant, no doubt - but apart from the anti-war and anti-establishment theme, I felt Heller didn't have much else to offer. Mildly humorous at times, but sadly, the storyline just didn't progress with enough purpose for my taste."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Having read the paper version of Catch-22 several times, it's one of my favorite books... I was surprised how few scanning errors there were when compared with some of the other masterpiece books I've ordered for my Kindle. Especially the older, out of copyright classics, where I found many errors. I am very happy with my e-book version of Catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Heller's masterpiece is one of those few books that can be appreciated even by people who haven't experienced war at all. As a 23 yr old reader, I obviously haven't been involved with WWII. However, this irreverent look at the absurd nature of all bureaucracies still affected me powerfully.Written like stand-up comedy, this continuous punchline takes the reader on a trip through the hell's of war as seen by Yossarian, a bombadier who thinks, rightly, that everyone is out to kill him. Yossarian's paranoia is truly bizarre yet seems to make perfect sense in a world changed by the presence of war.This masterpiece of modern literature holds as its core theme that war alters everything and everyone, and that people in such a situation become themselves paradoxes. The doctor who is obsessed with his own health, the chaplain who loses his faith (in an &quot;English-speaking, Anglo-Saxon, pro-American God...&quot; - one of the funniest passages I've read in any book), the tortured pilot who can't sleep unless he knows for sure that he won't be sent home and must fly more missions; all make this war satire one of the best two or three books I've ever read. Yes, it's everything it's cracked up to be, and you will be too."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Try Catch-22: it definitely stands out as one of the more interesting books I've read! This mockery of war and all things associated with it never ceases to amaze me. Always dead-pan hilarious and exciting, Catch-22 is a rollercoaster -- no, a backwards rollercoaster! You never know when the next exciting turn will come, or where it will lead. It's laugh-out-loud funny, no exagerration, something rare, though much sought after. I can tell you that I've personally cracked up out loud many times in the middle of reading, something which scared my friends a little, who were sitting with me while we read &lt;grin&gt; The humor is sometimes blatantly reckless, sometimes hidden and subtle, but always well-thought out -- or perhaps not thought out at all! The wild onslought of characters and events is mind-boggling, yet fun. The events are occasionally a tad risque, but anyone who is mature enough to handle it shouldn't be swayed by it. Overall, a fabulously unique novel!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is the best book ever written. Period. It is hilarious, witty, and terrifying.

Yes, there are a lot of characters and yes, the book plays with time, but be patient, stick with it and you will be rewarded. Also, the Everyman's edition is beautiful!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Recently, I decided to abandon my Crichton, Clancy, and Rice books to begin more \\"serious\\" reading. &quot;Catch-22&quot; was my first foray into the heavy artillery. What a refreshing change! Although it took a few chapters to really get a feel for the rhythm of the book, I was instantly hooked. The atmosphere, the dialogue, the humor...head and shoulders above anything else I've read.It all revolves around Yossarian, a character that wasn't very likeable for a good chunk of the novel. As the story unfolded, he evolved from a coward, to a pitiable product of a dysfunctional environment, to a beacon of strength and sanity in an insane world.Heller's dry, satirical style was perfect for delivering this great story full of quirky, all-too-real characters."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I wrote to Mr. Heller a few months ago, telling him he was a major influence in getting me interested in reading and not juvenile crime. He wrote a small note thanking me. This book blooms with compassion, humanity and infectious wit. He will be missed."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The premise of \\"Catch 22\\" is about characters, particularly soldiers, getting stuck in situations where no matter their decision, they're screwed. Some reviewers have said that the point is made within the first 100 pages and so why another 400 pages. However, for me it didn't get old. Yossarian's zaniness and Heller's swift style make it like one punchline after the next, and who ever wants a funny book to end? Although there's strong socio-political undertones, one shouldn't read this book as anti-war, or expect any preachiness, because again, the hilarity sticks out first and foremost. Is it comparable with Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\"? Only insofar as it's a dark comedy about wartime, and both authors served in war (so they have credibility). Either way, Heller provides brilliant situational comedy."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"\\"Catch-22,\\" by Joseph Heller, follows the activities of a World War II aviation squadron in the European theater. Much of the novel revolves around Captain Yossarian, a bombardier in the squadron. Heller has crafted an outrageous satire of the military. He mercilessly mocks many aspects of the military: rank structure, chain of command, protocol, the military justice system, the chaplaincy, the military medical establishment, and more. Heller's squadron and its higher headquarters form a world of cowardice, opportunism, and scheming; particularly biting is his portrait of jealousy, vanity, and self-serving ambition among the senior officers.The book is filled with many absurd images and zany situations, as well as with characters who have such names as Major Major, Colonel Korn, and Lieutenant Scheisskopf. Heller's prose is a delight; the pages crackle and pop with clever wordplay and witty lines. The book made me laugh out loud. But the wacky comedy and merry prose style are wedded to a dark vision; the book is full of graphic violence and Kafkaesque nightmarishness. There are also some vividly rendered scenes of aerial combat. It's quite a remarkable blend.The story follows Yossarian and his comrades in combat, while being treated in the hospital, during down time on their base, and on their recreational excursions into war-torn Italy. We see the relationships among the squadron members, as well as their dalliances with the women they meet during their tour. And we also learn the meaning of Catch-22, a bureacratic clause that controls the destinies of these military men. Yossarian is a compelling antihero, and \\"Catch-22\\" is a richly ironic work of satire. The book has endured for decades, and is, in my judgment, more relevant than ever in the \\"global war on terror\\" era.."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It is hard to know what to think after you read a book like Heller's Catch 22. This is Heller's comical \\"masterpiece\\" in the eyes of many. It is definitely comical, but a masterpiece? That was a tough sell for me.The story shifts time, plot, and characters in manner that is confusing. It works well in this novel because the entire book is an ode absurdity. The total and complete absurdity of war. One can probe deeper into the real depth of the story underlining the humor, but ever Heller himself commented that it was little more than a dark, comic act on the stupidity of war. He did not even intend it to be a thundering social statement, but rather a refreshing look at the irony that exists in all wars.The main character of the novel is Yossarian. He is kind of the books anti-hero, if you will. Certainly he is the most famous. The book is filled with ridiculous and memorable characters and they are all interconnected by Heller in a rather ingenious fashion. No concrete plot exists, it is rather a map a random events that occur in the lives of these madmen during World War II. There ranges everything from a quiet, gentle priest, to a psychotic whore, to rich, indignant soldiers, to ordinary a Major; to ruthless a General's and so on. It would take too long to go into depth about every character. Rest assured, they are drawn out with style and individuality by Heller in some of the wackiest scenes you will ever read in a novel.Catch 22 is told in third person, but the majority of the focus is on Yossarian. Yossarian has his fair share of flaws and mishaps, but he tends to be the one we sympathize and root for more than any other person. Yet it is hard to root for, or care about anyone too deeply because it seems like you are always laughing. You laugh even when you should be horrified, because some of the scenes are indeed horrifying, but they are downplayed so much by Heller that our reaction becomes tampered with. Instead of a feeling of power, we are left with a feeling of confusion.The only novel I can compare it to is Vonnegut's darker, wiser Slaughterhouse 5. In that novel, the author was able to maintain a delicate balance between sarcasm, humor, and pain. It was easy to see the author was hiding the pain of his experiences in the war through the dark, sarcastic humor. That made it powerful and breathtaking, along with the humor. In Catch 22, the sarcasm and humor exist; in fact, it is actually a funnier book. However, the power and the pain do not shine through and the book seems like an attempt to downplay the seriousness of war. It left me confused at times with its dark, disturbing passages that should be powerful, but are not, because the book, for the most part, is usually told in a style of a comedic satire.Catch 22 is a funny and original tale of World War II. At times, the passages reach a level of total genius with witty and cutting remarks. At times, it even makes you laugh and think deeply on how ridiculous war really is. I admired the numerous weirdo characters Heller described. I just didn't feel any real power or awe to it all. It was like watching a dark comedy unfolding in front of your eyes. You laugh, but when it is all over it is quickly forgotten.Perhaps that was the flaw for me in Catch 22. I wish I could have taken it a little more seriously. I think Heller goes a bit too extreme with his silliness and comedy, because when the \\"powerful\\" scenes of horror and anguish did finally come, I found myself not really caring too much, but I felt that I should have been moved in some way. It was an awkward mix for me. Not to say that I don't recommend Catch 22. Many passages are genius and I love the originality. It is definitely, for the majority of the time, a hilarious read. There is just that one catch, and who knows, maybe the confusion I felt was just another intended Catch 22, among many others in the novel.Grade: B+"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"As my friends and I entered our AP English class one morning, our teacher handed out a blank page to each of us and asked us each to define \\"war.\\" Little did I know how much that definition, along with my entire view of life , would be changed as soon as I cracked the binding of the novel that we were to start: Catch-22.Heller's timeless novel, though written in the aftermath of World War II (the author, like the novel's protagonist Yossarian, was a bombardier who witnessed the destruction and chaos that war always brings), is so much more than a standard war novel; it has come to define society's outlook on all things modern, including patriotism, humor, individuality, pain and the truly heroic. It tells the beautifully unstructured-structured tale of a young man, Yossarian, grappling with the illogic of morality and self-preservation. The novel is anti-etsblishment in that it asks readers to always consider their actions before giving their blind allegiance (Milo's syndicate, the glorious loyalty oath crusade) to that which is spoon-fed to them. Stark, shocking and profound in its portrayal of its society of men (and, in perhaps its only, exceedingly minor, flaw, only men), Catch-22 draws readers in, keeps them hanging on every word, and never forgets to evoke emotion, moving from humor to pity and fear, realizing the tragedy of life and death.While many have criticized the novel for its non-linear approach, Heller's structure, syntax (including some of the most amazing sentences I think I've ever read) and language prove the man to be a master. The novel loops back upon itself, returning to heartrending scenes, subtly revealing more each time in its use of diction. Snowden's death is the clearest example of such treatment in the work, only fully complete as the book reaches its truly thrilling conclusion (I'm definitely not going to spoil any of the ending by telling you more--just read it!). Catch-22 is a novel that you can't put down, no matter how you try; characters and storylines all fall into place as you move from the novel's confusion to its own type of enlightenment (particularly in these troubling times)--stick with it, enjoy, learn and take a break from the novel (for I don't think one ever truly \\"leaves\\" it) a better person...you'll thank yourself for it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch22 is the phrase used to describe the ironic paradoxical injustices that all humans must face. This is one of those books that hold a faint prestige for the reader, like upon finishing it, they enter a secret club, the catch22 club! You start to see Clevingers and Milos and Major Major Major's (who happens to be my favourite character!) everywhere.I know some people who think that this book makes the world and humanity ugly, but I think that's just cos the book has opened their eyes to the ironic injustices of the world for the first time. I think it makes the world beautiful, because all the characters, even the slimiest of them, are struggling so hard for what they want against all those ironic injustices, Captain Black to prove Major Major is a communist, Yossarian to get out of the army, Milo to make as much money as possible. And the basic innocence that all these characters have is the only reason why they can do the terrible things they do. Milo getting paid by the germans to bomb his own camp, CHief White Halfoat threatening Flume's life for a joke but causing Flume to live in eternal fear, every man who killed another in WW2, every man who ran the other way in fear for his life. It's a homage to humanity's innocence. The whole book says to me, \\"Look at all the horror and terror we are capable of, yet look at our frailty and stupidity, and beneath it all, a tenacity to keep going.\\" This book doesn't make light of war, it vindicates humanity of war.Anyway of course there are many other aspects to the book, its one of those books that can mean many things to the reader.Also an interesting thing to add, apparently \\"MASH\\" was based on this book. Although MASH is not nearly as dark, it still has many of the bsic themes and foible-filled characters."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It's just one of those books you don't want to put down. I'm real picky when it comes to books catching my interest, but this book made me laugh so hard on so many different occasions that it seemed like an episode of Seinfeld. I've never ever laughed out loud at a book until this one. I highly recommend this and can't wait to read the sequel Closing Time."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is a book about a great American bomb squadron during World War II. The book is about what it is like to be an American pilot in another country during the war. Yossarian, who is the main character of the book, is basically a very crazy person just because of all the experiences he has had with war. He has seen so many of his friend die that he does not want to fly on any other missions because he thinks that he will die. He is very nervous as to what will happen in the future, so he basically goes into the hospital so he does not have to go on any other missions. One of the main problems is that the number of required missions keeps getting raised, which means for him that he will be stuck there until he gets them done, but he does not want to go on another mission and refuses.During the book, Yossarian comes up with many plans to help him get out of the war and to get back home. All of the plans that he makes up, always get destroyed because of catch 22. Catch 22 is a kind of statement or rule that the men in the war have come up with for certain circumstances they are put under. Every time he tries to get out of the war, there is always someone or something that is stopping him, and that is the catch. Eventually toward the end of the book, some of the higher ranked men ask him to fly the less dangerous missions, and they will have other men fly the dangerous ones in his place. He still disagrees with this because he does not want the men to be put in a spot where they see the same that he has seen. This is Yossarians main problem in the book. He wants to save all of the men in the war from dying or from seeing the horrible sights of the war that he has seen. This would mean that in order for Yossarian to save the men is for him to fly the dangerous missions. Every time he flies the missions, he is getting more insane because he is putting himself in the places that the other men would die in. This for him is self sacrifice, and that is what is making him so insane throughout the book.During the book, Joseph Heller, the author, does a great job in explaining the circumstances and events that happen in war. He does a very great job in describing all of the characters and how they all feel. He also relates all of the feelings of the characters, to the real life feelings that people would have while in war. The main theme of the story is that Yossarian has to sacrifice himself in order to save the other men in the war. This is the problem, because it makes him more insane throughout the book, but in order for him to save the men, he is forced to choose one of the two things that are put in front of him, and that is the catch. Throughout the book overall, Yossarian has himself caught between two things that are both bad for him. So overall, the theme of this book gives a good idea as to what can happen to a man that is put in the horrible consequences of war. I think that the overall book is very well written, because the author can make the reader feel sad about the war one minute, and happy about it the next, and that is what is so great about the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Craig LeamanCatch-22Catch-22 shows many things that relate to isolation because the people I the book are always arguing with each other and never give anyone on the same squadron the right support they need. But the funny thing is they get by because they know that they are going to have to live with each other for a while, which leads to a state of depression in the squadron.But the only thing that Yossarian wants to do is get out of the military and go home. Yossarian gets very angry with people because he doesn't want anyone bugging him because he is a man that likes to be alone and stay in his own world which is shown by isolation. A sign of isolation shown on this book is when Yossarian always has some sort of problem with himself. This is shown by isolation because he is a man that is very lonely and wants to get out the military. Catch-22 makes Yossarian feel very depressed because the military always bumps up the missions needed to leave the base. So Yossarian always goes off on his own because he knows that he will be there for a while.Another sign of isolationism is when all the people in the book become incoherent because they are unsure of what to do to make themselves get along with one another. This is isolationism because they take it out on other people while making themselves feel bad about how they are going to live the rest of their lives and at the same time taking their problems out on other people.I believe this book should be read because it offers a lot of action and humor. The men in the squadron are always fighting with each other but somehow they always seem to pull it off and get along in the end. It also offers a lot of drama because when Yossarian's roommate dies many people are effected by it and don't know how to deal with it. But at time the book can be boring because it rambles on about describing when Clevenger says how Yossarain is crazy. It goes on for about a page and a half. That is the only boring part of the book. All round I thought it was a book that offered a lot of information on what war life was like at that time."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"\\"My military experience was beneficial and enjoyable, almost entirely. Even those last missions when I was scared stiff became a rich experience because they were suspense. It was not boring.\\"(Joseph Heller) Heller's experience is part of what enriched Catch-22's exceptional portrayal of World War II and Yossarian. Catch-22 was meant as a classic from the time it was published. Describing the corruption of society through the main character's, Yossarian's, experience in World War II. The in-depth analysis of peoples' view of gain for only themselves made Catch-22 destined for success from the very beginning.The story is that of a bomber pilot, Yossarian, who endures the hardships of fighting the war. He must deal with the superior offices constantly raising the required number of missions each man must fly to be sent home whenever he is close to release. He must also live with the men in his squadron dying left and right which is his greatest let-down.But, finally he has a chance to escape. After flying 71 missions and seeing all his friends die in combat he refuses to fly. This invokes a deal from his commanding officers since he is causing such a problem among the rest of the men fighting. All he must do is like his commanding officers and he can be sent home a hero. Yossarian agrees to this but deep down he disapproves. As he walks off though he is stabbed and is brought to the hospital where he discovers his only surviving friend is in Sweden. He then sets his mind to leave his troubles and find his friend, Orr, in Sweden.Catch-22 is a terrific work for how it unmasks the corruption of society. Constantly, Yossarian notices the people around him seeking their own personal gain. Colonel Cathcart, raises the number of missions, endangering and enraging his own men, just to make his squadron look good. Milo, the mess hall officer, is always making deals on the black market and even goes to the length of bombing his own men to make some money. At the conclusion of the book, when Major Danby cried, \\"Jump!'&#65533; Yossarian jumped. Nately's whore was hiding just outside the door. The knife came down, missing him by inches, and he took off.\\"(463) When Yossarian jumped he obeyed his instincts which showed a change in his attitude toward the world in the rest of the book.This book is excellent for the revealing of peoples' intentions. The numerous encounters with corruption Yossarian experienced made this reviewer think how many of those similar situations exist today. After reading Catch-22 it is a wonder how this society does not fall apart though the vivid explanations the book puts out for the readers. Now, however, this reader has gained a greater appreciation for analyzing the situations he comes across."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I'm hesitant to call this book an anti-war novel. I think that's too simple of a generalization for a novel that deserves a much more in-depth look. For me, Catch-22 in about the human condition which leads us to experience fear, selfishness, anger, anguish, loneliness, pain, and every other imaginable emotion. I think the greatest thing about this novel is that Heller, in about 90% of the novel, seems unconcerned with passing judgement and instead chooses to give us the raw reality of these characters and lets the rest be decided by the reader.Heller creates a chaotic athmosphere filled by exotic characters that are never censored. The narrative is consistently odd but it never seems to stray too far from its purpose, or plot. The first three quarters of the book are hillarious, followed by a somber, pensative tone completely brutal and unforgiving. You don't realize how quickly it goes from a satirical, cynical place to a completely harsh reality. The transition is amazing and the result a complete shock to the reader.This is a wonderful piece of literature. Heller lets his characters speak for themselves and he lets their actions create the moral statements of the novel. That in itself is a huge accomplishment.This is a great book regarldess of your view on war."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is a great peice of literature. Filled with wit, humor, and sadness it makes reading about such a terrible thing like war enjoyable. Reading about Yossarian and company's journey trough World War II was slow at some points, but I am glad that I forced myself through these moments and read on. It picks up twards the end and makes for a great read. I was forced to read a novel for a high school project, but I am glad that I picked up this book, it does not only tell about the war, but it takes you through a great story at the same time. It shows the courage of Yossarian and others as they fly in and out of dangerous mission day in and day out. Anyone who liks books about war is sure to love this novel, it truly is a great book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is one of America's greatest works of literiture. It is a funny, powerful, sad, and ironic portrayal of war. I'v never read anything quite like it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a very interesting story about a bombardier named Yossarian stationed in Italy during WWII...The whole world seems crazy in this novel and there are plenty of crazy characters that inhabit it. It might sound weird to say, but there really isn't a plot in this story. It's just a bunch of funny and sometimes sad events told in a nonchronological order. This would make the story confusing, but since there isn't really a plot it doesn't really matter. Reading this novel one can tell there are many layers and meanings, but it's not neccessary to delve too deeply into these meanings as the book can be read just for it's hilarity. I found some parts to be laugh-out-loud funny. This book is somewhat hard to describe and one can really only appreciate it if they read it. It's worth reading and I personally got through it very quickly..."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I got to read this book only a few years ago, and suddenly everyone around me looked as if Im an alien. Catch-22 is really wonderful satire about war. The hilarity is wonderfully woven around the unavoidable tragedy during the war era and Heller beautifully alternates between the two.In a sense it is like Voltaire's Candide where the central character oscillates between optimism and pessimism, only here Yossarian (and others) oscillates between the comic and tragic. While Voltaire's is really a serious satire about the evils that humans perpetuate on one another, that was completed in 3 days, Heller's is more funny yet focused on war, probably starting a new genre - war comics (beetle bailey, mash etc). Its ironic that the movie Catch 22 could not bring out the nuances of the war time that Heller has depicted in the book. He probably also created a style of repeating same thing in different words to make it look funny.Anyway this is great novel not only to be read but also realise the evils of war. Yossarian will surely be an unforgettable character whoever read this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Although as i was reading it, i was thinking \\"WTF\\", nothing makes sense, whats the point, whats going on... but i didn't quit and read it to the last... and i am glad i did so, at the end everything becomes clear and you start connecting all the things that went on and voila its a masterpiece, one of my most favorite books that i am definitely going to read again."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is a good book. However, if you order it paperback, it does not come as pictured. It is a red background with a blue man instead. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"As a member of the \\"Viet Nam\\" generation who never went to war, I can understand how I might have thought this book was \\"Right On !\\" 40 years ago ... if I had read it back then.But, I only got around to reading it last month at age 60, and I have to say, it left me rather cold and unimpressed.My Dad was a B-25 pilot in WWII flying missions overseas. He was in pretty much the same situation as the characters in \\"Catch-22\\".Over the years, he has provided me with many insights that have helped me understand what it was like. He has both humorous anecdotes about military inefficiency and tales of what it's like to fly over enemy territory while people on the ground are trying to kill you.Absolutely nothing he has ever told me gives me any indication that the fictional situation described in the novel \\"Catch-22\\" is anything other than extreme exaggeration for the purpose of making a point.Of course, the point the Joseph Heller is making is valid at a certain level.But, his heavy-handed way of telling his story is so completely over-the-top that it just sort of misses the mark in my opinion and because he is so willing to hammer his point home in such a fashion, he compromises his credibility."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I was always told that this book was the ultimate in tongue-in-cheek humor. Unfortunately, although I found parts of the book both insightful and funny, it came across as rather dated. Perhaps with the growth of a more sophisticated and subtle approach to this genre of humor, Catch-22 is showing its age. Quite frankly, I got more out of watching re-runs of MASH (which probably has some of its roots in this book) then from reading this narrative. The fact that it doesn't have much of a plot adds to the frustration. A good read to get the sense of the time in which the book was written but, overall, old hat."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I first read Catch-22 in high school, and ever since have held it to be my all-time favorite book. So it was with some trepidation that I cracked it back open as an adult. Would it hold up? Thankfully, it did more than hold up; it turns out that it's even better than I remember. It's not just Heller's brilliant, through the looking glass logic that makes Catch-22 so remarkable, even though that logic leads to innumerable laugh-out-loud hilarious passages and too many brilliant sequences to count (my personal favorite may always be the sudden moaning outbreak). Had the book merely been a brilliant and hilarious piece of satire, I would have enjoyed it, but it wouldn't be the classic that it is. What makes Catch-22 absolutely unforgettable is the deep layer of melancholy and rage that underlies the satire and drives the book. I've always held that one of the hardest things to do in any medium is mix genres, and I'm always impressed when someone does it well. In Catch-22, Heller mixes drama, comedy, romance, and war story together without even blinking, and slides so effortlessly between them that you go from laughing to horror in the blink of an eye. It's this juxtapositioning that gives the book so much of its power - the transition, for instance, from Yossarian's insane arguing with Danby to the horrific fate of poor, doomed Snowden remains one of the most effective and haunting passages of any book I have ever read. There has never been another book like Catch-22 - even Heller never wrote anything this brilliant again (although Something Happened is a minor gem of an altogether different sort). But given how incredible this book is - how funny, how touching, how haunting, how powerful, how brilliant - who can complain? With its spectacular and wonderful set of characters, its trenchant and hilarious take on the military mind, and Heller's masterful writing, Catch-22 remains the finest book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 was unique among the other World War II novels that I have read. The characters, such as Yossarian, Milo and Major Major Major were quirky and satirical and, though many aspects of the story relating to World War II were embellished and fictionalized, Joseph Heller was still able to convey a powerful message; war is illogical and absurd. Heller's style of writing often seemed unstructured and many of the events that took place made no logical sense. Milo, in his enterprise which played a large role in the novel, was able to buy goods and then sell them for less money but still make a profit. The preposterousness of this situation reflected Heller's overall message about war; war is illogical.Though Heller used satire and humor to describe a very grim time, he successfully conveyed a sense of hopelessness and despair in the men fighting the war. Yossarian, the protagonist of the story, remained positive throughout but because of his repeated flashbacks to the death of one of his comrades, Snowden, we see that beneath Yossarian's upbeat exterior, he was in fact severely traumatized. In one of the final chapters of the novel, Heller vividly described Snowden's death. Because this was such a sharp contrast to the prevailing satirical tone of the novel, this scene becomes much more powerful and imbued a sense of utter despair.Although I found most of the characters and many parts of the book humorous, I also found the book long winded. The book was often repetitive and, though this was done intentionally to be humorous, I became bored with the book. Also, I found some of the dialogue very confusing. Overall, Catch-22 was intriguing but did not capture my attention."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 was written before MASH became a TV show. This book has action and tells what goes on when our soldiers are not fighting. Make love,not war!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is the only book during which I have laughed so hard that I cried. The quick back and forth dialogue sections come across like perfectly natural conversation and Joseph Heller's wit cuts out razor-blade sharp."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I won't bore you with a retelling of the story, as others have already done so. (Take that statement however you want.) Let me just say a few things that you might find helpful.I first read CATCH 22 when I was 13. What an eye-opening book for a 13 year old! Now, three full decades later, it's still a captivating book, one of the few I enjoy as much or more than when I first read it.Yossarian is the man who wants to \\"live forever or die in the attempt.\\" Well, he's going to live forever, as are the other characters in the book, and that's the brilliance of the story. While Heller's literary style is looking a bit ragged around the edges by today's standards, it's his ability to discern, distill, and capture in print the true, unchanging characteristics of humans and the human experience that makes for true immortality.Is it anti-war? Yes, in part. But it's much more than that. Heller makes good use of the war as a magnifying class for examining his true subject: human nature in conflict with its own human flaws.CATCH 22 is ... a handbook on humanity, warts and all. A ribald, swerving, twisted, irreverent handbook, but a handbook nonetheless. Or if you prefer, think of it as the biggest feather in Heller's cap. ;) Oh, and don't watch the movie version, which is more an undergrad's synopsis of a Cliff's Notes version of the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I love humor and satire books, and Catch-22 remains one of my all-time favorites. Logic and sense are completely discarded, but then at times throttled and twisted by every available character to the point where you find yourself agreeing with ridiculous arguments. Generals vie for power through a constantly deserting private who sells lighters, officers are assigned due to how appropriate their last name is, and medals are won by sheer cowardice. Heller's cast of characters, including the sex-crazed ex-photographer Hungry Joe, ever-lethargic Nately's whore, and hermit Major (named Major Major Major) stand out among fictional figures. The \\"protagonist,\\" Yossarian, is one of the few main characters in all of the war hero genre that not only begins but remains a selfish coward you cannot help but love. Over time I have bought several copies of this book just to lend out every one of them."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"So, here's the thing. I know this is supposed to be one of the seminal works of American literature, and blazingly funny to boot. And while I have no doubt Catch-22 will maintain its place in the canon regardless of anything I write, I found the whole thing quite tedious.Perhaps that was Heller's point: that war is tedious, that war doesn't make sense, that the only way for a soldier to survive a war with sanity intact is to develop a sense of the absurd and act on it. But after 144 pages, I knew I didn't care enough about Yossarian or any other character to follow the absurdity for another 300 pages.Thus, a two-star rating simply because I didn't care."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The ad in The New York Times for Joseph Heller's Catch-22 overpowered the eye, while the text overpowered the mind of its readers. The book revolves around one catch, Catch-22, which states, \\"a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he formally requests to be relieved proves that he is sane and cannot be relieved\\" (45). The catch changes meanings several times throughout the novel; but always clearly conveys the satirical tone of Heller's work.Heller, a bombardier during World War II himself, begins his novel with the main character, Yossarian, in the hospital. He had vowed not to fly any more combat missions. Readers are introduced to a variety of other characters: Orr, Yossarian's roommate; Clevinger, Dunbar, Havermeyer, other bombardiers; Doc Daneeka; Hungary Joe; Major Major, and many more. Each chapter focuses on a different character. The novel follows Yossarian on his combat missions, leaves in Rome, and stays in the hospital. Throughout, readers are told of Yossarian's fear.Heller's Catch-22 is worth the time to read. Heller clearly conveys the feeling bombardiers have during their combat missions.\\"There was no established procedure for evasive action. All you needed was fear, and Yossarian had plenty of that, more fear than Orr or Hungry Joe, more fear even than Dunbar, who had resigned himself submissively to the idea that he must die someday. Yossarian had not resigned himself to that idea, and he bolted for his life wildly on each mission the instant his bombs were away\\" (50).Seeing the machinery that could kill you at any second would take many hours of mental conditioning just being able to remain calm. No one would be able to get used to the flak. In a way the catch states that as long as soldier possesses fear, he is sane.Heller uses a disrupted stream of consciousness to help create his tone. The novel covers huge leaps of time. At one moment, the novel will be before a mission called Avignon, but suddenly will be right after Ferrara, a mission that happened long before Avignon. What one comes to realize is that the chronological order does not matter. The novel is more about the fear felt by the men and the different ways each man copes with fear. More importantly are the repeated images and concepts.Yossarian's fear never ends, which is why some of the imagines and concepts are repeated. One such image is the soldier in white. When Yossarian was in the hospital, a soldier was brought in during the night that had a complete body cast on. He later died of his injuries. As Yossarian's fear is always with him, so is the memory of the soldier in white. Yossarian could easily picture himself as having \\"two useless legs and two useless arms\\" (10). Yossarian did not appreciate the reminder of what could happen to him on any of his missions. Another repeated concept is the namesake of the novel, Catch-22. Catch-22 changes meanings throughout the novel. For Yossarian and the men, the meaning has already been stated. For the citizens of Rome, a city occupied by American troops, \\" \`Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing' \\" (407). Troops could evict people from their homes or force a restaurant to close and the Italians had to follow the orders, only because they could not stop the troops. What the men are afraid of changes for each man, but they are all afraid. Hungary Joe is afraid of going stateside, Nately of losing his beloved whore, and Yossarian of losing his life. Many repetitions appear in Heller's Catch-22, these are just two examples.Heller also portrays the fear felt by the men by telling the novel in a third-person point of view. When a reader only experiences one character's viewpoint, the reader can have difficulty judging what may be exaggerated or underestimated. With the third-person, readers enjoy objectivity. For instance, one could come to the conclusion that all of the soldiers are afraid. For example, Havermeyer is a bombardier that will fly in straight, drop his bombs, and fly out with little or no evasive maneuvering. However at La Spezia, an Italian port where the men encountered very heavy antiaircraft fire, \\"even Havermeyer resorted to the wildest evasive action he could command when he saw what a vast distance he had still to travel to escape\\" (375). Readers realize that the fear that Yossarian feels is universal. However, Yossarian is the prime example of what fear can drive a person to do.Yossarian is driven to many unusual actions because of his fear of dying. He pretended that he had a liver condition so as to stay in the hospital.\\"Yossarian ran right into the hospital, determined to remain there forever rather than fly one mission more than the thirty-two missions he had. Ten days after he changed his mind and came out, the colonel raised the missions to forty-five and Yossarian ran right back in, determined to remain in the hospital forever rather than fly one mission more than the six missions more he had just flown\\" (165).He also walked \\"backward with his gun on his hip and refused to fly any more missions\\" (392). Yossarian was willing to start injuring people from his company, just to keep from flying.Heller's novel, Catch-22, deserves its place as one of America's classic novels. The book explores the mentalities of the men putting their lives on the line for America. Heller's past influenced his writing of the book, and his use of several literary devices form his message. The catch is that people will take advantage of a person, just because that person cannot stop them. He was able to mold his novel into a classic by asking one question: what's the catch?"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The words I used to describe Catch-22 are bleak, black, and absurd. Heller's brand of absurdist humor creates some of the most poignant moments in literature and some of the most hilarious (there are many, many laugh out loud places here). It is basically the story of Yossarian, a bomber, in the closing months of World War II. He can't understand why thousands of people he hasn't met yet are trying to kill him. And it goes from there. Loaded with absurdist humor. It does turn darker towards the end. This is a very densely packed book, every page loaded with information. It's not a book you can lose concentration while reading. But it is well worth the time and energy it takes to read it. Definitely one of the best books ever written."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This dark comedy of World War Two takes place on the small island of Pianosa, off the coast of Italy. The main character, Yossarian, is an American bombardier, and like his squadron, spends much of his time either flying dangerous bombing runs over northern Italy, sleeping off his exuberances in Rome, or going on some hilarious comical escapade through which Heller is able to satirize the American military bureaucracy.At first glance (or the first reading), this novel appears to be a random collection of character sketches, loosely arranged around Yossarian and containing only confusingly humorous conversational drivel. But on the second reading, everything makes sense and it is possible to see how the comic absurdity changes from light and fun at the beginning into a dark and melancholy satire by the end of the novel.Joseph Heller first published this novel in 1961, and since then the phrase &quot;Catch-22&quot; has entered into the English language as a &quot;paradoxical problem or situation.&quot; In this book, Catch-22 is an obscure military regulation that allows for an illogical and absurd system to exist.Completely illogical logic and embarrassingly simple complexity await the individual who undertakes the reading of this excellent novel, which has become both an amusing comedy and a pensive tragedy at the same time.Bottom line? Catch-22 is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This uproarious satirical novel by Joseph Heller prompted me to think of Robert Crichton's 'The Secret Of Santa Vittoria', another novel blending WWII and comedy. Published in 1961, 'Catch-22' was the forerunner of Richard Hooker's 1968 novel, 'Mash: A Novel About Three Army Doctors'. It's not about Army Doctor's in Korea, but about Army Air Force pilots and bombardiers during WWII stationed on the small island of Pianosa, west of Italy. In order to understand the insanity of this story, the reader has to comprehend what Catch-22 means. In chapter five, Doc Daneeka explains to Yossarian ( main character ) and Orr, his roommate, why he can't ground them due to insanity: \\"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.\\"That's some catch, that catch-22,\\" he observed.\\"It's the best there is,\\" Doc Daneeka agreed.\\" This catch was why none of the bombing personnel were able to avoid flying mission after mission.The main character is Captain Yossarian, a bombardier who is convinced he is going to die on a mission. In chapter two, he explains to fellow officer, Clevinger why: \\"They're trying to kill me,\\" Yossarian told him calmly. \\"No one's trying to kill you,\\" Clevinger cried. \\"Then why are they shooting at me?\\" Yossarian asked. \\"They're shooting at everyone,\\" Clevinger answered. \\"They're trying to kill everyone.\\" \\"And what difference does that make?\\" Yossarian's fear of dying on a bombing raid was enhanced by his group commander, Colonel Cathcart. His lack of compassion was buoyed by his desire to be a general and more importantly, to be featured in 'The Saturday Evening Post'! If the Air Force wanted 40 missions before you could go home, the Colonel wanted 45. Every time someone came close to obtaining the target number of missions for being sent home, Colonel Cathcart raised the required number again. The Colonel is only one of the complex characters in this novel.I have many favorite characters and situations in this sometimes disturbing, but whimsical story. The first is Lt. Milo Minderbinder, the mess hall officer. From day one, he wheels and deals like no other war time entrepreneur. He gets away with his shenanigans by telling everyone that they have a share in his enterprises. In chapter 22, he explains his egg business: ...\\" I make a profit of three and a quarter cents an egg by selling them for four and a quarter cents an egg to the people in Malta I buy them from for seven cents an egg. Of course, I don't make the profit. The syndicate makes the profit. And everybody has a share.\\" He gets into so many businesses that he even deals with the Germans! In chapter 24, he takes a contract from the Germans to bomb his own base: \\"This time Milo had gone too far. Bombing his own men and planes was more than even the most phlegmatic observer could stomach, and it looked like the end for him...Milo was all washed up until he opened his books to the public and disclosed the tremendous profit he had made.\\" Then he says in the same chapter: \\"I'd like to see the government get out of war altogether and leave the whole field to private industry. \\"As the Milo character gets deeper into the book, it only gets more humorous.My second favorite is Major Major Major Major, the squadron commander, who looked like Henry Fonda! People who met him were always impressed by how unimpressive he was! In chapter nine, we learn: \\"With a little ingenuity and vision, he had made it all but impossible for anyone in the squadron to talk to him, which was just fine with everyone, he noticed, since no one wanted to talk to him anyway.\\" In chapter ten, we find that: \\"Major Major never sees anyone in his office while he's in his office.\\" But you can see him, if he is not in his office. If you try to barge into his tent, he goes out the window. I know it's confusing, but his first, middle and last name was Major, thus the four 'majors' when he got promoted to, you guessed it, Major.This book is a riot.My third favorite is Major-------de Coverley, Major Major Major Major's executive officer. Throughout the novel he has a blank for his first name. His function is uncertain at best. He basically pitches horseshoes all day, kidnaps Italian workers, and rents apartments for his men to use on rest leave. As soon as he hears of a city that the U.S.Army has captured, he's on his way there, usually at the head of the procession in a Jeep. No one ( friend, or foe ) knows who he is! But the reader knows that he is there just to rent apartments for his men. His picture appears in many publications, as if he is is leading the conquering army. I'm telling you this book is a gas.There are two subplots that are absolutely hysterical. The first involves the Chaplain's hostile assistant, Cpl. Whitcomb. The corporal comes up with the following generic condolence letter: \\"Dear Mrs., Mr., Miss, or Mr. And Mrs. Daneeka: Words cannot express the deep personal grief I experienced when your husband, son, father, or brother was killed, wounded, or reported missing in action.\\"This one was sent to Doc Daneeka's wife, even though the Doc wasn't dead. Col. Cathcart feels this letter will prove his concern for his men and finally get him in The Saturday Evening Post. He promotes Whitcomb to sergeant! The second subplot revolves around our hero, Yossarian. After Yossarian tells Lt. Nately's whore that Nately was killed in action, She tries to kill Yossarian and she relentlessly pursues him chapter, after chapter. Nobody knows why she wants to slay him, but it is funny.The reader will also meet: Chaplain Tappman, who is intimidated by everyone; Nurses Cramer and Duckett; Hungry Joe and his screaming nightmares; Chief White Halfoat, who knows he is going to die of pneumonia; Aarfy, the navigator; and Huple, the fifteen year old pilot, just to mention a few. How Joseph Heller kept track of all these characters is unbelievable.There is so much going on in this book that I had to take notes to remember who is who, and who did what.This is a great American classic and should be read by book lovers of all genres. The great American author Studs Terkel states in the \`other voices' section of this book: \\"You will meet in this astonishing novel, certainly one of the most original in years, madmen of every rank: Major Major Major, on whose unwilling frame the gold leaf is pinned because of his unfortunate resemblance to Henry Fonda; Doc Daneeka, who is declared dead despite his high temperature; Hungry Joe and his fistfights with Huple's cat; ex-pfc Wintergreen, who has more power than almost anybody.\\" Enough said?"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Heller's satiric tone is a refreshing break from most classical literature. He manages to write about a very serious and somber topic and make the reader laugh without making light of the subject. The book actually does have something funny on every page. This is one of those books that you simply must read if you do any kind of reading at all."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This was my third time reading Carch 22 and it just keeps getting better each time. I'll probably read it again in a few years."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"a great book. there's a reason it's a classic. it's so unique, great characters, kind of crazy, but still totally relevant. highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is simply one the greatest books in American Lit. Aside from Slaughterhouse Five (and especially if you loved that) you want to read this book. Like all great works, it may be about a particular time, but it's truly timeless.Also loved:Slaughterhouse-Five (Kurt Vonnegut Series)Mother Night (Kurt Vonnegut Series)The Siege of Walter Parks"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"An American classic. Holds its edge after decades. Belongs in the pantheon of American fiction - oh, wait, it already holds a place in that august company."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"First and foremost, Catch-22 is written in a circular fashion, often ignoring chronological order to aid in the atmosphere of apparent logical irrationality. Many a reader has been turned away by this lack of sensical ordering. However strive on, just as a CSI detective starts with only half the picture, as you travel through this book, all becomes clear.There are two different appeals to reading Catch-22. The first is the lighthearted satire, mayhaps similar to what many of us have found in the comic strip \\"Beetle Bailey\\". In fact, you could open this book up randomly to any page and sample the hilarity without embroiling yourself in an immense and thought-provoking novel.The other path is the hidden meaning which each and every one of the 50 odd characters portrays. The profound absurdity of war and the needs of the individual versus the needs of society are debated mercilessly. This book is not truly anti-war as the war itself often seems more of a backdrop to the main story, however Heller strives to emphasize the desires of the individual versus the greater payoff to society . The main character, Yossarian, desires the end of the WWII but not at the cost of his own life. The greater enemy of the novel is often not the Germans, but the bureaucracy of the American army or as Yossarian says, \\"The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on, and that includes Colonel Cathcart. And don't you forget that, because the longer you remember it, the longer you might live.\\""},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I almost didn't include this book in my reading list - thank goodness I did in the end!Although set during a war, the theme is about survival, insanity and humanity.The language is disturbingly funny and can drive anyone crazy.The story is not told chronologically, which makes it a slightly difficult read, but the book relies largely on its characters and the way that Heller sets it out presents better pictures of each character. At the beginning of the book we get the impression that everyone is crazy, Yossarian most of all. But as the story unfolds we realise that it's all just a hopeless attempt to survive the madness of their era, nobody is fool and least of all Yossarian.I'm currently reading it for the third time - definitely one of my favourite books now. The story may be too entangled to understand at first, but the characters come vividly to life and stay with you."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"When I first picked up Catch-22, I expected to be bored to death by yet another long and dull novel about war. Within the first chapter, I was surprised to find that the book was funny in a darker and satirical way.At first I thought that this book was about the insanity of war and it's crazy bureaucracy, but upon further reflection I have found this novel to be more about moral decisions and ethics. Sure, Yossarian wanted to be sent home from the war, but he would not okay General Peckem's and Cathcart's theory that it is acceptable to continually raise the number of flight missions, which would endanger the lives of others in the squadron. This huge moral dilemma is the climax of the book, and when Yossarian makes the ethical choice and sacrifices his guaranteed safety for the overall good, the reader is left with a contented feeling.I am glad that I got the opportunity to read Catch-22. I strongly recommend the book to anyone and everyone who has the time to read and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Set in the closing months of WWII,Catch-22: A Novel (Simon & Schuster Classics)follows Yossarian, a bombardier who has decided that everyone is trying to kill him.This book is not just a military satire, it's focus is much bigger that that. This book shows the obscene craziness of our world, each character another aspect of human nature.This novel gets better every time I read it and it's message is still an important one today.If you haven't read this book yet... what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"That about says it all. I had no idea what to expect when I picked up Heller's masterpiece and perhaps that was part of the wonderful-ness: it was a total surprise. After reading Catch-22, my outlook on life was completely thrown for a loop. No book has ever made me think and reevaluate as this one did. A perfect novel - it makes you laugh, it makes you feel sad, it makes you think and it stays with you. I am ever amazed at the intricacy with which the novel is structured and how the story unfolds. I re-read Catch-22 regularly."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller was a genius in delivering such a masterpiece to his fellow countrymen. The style, and proses are evocative. Heller keeps the plot, and storyline right above the surface of the pages. He has you learning of one character make reference to one you will learn of later in the book, or one you just passed. The satire is fulsome, and majestically original. The book refreshes the reader in a way very few books can. It is disconcerting when one realizes this is one of a kind. Authors should take a stab at further developing Mr. Heller's gift."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This was a very popular book when it first came out. Millions of copies were sold in the paperback version in the 1960s. There are a few different versions on the market. The present version has an introduction by the author in which he describes the process of getting the manuscript accepted for publication, and then he describes the first book reviews after it came out. It was his first novel and he received a $1500. advance. The book was written after he taught English composition at Penn. State and while he was working in the advertising business in New York City in the 1950s .When the book first appeared, the reviews were mixed. The Sunday Times, for example, thought that the book was far too \\"repetitious\\" and it lacked \\"craft and sensibility.\\" But a reviewer from the Herald tribune in New York thought it was \\"a wild, moving, shocking, hilarious, raging, exhilarating, giant roller coaster ride of a book.\\" Those two reviews summarize the basic traits of the book. I quote Joseph Heller himself who wrote a piece on the reviews in the introduction.The reviews were not unanimous because - and this is a simplification that I make here - this is not a novel in the purest sense as one might think of a novel such as Madame Bovary. It is not a well balanced work of art where one has a few strong characters and a strong plot. Rather, it is a wandering story or a series of short stories all linked by a common protagonist. The hero, Yossarian, is an air crew member in a bomber wing which is stationed off the coast of Italy during World War II. The book has a series of strong characters, all held together by a weak plot; it is a series of very funny portraits of various characters in the bomber wing. Each chapter is about a different member of the wing: various colonels, generals, fellow crew members, the chaplain, etc. It describes their actions, motivations, and inner thoughts.The book describes how they cope with the isolation, the pressures of war, and the ambitions of the regular officers, especially the colonels who want to become generals.So, this is a great piece of literature but perhaps not the great American novel. It took Joseph Heller about 8 years to write this story of World War II, and we assume that he has drawn on his knowledge of the bomber wing from his own time in the air-force. It is irreverent humor which leaves the reader laughing out loud on many occasions during the read.The only other similar book that I have read is Slaughterhouse Five, but the present work is much longer and more complex than that book.This is an interesting and entertaining read that can be read in a day or two."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Every superlative has been attached to this great satirical piece -- masterpiece, laugh out loud hilarious, enormously funny, original genius, devestatingly witty, terrifyingly insightful, etc, etc. This one of a kind book deserves all these tags.A novel of WWII bomber crews, it is all about war and people in general, with all their foibles and quirks. A fascinating piece of work: funny, insightful, witty (there I go with the tags). One of the few books that I've read more than once, I hope to read it again. If you haven't read Catch-22, you must."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"So much has already been written about Catch 22 that I don't know if I can add anything else to the discussion. It's well worth your time to read it if you haven't and reread it if it's been a while.The brilliance of the book, in my opinion, is that it maintains several themes strongly through sarcasm. Reading the novel feels like watching a M*A*S*H marathon, that's high praise in my book.Power designs itself to remain in power and greed is the ultimate excuse for any crime. Those out of power can be trampled upon and abused and killed so long as it's done in the name of greed - and that doesn't even need to be disguised. And, the sad part is that it's all true. There isn't any truth in this book that's less relevant today than when it was written 40 years ago.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is a satirical masterpiece of 5 central themes: insanity, the brutality of war, free will versus determinism, moral debasement, and death. Each character is a unique archetype that embodies a supporting idea. The ideas include the cyclic run of Catch 22, the absurdity of a non-sequitir world, the ridicule pinned on sychophants, hypocrites, the sexually imprisoned, the logical lapses of high military officials, the religious officials that lose faith, all of which culminate in a heap of drama, irony, humour, and social commentary.Another key idea at the crux of the novel is time. One of the reasons that I was able to enjoy reading the novel after already having read it before was the complex chronological structure. The novel is not chronologically consistent in any pattern: it isn't written from beginning to end, vice versa, nor in media res. Rather, time is jumbled in a mess, which enhances the entire effect of life under Catch 22: and confusing, helpless mess.The novel is also held together by black humour. Heller pokes fun at many areas in the microcosmic story that are inherently not funny at all. With skill and genius, the novel is a work that discusses grave topics in a manner that is light yet effective, humourous but poignant.I was at Barnes and Nobles just yesterday and Catch 22 had the center poster spread. Like, omg."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Is there any book quite like this one?Catch-22\\" is my favorite novel. Of all time. To adapt an old saying, if an infinite number of monkeys were to type an infinite number of words for an infinite amount of time, THESE would be my favorite 170,000-odd words they could possibly type.There are other works that attempt to emulate this one, and many may receive some of the same adjectives when reviewed--zany, heartfelt, comic, tragic, classic, passionate, absurd, painful, hilarious--but, simply put, there is no book like this one.Even Joseph Heller couldn't escape his masterpiece. Though the author--a self-admited plodding writer--wrote several more novels, there was nothing to equal his triumph here. Such is the price of such an early tour de force.That said, \\"Catch-22\\" is certainly not for everyone. The novel is often...NON-SEQUENTIAL: It skips forward and backward in time (see \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\"), to great effect;VIOLENT: Occasionally extreme and shocking;BIZARRE: A captain named Major Major Major, for example;ILLOGICAL: Even if you discount \\"non-sequential\\" and \\"bizarre\\";ANTI-HEROIC: The protagonist cares for nothing more than his own skin;COUNTER-CULTURAL: The U.S. generals are painted as insane and vain, even bombing their own airport;ABSURDIST: A character stuffs his cheeks with crab apples, to name but one;TRAGIC: There are moments that left me tearful;HILARIOUS: Any sequence involving the phrase \\"Catch-22,\\" for instance;While all of the above is true--and perhaps because of it--there is no reading experience like this one. I read the novel when I was a high school sophomore, sometime around 1968, and in some ways liken the experience reading it to my sensations as I watched the movie \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\"--I might not have always understood what I just witnessed, but I knew it was unique, important, and transcended other works.There are some people I've met who have told me they would not read the book simply BECAUSE so many other people constantly reference it that they now believe themselves to be inured. I would liken these naysayers to those who avoid followers who continuously allude to, say, \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\\" tirelessly tryng to one-up fellow \\"Grail\\"-ers by quoting dialogue line-by-line. I, too, have been around those devotees when it comes to such works, patiently sitting by (or, I admit it, even joining in) while they quote this character or that scene with the reverence of the true disciple.But this is that kind of book, a watershed novel that pre-dated other great works of literature or movie or TV like, say, \\"M*A*S*H\\" or \\"Hitch-hiker's Guide\\" or \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" or \\"The Gone-Away World.\\" It is a truly great anti-war classic that reads like an amusement park thrill ride, ushering its reader on a cavalcade of experiences and emotions that should leave the appreciative breathless and angry and thrilled, but never apathetic.Like with any great work, the reader who finishes the book should find that his or her own understanding of the novel will vary from others', and I am willing to admit that some may not appreciate the work like, well, I do, but I would find it hard to believe that the book will not create in them a unique emotive experience. There is so much happening within this novel that any one aspect of it warrants investigation: the general who cares nothing for his men other than risking their lives to get his own praiseworthy article in the Saturday Evening Post; the officer-turned-capitalist who convinces the commanders to remove parachutes and replace them with IOUs, or replace food with cotton; the innocent young soldier who is willing to give up his life to save a cynical whore who cares nothing for him; the shy major who will only allow office visitors when he is anywhere but actually IN his office; the living doctor who has been declared dead and now walks around like a spectre; the pilot who continuously ditches his plane for practice...See? I'm doing it myself.Read this book. It is the one true classic that I can honestly say I have read and re-read and read again, and still hope I live long enough to read it twice more. It's that good."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is a marvelously written, inexhaustibly depicted, vividly portrayed, and sarcastically alluded novel that dazzles with mind-blowing vise and addictive charisma!I picked up this book in a bookstore by accident. Before I bought it, I only heard of this book somewhere too distant too recall. One day I was walking around a bookstore with a friend, and suddenly bumped into the title \\"Catch-22\\", and a comment saying that it is a good novel came up to me. I eventually bought the book out of that impulse.In fact, when I was reading the first few pages, I had a difficult time getting used to the atmosphere that was looming around all the characters in the book, as well as the general tone of absurdity that is everywhere, and the hilarious logic. However, once you get used to the tone and move on in the story, you will be exposed to a world of dark comedy and heart-breaking scenes.When I was reading the book, it was very common that one sentence can make you want to cry, laugh, fume and think at the same time. Jacob Howard has said that some literature scholars claimed that Joseph has \\"shouted\\" the words on the paper instead of \\"writing\\", this is an accolade in terms of the emotions that mingle across sentences in the novel. I feel that the the emotions have been woven so well across the entire world that is behind the words, that every single sentence, every single adjective, is powerful enough to pierce directly to your heart and touch the truest and purest materials there, and at the same time create the kind of resonance that make you unwilling to put the book down while pondering upon the meaningfulness of most of the stuff that are prevalent in today's world."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I picked this one up because I wanted something funny to read.

I won't go into details about the plot to avoid spoiling anything.I doubt this is even necessary, but I do feel that I need to warn some readers that this isn't a book for kids. It's about war and the army, and nothing is spared- death scenes, of which there are plenty, are gruesome and tragic. Prostitutes and loose women are extremely common topics.

Even if you aren't looking for something so deep this book is still for you. Even taken at the most superficial level Catch 22 is a great read. It can make you cry, laugh hysterically, or become very angry. By the time I finished this book I loved all the characters. If you have seen the (somewhat) recently released movie just know the book is 1000 time better.

It is also very very funny, even though a lot of it is so-called dark humor. All kids should read this when they are 18. It will put them off any warlike thoughts for ever."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is one of the three best books I have ever read. Set during World War !!, it combines eternal relevance, pathos and humor in the gripping story of a most interesting character."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The novel \\"Catch-22\\" was written by Joseph Heller to show how crazy the Air Force made people during World War Two. The characters are trapped in the Air Force by the catch known as Catch 22, it was meant to stop crazy people from compromising missions by preventing them from flying. What the catch really did was prevent anybody from being grounded (sent home). The catch works where if someone was crazy all they had to do was ask somebody to ground them, the only problem was that when they asked to be grounded the catch said that the person was no longer crazy and could not be grounded. This along with the number of required missions constantly being raised prevents anybody from leaving the Air Force. Being forced to stay takes its toll on the soldiers as they slowly lose morale and drift into madness. The main character, Yossarian, realizes that there is no escape other than death, which he, more than anyone, wants to avoid. This prompts him to plot how to avoid going on missions.Heller writes this story not in any particular chronological order, and instead connects the chapters at random in order to portray the insanity that the characters experience. The story is analogous to a jig-saw that is given ten pieces at a time. The reader must remember was has already been said and connect it to what has just been said. Heller's writing style of using a plethora of ironies and hyperboles adds to the satire of the book, which isn't so much satirizing WW2, but war in general. His way of writing the character's dialogue also contributed to the insanity that he was trying to portray. The characters speak in what feels like circles, where the character says what the last character said in a slightly different way. After a while of this, the conversation loses its original meaning and makes even the reader question his sanity. The novel effectively satirizes World War Two and possibly all other wars, and conveys themes of power in bureaucracy, the inevitability of death, and a loss of religion."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"For the price a very sweet deal. have had it for 2 months now and no problems. would buy again from this company"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is being used for an English lit course. We are finding it to be an interesting and thoughtful read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Brilliant, subversive, dark and dangerously funny - what more do you want from a war novel? Oh yes, death. There's plenty of that amidst all the madness!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I loved Catch-22. There is so much greatness here, that it's hard to know where to begin. Many people have a hard time with the storytelling method that jumps back and forth into time. Everyone is used to books that move mostly from beginning to end, with ocassional \\"time jumps\\" only if the character POV changes. Heller uses a different organization method. He organizes by topic, and the narration is almost as if an interlocuter tosses out subjects and people to a war veteran and he tells everything he remembers about each one.I think Heller does this so that the reader doesn't focus on the \\"war events\\" such as battles and missions, but instead we focus on the personal stories and experiences of the different soldiers in Yossarian's bomb unit. The book is absurd from beginning to end. Of course, the absurdity of war, and the absurdity of cooperating with war, is the whole point. What's amazing is how Heller saw this on the heels of WW2, a conflict most people considered completely validated as a \\"just\\" war by Nazi atrocities. Catch-22 seems like the voice of Cassandra when we look at the American wars that followed.My favorite character of Catch-22 was Milo Minderbender, the 27-year old business prodigy whose antics seem perfectly applicable to today. I think Milo most compelling episode came when he contracted to bomb his own airbase, and everyone forgot their objections when he showed them how much profit he earned in the deal. The other Milo anecdote I truly loved is when he got mesmerized by cornering the Egyptian cotton market and ended up stuck with product he couldn't unload. Milo then tried to convince everyone in the unit that chocolate covered cotton was edible and that it was their duty to learn to like it.There is simply too much here to include in a short review. Do yourself a favor: read it, laugh, and read it again. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Read this book!I remember Catch-22 having a cult like following among my older siblings and their friends. Catch 22 seemed to have a wide influence in popular culture yet was not a best seller when it was first released. Heller's humourous war-time Kafkaesque nightmare retains its relevancy forty years on as a political and social commentary. No book has made me laugh and cringe so much at the same time.Technically, its probably not the best book I've read but probably one of the most important and influential.A must read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Heller is a modern Job, yelling at G-d, complaining to G-d, crying and laughing. His book is scary. Life has no meaning, it is Snowden or Sweden. It is our world that is insane, this is why we laugh insanely in order to stay sane. Heller: life is hell. Yossarian: what's the hell! Milo: is there a demand for Egyptian cotton in hell?I would recommend Every Man's edition of the book - it has a great introduction by a Canadian (or maybe British) schalor. By the way, a customer put a picture of the hard cover Every Man on the Amazon - that one with the Heller's photo."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book had me laughing out loud. It was beautifully written and this will be one of the few books I want to read over and over again. Well done!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"A very smart, well written book. I'm not some pacifist, violence is evil type of drum beater. Sometimes violence is necessary. Far too often, however, even with the best surface intentions, the machine of bureaucratic incompetence enters the fray, and makes everything both surrealistic, and incomprehensible. This book points that out. It doesn't find fault with the ongoing war, per se, just with the way it is run. At the same time, it brings up plenty of intriguing questions. The sharp witted protagonist,Yossarian, time and again points out the futility of trying to argue with any single minded authority figures. Sad, serious, and hilarious, all at the same time. As a side note, I enjoyed this book so much, I tried some more work of Heller's. It was horrible, this one off being his true genius hat trick, and nothing else even coming close."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Perhaps the greatest satire on war, \\"Catch-22\\" presents many characters with extraordinary personalities, the most important of whom is Yossarian. Witty and cunning, he constantly tries not to avoid being killed while serving his duty in WWII. He meets many people and goes trough many trials in this book. One such trial occurs very early in the book and uses the book's title phrase Yossarian finds a catch in the system that says that soldiers will be sent home who are crazy enough not to fly an airplane into combat. The doctor tells Yossarian that he must first tell him that he is crazy, and then must have someone vouch for his insanity.Yossarian assumes that he will be dismissed, but the Doc adds one more stipulation: if someone asks not to fly because they are crazy, they can't be crazy because anyone who doesn't want to die must be sane. This, Doc Daneeka notes, is a catch-22. The phrase \\"catch-22\\" now appears in the dictionary because of this book. If that fact does not suggest the importance of this book, I don't know what will.This book is funny from beginning to end. It shows a lighter side of war. Most books don't refer to the human struggle during wartime but \\"Catch-22\\" uses humor to show how the conflicts between one man and the solders fighting along side him affect him in war. This book will be able to make you laugh about some very serious issues that effected people during WWII."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"What is there to say about a book that so many before me have reviewed? My take on Catch-22 is that it is hilarious, eye-opening, and a bit disturbing (but just a bit). I couldn't put it down for the first couple hundred pages.But it got repetitive. I don't care to pick at classics, so I won't. Should everyone read this book? Yes. Was it good? Yes, I would say 3.5 out of 5 stars. I would give it more, but there comes a point where it just drags...and drags...and drags. The version I have is 453 pages and I think I could have done without 150-200 of those pages. I did, thankfully, enjoy the ending--I went from hating Yossarian, the main character, at the beginning of the book, to not being sure how I felt about him, to actually kind of liking him at the very end."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"A few years ago I attempted to read this book, but gave up after about 100 pages. I picked the book up again and finally I was able to read the entire book. The only reason I don't give this book 5 stars is that it took me awhile to get drawn into it. Overall, it's very well-written with a lot of subtle humor in it. The book can be a little redundant at times, but it's very unique. This is definitely a must read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Good movie based on a great book! Some very funny moments but Hollywood did stray away too many times from a very funny story line."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Do you think the people who are criticizing this book for being unnecessarily anti-military realize Heller was in the military?

Should be read by everyone from freshman in college on up."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a jarring, thrilling, hysterical exposition of the oppression and dominance which pervades lives and lifestyles in the modern era. Full of classic dialogue, superb characters, wonderfully narrated, Catch-22 may be the best book ever written. A heartbreaking achievement of staggering genius!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Heller uses the most brilliant satire as he pens the story of Yossarian and his comrades, and their fight for survival in the midst of war and death. Sarcasm drips off every page, which makes the book a bit slow at times, but thoroughly humorous and enjoyable. And....what an ending!If you love M*A*S*H, you will love this book! And if you love this book, you should seriously watch M*A*S*H!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is the original (at least in terms of modern relevance) satire of modern warfare and decision making. However, it achieves a level of humour very rarely achieved elsewhere. It is a very personal book, and some of the personal touch, sidesplitting jokes, and very dark serious undercurrent make this resonate more with me than some of the other great \\"political / moral\\" satires - Animal Farm and 1984 after all can leave you feeling somewhat cold."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Although [...]. It had an incredible affect on me. It is incredibly funny, yet very sad in parts. Especially for example when you do finally find out what happened to the gunner, Snowden, in the mission to Avignon. Or when Yossarian walks through Rome.The ideas concerning the ridiculuous nature of war are as topical now as they were in the 1960s. Actually, of course, Joseph Heller's presentation of the insanity around him predated the Vietnam War, and I wasn't around at that time to truly judge the feeling then.The dialogue is laugh-out-loud funny at times, as is the juxtapostion of events, as for example when Clevinger complains of confusing cause-and-effect in staring at the bomb-line on the map south of Bologna, willing the line to move itself and for the squadron to not have to fly the mission. In fact, the whole chapter in which this incident occurs, \\"Bologna\\" was the funniest in the book for me, with the rain beating down and the mission continually cancelled, Chief Whitehalfoat stealing a jeep to drive home, and Yossarian telling his pilot to turn around. And then, of course, Bologna was a milk-run; no glue gun there.Anyone who has not read this book and is mystified by what is going on at the moment and since 2003 should read this book. It's not going to change the world, but it is food for thought.Also highly recommended are the next two of Joseph Heller's novels, \\"Something Happened\\" and \\"Good as Gold.\\""},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I've read this book three times over the years, and I sometimes remember bits of it at odd moments. It is very funny and profound. I once read that many years later, Joseph Heller was asked why he had never written anything as good again. He replied \\"Who has?\\" He had a point."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I've always been interested in reading this legendary book, just not 450-pages interested, so I was pleased when my book club selected it and I was \\"required\\" to read it. Unfortunately, by the time I got to the end, I was much less pleased. I found the book's much-vaunted humor to be tiresome in the extreme, the characters far too cartoonish for me to care when bad things happen, and the entire enterprise to be about twice as long as necessary. Which is not to say there weren't some things to like: the non-linear, non-chronological structure is kind of interesting at times (unlike some, I didn't find it confusing), the convoluted machinations of war profiteer Milo Minderbinder are kind of amusing, and the sly insertion of anachronistic elements to signal that the book is about Korea and not WWII, are all worth mentioning. But the book leans far too heavily on extended circular conversations that reminded me of nothing so much as a series of Abbot and Costello \\"Who's On First?\\" routines. To be fair, a number of my fellow book club members couldn't read these without audibly giggling, but I (and others) found them to be very painful going. And it may be that the book just hasn't aged well, or has been succeeded by so much tighter satire (M*A*S*Hfor example) or ridiculous wars, that it just can't reliably have the subversive effect it must have at the time it was published. For military satire that's more contemporary, and to my mind at least, funny, try the excellent Gulf War farceFobbit."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"For quite a few years I've ignored this book simply because its a work of fiction and who needs that when there are so many quality true stories out there to read? Well I recently bit the bullet and read this book to see if it lived up to the hype. It sure did. What a rich and engaging cast of flawed but interesting characters! They reminded me of some of the men I served with, especially the young and romantic Nately. His naivety mirrored that of not only my friends but also my own self at that age (though I was much to innocent to try and romance a prostitute!). I would highly recommend this book to anyone in need of a laugh at the insanity of war."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I was really introduced to this book by reading John van der Ruit's &#34;Spud&#34; novel. It was very funny in places and, as one who served in the Air Force, much of the scenarios showed that the author understood the context well! I will admit that I started to lose interest after a while as the author tends to spend whole chapters on individuals; some of them grabbed me and others were rather boring. On the whole, an entertaining read that explores human fickleness, the rigidness of societal structures and the absurdity of war."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read this book because I read it in high school and never got to finish it. I wanted to read it again and get to the end this time. Funny and a little irreverent. Yossarian lives!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I wasn't too excited to start this book. I had to read it with my class at school and, well, we usually don't read very good novels. This one was...okay. The entire novel was a satire-making fun of war. There were a few parts that really made me laugh, but sometimes the book seemed to drag on and on with the corny jokes! And sometimes it didn't make sense just because the author didn't feel like making sense in order to prove a point. I know that's a certain style, but it irks me.I liked how the characters were well defined, if annoying at times. I know, I know-they're supposed to be this way. I'm just not used to reading any book like this one.I'm giving \\"Catch 22&#8243; 2/5 stars: 1 star for the fact that it made me laugh [sometimes], and the other for the combination of it being a classic book [then it must be good enough for people to read XD] and having great characters."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Having previously red the book several times I knew precisely what I was getting. I continue to loan my books to friends and relatives requiring that I purchase it again to re-read it. Not entirely a BAD idea because with each new reading I get new entertainment value from the book. VERY well written with a dry sense of humor concerning a very SERIOUS moment in history. It is a very sensible spoof on army life during world war II with various things taken to their ultimate extreme to wring out the often buried humor. I suspect this will not be the LAST time I read and enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Although I am in my late 60s with a Ph.D. in English, I had not read the novel. Having heard the phrase, &#34;Catch-22,&#34; all my life, I decided it was high time to do so. First, I listened to the audio version.

But after re-reading it now, I am suprised at how well it has held up. I do think you will probably enjoy it more if you are or have been in the military, as much of the humor and satire in the book deals with the military beaucracy, and if you haven't experienced it, you may not &#34;get&#34; some of what Heller is presenting."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is more about people than it is about war. It is more about life than it is about death. It is more about Yossarian and Nately (and his old man) and Sheisskopf and Major Major than it is about World War II. Hell, I even took my username from my favorite character in this book (as well as literature universall), Milo Minderbinder.I have heard from many that Heller has not approached this brilliance since. He once, when asked why he had not written another novel as good as Catch-22, said, &quot;Well, nobody else has either.&quot; That just might be true. This book made me look at people with all their quirks and their inconsistencies and try to laugh instead of argue. It helped me look at our world with a smile and a laugh insead of a frown and a spoonful of critisism. Parts were hilarious, parts were poignant.Its story is far less important than its character (as made evident by the format). In every character you see something in yourself. In Yossarian I saw much of what I would like to have the guts to do. I saw common sense. It was also a manifestation of Orwell's famous quotations, &quot;Sanity is Not Statistical.&quot;Read this book: laugh, cry, think, be enlightened.{{{milo}}}"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is an excellent book chronicling the experiences of an American bombardier in WWII with objections to sacrificing his seemingly infinitesimal self in order to win a war. The prose is stirring and although the vocabulary can be difficult at times, it forces your mind to create a vivid picture of the scenes. The hilarious characters make you laugh out loud. My favorite scenes were with the two CID men with Major Major and the scene where Yossarion pretends to be a man who died in the hospital for the family of the victim. It was seemingly almost entirely a comedic piece until the last thirty pages, in which the reader arrives at the startling revelation that nearly all of the enormous cast of characters has died. Though it took me a long time to finish, I would gladly read it again."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The best way that I can find to describe this book is Abbott and Costello's infamous &quot;Who's on first?&quot; routine. The entire plot and interaction between characters is a mish-mash of miscommunication. The characters run the gamet of absurdity. From the main character Yossarian, the bombardier who thinks that everyone is out to get him personally because they are trying to kill him in a war. To the private, who is running a black market between countries and enemies, selling anything and everything he can get his hands on. To the colonel who feels that the success of the army depends on whether or not he can provide a good parade. The list goes on and on.The plot weaves back and forth in time and can get somewhat confusing at times, but then again if you're not on your toes this whole book could get away from you. I found the best thing to do is just find a quiet place and let yourself get absorbed in the ridiculousness. The best way to sum up this satirical look on war is this: &quot;Catch 22&quot; IS a catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller has created something amazing in Catch-22. It is a modern classic. The novel will spend 400 pages dragging the reader through the mud, only to to conclude with one of the most satisfying endings I have found in literature. The tone will oscillate between ironic and morose, jubilant and melancholy, and Heller makes no apologies for doing so. The novel ultimately questions the validity of war and so-called camraderie, loyalty, and patriotism. This is a wonderful book with a message that will resonate with the reader for a long time after the story comes to an end."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is the one thing that keeps an entire bomber squadron in WWII still flying. The book constructs a vivid portrayal of the experiences of Yossarian and his comrades and their reasons for insanity. Their only goal is forging plans that can keep them on the ground and out of their planes. There is a limit to the number of missions the squadron must fly, but as soon as enough men reach it, it is simple raised. The squadron is caught in a never-ending circle broken only by death. The ironic Catch -22 is their only path towards freedom, it keeps them flying because it is Catch-22. The book is a great read the humor in the book runs abound along and the irony behind catch-22 creates great plot twists. Yossarian will continue to live for many years."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read this book and loved it! It is by far one of my personal favorites. It has been critized as slow to start, which is partly true, but once you get used to Heller's style it is one of the greatest stories ever written."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"If you are thinking of reading this book take and chance and start now, you won't be sorry. I rank this as one of my top 5 favorite books and the best satire I have read or seen. The book can start out to be a little hard to read at first with dozens of characters and a timeline that goes back and forth without notice. But once you get thru 100 pages or so the plot starts to come together and it's pure genius stands out. No other book I have read makes better satirical comment on the Human nature than this book and the humor used will make you laugh out loud while reading. The closest comparison I can give this book is the movie &quot;Life of Brian&quot; by Monty Python. If you liked that movie read this book and vice versa."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is a very funny novel about Yossarian, a solder that flies for the Air Force. To get out of the Air Force you need to fly a certan number of missions. But Colonel Cathcart, a leader of Yossarian, keeps raising the number of missions. So, Yossarian is stuck. This book has all kinds of humor, and will keep you laughing. I have never read a better book. I would HIGHLY recommend this book if you are one for humor, action, and more humor."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is one of the funniest book ever written. Funny is not just a way of saying it made me giggle. Really funny novels are funny because they provide surprising insight into the way human beings truly are. Among classics Catch-22 is the funniest I've read. Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf is the funniest contemporary novel because it has similar amazing insights -- but it's not a war novel, and who knows if it will have the relevance that Catch-22 does fifty years later, but anyway I just love both these books."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Screw Tolstoy, this is the greatest war book ever written. Heller reinvented the novel with a totally unique approach to character development.He lets us get inside the mind of very disturbed people in one of the funniest and clever books ever written.

A modern classic by any measure."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Hillarious, Moving, Disturbing, Flawless. Catch-22 is notthe greatest book I have ever written, it is, though, thebest. Heller's revolutionary plot structuring drivesbeyond time and place, to meaning. After the first fewchapters the book seems to be going every directionpossible, but after a few more it becomes evident thattime has very little consequence in the book, but that thesignifigance of each segment, which Heller repeats overand over again to the beat of some furious, wildlybrilliant drum is the deciding factor in his plotting.The insane structure all the while parallels the hero's,John Yossarian, or anti-hero's more accurately, frenziedattempts to break away from the madness of society and toattain his supreme goal, to live (even if must die in theattempt.) He assaulted by Capitalism, in thepersonification of Milo Minderbinder, the man who'sbusiness crosses all battle lines, supports every man,woman, and child in Europe, and robs them dry at the sametime; to Col. Cathcart, the ultimate bad boss, whosacrifices the men in Yossarian's squadron in the vainhope of being featured in LIFE magazine; to Nately'swhore, who is Yossarian's also conscience, and who isconstantly trying to kill him; to The Soldier In White,the ultimate victim, neither quite living nor quite dead;to Snowden, who's terrifying secret haunts Yossarian for afew hours chronologically, but for the entire course ofthe book due to Hellers brilliant structure; and MajorMajor Major Major, the man assigned to mediocrity. Allthe while Catch-22, the ultimate insanity, defying allreason and sense, appears anywhere and everywhere, in anyform immaginable, haunting Yossarian and preventing him frombeing free of the insanity of the war and society.But no matter what you read, no matter what happens to anyof Heller's manic characters: Yossarian lives.Chris BenchThere was only one catch...and that was Catch-22. -Joseph HellerWho is John Galt? -Ayn Rand"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Like most who have read this novel at different times in their lives, the first readings are not nearly so fulfilling as the reading once the silly arrogance of college life has long been left behind. This book means more to those of us who have matured because the institutional insanity so cleverly articulated by Heller in this novel is more pervasive today... and not just in the the military. I think it takes decades of living before some of the truths in novels such as this meaningfully reveal themselves. When I was required to read this in an American Lit. class in college, I pretended to understand it, because I was full of myself. Now, looking back, I realize I didn't understand it then at all."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Even sloth and debauchery lose their power. Virtue and sanity are what's left over when you've tired of all vice."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"By wrapping his story in the context of war, Heller amplifies our tendency to treat others as a means to an end and to interpret our surroundings as intentionally hostile to our own objectives.Does Heller say more than this? Probably, after all, he introduces a lot of colorful characters, albeit most superficially. But it takes a lot of patience to wade through his oxymoronic prose and roundabout narrative style. At times I found this entertaining; at others I did not. It was probably during these latter instances where I missed the book's other messages on love, capitalism, war, sex, and everything else that others have gleaned from its pages. Admittedly, war is tragic, and sometimes life seems pointless and self-defeating, but as Major Danby explains near the end, sometimes we just have to focus on objectives larger than ourselves.In short and in an attempt to imitate Heller's style, I would describe Catch-22 as a comical and tragic book that uplifts and depresses you. Its constant absurdity is transcended only by its momentary seriousness. Would I read it again? Parts of it, most definitely. The whole thing, probably not."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"When a piece of literature gets stuck into a culture, you know there's really something to it. Having read CATCH-22 when in high school, I decided to revisit it in this crazy George Bush-world we now live in. The parallels are frighteningly surreal. But let's not get political.This is the story of one man's fight to exit WW II in one piece. His name is Captain Yossarian and he finds the war-torn world to be a place of contradictions and ignorant men of power. Flying missions over Europe, Yossarian's commanders continually up the number of missions that must be flown before the men can be circulated back to the States. Yossarian realizes he'll never stop flying these terribly dangerous missions because whenever he gets close to his final one, his CO's up them (a Catch-22 in itself). The ridiculous qualities of war are thrown at Yossarian as we witness his conflicting tragedies through comedic/ironic eyes.In his do-anything-to-stay-alive fashion, Yossarian enters the hospital as often as possible with stomach ailments, or by trying to be deemed mentally unstable. Neither works, of course.Pinning medals on naked men, rowing to Sweden with a tiny spoon, and living with a dead guy who never made it past his first mission, Yossarian's gambits know no bounds.Heller's writing style is something of a marvel, too. His own prose is done in Catch-22 fashion, making the reader laugh and cringe (Example: \\"Don't interrupt.\\" \\"Yes, sir.\\" \\"And say \`sir' when you do.\\" \\"Yes, sir.\\" \\"Weren't you just ordered not to interrupt?\\")It's amazing that even today the term Catch-22 can be heard muttered by people who don't know the reference from which it originated. Try asking someone what a Catch-22 is and they'll likely be able to tell you, but many probably won't know where the term came from. I think we owe it to Joseph Heller to keep this pun alive, especially with what's going on in the Whitehouse right now.Oh, darn! There I go again. Sorry..."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"There's a war on, everyone is crazy, and none of the airmen who has flown close to the mandatory number of missions seems very happy when someone raises the number of mandatory missions. There's a way out: all a crazy airman has to do is to ask the doctor to ground him. But there's a catch.\\"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.\\"Thus Joseph Heller introduced a new term into the English vernacular. Catch-22 is a view of the world in all its absurdity and contradiction. It's a novel that explores critical issues like war, identity, and the struggle of the individual against bureaucracy run amok--all while being tremendously funny.The story centers around Yossarian, a bombardier trying desperately to save himself; men he knows keep dying because they're sent on one dangerous mission after another in an effort by their commanding officer to show his zeal and to be promoted.Each chapter in the novel is entitled for a character or location in the story, allowing us to focus before moving on to the next part of the story. In this structure, we learn the absurdity of the situation, the apparent inability of anyone to stop the wheels of the bureaucracy, and the success of those who exploit it to their own ends, all while proclaiming themselves to be working for the greater good. (Everyone, after all, has a share.) Then there are the efforts to achieve recognition by the sincerity of the form-letters sent to the families of the airmen killed. And the work of a schemer trying to get his picture the Saturday Evening Post.Some call it bitter or critical of bureaucracy. I call it an honest look at the results of consolidating power. Catch-22 is a brilliant work, well-deserving of its reputation as a classic of American literature, one of the best novels of the twentieth century, a thoughtful commentary that apparently heeds the advice offered by another brilliant explorer of the human condition from a century before.\\"If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you.\\" --Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. The book was very witty and had me laughing several times. The story wasn?t anything special, in fact it was sad, but the author wrote in such a way that that made the book humorously enjoyable. The concept of the catch-22 was strewn throughout the book, and the apparently insane main character of the book, Yosarrian, proved to be one of the few sane characters in the book. I saw two weaknesses in the book. First, there are too many characters. I could not keep track of all the generals, colonels, captains and majors. Second, the book was trashy in parts. These parts of the book were unnecessary and did not settle well with me. With all that said, the book was horrible for being so great."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read Catch-22 on the beach before many a Fijian sunset. The fact that i couldn't take my eyes from the page to admire the surreal postcard display before me has to say something about this book. I stayed up til four each morning because i never wanted to stop reading. This is just ONE OF THOSE BOOKS. Heller's vision is of such a complete story, a beyond-history, where events are visited and revisited and new light is shed on them, but the omnipotent power of the author is felt in the filtering of accurate details throughout. I just found Heller's control over his narrative mesmerising. Aside from this structural point, Catch-22 would be nothing without its characters. I don't remember ever delighting so much in the exploits of so many characters. An entire air-force base, virutally, is evoked in chapter after chapter of brilliant scenes and funny histories.Watch out for: Hungry Joe, Major Major, Milo, Orr, Doc Daneeka, The Chaplain, Sheissekopf, aw heck, i won't list the rest, but they're all good!Particularly relevant now, and in any time of war in the future (sadly, the fact is inevitable), is Heller's portrayal of the madness of war. Anyone can say it, anyone can glorify it, but Heller was actually there. He served as a bombadier (Yossarian, his protagonist, does too). But its not just the war, its any government, any big business, any SYSTEM, which oppresses you, beats you into submission and makes you do its dirty work at the expense of your life love and liberty. The SYSTEM that you can't escape from, no matter what - and as soon as you want to escape, it uses this against you to shackle you back to it again.Despite this, though, like other truly great books, you don't get the sense of being badgered by it. You laugh along with the third-person narrator and you read about characters and story. You don't ever feel that you're getting a book of straight ideas: always a dry, suffocating thing. He isn't telling us a anything, he isn't teaching us anything, he's showing us something - and allowing us to make of it what we will. Heller has made a book with an overriding theme, a satirical novel, but he hasn't written another Bible. He presents a situation, he doesn't pretend to have all the answers. The only thing he knows for sure, is that war doesn't solve anything.There are no words to describe the sort of funny Heller's book is, except maybe laugh-out-loud. I don't remember laughing so much at a book.Like Catcher in the Rye, Catch-22 is a book which will make you feel throughout and after you're finished both happy and sad: happy that a book like this exists, though shocked that it fell into your hands, but sad over the fact that you doubt you'll ever find another as good.If in doubt, though, try Vladamir Nabokov's Lolita and Catcher in the Rye. Remarkable, lyrical, hilarious books are indeed hard to come by."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"On the one hand, Catch-22 may be beating a dead horse under the circumstances that it is trying to convince the reader that not all soldiers serving during WW2 were perfect and that many were trying to escape their duty, but on the no-so-literal side, the book is an amazing insight into the twisted rules of most establishments and organizations, notably and especially those which are \\"American\\".At a surface glance, Catch-22 appears to be about one Captain Yossarian, a navigator serving in Italy during World War 2 who is constantly trying to find ways to get out of combat and return home due to the fact that his commanding officer, Colonel Cathcart, is constantly raising the number of required bombing missions for each pilot. The context of the story follows Yossarian's various crazy attempts to escape the hellhole he is trapped in, as well as the insane antics of the other soldiers in his squadron and the numerous backstabbings and alliances that occur. By the time you reach the middle of the book, you'll be questioning if there is even one sane man in the entire squadron.That is the surface look. When you look underneath that, Heller has taken all the loopholes and injustices of the military and served them up for any somewhat intelligent person to see and therefore to use, in order that they won't get themselves caught up in a net of contradictions and lies, essentially falling into the all American trap of joining the military. (Little did Heller know how many young men would do just that less than 20 years later in Vietnam.)However, that is still not all. Under this second skin of the military lies an even deeper message that goes even beyond how distrustful and wicked the military can be, and that is the horrid truth that establishments all across the globe are using the same twisted procedures and insanely irrational rules to keep those who are a part of it in check. The fact that there is not only one message hidden under the surface of the plot, but an even deeper one embedded in that is truly genius, and I do not use that word lightly.With the universal truth about establishments and their catch-22's (essentially a lose-lose situation), there are also many other messages in tow throughout the novel about the morality, decency, and existence of man. The chapter titled \\"Nately's Old Man\\" serves up a decent argument about war and the ultimate future of America and hereby all nations, and the chilling chapter \\"Snowden\\" brings the entire existence of man into question in a disturbing scene taking place during the death of a soldier on board a plane. Some may view Catch-22 as an irrelevant novel to anyone who wasn't alive in the 1950's due to its WW2 theme and overall plot, but deep down inside, theire is a truth to this novel which has stood the test of time. No true reader of literature would dare pass this up."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Usually I prefer shorter novels, ones in the 200-300 page range. However, at the recommendation of my friend, I decided to give Catch-22 and it's 450+ pages a chance. Looking back, I can't thank my friend enough for this recommendation.Catch-22 follows the people and events surrounding one Captain Yossarian, a World War II bombadier stationed off Italy. All he wants to do is live while, through his eyes, everyone wants to kill him. Even the people on his side are out to kill him. As the number of missions he must fly keeps rising, Yossarian keeps coming up with new ways to avoid his inevitable death.This book is littered with a cournicopia of interesting characters. Each one gets their own chapter (and in some cases, multiple chapters) and Joseph Heller manages to mesh them all together to form an interesting (albeit sometimes hard to follow) plot. At first it seems like the book isn't going to really go anywhere but before you know it, it's there.This book gave me a good chuckle on numerous occassions. Whether it was one of Yossarian's crazy schemes to get sent home or the officers' constant struggle to gain recognition (and promotion), there is never a dull moment."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"...I had heard the term \\"catch - 22\\" for years, and I knew there was a book of the same name. That's all I knew. Then, one afternoon while listening to National Public Radio, probably NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Gross, or Radio Times, I heard one of the guests describing Joseph Heller's Catch - 22 as an exceptionally great American novel. I was almost finished with an Anthony Robbins self-help book when I heard the NPR interview, so I walked to the prison library to check it out. Heller's Catch - 22, a Voltaire-like satire of the military's rigidity had me laughing from page one.Heller uses a dry wit to poke fun at the obsequious, phony interactions between military personnel. As Voltaire's Candid brought to surface the hypocrisy that comes with institutional thought patterns in general, and organized religion in particular, Heller makes readers laugh by bringing his protagonist into contact with his superiors, his equals, his subordinates, and civilians. As a federal prisoner, I live in the midst of the same culture Heller describes. Catch - 22 reminds readers that institutions and the insular culture they propagate cause many of the personnel who work for institutions to forget that we're all human beings and not part of a bureaucratic machine.Heller uses each chapter in Catch - 22 to dramatize another ludicrous episode of military life. We laugh while reading how individuals become blinded by their positions and the power that comes with rank. In several chapters we follow one ingenious military man as he exploits the greed of human nature to build a massive military-sanctioned black market enterprise, the syndicate, in which \\"everyone has a share\\"; enabling them to profit through layered global transactions that frequently deal with war-time enemies. In other chapters Heller entertains us by exposing the insecurities and pettiness of high-ranking officers; it's funny to see those whom the officers belittled and stepped on earlier become direct superiors later in the novel.Heller's Catch - 22 is so powerful that he book's title became a dictionary work defining paradox. It not only made me laugh, but also inspires me as a writer. One day I hope to emulate Heller and Voltaire by writing a satire in the same vein, exposing the absurdity and waste of the criminal justice system in general, and prisons in particular."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The book Catch 22 by Joseph Heller is not like any other book that I have read. Usually when I sit down to read a book and find it hard to stay with I give it up. This book is like that. In the first hundred pages you start off in an Italian Hospital and then you are out in the war and back in the hospital. This book does a lot of jumping around and is hard to get started. I found that after the hundred pages there is a lot of humor and it becomes an enjoyable book.Another reason to like this book is because of the main character Yossarian. He makes this book more enjoyable to read because of how humorous he is. At the end of the book the army tells him that he is free to go if he talks good about what is happening, Since Yossarian doesn't believe in what is happening he runs off and frees himself. He does this because he knows that if others go to war they can die and he doesn't want that to happen.Catch 22 teaches the reader to watch out for higher-ranking people trying to pull a fast one by trapping them in a no win situation."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is a book about a great American bomb squadron during World War II. The book is about what it is like to be an American pilot in another country during the war. Yossarian, who is the main character of the book, is basically a very crazy person just because of all the experiences he has had with war. He has seen so many of his friend die that he does not want to fly on any other missions because he thinks that he will die. He is very nervous as to what will happen in the future, so he basically goes into the hospital so he does not have to go on any other missions. One of the main problems is that the number of required missions keeps getting raised, which means for him that he will be stuck there until he gets them done, but he does not want to go on another mission and refuses.During the book, Yossarian comes up with many plans to help him get out of the war and to get back home. All of the plans that he makes up, always get destroyed because of catch 22. Catch 22 is a kind of statement or rule that the men in the war have come up with for certain circumstances they are put under. Every time he tries to get out of the war, there is always someone or something that is stopping him, and that is the catch. Eventually toward the end of the book, some of the higher ranked men ask him to fly the less dangerous missions, and they will have other men fly the dangerous ones in his place. He still disagrees with this because he does not want the men to be put in a spot where they see the same that he has seen. This is Yossarians main problem in the book. He wants to save all of the men in the war from dying or from seeing the horrible sights of the war that he has seen. This would mean that in order for Yossarian to save the men is for him to fly the dangerous missions. Every time he flies the missions, he is getting more insane because he is putting himself in the places that the other men would die in. This for him is self sacrifice, and that is what is making him so insane throughout the book.During the book, Joseph Heller, the author, does a great job in explaining the circumstances and events that happen in war. He does a very great job in describing all of the characters and how they all feel. He also relates all of the feelings of the characters, to the real life feelings that people would have while in war. The main theme of the story is that Yossarian has to sacrifice himself in order to save the other men in the war. This is the problem, because it makes him more insane throughout the book, but in order for him to save the men, he is forced to choose one of the two things that are put in front of him, and that is the catch. Throughout the book overall, Yossarian has himself caught between two things that are both bad for him. So overall, the theme of this book gives a good idea as to what can happen to a man that is put in the horrible consequences of war. I think that the overall book is very well written, because the author can make the reader feel sad about the war one minute, and happy about it the next, and that is what is so great about the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is the story of a bombardier named Yossarian, who is a frenzied officer in the air force who believes that thousands of people he hasn't even met are trying to kill him, which is somewhat true, but they are really trying to kill everyone. His superiors have no compassion, and like other people of great power believe that Yossarian and other officers are there to serve them. Everyone thinks Yossarian is crazy but the only thing he is crazy about is staying alive. Whatever he does he cannot seem to escape the tragedy of catch-22. This gut-wrenching novel, which attacks the cracks in the dehumanizing military service of WW II, reminds us once again of all that we have taken for granted in our world and should not. This long novel took me awhile to finish but it was worth the effort. Every teenager should read this and find the deep meaning of catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller's novel \\"Catch-22\\" takes place during war. American twentieth century literature that shares with its readers the truthful anecdotes of people's lives in the war. I think that was the best part of the book was the humor and irony. The book brought life in a time of death and war. Even in the seriousness of war, this book manages to poke fun at the craziness of people's lives. It showed how the people that we consider great war heroes are not always as they seem.Here are these great war heroes doing various missions, trying to claim insanity so that they do not have to fly. If it was not for the idea of catch-22, they would all have been landed. Not to mention how many times Yossarian lied he was sick to go back into the hospital. Then there is the great leader Cathcart who freely volunteers his men for missions all the time. There is also the fact that the war heroes of this book are so flawed in their own character. Or when we think of war heroes, we do not think of the trauma people go through in war. Yossarian did not wear his clothes for the longest time bcause he could not handle the blood that was shed on his friends clothes that died during flihgt.Another thing that stood out was the format of the book. Every chapter seemed to have a new character with a new and exciting story. \\"Catch-22\\" really jumped around a lot. Even though it could be a little bit confusing at times, the book still managed to make sense and get its point across It was nice to read to the end and see how everything had come together. Joseph Heller really managed to make every section of the book connect and smooth over in the end."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"A person's enjoyment of &quot;Catch 22&quot; might depend on their current views of the war. Regardless of what those feelings may be, they will most likely be strengthened after reading this book. It is sometimes considered an anti-war book, but anyone who disagrees with that would probably consider it honest and comical. The main character Yossarian is not fond of war. He learns early on that the real &quot;catch&quot; is that a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to participate in the missions, not if he requests to leave. Anyone who is smart enough to request to go home proves their sanity. Yossarian spends the entire novel trying to think of ways to be relieved of his duties. He just barely escapes a couple of opportunities to be sent home, which only adds to the several elements of humor, satire and irony.I read &quot;Catch 22&quot; for a high school assignment, expecting it to be another serious and dramatic book similar to the majority of the works I have read throughout high school. It is basically the opposite. I wish it had be required reading because it introduces elements of humor and irony that many students have not been introduced to in works of literary merit. It evokes many questions, sometimes deep and philosophical, sometimes trivial, of the true meanings of life and war. I would've loved to have many class discussions about this book because each student would have different views and opinions to share.While I don't consider it the best book ever, it certainly is enjoyable. Although elements of war really don't interest me, probably due to current events, I was entertained by the humor, irony and sarcasm, which helped to make many of the character, especially Yossarian, extremely relatable."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"For me, there is something a bit too unlinear about this novel: it seems a compilation of character sketches interpersed with a general &quot;feel&quot; for the military at the time. The pros are: character sketches detailed and funny; and an occasional paragraph of great comedic brilliance, which are SO wonderful that one keeps reading hopeful for the next one. The general anti-military feel for the novel was probably more attuned to the times in which it was written, we having seen in our times how necessary it is to have a military, and the noble sacrifices of military people. On the con side: the dialogue is unlikely in many places; the names of the characters very unlikely (as though pulled out of the too-creative hat); and a style that skims along a little breathlessly, as though punctuation amounted to grammatical error rather - what it really is - the finest point of style. And yet on the whole it is that wonderful, cynical American sense of humor that pulls it all off, just as it does for other American novels, such as Iacovelli's Lily Snow, Cheever's Falconer, and Henry Miller's naughty and otherwise sterile novels."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 for me, before reading it, held a mythic position amongst books. This mainly stems from the fact that my mom gave up reading it at about page 50. From that point on I was determined to read it, to get through it, and to my astonishment, that was not too hard a task. Catch-22 is an hilarious book, one of the most funny books I have ever read, but it goes far beyond that. While reading the novel, the most wide range of emotions will be felt by the reader. You'll laugh at the escapades of Yossarian and his squadron with prostitutes in Rome. You'll fell heartfelt sadness for the dead man in Yossarian's tent, who never even got the chance to unpack his bags, as well as for the memory of Snowden, just a boy who died too young. At times you may be surpirised and confused, but that's the plan. A novel that many consider to be some of the best writing ever done by an American, it does not disappoint. Set at the tail end of World War II, but going beyond pure criticism of the war, Catch-22 will make you laugh, and then cause you to think seriously at what you're laughing about. If your asking yourself whether or not to read Catch-22, condsider what the author himself said about it. When told by a reporter that he had not written anything better than Catch-22, Heller replied simply &quot;Who has?&quot;"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"As a senior in Mercy High School, I have been forced to read many a novel. When I first chose to read this novel I dreaded that I would be preached to on the glory or horror of war throughout my reading. After completing this novel, I can honestly say that Catch-22 is the best novel that I have read throughout my high school career. Joseph Heller lets the reader decide whether war is good or bad and never forces his opinion on the reader. The characters act with human emotions and their reactions are as any real person's would be. Although the stories tend to bounce from one to another, in the end they come together and form a complete story. I was unable to put this book down and wholeheartedly recommend it. This is one book that you will not regret reading."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Just wanted to vote for this as best novel of the second half of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This novel is a brilliant commentary on the absurdity of war, the stupidity of bureaucracy, and the nature of man's existence. Its serious message is told in a comic style, and the chronology ebbs and flows throughout. It is a long novel, but well worth reading through."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Have you ever heard of the phrase \\"Catch-22?\\" This phrase originally came from Joseph Heller's amazingly hilarious novel, Catch-22.Catch-22 is one of the greatest books I've ever read. The protagonist of this tale is Yossarian, a daring bombardier stationed in the Mediterranean during WWII. He is struggling to complete his required missions to finish his service in the Air Force. Each time he comes close, however, Colonel Cathcart raises the number of missions. For Yossarian there is no escape: Catch-22, the sinister rule that resides in the heart of the book, makes it impossible for him to evade his duties. Catch-22 states that any man who flies his missions is crazy, and therefore could be grounded, but only if he asks. As soon as he asks he is no longer considered crazy but sane, and must fly his missions.I highly recommend this historical-fiction novel, but only to those 13 and up because of some mature content. It also can be challenging to follow because it has many subtle flashbacks and big vocabulary words. There are a few themes in this book, but the one that stood out the most to me was perseverance. Joseph Heller has also written a sequel to this book, Closing time.Sitting here and reading reviews won't do you justice, though. So go on, get up and grab a copy of this insanely funny book and start reading!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"A friend recommended this CD to me and it was a great recommendation. Jay Sanders does an amazing job reading this book. He provides interpretation that goes beyond the book and makes the book seem even more ironic and entertaining. Parts are laugh out loud funny. He changes his voice to match various characters and really brings the characters to life. I think his voices and interpretations for Yossarian and Milo are great. The part of the book describing events following Orr's crash landing and the time in a life boat is truly hilarious, made more so by Mr. Sanders's retelling. If you have read the book (which everyone should as it is a bit of genius and a great commentary on the absurdity of life) get the CD, if you have not read the book, get the CD. I think this is one of the best CD versions of a book I have ever heard."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is the greatest novel of its kind. In all of humorist literature no author captures the moments of its characters so fully. All of the characters jump out from the pages with their realistic qualities and depth of construct. The humor follows through serious and tragic circumstances to help the reader realize the ludicrosity of war.This is the great predecessor to the pop-culture phenomenon of M*A*S*H.Not only are you left rolling with laughter at the events of Catch-22 as well as the illogical baseness of military thought, but you are left shaking your head at the parallel of unimaginable events to modern historical events.

If you read this book you will find that it is hard to follow until the last 3 chapters when everything comes together. It would be nice if there was a sequel to Catch 22 since the book ends so suddenly.Yossarian, the main character, was the most fun to read about, he had many conversations and incidents that just kept you guessing. Sometimes the book would focus on different characters such as Major Major Major and Milo Mindbender, but that wasn't to bad since they were also very interesting to read about.You should definitely read this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"For the most part, this book was good. It took me a long time to read, but I eventually finished it. I though the plot line was great, and the characters were hilarious.

The protagonist suffers through one disaster after another barely keeping his life while those around him lose theirs. While it sounds like there is no room for laughter in this book what with the deaths of all his friends, the author just hints at the death scenes which are presented in full towards the end of the book. Thus the end of the book is more serious than the beginning.

Buy it becuase you want to see humor in a crazy situation."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is the story of a fictional bomber squadron on the Italian island of Pianosa. The characters are many and diverse, and their problems even moreso. But wow - this is quite unlike any other novel in the history of American literature. We sympathize with only a few characters, mainly Yossarian and the chaplain, the seemingly only sane characters in the entire novel. Everyone else - all of the generals, majors, colonels, captains, pilots, privates, PFCs, etc. - they are all just a little bit off their rocker, and it can make for such an interesting reading experience. We are being shown the true madness of war - the concept of \\"patriotism\\" and all armed conflict is challenged, because, as Yossarian says, it matters not what side they're on, because both sides want you dead.Sometimes the dialogue is absolutely hilarious when two of these \\"insane\\" characters get together for a conversation. And other times the narration makes you double over and wretch in disgust, (e.g. Yossarian tending to Snowden's wounds and that eventual outcome - if you've read you know to what I am referring). Now I wasn't alive when this was originally published, but I can only imagine the praise that it would have garnered. Nothing has ever so perfectly captured the madness and irrationality of war. And Catch-22, now a part of our national lexicon, was the pretense (in this novel) used by our \\"insane\\" characters to argue their point and keep the men fighting. If you haven't read \\"Catch-22\\", this may be making no sense. I leave you with only an example, because it almost defies explanation. Yossarian is a bombardier who doesn't want to fly more missions (the number to get you a ticket home is continually being raised). Learning of a proposed dangerous run to Bologna, he sneakes into the map room and moves the pins on the map. The next day commanding officers see the map, think that they've taken Bologna already, and cancel the mission.You'll constantly be furrowing your brow, but in the end, as I did, you'll understand what Heller's been saying all along. And you won't ever look at war in the same way."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I credit this book with my newfound enjoyment in reading. I found that although the book has some deeper meaning about the affects of war on the human psyche, for the most part it was tremendously funny. The best relation I can give is that normally when you watch a movie or show that you find funny, you usually don't laugh at loud the entire show, however you still find the jokes funny. This book made me laugh out loud numerous times.

It is also about how much danger there is in our everyday lives and all the truths we try to ignore. Soem may not like the ending, but it reall is perfect. Buy it"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"What can you say about a book that has had so much influence? It's clearly deservedly classic. But it isn't a real pleasure to read, at least not for me. The prose is so dense that you have to read every word. You can never predict where a sentence or a paragraph is going. Heller makes sudden, neck-snapping changes from the cutely ridiculous (like the squadron commander refusing to see people in his office when he's there) to really heartbreaking. The genius of the book is not in the humor, which to me at least started to get old after a while--the genius is in his assault on the bureaucratic mind and the way he captures the feeling of men trapped in the inhuman machinery of war. It isn't the most enjoyable thing in the world to read, but it should be read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22's basic purpose is to show the chaos and stupidity of war. It also shows that wars aren't fought only against the enemy, but against ourselves. They are fought on the bases against clashing egos and people with no sense and those with too much sense. A person who would enjoy this book doesn't have to be just a fan of war novels. A book like this can appeal to a vast number of persons because it is so fun to read. It can also appeal to those who like the unusual and thought provoking.Yossarian is a bombardier who seems to be the wrong person in the wrong squadron. When he censors letters, he cuts about everything out and signs the aliases \`Irving Washington' or \`Washington Irving'. When he presented with a medal, he marches down the ramp naked. But it seems every time Yossarian is close to completing his tour of duty, the mission number is raised by five. While many crews in other squads are going home at 50 missions, Yossarian's group is at 80 and counting. So Yossarian decides enough is enough and refuse to fly more missions. This creates quite a stir between him and his superiors. This creates chaos in the squadron with the threat others will soon refuse to fly. Yossarian offered a deal: He can return back to the states and no one would have known about this or, due to insubordination, desertion, cowardice in the face of the enemy and several other charges, he will be court-martialed. We see various colorful characters throughout the book, including General Dreedle, Colonel Korn, Colonel Cathcart, Lieutenant Scheisskopf, Nately, Hungry Joe, Major ------ de Coverley, Nately's whore kid sister and Major Major, among many others. Not many of these characters have importance to the text. However, some of them make the book more fun to read and others add to the backdrop.\\"The enemy,\\" retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, \\"is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.\\"This quote (Which also appears in the amzon.com review above) is important in that it shows the two sides of which war is fought. For example, the number of missions is continually raised by the squadron's commanding officers, thus increasing the squadron's chances of getting killed. The quote also shows the meaningless of war. Why should you care about who wins if you are dead? Or who is really the enemy in war?I wasn't sure as to what style Heller used. The book is not organized confusingly, but its tone changes throughout. We are presented with thrills, drama, horror and humor. Perhaps this is meant to show how well mixed our own lives are It can be called an anti-war novel, but unlike Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, Catch-22 is a satire. There are some audiences that may not like Catch-22. Like I said, it has varying changes of attitude plus has somewhat explicit content concerning sex and language. Also, the novel has rather large cast of people and not all of them have importance to the story line. Nevertheless, except for romance and possibly mystery, Catch-22 has enough elements to appeal to a wide audience.I have tried to review Catch-22, but I think that no one review can fully comprehend Heller's work. I'm sure that there is some more depth in the novel than I have touched on in this analysis. The novel has to be read and read again and again before it is fully understood. But this is what good novels should do. Catch-22 I liked because I like war novels and because it leaves much to think about. If there is something to dislike about it, it seems to me that the book's end leaves an open gap, possibly for a sequel that never came. Also, at over 400 pages, this is a very long read and takes some getting into. But once you do, the book doesn't stop and delivers in whole. Thus, I recommend Catch-22 (And would give it ten stars if possible) for its anti-war message, its themes about humanity and for the fact it's just so fun."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"If you like a good story, then do yourself a favour and read Catch-22.

Since then I have read it four times over.Yossarian, the main charecter of this book, lives in a perpetual state of sanity which can make any normal, insane person almost dangerously sane.

Beginning the novel on the train from Paris to London, I was laughing almost hysterically all the way to the Chunnel. Then, Heller shows exactly what I was laughing at, and suddenly it isn't funny anymore.The slow trip through Southern England's decrepid rail system was much more somber, and the book went from the best humor I've ever read to the the best novel I've ever read.Finishing it in a London Hotel room three days later, I sat down with my father to joke about &quot;Flies in your eyes&quot; and discuss whether or not there is a better book out there.

I enjoyed the book for its creative style, and humorous situations. What I don't understand is why people must try to look between the lines to find some political motivation behind its humor and satire. The critics need to remember that it is fiction, and only fiction. It is meant to be read for enjoyment. I really enjoyed this book, and I would recomend it to any person who reads for entertainment purposes, and not for political purposes."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 takes everything we look up to and respect and makes us want to spit on it, and vice versa. Chewing gum under the table will be seen an advanced microchip, and a respectful, bright person will be seen as a democrat.This is why I liked this book so much. If I were a character in Catch 22, Heller probably would have turned me into a king.The great thing about Catch 22 is that a man can write a book that makes no sense and has an insane plot and come out with a best seller. I have no idea why this occurs, but I go with the flow and I say Catch 22 is one of the greatest books I've ever read.I recommend this book to anyone who laughs at anything besides your everyday Disney type slap stick humor, and anyone who knows what everyone else hates."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I found Hellers work abysmal. I read it (and bought it) because I'd never read it, and heard from others that it's worth it. They lied. Heller tries to write in much the same manner as Jim Carrey or his progener Jerry Lewis try to act.

I first read it in high high school and loved it and thought I'd take a second look. It still holds up and is still incredibly funny. It speaks of the insanity of war but really comments on the absurdness of life.Heller has created a number of unforgetable characters that continue live on well after putting the book down. The humor in the book and the overall tone of not only questioning authority but ridiculing it make it a joy to read and reread."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Ok, as you've read, I've only read half of the book, Catch 22, but I think that it's wonderful! For those who read this book, I think that you will find it incredibly funny or incredibly weird. In my case, I found it incredibly funny. It is about Yossarian, a bombardier in the war (which one, I forget, hehe), and his life there with INCREDIBLY hilarious friends. I can't wait to finish this book, and I hope that everyone will at least attempt to read it...I'll go finish it now."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The Book Catch 22 by Joseph Heller is novel about a young man named Yossarian who is a bomber in the war. He is a scared, weak drunk who hates being a bomber in the war. He is afraid of dying and does anything in his power to not have fly missions. He faked a liver problem and went to the hospital for a few weeks to just relax, hit on the nurses and talk to other patients. One time he even faked being someone else dying and talked to the guy&#65533;s family just so the doctor wouldn&#65533;t tell that Yossarian wasn&#65533;t actually sick. Heller portrays the whole unit Yossarian is in and everyone he meets to be sort of odd and a little crazy. Most the captains and people of rank are alcoholics and do something to take advantage of their positions in the military. For example Major de Coverly kidnaps Italian laborers and goes to cities to get apartments for officers and enlisted men to go on leaves. The main purpose of these leaves is to visit prostitutes and get drunk. I feel that Heller portrays everyone in the book to be a joke, and I think he shows his feelings about war through these characters.Catch 22 is a good book but a confusing one you need to pay attention to all the characters because they all seem to have a story to go along with them and in some way they connect to Yossarian. Heller furthers the complexity by jumping from character to character and from scene to scene. Catch 22 is a funny novel with a lot of good humor about life and the war."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Judging from most of the reviews here I'm obviously going against the flow, which is bizzare since one of the reasons i decided to read Heller's book was exactly the fact that most reviewers are raving about it. Oh well, there's a lesson to be learned here somewhere.&quot;Catch 22&quot; is considered a classic but in my mind &quot;classics&quot; are books of the caliber of &quot;1984&quot; or &quot;Brave New World&quot; or &quot;The Stand&quot;, books that hold up in time and deliver their message in a way that isnt anachronistic. &quot;Catch 22&quot; does not belong in such an &quot;elite&quot; category.It's supposedly &quot;hilarious&quot; but that's a very emphatic statement to make about humour and, hmm, i hardly laughed with it. Sure, humour is (as are many concepts) just a matter of perspective but from my angle of the world this was hardly enough to make you grin. Another paradox is that many readers claim you &quot;have to be well read&quot; to like this or (even stranger) you &quot;have to read this if you want to be well read&quot;.This is absolutely untrue. What is actually true is that the more you've read the less the chances become you'll be thrilled by &quot;Catch 22&quot; and if you are not &quot;well read&quot; (which is hard to define anyway) &quot;Catch 22&quot; wont add too much to your thinking arsenal except in my opinion the obvious.So what is the obvious here?Heller goes into an overlengthy diatribe to deliver an antiwar message decorated with philosophy bits and some provocative thoughts. While he tries to bring forth the insanity of war he does so by using incredibly underdeveloped characters, a totally ineffective plot (if one can call this a plot) and humour that tries to be subtle sarcasm but fails completely as:-if it's subtle i\`t's so subtle it's almost invisible, and- if it's sarcasm it's so harmless that it causes little concern to its targets.I wont go into the story or the characters as many other reviewers have covered that in 1000s of reviews here. What i will add is this: &quot;Catch 22&quot; is painfully boring to read, it becomes almost a task as you go through the first 50-100 pages and you find the same concepts over and over repeated and what is supposed to be a &quot;storyline&quot; thinnning continuously until it almost dissapears. If all &quot;classics&quot; were like this my take is that literature could easily become mental torture.What i find even sadder is that Heller fails while actually delivering an important message. This only drives home the fact that you might have the right thoughts but this doesnt mean you can express them in a literary way. Heller would be probably better off had he written a straight philosophical book which would have been way more in his element. As it is he takes a shot at literature and doesnt miss as he hits the target head on and the victim expires.All a matter of perspective as i said, but i would advise you to take a good look at both the negative and the positive reviews about &quot;Catch 22&quot; before you decide whether to read it or not. You'll be surprised how completely contradicting they are. Hilarious and boring dont exactly go together. If, however, you do go on and read it dont be surprised if you find that you're forcing yourself through it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Yo Yo Yo, here I go again.

It's kind of tough to keep all the characters straight too, but by the end of the book you will be able to.The book is very illogical and absurd, which is one of the things that makes it so enjoyable, though some readers may find it trying when characters say or do things that they think make no sense.

I can say it still makes me laugh my ass off. I can say I LOVED ALL the characters even those I hated. I can also say I am very happy I got to shake Joseph Hellers hand and tell him how much I loved his book before he died. I wish I had had a hardback copy of Catch 22 for him to sign for me but I got him to do me a paperback. Well anyway I think Catch 22 is a totally wonderful book and everyone should read it. Many times for full effect.And WHO the hell is Christopher Buckley ? I do NOT like to read anything about a book that is not from the author, I will rip that crap right out of the book.

I had seen the movie, and loved it, had heard all kinds of references to the book, and every time i opened it before, there were good sentences in it, the kind that drew you in. So I started reading and was fast disappointed - it's just a series of vignettes, of SNL sketches. It's not a real novel, it's an experimental one, of modernist flavor, where the story is not continuous, where, in fact, the author doesn't care too much about the story: he cares about the process, about showing how clever he is, about dialogue that is witty and absurd at the same time. Was this a disease of the times? I seem to remember Monty Python had similar stuff, the stuff that seems just clever and belabored now, not the stuff that has become classic.I have to confess: I like linear narrative. I read a bunch of the other stuff and it just makes me tired. This jumping around, this collage of happenings just doesn't add up to a good story.I heard somewhere that Heller was much influenced by Jaroslav Hasek (who wrote the Brave Soldier Svejk). I read Hasek, and found him to be much funnier than Heller - but then, again, Hasek was telling a story, whereas Heller is primarily displaying his skill with words."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I am using my mom's account and so this review is by me, not my mom.I read this book for a book project.

The order of events is screwed up to the point that I was strongly tempted to rip out the pages and put them in some kind of a rational order. The \\"humor\\" in the book is really not that funny to be honest. The rare moments of true comedy were so scarce as to not be able to justify this books existence. Any morals or \\"big ideas\\" that you were supposed to get out of reading this book are lost in the nonsensical ramblings that I guess were supposed to be the plot.

For those of us who weren't there, the world came alive. Returning to the book, I could not stop reading because now I had actually seen what terror these men were facing each day. This is a must read for any fan of literature. Naturally some will hate it because of it's comic sense of war, but the utter reality is not gone from this book.

Heller adopts a completly original style for this work. He takes scenes of outrageous comedy and mixes them together with brutal descriptions of violent conflict. The contrast keeps the reader off balance; you never know what to expect next. Heller's amazing talent as a writer comes through in almost every paragraph. His dialogue is believable, sharp, and witty; his word choice is very precise; and his descriptions are incredibly powerful. Perhaps the most amazing thing about the novel is the way that Heller juggles his gigantic cast of characters.So, should you buy &quot;Catch-22&quot;? Here are a couple sample paragraphs. If you find these to be funny, you will enjoy the entire novel.&quot;Major Major had been born too late and too mediocre. Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. With Major Major it had been all three. Even among men lacking all distinction he inevitably stood out as one lacking more distinction than all the rest, and people who met him were all impressed by how unimpressive he was.Major Major's father was a sober God-fearing man whose idea of a good joke was to lie about his age. He was a long-limbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism. He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down. His specialty was alfalfa and he made a good thing out of not growing any of it. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa that he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn't earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major's father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done. He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county. Neighbors sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money a was therefore wise. &quot;As ye sow, so shall ye reap,&quot; he counseled one and all, and everyone said, &quot;Amen.&quot;"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I fondly recall reading Joseph Heller's CATCH-22 during high school. Yossarian, the wise yet trapped bombardier, spoke eloquently about the insanity of war to a generation who grew up watching news reports from the jungles of Vietnam. I was recently shocked to discover youths still read this novel as a rite of passage. My son, a college freshman, has spent the summer reading and discussing CATCH-22 with his girlfriend. As I've listened to their takes on this book, I realized that Heller's masterpiece was not merely a period piece. It remains a solid work that still speaks to the youth of today as it did too many decades ago."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller's Catch-22, is an unequivocal satire on postmodern American life, with messages of dissident revolt that are well suited to the decade in which they appear. Heller is almost systematic in the issues he touches: the frustration of the individual up against powerful and faceless bureaucracies; the anticommunist purges of the Cold War and its smug hypocrisies; and strong antiwar issues that dominate postmodern America. In Heller's works, escaping these traps and inconsistencies of government is essential in the pursuit of moral and self-preservation. After all, \\"The enemy,\\" as Yossarian puts it, \\"is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.\\""},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I started off reading Catch-22 slowly, not really getting into it, but that quickly changed. By the time I hit about page 110, I was hooked. From then on I spent all my free time reading it. This book is not only the best overall of books I've read, but it is by far the funniest. The hilarious schemes concocted by Milo to the hilariously sane logic of self-preservation provided by Yosarian make this book the best. That's all I have to say, read it, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller, in Catch-22, uses mainly humor, horror, and irony to convey his theme that war is irrational. Most of the chapters in this book are very funny. They centre on things that are ludicrous and silly. A great number of things happen in this book that could not and would not ever happen in real life. The characters in Catch-22 though, never notice the absurdities around them, and this contributes to the humor of the book. Heller shows the characters behaving as if everything is fine to show how soldiers in the war are made to do whatever their superiors want them to. Indeed, a major theme of the book is that the individual is powerless to stand against large institutions such as the military or big business. Different characters in the book symbolize the larger forces against Yossarian, the protagonist. Yossarian is constantly being \\"defeated\\" by these institutions, despite his brave efforts to oppose them. Heller also achieves his purpose though the juxtaposition of humor and horror. He will present a ridiculous situation and invite us to laugh at it, and then immediately present a feeling of horror, such as showing us that we are no different than the characters that are behaving so oddly. This juxtaposition is consistent throughout the novel. One of Heller's chief methods of conveying his hilarity and dismay is irony. His dry, cynical, irony fills the book with funny situations and afterwards makes one think more deeply about them. Heller amplifies the absurdities of war to make them impossible to miss. Heller's constant switching back and forth shows the reader that war is definitely irrational."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller successfully utilizes detailed character developement, an extremely sarcastic tone, and a confusing placement of events, in which he jumps from scene to scene in no particular order, in order to create a humorous yet realistic image of war and the politics that surround war. Heller titles many of his chapters after a character in the novel. This proves how important the characters are; rather than center the novel around events, Heller centers his novel around the characters. Which makes perfect sense. War may involve events, but more importantly, it involves people. Most of Heller's chapters also begin with a description of the character they are titled after. The first sentence of the chapter titled &quot;Colonel Cathart&quot;, Heller begins with &quot;Colonel Cathart was a slick, successful, slipshod, unhappy man of thirty-six who lumbered when he walked...&quot; Although how he walks has absolutely nothing to do with any of the major events of the novel, Heller tells us this in order to give a more personal image of Colonel Cathart. Colonel Cathart is a character in the war; he creates the events, the events do not create him. Heller not only developes his characters without leaving out any personal details, but also portrays the war and its charaters with much humor and sarcasm. It is impossible to read through this novel and not atleast smile. I even laughed out loud a few times. The tone may seem incredibly funny; however, the message is very grim. Heller is telling a story of war. The people in this war, as hilarious as they seem, are really very depressing. Every character has their own set of &quot;issues&quot;. Yossarian, for example, loves every woman he sees. If he lives through the war (another &quot;issue&quot;-obsession with death), he will probably have a very hard time finding a mate. These psycological and emotional damages are the ones Heller is attempting to portray. Usually the funnier it seems, the more devastating, realistically speaking, its effects are. Heller also has a tendency to put all of his events out of order. Perhaps this is to show how the veterans of the war see things, or to show that the events really aren't as important as the people. Either way, it makes the novel somewhat hard to follow, but does make us look more to the characters and their feelings rather than the events taken place. As human beings, we like to take the easier route, and following the character developement is much easier than following the confusing plotline, or lack there of. Overall, the novel was incredibly insightful. Most &quot;war books&quot; are very serious, but Heller's light tone makes Catch-22 stand out. However, we must not forget the underlying message. War damages people mentally, emotionally, and physically forever, even after it's over."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The way the logic of the book is twisted into the narrative is awesome- such as Heller's description about one lieutennant being attractive, intelligent, friendly, polite etc. , and therefore everyone hated him.My favorite instance of this logic is the best come-back to the &quot;What if everybody did that?&quot; attack: &quot;Then I'd be a damned fool to do otherwise!&quot;I also liked the &quot;It's better to live on one's feet than die on one's knees&quot; exchange.Read the book, get it: there's enough density, puns, and jokes here that you'll find things you didn't 4 re-readings later!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Book Description: Catch-22 is a tremendous blend of irony and satire. The book pokes fun at the paradoxes of everyday life in the military as it follows the tour of a young pilot, John Yossarian. Yossarian spends his tour of duty going from his station in Pianosa and the city of Rome, where the men meet with Italian prostitutes. While stationed Yossarian has to deal with the loss of many friends and the paradox of the mysterious catch-22, until he finally decides to leave using any means necessary.Review: The satire that Heller uses in Catch-22 is enough by itself to satisfy the reader. However, he also includes an interesting and action-packed storyline that is enough to make any reader enjoy the book. Heller's outlook on life, as expressed by the protagonist, offers a unique perspective on its irony. The use of a mysterious military directive, catch-22, is how Heller describes the irony best. For instance, Yossarian cannot be grounded from flight unless he asks to be due to insanity. However, according to catch-22, asking to be grounded demonstrates an appreciation for life, which constitutes sanity.The only downfall to Catch-22 is Heller's extreme use of stream-of-consciousness, the use of jumping through time as the protagonist remembers events. It is very confusing in the beginning of the book and makes the book difficult to start. However, as the book continues and more events are included, it becomes easier to establish a true timeline, and the book can fully be appreciated for the marvelous literary work that it is."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I have just finished this book for the first time. The message of the book should not be oversimplified. It isn't really anti-war: Yossarian, the author's mouthpiece, does want to win the war and beat the Germans, and as I read it, believes he has a true duty in this regard. It's just that he thinks he has already fulfilled his duty and is (at the time of the action) being played for a sucker. The war is in a declining phase. The outcome is all but certain. The career military people are positioning themselves for the end of conflict, and those anticipating a return to civilian life are positioning themselves to make money. Gen. Dreedle, who is a warrior general (not a buffoon, in spite of the satiric elements), is losing his power to the bureaucratic types as the end of the war approaches. The book is not propaganda on anyone's side; instead, it is a tragic meditation on decay, which accompanies even the most important victories. And it is comic in the best sense, in giving hope that individuals can hold out against that decay. Probably not the best book I've read -- partly because of the dated humor -- but still a must-read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read this book when it first came out. I was a Senior in High School,the Vietnam war was raging and it was what EVERYONE was reading. Its hilarity and cynicism hit everyone where we were most concerned: war, the craziness of authority, and staying sane in a crazy world."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"&quot;Catch-22&quot; is really a great precursor to M*A*S*H, &quot;Hogan's Heroes&quot; and the like. Heller keeps up an impressive and exhaustive comedy through the whole book. Rarely does he get serious, and when he does, he doesn't get out of line. If you don't want to read about crudeness, sex, violence, and---well, reality, then for God's sake don't read this book. &quot;Catch-22&quot; is by no means a careless war comedy about a bunch of aviators who like sex and alcohol and screwing the general's wife (although all three examples are in the book). The plotline and timeline are complex and a recurring, ever-progressing dream of the main character gets more violent and grisly in each episode. &quot;Catch-22&quot; is very clever and complicated. Heller showed mastery of the English language in the way that he was able to maddeningly play off the book and its characters' verbal and oral device's. If nothing else, &quot;Catch-22&quot; is an excellent study in writing technique and conversation."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I love this book.....and I'm not even finished it yet. It's funny, thrilling, and historical.....really enjoyed it"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I've read this book about half a year ago and it was definitely one of the funniest and yet eye opening and myth shattering books i've ever read. The catch is obscure and indefineable but it's there everywhere. I'm in the army and i see people trying to get out yossriain does all the time and get the same answers. The catch is there. I live it every day. Joseph Heller depicted it in great accuracy - after reading it i had to think a lot more about the way i'm going to continue my military service."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I reread Catch-22 after 30 years. This time, a brand new message came to me. Catch-22 is an outstanding metaphor of the business world. If you take a moment and just compare Catch-22 to the way organizations operate, you begin to realize that there are more Major Majors and Dr. Danekas, Hungry Joe's and all the others cast of characters are alive and thriving in the business world today. Substitute the business world and the Catcht-22 world, and it's like taking the roof off of companies and you begin to tealize it exposes disjointed logic and unbusiness ways of doing business. This is a must read for any Business Major and MBA candidate. Read it again and again and once more, new insights will appear."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Well, I haven't got the chance to finish the bookas my wife takes it away from me when I startlaughing as mad - simply this is the onlypossible way to read it. Definitely one of thebest I've read EVER. Recommended VERY VERY much!!!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I was never an avid reader; that is, of course, until I read Catch-22. Singularly the best book I have ever read, I might even go so far as to say that it changed my life. It has always seemed a somewhat ambivalent book to me however. It never entirely takes one side of a subject over another, which accents the absurdity of the war and of the little island of Pianosa.The story itself is mainly about Yossarian, although he isn't completely the main character. He is not a coward, but he is not willing to let himself die (one of the more sensible things I've ever heard in my life!) He is a man of conviction, even if they are the &quot;wrong&quot; ones.Almost everyone around him is crazy, or seems crazy to him. Everyone around him thinks HE is crazy. Yossarian must suffer through one of the worst wars this century has ever seen. He wants to find his way out, but the absurdity of catch-22 won't let him.Catch-22 means that you can never win. A good example of catch-22 (which has now officially entered the English language to mean essentially the same thing) is when Yossarian says he should be grounded because he's crazy. If Yossarian wants to fly, he HAS to be crazy. However, if he wants to be grounded, he has to ask. As soon as he asks, he isn't crazy anymore, because he doesn't want to fly anymore. That sentence I just wrote might be a little hard to swallow and I recommend you read it again.Anyway, catch-22 is always showing up and Yossarian doesn't mind until it wreaks havoc on a little whore-house in Rome.Meanwhile the shocking surprise ending comes around with Yossarians idiot friend, Orr. Unfortunately, I JUST CAN'T give away the ending!!Catch-22 has always been a thoroughly enjoyable book and I've read it five times. It never gets boring and it always exciting and funny. If you don't read this book, you are suffering a GREAT loss. I might point out a quote I once read in a library copy of Catch-22 which said pretty much the following, &quot;You will either LOVE it or HATE it.&quot; Instead of just judging it immediately, read it once and if you hate, then you hate. But you should never forgive yourself if you refuse to read this book!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The phrase &quot;Catch-22&quot; is mostly used by supposedly literate people to convey the notion of circular reasoning. e.g., Yossarian couldn't get out of the war unless he was crazy, but - if he wanted out - he couldn't be crazy. That's one interpretation.As I see it, that wasn't really Heller's point. The real meaning of the phrase, as quoted from the book&quot; was &quot;Catch-22... Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.&quot;Great book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"If you want to know the horror of war, read &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; or &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; or &quot;From Here to Eternity.&quot; Bravery in the service of death. Blood and carnage. The inexpressable sadness of young men dying to validate the decisions of old men who draw lines on maps.But the thing we must remember is that wars have never solved anything -- we keep having them, and the lines just get redrawn -- and young men just keep dying.And that is absurd.&quot;Catch 22&quot; says that: If you want to get out of the next death-defying mission, you must prove that you are crazy, because a crazy person can't be allowed to go on such a mission. But if you try to prove you're crazy (and therefore don't want to go on the mission), you're sane and you have to go.I've read &quot;Catch 22&quot; 10 times, and every time I read it, I find something new to laugh at. As long as I can laugh at war, I think I'm a little saner than the old men who draw lines on maps. I'll keep reading it until I find nothing new to laugh at.After &quot;Catch 22,&quot; Joseph Heller wrote other books that were less than acclaimed. &quot;Something Happened&quot; was greeted with &quot;What Happened?&quot; I don't care -- &quot;Catch 22&quot; guarantees his place in the history of the human race's struggle away from war.I was in Vietnam, so I am almost an old man. I hope I never draw lines on maps. I want to always know what Heller was trying to tell us: War is not horrible. It is absurd."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is tremendously different from most of the other war novels. For one, glory and honor are not depicted as characteristics of soldiers who are in combat. Yossarian isn't exactly on the front line, like Paul in All Quiet on the Western Front, and his ability to go to Rome allows the reader to see that although combat missions are forced onto him, he is still a human being. He is not like a character that is so engrossed in the war whose condition is difficult for the average person to comprehend. Yossarian shows you his life, his inability to ensure himself survival, and the utter irony of war. The novel is captivating and evokes many different emotions: laughter, tension, shock, and sadness. There were many instances when I laughed and at the same time realized the horror of Yossarian's life. Heller's unique ability to illustrate war had a striking effect on me and remained with me for a long time."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This is not a work of fiction but the pure essence of reality. If you've ever been a part of a private sector organization (business), the military bureaucracy, or any federal, state of local governmental agency, then you have some, most, or all of the characteristics of some of the lunatics in this book. Which one(s) depends on who you, in your true self, really are. War is the setting, but this book is based on human organizational psychology. Yossarian was the lone sane person in this story, which is usually the case in real-life."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"At the moment I write this review, it is the 341th one, so there are few chances anybody will read it!Anyway, this book is brilliant, both powerful and hysterically funny. It has been said it's about WWII. I believe it to be more universal, even more than just about war, we delve into dehumanisation and mental insanity here. And yet you'll laugh, I promise, money-back garantee.The book has its own timeline, yossarian's (the main character). I haven't &quot;studied&quot; the structure or printed graphs about it :) but this aspect of the book is just unique, and brings magic to it.Nothing more can be said, you'll just have to read it now, and maybe that's another definition of the now famous Catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Fantastic. A quirky and off-the-wall read. Admittedly, the style took a little while to get used to, and I put it down a few times in the past until I had the patience to become accustomed to the stream of consciousness nature. Once I actually hunkered down and got into the book, though, I was completely rewarded. I have read no other book quite like this, which I mean in the best possible way.Don't expect to necessarily retain much by way of a plot, or to remember all of the myriad of characters that appear. Do prepare to be thoroughly entertained, however. The book is completely unique and hilarious, and is prophetic in the sense that its humor still applies to readers today, some 40+ years later."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"While reading this book, i got a big kick out of Heller's sense of humour. However, i found that it was something i enjoyed as i read, but the storyline was so choppy that it didn't stay on my mind when i wasn't reading it. As things went on, i got the feeling that, for all it's erratic wisdom, the story didn't hold together well, and would soon burst out of its binding, and lie scattered and no longer useful or respectable. Happily, I was very wrong, and the latter part of the book was an ingenius bringing together of the whole crazy plot, and the resolving of the recurring passage throughout the book made for some of the most intense reading i've experienced. Brilliantly pulled off."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 did everything that Joseph Heller wanted. Moreover, it did exactly what a classic should do: it makes you think. Why do we go to war? Why do we kill? Why did we follow the insanity of war that pervaded the twentieth century? I admire Mr. Heller for this. However, what if Hitler and the Nazi's overran the world because the allies did not find the rational to destroy or stop them. It is doubtful that any such book would have ever been written, let alone even discussed. There would be no free speech, no freedom of assembly or of religion - among other liberties. Yossarian would not be able to enjoy sleeping with Sheisskopf's wife because he would most likely be sent to a prison camp to die. And because the world still has a Saddam in control, killing will remain. I enjoyed the book because I am thinking about enlisting, and the book challenges me to consider that which is usually ignored. The author's reasoning forces me to deal with the issue of killing another human and why I would follow orders to do so. In the US and other countries soldiers willingly vow to defend their constitution to death. Can anyone say that all those who had ever enlisted were insane? Thomas Aquinas grappled with the hypocrisies of war, and derived reasoning on Just War in his treatise. Yossarian reflects what is very much prevalent in the twentieth century: the 'let-me-get-mine,' self-preserving disposition. Heller underestimates human character - intentionally or not. His crack on leadership is humorous, but not convincing. In reality, leaders - whether in the military of democracies or in democratic governments - for the most part are sane and intelligent enough to make wise and justifiable decisions. The book is excellent for its provocation. However, one should also take the other extreme. James Webb's Fields of Fire is an excellent novel depicting an USNA graduate as a Marine in Vietnam. The character in the end rebukes all the draft dodgers and protesters at an Ivy League school, calling them cowards and hypocrites for not protecting the same freedoms they were exercising and that other people were willing to die for. In all, Catch-22 either provokes praise or rebuke. The style is its own, as is the content. Whatever the opinion, enjoy the book for where it can take you. (Five stars for content and aim; one star taken away for the laboring style and uneasy transitions.)"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Borrowed and read the book 40 years ago and never qiute forgot it.

The story loosely chronicles his time on the base. But mostly, it's an extended exercise in ridiculing military processes, thought, and actions, and at demonstrating just how crazy war is. The ridiculously exaggerated characters and their foibles make the story. They're so bizarre and chaotically presented as to almost make it difficult to follow -- but the humor is so excellent that it doesn't matter. It's a long book, worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"As the author ofSnaggler's Paradise (Wickedly funny... Mark Rainstone Reviews)(highly recommended) put it, \\"Being crazy is the only sane thing in the world.\\" Joseph Heller's Catch-22 has stood the test of time.

The story utilizes absurdist circumstances and disfunctional characters to portray war, and the American military machine as a \\"damned if you do, and damned if you don't\\" hell where a sane person just doesn't fit in.Some of the passages were laugh-out-loud funny, but overall it was a bit dark and absurd for my tastes."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a great novel that is a lovely satirical work. It involves many characters with extraordinary personalities but the one that it centers around is Yossarian. He is a witty man that is constantly trying not to be killed while serving his duty inWW II. He meets many people and goes trough many trials in this book. One such trial occurs very early on in the book and uses the phrase that yields the books title. Yossarian finds a catch in the system that says that one will be sent home if they are crazy enough not to fly an airplane into combat. The doc tells Yossarian that he must first tell him that he is crazy, and then most have someone vouch for him. Yossarian then assumes that one would be able to be let go if they go through that but the Doc adds one more stipulation. He says that if someone asks not to fly because they are crazy they can't be crazy because anyone that doesn't want to die must be sane. This, Doc Daneeka notes, is a catch-22. The phrase catch-22 actually was put in the dictionary because of this book. If that does not show how important or impressionistic this book was on its time I don't know what will.This book is funny from beginning to end. It shows another side of war. Most books don't refer to the human struggle inside a war but to the battles that the war consists of. Catch-22 uses humor to show how the struggle between one's self and his own people affect him in war. This book shows many people how war can affect someone in more ways than one.I really enjoyed this book and think that it is a must read. One reason that makes this book just a little better than others is the fact that it has been banned. The fact that people actually cared enough about this book to ban it means there has to be something good in it. This book was banned because it refers to women as whores. This book does not dwell on that though. If one really was offended by that they could just as easily substitute another terms such as \\"elegant young lady\\" in for whore. The bottom line is if you want to read a great book that will make you laugh you definitely should read Catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"this is a really difficult book to truly follow- however with much effort, and time, the characters, especially Yossarian, are brought to life and compassionate!

Now, after finally completing Atlas Shrugged (another tough read that took me two tries), picked it up again, read it through and enjoyed the predicament that poor Yossarian finds himself in (how to get out of flying that next bombing run). One recommendation- see the movie of the same name after reading the book, so that you can appreciate the effort that went into making a movie of it...

Through catch 22 clauses, men are unable to fulfill the orders given, defeating the whole purpose of giving orders. Through these clauses, men are unable to satisfy their goals which just turns the situations round and round in the most comedic way.I was intrigued by the amount each character was developed.

The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn't quite jaundice...&quot; It didn't stop and as each character was introduced, and a whole new story was introduced, it got funnier and funnier depicting how ironically stupid the comanding officers are as well as the ridiculous rules that govern the soldiers. Through catch 22 clauses, men are unable to fulfill the orders given, defeating the whole purpose of giving orders. Through these clauses, men are unable to satisfy their goals which just turns the situations round and round in the most comedic way.I was intrigued by the amount each character was developed. Almost all had a chapter dedicated to them and almost all i grew to adore. It was a film in my head, i could fit every character to a role.This book maintains its wonderful humor all the way to the end and i hope that this recommendation helps. it was an incredible book, dont wait, start reading."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I haven't read much fiction since high school and then I was forced to read. But being an avid reader of non-fiction myself, I wanted to turn things around and give fiction another try. I chose as my debut work Heller's Catch-22. I couldn't be more pleased with my choice.The book is just brilliant and very funny. I found myself laughing out loud so many times. Heller has an amazing talent in describing people. By describing someone's appearance and habits it makes you think you have actually met the person, as with the Colonel who was described as someone who uses words such as apogee and panacea.Reading the first one hundred pages or so I felt a little overwhelmed with so many characters. At that point I thought the book was going to be just that, an endless list of characters, but the best was still to come. All the insanity of war is revealed in an outrageously funny and tragic way. I have a feeling folks in Washington DC should be reading Catch-22 right now.It became sort of a tradition among reviewers of Catch-22 to pick their favorite character. For me it's a hard toss between Milo, Orr, and Yossarian, of course; but I pick Orr.Leonardo Alves - Houghton, Michigan - February 2003"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is very funny and entertaining. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys off-the-wall humor with a heavy dose of cynicism. The book revolves around a war but that is hardly the point of the story. The war serves as more of the background that the author uses playfully to get his messages across.The book is filled with very entertaining stories of our hero off to battle, trying to fight his way out. He tries everything only to find that war, and life, are full of catch-22s.Overall, this is a great story that relishes the dark side of humour. I would recommend it to anyone who has a liking to war stories and/or strange stories such as those by Kurt Vonnegut.Side Note: if you are looking for more serious war novels then you should consider the Naked and the Dead by Norman Mailer or the Gathering Storm by Winston Churchill. Both are great books that deal more with the real character of war."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It really is a smattering of all the concepts that makes a great literary work. Bursting at the seams with different themes, I found Catch-22 to be uproariously funny yet awfully saddening at the same time. You can be laughing your head off and pitying the poor soldiers simutaneously.The range of emotions this book displays and yanks right out of the reader is quite impressive. I'm not a fan of war-related books because it's just not my forte - but Catch-22 is definately an exception."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The novel Catch 22, by Joseph Heller is dismissed by many as being a book simply about World War 2, which on the surface, it is. However, after analyzing the novel more thoroughly, one finds that not only does it describe WW2, but it also serves as a social commentary on life at the time. Written in the early sixties, Catch 22 accuratly describes life in the 1950's using Yossarian as the voice of a generation. The novel also does an excellent job juxtaposing the of fear of death with the uncertainty and often times irony in life.This novel is a must read for anyone interested in fifties society, culture, the atomic bomb or the second world war."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"At first this book puts off because it is so clever and cynical. The whole 'madness of war' concept has been covered so often that the book seems stale (though this was one of the first modern American books with this theme). This cynical and clever criticism appeals maybe to self-centered young men but it was tiresome. However the humour is genuinely suprising and the book starts to have some heart about half way through. Not everyone is an idiot and there are some nuanced portrayals of more complex characters.So read it for the wit, but unless you've never read anything of the genre (i.e. anti-war novels), don't expect any fresh insights."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 was written by Joseph Heller who served as an Army Air Force bombardier during WWII, which seems obvious since some of the information described seemed like it could only have come from someone who actually was there and went through the war.Rule Catch-22 seems to be a lose lose situation. You can be discharged from duty during war if you are insane. But Catch-22 points out that only people who are insane would participate in war to begin with, so if you know you should not be participating in it, then you're sane, and thus have to serve.John Yosarian the main character reminds me a lot of Corporal Klinger from M.A.S.H., (I'm sure that that T.V. show had to have used this book as a model, if not intentionally, then at least subconsciously), but unlike Corporal Klinger who is trying to get a section 8 to get out of the war because he's lazy, Yosarian is trying to get a section 8 to get out of the war to save his life. It's not as funny when you put it that way.This book was quite an emotional roller coaster ride. It's full of sarcasm which I like, but it's Joke, Joke, Joke, and then someone dies. When that happens I didn't know whether I was supposed to laugh or cry.Then just when you get used to this type of format it changes to the reverse where it touches upon a really sincere issue, and then hits you with more satire to follow it up.The tension in the book keeps mounting and mounting as the number of missions a bombardier needs to fly to qualify to go home keeps mounting. You find yourself routing for the character just to survive.It's full of lot's of irony, and all of the characters are wonderful. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I'm sure each one of them represents some part of his psyche. Overall it was a very good book.P.S. A movie based on the book came out in 1970."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Heller's Catch 22 is the funniest book I have ever read, but it is also a surprisingly tragic story.The plot (about a bombardier named Yossarian who wishes desperately to find a way out of fighting in WWII) is not truly concrete, and the entire book is mostly a study in character. The conflicts of John Yossarian's various friends and foes are explored, and the ineffectiveness of bureaucracy is mercilessly satirized. Here's an example of the trademark wit and absurdity that characterizes Catch 22:\\"They're trying to kill me,\\" Yossarian told him calmly.\\"No one's trying to kill you,\\" Clevinger cried.\\"Then why are they shooting at me?\\" Yossarian asked.\\"They're shooting at everyone,\\" Clevinger answered. \\"They're trying to kill everyone.\\"\\"And what difference does that make?\\"A great and memorable book, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read this a few years ago as a freshman in High School. It was just as good as I remembered, and it remains as my favorite novel."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I'll be brief since there are so many reviews already out there: I have never read a book that can match this one in terms of characters, dialog and writing style; it is both immensely entertaining and profound."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Before writing a book review, I always attempt to determine what the intent of the author was and how successfully the desired effect was achieved. So what, exactly, is the purpose of Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22?\\"Is it to provide a biting satire of the reputed leaders of the Armed Forces? Is it to illustrate the dehumanization of war by a blind bureaucracy? Is it to entertain us with a dark comedy and clownish, cartoonish figures like Colonel Cathcart? Is it, perhaps, to parody the excesses and extremes of capitalism and communism through Milo's syndicate? Is it to illustrate the horrors of war in graphic detail? Is it to convey the inevitability of death and futility of escaping your ultimate fate? Or is it simply an exercise in paradoxical reasoning and illogical logic?The answer, of course, to all of these questions is yes. Heller has delivered a masterpiece of a novel, one that works on many levels. His unorthodox methods prove triumphant in the end. Through light comedy, absurd logic, and haunting flashbacks, Heller presents a war, which may be fought for idealistic purposes, but is executed in an arbitrary and self-defeating manner, whose only glory lies in the odious commanders. Although this is not an anti-war novel, it certainly criticizes how the war is fought.Catch-22 could be divided into two parts. The first 2/3 of the book provides a circular timeline, as the non-sequitur chapters help to paint a vivid picture of the lives of Yossarian and his comrades. At first, only minor details are revealed. As the chapters progress, though, the details are filled in, like an intricate jigsaw puzzle, and the reader is left to ascertain the meanings of earlier, cryptic inferences and allusions. In these chapters, a light comic mood prevails, interrupted periodically by such accounts as the siege of Bologna. Indeed, some of the chapters are high-comedy. If M*A*S*H wasn't inspired by this novel, it sure borrows some of the same comic elements. However, Heller reminds the reader that there is still a war going on, as death and destruction come into the forefront periodically. The last 1/3 of the book provides a linear timeline and marches incessantly toward the final climax. In these chapters, the mood turns much darker and sinister, as the deaths pile up and the humor dissipates.Heller provides a portrait of each of Yossarian's comrades in the squadron. Some, are comical and absurd, such as the enigmatic Major Major, who only allows people inside his office when he is out of the office. Some are idealistic and sympathetic, such as Clevinger and Nately. While others are boorish and brutish, such as Colonel (take your pick). However, the narrative is told from Yossarian's point of view, so, although we are never told specific details about him, the reader can delve into his mind and discover the kind of person he is.Overall, Heller delivers a masterpiece. Catch-22 provides an entrancing, enthralling and interweaving narrative of details and ideals that paints a glorious picture of a war-time bureaucracy gone amok. If you haven't read it yet, please do. And if you've already read it in high school or college, read it again."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"There was only one catch, and that was Catch-22....Catch-22 is a book detailing the life and times of John Yossarian, and how war changes his life and his way of appreciating life.Yossarian, a bombardier in WWII, is constantly faced with the threat of death , when all he wants is to be immortal, or die trying. He is a quirky, witty man, and Catch-22 is full of humor, but one of the great things about this book is the range of emotion expressed by the soldiers. Although they are proud men serving our country, they are also trapped in a powerful bureaucracy focused on nothing but celebrity. Although they should have been commended for their bravery, they were thrust into the most dangerous missions for the most pointless of reasons: aesthetically pleasing bomb patterns.One of the main reasons you should read this book, however, is for the flashbacks of Snowden. It's a powerful scene that stays with the reader, with vivid description and detail. You feel like your're there with Yossarian and clueless as to what to do about a dying gunner on your plane.But more than anything, this part, along with the entire book, leaves the reader with a new perspective on death and war. War can be a corrupt system, with people supposedly hating people from foreign countries they have never met, and supposedly being friendly with those on their side, when it can be entirely the opposite. War can send young and old to die, and war can drive men crazy. But most of all, war changes a man, as Catch-22 shows.So if you're considering reading Catch-22, don't think twice...but do it. It's a book you'll never forget, and won't regret reading."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It is of the essence of every great piece of literature that at least some portions of the story do not make any particular amount of sense.This entire book is like that.Catch-22, in a nutshell, is one of the most bizarre, nonsensical, BRILLIANT books you are ever likely to read. The book is described as being the epitome of insanity because it is about life, an insane state of being. Catch-22 is a documentary of society and the pointlessness of war, but makes it points in such an odd fashion that the book may be lost on those without the cranial capacity to live as humans and who are instead content to live in sewers of humanity with only its dregs for companionship.But don't take my word for it. Read it yourself."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Is there anything new to say about this American classic? All of the cliches and superlatives apply. This is one of the most brilliant and darkly entertaining novels I could imagine, a true masterpiece. It has been my favorite novel since I was in high school, and it stands up to re-reading very well. I read it recently and was amazed at how different the experience was from the first time almost 20 years ago. As a teenager, I was struck most by the comedy. But now, as a 30-something military veteran and attorney, I focused more on the cynicism. It wasn't as much fun this time around, but every bit as provocative and interesting. Overall, a brilliant book that belongs on the universal \\"must read\\" list."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is a novel that is and deserves to be a cornerstone of american literature. Author Joseph Heller uses exelent literary elements unfolding the random series of events and happening that keep the reader waiting to turn the next page.though the book contains confusing themes it is incredibly humorus.all in all catch 22 is a great novel and one of my personal favorites, but is is a book that you have to read it cover to cover to fully understand. that means no flaking out on this one."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"When I first picked up Catch-22, I was hooked by its immediate sense of confusion and hysteria. These themes seem to saturate the book, creating a satirical, memorable novel that points out the senselessness of war. The renegade bombardier, Yossarian, consistently attempts to rise above the rule of Catch-22 and return home to the States. Yet Colonel Cathcart continues to raise the number of missions, causing Yossarian to come up with different ways of rebelling, whether he decides not to wear a uniform, or asks Doc Daneeka to send him to the hospital.The novel not only talks about the ridiculousness of certain customs in war, but the tragedy caused by war. Every soldier risks his life on every mission he flies, hoping that he will survive just this one so that he can be one step closer to going home. Towards the end of the novel, Yossarian walks through the dirty streets of Rome, where he contemplates the state of the world.\\"What a lousy earth! He wondered how many people were destitute that same night even in his own prosperous country, how many homes were shanties, how many husbands were drunk and wives socked, and how many children were bullied, abused or abandoned.\\"Catch-22 left me with an understanding of the fruitlessness of war. Every wacky character's seemingly senseless actions culminated into a grim picture of the war front.

I can see how it would strike other people as brilliant and how they would think it was the best novel ever made, but it just didn't hit me like that. I had trouble getting absorbed in it. There were multiple passages that I really liked: the first chapter was great, after that it was a little sloggy, but the second half, especially toward the end, became quite good. My favorite passage was at the end, when Yossarian's walking down the street in Rome at night and observing...And I love Orr. But I don't know, something was just missing...still, I can recognize that it is a well-written book and therefore give it four stars. Maybe I'll try reading it again, several reviewers seem to think that will make you love it..."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book came highly recommended. It lived up to the recommendation.

Thank you Mr. Sampselle."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is an extraodinary book, it has its own flow and character.

Part way into it I realized that this book was never meant to be serious. It is also not a war story. It is about the characters and how each and every one of them deals with the seriousness of war in their own way. I thought it was a hilarious book that can be read again and again. For anyone who did not like this book I urge you to give it another try. Read it for the characters. Each one is crazy in their own way and that is how they avoid becoming crazy from the seriousness of war.

This is my favourite book of all time, and I think that everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"If Saving Private Ryan is the greatest war movie ever made, Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is the greatest war novel ever written. It combines the horror of All Quite on the Western Front and the dry humor of a J.D. Salinger novel. The anti-war message is all too clear in this novel. It is not underminded like The Thin Red LIne or The Naked and the Dead, but full in your face. The sorrowful character of Yossarian makes you hate, pity and enjoy his company all at the same time. The assorated cast of characters will leave your head spinning but enriched at the end."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I both pity and envy the person who has not yet read this book.

It also has serious undertones and brings up interesting questions, but even then it never fails to get a laugh."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 started off incredibly witty and profound and well, good. But after the first few chapters the humor gets old and repetitive, and towards the end of the book the humor was either no longer there or I no longer found it even mildly amusing. I had to force myself to finish the book and it took me weeks. The book also wasn't very action-packed. Don't get me wrong, I liked the book, and I thought it was somewhat insightful into war and human nature, but after awhile I found it to be tiresome and worn out. I'd recommend it for the first few chapters alone, and some of the characters are hilarious, but expect redundancy."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"It took me a while to get into this. And the humor was the only thing keeping me going throughout, that and how it's juxtaposed with these scenes of war-induced brutality and human venality. Heller moves, often disorientingly, between the two. We get a a really funny exchange between army officers, then an incredibly tense, well wrought depiction of a bombing run over an Italian city. It definitely stretches between the psychological extremes of (what I infer from what military people tell me) what it feels like to actually be in a war. You have these long moments of dull, bureaucratic stasis and personal malaise, punctuated with brief moments of \\"oh god oh god oh god oh god they're shooting at me oh god oh god oh god I'm going to die here\\".I guess this seemed like a powerful indictment of authority circa 1961, and in a lot of ways it does antedate a lot of what the sixties was about. I guess if you're a baby boomer, it probably does seem like an unqualified masterpiece from your youth. For a young adult in 2010, not so much."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"with little time to read the book, the cd's let me listen in the car in between class and not keep me locked in once place reading."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is difficult to review because it swings between funny anecdotes and horrific descriptions of war. There is also much extraneous material to slog through which makes it a long read. The tone is reminiscent of the television series M*A*S*H, or since Catch-22 came first, maybe it is the other way around. In any case it is an interesting book but a classic it is not. Stick with Tolstoy, Hemingway or Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This was the third time I read Catch-22 by Joseph Heller and everytime I read it I understand it better and better. The first time I read it, I was about 17 years old living in Russia. Anything American was good. The book was translated into Russian but somehow was not very popular. No one could really understand what it was all about. If it was about the WWII, it was at least strange. If it was an American humor, there was nothing to laugh about. It was not funny to bomb your own planes. And how could a captain walk around naked? Tomatoes, prostitutes, the CID men, crazy officers and nurses... People did not like it.Than I came to America and a few years later, I saw this book used, somewhere, and just for 10 cents. I could not resist. I read it again. I could speak some English back than but I guess it was not enough to understand the full depth of Catch-22. I liked it better than before, in Russia, but still not enough. It was just OK.A month ago, I was making more room for books in my house. Books, I did not care much about were destined to end their lives in the local library, as my donation. Catch-22 by Joseph Heller... I opened it again. What a mistake. What a surprise. I was stunned. It was one of the best books ever written. One has to know not only the language but the life in America and the Americans as well to understand this book completely. This book is not about the war. This book is about us and our lives and our regular affairs. This book is perfect and has to be an American classic. No, Catch-22 did not go to the local library. It is destined now to end its life on my shelf. I will have to read it again and, only than, again and again. Have you read it? You have to read it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book had me failing in my attempts to suppress the laughter that it often evoked from me.Set in an aviation squadron in World War II, the characters' ambitions and actions are directly applicable to modern corporate America.I just finished the novel and was glad to do so. Part of the reason for this is that you never know what to expect in the novel, especially in two chapters that I won't forget any time soon and probably never will. They weren't my favorite chapters to read, but without them the novel wouldn't have near the impact. These chapters are for you to discover.If you figure out what ever happened to Major Major Major Major, let me know."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I've never read a book that was so ironic, funny and confusing like this one.

No one should live out their miserable little lives without being able to say, &quot;I've read Catch-22.&quot; This is a true literary masterpiece, a classic through and through, a book so superior I should be ashamed to even try critiquing it. Joseph Heller shows himself a true master of the English language in this spellbinding satire, his look at the nonsense surrounding the logic of the American military system. Catch-22 is brought to life by a remarkably diverse cast of characters, all of them interwoven into a plot that unfolds and comes together with relentless perfection. Heller lets us see not only through the eyes of his main character, the paranoid bombardier Yossarian, but gives us a glimpse inside dozens of other vivid personalities, plunging us into their thoughts and dreams and hopes and fears and desires. Their stories, told with such a sarcastic and surreal edge, go far beyond the bounds of outrageousness, yet the unarguable truth they represent holds the potency of a maxim. Catch-22 is guaranteed to grip you, entertain you, and astound you. Its story is certainly complex, but so profound as to leave you recalling each and every detail as an individual climax. This book never slows down, never settles into boring normality, and is never to be forgotten by me, nor by a lot of other people -- I'm sure -- who have had the gift of opportunity to be exposed to such magnificent literature."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Thirty years ago this summer after my freshman year of college I started to read Catch 22. Everyone was reading Catch 22. I don't really recall why, but I never finished it. This summer I picked up the book on tape because my high-school daughter was assigned to read it. I'll finish it this time, but now I know why I left the book unfinished that summer. Reading it is turning into a chore.I question whether this book holds up as a classic. True, there are plenty of moments of biting satire and superb black comedy. and yes, the phrase Catch 22 did enter the language and that concept is brilliant. But the book is 400 pages of the basically the same thing over and over. There is virtually no characterization -- Heller is incapable of it -- and not much of a plot either. One cannot keep the characters straight; they all blend together. Yes, it is about war, but Heller/Yossarian really comes across as a misanthrope -- everyone in his world is weird and worthless. I don't want to spend more time with any of them, but I've got two-thirds of a book to go. Voltaire did something quite similar to Catch 22 in Candide, but he kept his story to about 100 pages. Heller probably should have done the same."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I decided to fill in the gaps of my knowledge of classic American literature--I didn't grow up in the US, so I hadn't read most of the books US students would have read in school. I was scratching my head over this book after several chapters and gave up on it after several more. It seemed to me that at the time it was written, the book may have been a powerful anti-war statement and perhaps an example of a writing style that hadn't been seen before, but I found it very dated, lacking context, and little more than a sequence of caricature vignettes and slapstick devices. Maybe I failed to appreciate it because I'm not American, though I have a decent knowledge of US history and I've been living in the US for more than a decade."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Hellner's &quot;Catch-22&quot; is not the most intresting book, however, it does bring up important &quot;fears&quot; that society even today faces. For example, the fear of death is throughout the book and Yossarian has a tough time dealing with it. On a positive note, Hellner's characterization was intresting. He made simple &quot;average-joe&quot; characters stand out and have a role."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"'Catch-22' is a pretty famous book, so you might think you need to read it to be &quot;well read&quot;. Don't. If you read more than 20 pages you will just be wasting your time.

It made me laugh out loud several times. The people that find the plot hard to follow, as Heller jumps between time periods, are just stupid.

I just loved it. This one is a keeper. It gets funnier every time you read it. I've read it at least four times, and can't get tired of it. Definately deserves to be above Brave New World in the top 100 list. Keep in mind, in Chapter 39, the definition of Catch 22 is &quot;They have the right to do whatever we can't stop them from doing.&quot; That stands out better than Doc Daneeka's, but that seems to stand out."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"There is no author that can write a book as compelling both comically and dramatically as Joseph Heller does with Catch-22. The pop-culture, counterculture classic reflects the down and out 1960's through WWII. The look of the world through Yossarian's eyes is hillarious at first, but at second thought-sad. The fact that he believes everyone is plotting to kill him reflects the horror of war. If you do decide to read it, beware. It starts of with a rocket, and the first 100 pages are the funniest of the book. After that, it slows down in the middle, and is a lot more meaninful. But around the 220s the book gets going again and countinues to be funny and horrific. The passage of with Snowden, especially. Bravo Mr. Heller."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I read this book for a Grade 13 high school essay and it is extremely captivating. Heller builds each of the many characters so well it is like you know them personally. His detailed filled pages make you feel as if you are really there. Feel Major Major Major Major's pain!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is absolutely a brilliant book. Everyone should read it, whether they like historical literature or not (I don't in particular). Give it a chance! I loved it. You'll meet some hilarious characters, and it's unlikely that you couldn't relate to one of them. I, personally, saw a bit of myself in the chaplain."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"catch-22 has the cleverest and funniest dialogue of any book I've ever read.

A Masterwork of structure and storytelling. Reading it will change the way you see things."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I have a good sized knowledge of WWII history, and have read many other books about it, but this is something totally different. It's child-like humor in an adult setting tells a great story in itself. To write a novel about a B-25 Mitchell crew member, but having most of the story take place on the ground, while still having a convincing story shows just how great of an author Heller is. Its a great book to read any time. I'm only 14 now, but I still gave a good 8th grade book report on it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I'd like to submit my vote for Catch 22 as the greatest English novel of the last 100 years. Heller's masterpiece rewards repeat readings, as he's developed a rich list of characters who you can never forget. I didn't first read the book until early this year--when I was 28 years old! It's now become a yearly mainstay--a novel I intend to read over &amp; over again. Read this book now."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a great novel that is a lovely satirical work. It involves many characters with extraordinary personalities but the one that it centers around is Yossarian. He is a witty man that is constantly trying not to be killed while serving his duty inWW II. He meets many people and goes trough many trials in this book. One such trial occurs very early on in the book and uses the phrase that yields the books title. Yossarian finds a catch in the system that says that one will be sent home if they are crazy enough not to fly an airplane into combat. The doc tells Yossarian that he must first tell him that he is crazy, and then most have someone vouch for him. Yossarian then assumes that one would be able to be let go if they go through that but the Doc adds one more stipulation. He says that if someone asks not to fly because they are crazy they can&#8217;t be crazy because anyone that doesn&#8217;t want to die must be sane. This, Doc Daneeka notes, is a catch-22. The phrase catch-22 actually was put in the dictionary because of this book. If that does not show how important or impressionistic this book was on its time I don&#8217;t know what will.This book is funny from beginning to end. It shows another side of war. Most books don&#8217;t refer to the human struggle inside a war but to the battles that the war consists of. Catch-22 uses humor to show how the struggle between one&#8217;s self and his own people affect him in war. This book shows many people how war can affect someone in more ways than one.I really enjoyed this book and think that it is a must read. One reason that makes this book just a little better than others is the fact that it has been banned. The fact that people actually cared enough about this book to ban it means there has to be something good in it. This book was banned because it refers to women as .... This book does not dwell on that though. If one really was offended by that they could just as easily substitute another terms such as &#8220;elegant young lady&#8221; in for .... The bottom line is if you want to read a great book that will make you laugh you definitely should read Catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22, a great satirical work, presents many characters with extraordinary personalities, the most important of whom is Yossarian.

This book will be able to make you laugh about some very serious issues that effected people during WW II.One reason that I recommend this book so highly is that it has been banned. The fact that people actually cared enough about this book to ban it means there has to be something good in it. This book was banned because it refers to women as whores.

While is is a great study into the insanity of war and has many truly hillarious moments, this book just doesn't flow. You'll be reading about Yossarian's present problems and suddenly you will be reading about some incident that happened in the past, and there won't be so much as a transition, then you will be right back to the present. This is why I gave it 4 stars.On the other hand, this is an excellent satire on war and its insanity, and is laugh-out-loud funny. The book follows a crazy bombardier named Yossarian who is uncanny for pointing out paradoxes and contradictions in the modern psyche. Yossarian wants to get out of the war, and he pursues several avenues, but is thwarted on one end by a neurotic, brown-nosing Colonel Cathcart, and on the other by the melancholy, and also neurotic, Doc Daneeka, who will not allow him to get of by reason of mental defect. I wish I could post a funny line that had me laughing, but there were really few individual lines like that. Mostly there were exchanges between Yossarian and the people he meets. This book is not beach reading: you have to really concentrate to see what's going on. But it was a fine read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Laugh out loud funny at times, Heller's catch 22 will bring you quickly through an otherwise unfunny topic. Irony is dripping from every page, as Heller twists and turns the absurdity of war and the associated absurdity of the political aspect of war into one massive reality check. A fantastic read. As far as the actual book itself, as with all everyman's editions, the quality of the book is first rate."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I was told to read Catch-22 as a summer reding assignment, and was not looking foward to it at all, but his may be one of the best books I have ever read!

I reccomend this book highly!!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is particularly hilrious for anyone who has ever been in the military. I finally read this novel almost a year after getting out of the Army, and could not stop laughing.Some of the characters ring so true it is almost eerie, though funny. Pompous officers who care nothing for their men, but are willing to &quot;sacrifice&quot; to win the war, when the only true sacrifice comes from men like Yossarian, who they so readily send into harm's way for their glory - oops! I mean to win the war.There is the war profiteer who sees no wrong in scr**ing his buddies as long as he makes out OK. There are the multitude of characters who, one way or another, are war's hapless victims. This is one of the greatest anti-war novels ever written, because it gets its message across with subtlety and humor.An excellent read and an American clasic."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"A classic mixture of hilarity and horror.

It shows how crazy war really is, and how crazy people can be. The characters in the book are like friends of your own, you know them like you have for years.

The individual character voices are easily identifiable and very entertaining. I listen to 1-2 audio books each week and this one stands out as my favorite. Whether you are familiar with the story or not, I highly recommend giving the audio version a listen."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"In becoming the 310th person to review this book here I understand the unlikelihood that I will say anything that has not been said before. I write this however because all that can be said about this book deserves to be said and is worth saying again and again and again. &quot;Catch-22&quot; is a monumental creation, the product of a brilliant inspiration that does not recognize itself and such and thus plays things out on its own terms, without pandering or pretention. I believe that this book came about simply because Joseph Heller had a unique vision and chose to record it. It just so happens that what was unique about Heller's vision was his ability to view the true madness of the world and then distill that madness into images and words, recording his viewpoint with shocking clarity.I will not deny that the presentation is ludicrously over the top. What I will argue is that this book could have been written in no other way. Heller saw the world in general, and war in particular, as irredeemably absurd. To be honest then Heller had to paint an absurd picture, and make sure that it could not be mistaken for anything but absurdity. It follows that the presentation should be equally absurd. This is only one way in which which Heller give the finger to conventional literary wisdom. &quot;Catch-22&quot; was written to defy socio-political conventions and it would be hypocritical to adhere with any closeness to conventions of the arena in which he chose to make his stand.Two common criticisms of &quot;Catch-22&quot; are that it lacks a strong plotline and that it is too long. The first criticism is perfectly legitimate. &quot;Catch-22&quot; not only lacks a &quot;strong&quot; plotline, it comes very close to lacking anything that could be considered a plot line at all. Why, I ask, should Heller have sacrificed his ideas and vision for the luxury of a fabricated plotline? One of the major themes of &quot;Catch-22&quot; is the pointlessness and circularity of war, indeed, of life in general. It is only one more example of the integrity with which &quot;Catch-22&quot; was written that Heller chose to structure the novel in a way that would reinforce the that theme. Who needs a plot, anyway, when the theme is so strongly evident and so soundly delivered. As for the length, I don't think heller could have encapsulated the enormous scope of this book in any smaller framework. Once one gets into &quot;Catch-22&quot; it becomes an intoxicating, encompassing, and overwhelmingly enjoyable reading experience. Dealing with the length of the book is not a problem when it is enjoyed as thoroughly as I enjoyed it. It also allows for repeated readings, as one can crack it open at almost any point and read on indefinately, find fresh enjoyment and enlightenment in each page. &quot;Catch-22&quot; was brilliantly concieved and delivered and will be just as convincing hundreds of years from now as it is now."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I have read this book many times over and I never tire of it. This is one of the greatest novels in the history of the United States, at least in the last 100 years. It is a roller coaster and the sarcastic and wild characters come to life more than some of our own lives. This book should be read by everyone because although it is first seen as a comedic story, it is serious in its ability to show the problems with the world. Colonel Cathcart just wants to get ahead in the army and only wants a raise. Milo wants to become rich beyond his wildest dreams and Yossarian just wants to live. This novel has inspired me, myself to write a novel, which I am currently in the progress of. Hopefully, Catch-22 will do the same for you."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is probably one of the best books I've ever read. It's a hilarious satire on the insanity of war and bureaucracy. However, the book can be rather hard to follow at times because of the way that Heller moves back and forth. The book is not organized chronologically either. It is organized more through important events regardless of their place in time. The flashbacks kept me on the edge of my seat, however, because of the fact that only a small amount was revealed every time a situation was referred to, until finally the whole scene is revealed. The book evolves from a comedy to tragedy throughout the story, such as Yossarian's trips to the hospital. Which eventually grow from silly made up illnesses, to serious life threatening ones."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"As anti-war propaganda, this book is pretty good. All Quiet on the Western Front was better, but not nearly as funny. That's where Catch 22 excels. The book did not convince me that there is nothing worth fighting or dying for (remember the Holocaust?) but it does make you question why you are fighting and whom or what you are fighting for. Heller has incredible wit and humor, and if you can get past the overwritten prose (seems like every other word is an adjective) you'll find some real gold here."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Awesome book - the funniest book about the saddest topic that I have or ever will read - Everyone should read this - especially if you are, have been or will be in a bureaucracy (read - everyone)"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"&quot;Catch-22&quot; is a work of unquestionable brilliance. That said, there are many reasons why you may not want to read it. First, if you have succumbed to the mass-market myth that all good pieces of fiction must have a contrived, cookie cutter plot, which yanks whatever characters therein around like chess-pieces, this is not for you. Second, if you have a short attention span and prefer to read fiction that skims along at reckless speeds and never dips below the surface of anything, this is also not the book for you. Finally, if you think that all fiction should be filled with ridiculous gravity and straight-faced stupidity and don't understand the concept of satire, this book should be avoided at all cost.If you do not fall into one of the above categories - READ THIS BOOK! It will be one of the most delightful experiences of your life. It is a long book and effort is definitely required to read it, but &quot;Catch-22&quot; rewards ever ounce of effort. Almost every page is packed with a new, fresh and challenging scenario, one which tackles the issues Heller deals with head on. The beauty of Heller's razor sharp wit is that it cuts down the very heart of the matter, clears away the distortions of emotion and preconcieved opinion, bringing everything into perfect focus.This is no normal piece of fiction. Many of the characters are faceless and nameless, puppets playing their role in Heller's elaborate production. They are symbols, as are the sometimes fantastic setting and always fantastic scenarios. That is Heller's point. He had no interest in writing a typical piece of fiction, the kind that could be easy consumed, digested and disposed of. This is a book that takes control of you and doesn't let go, not even after you've put it down. This is a true original, a true work of art."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I've read a lot of books, and i must admit that this is the best one!

It's funny. It's sad and terrible. His vocabulary is huge. The man can write. His story moves. The characters are insane and know it, at least some of them.

I really enjoyed this book and wholly recommend it for those willing to give peace a chance."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"In Catch-22, Joseph Heller created a hero, Yossarian, who will go down as one of the great heroes in history becuase he is adamantly unheroic. If that seems like a paradox, it is, but it is only one of many in this hilaroius novel. This book is considered to be a stylistic masterpiece becuase Heller creates huge, laugh-out-loud funny moments by describing everyday situations in a way, and with a certain tone, that makes them seem ridiculous. Everything from standing at attention to picking up prostitutes while on leave is funny in this book, and the truly amazing thing is that Heller does all of this while at the same time bitterly satirizing the military, big business, and the lunacy of combat itself."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 has to be one of the funniest books that I have ever read. While I was reading it, I would burst out and start laughing because this book was so humorous. Unfortunately, I dislike reading long books. But this is one long book that I am happy I finished. It was fun to see how stupid the military can be and how shallow people are.

However, he badgers his reader to the point where any knowledge or truth that has been gleaned from the novel is lost. A book about nonsense and insanity is fine, but when the reader is forced to see it through the same kaleidoscope as the characters, some of the impact is lost. One has a hard time relating to, or feeling sympathy for, the characters since we never know what they'll do next. Does Heller really mean to say that people were making money at the expense of their friend's llives? If so, the ridiculous personage of Milo is the wrong way to achieve this end. This character's actions are so ludicrous, that the reader is forced to write off the incidents completely. This is just a symptom of Heller's disease, which causes him to alienate his reader through an overdose of sarcasm and ridiculousness."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"i loved it. i am only 16 and read it for a book report in english. the major major chapter was the best. read it!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I'm probably one of the few who doesn't think this book is outstanding. Don't get me wrong, as literary art \\"Catch-22\\" excels but I judge a book not on artistic merits but simply by how well I enjoyed reading it. \\"Catch-22\\" is laugh out loud funny sometimes but it is rather convoluted and hard to follow. Rather than a flowing narrative, it is simply jumbled military anecdotes that follow no timeline. An event or person that may be mentioned early in the book isn't described until later in the book. But what it comes down to is that I could have stopped at the end of each chapter with no impulse to read further to see what happens next. The wonderful slapstick absurdity that makes the novel special is surrounded by some rather dull sections and while most of the characters are silly and comical almost none are likable. I can see why \\"Catch-22\\" is considered a classic but I found it partly dull and only partly delicious."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This truly is a satire that uses dry humor to bring home the book's points. There were times when I was left shaking my head with a smile, or an outright laugh. But for the most part I kept shaking my head wondering if all this book is about is dry humor satirizing the politics and ideology of WWII, or any war for that matter. And yes, that is what the book was meant to do, but it doesn't make for a good novel, as everyone is saying. A satirical conversation yes, a novel no.Reading the reviews the book is made out to have a flowing plotline that reveals the satire through an underlying conversation, one that uses a plotline of capitalist ventures, scheming officers and men who want out of the war. But this just isn't the case. The book itself is a loose collection of satirical comments that never form into anything other than a comedy, one meant to seem witty and fun. But after 463 pages you are left with nothing more than an elaborate definition of Catch-22, one that has no storyline worthy of making this a novel.If you are familiar with M*A*S*H and love it, then read this book. If you love satirical comedies with no storyline, read this. But if you are expecting to find a satirical \\"novel\\", as many reviewers have called this book, then you won't find it in this loose collection of witty phrases and hinted at revelations.

Virtually any praise that I can heap upon Catch-22 has been done - and more eloquently than I can ever put it. From a humanistic standpoint it is a far-reaching work touching on subjects which can be deemed universal, even given the extreme circumstances placed upon the characters; though most of us have never even smelled the smokey aroma of a bullet fired at our heads, let alone experienced the horror of war (as far-removed, history-channel watching observers like my self so inadequately put it), Heller smashes, with remarkable insight, care and an almost scary gift for paradoxical logic, into subjects which touch any person with the right-minded patience to plough through this massive novel.As a work of philosophy (yes, philosophy), Catch-22 visits realms of logic that will twist the reader's mind while making him realize the idiosyncracies in war, indeed in everyday life. There is a reason why the term 'Catch-22' is now a commonly used expression; the book puts a name on a set of logical impasses that had been hinted at before but never officially named. (perhaps by philosophers, yes, but never in such a popular way)As a work of literature, this book is simply amazing. A testament to the nearly 10 years Heller plunked down into its writing, Catch-22 is easily the most complex and convoluted novel I have ever read which still manages to keep some semblance of sense and cohesiveness. I cannot even begin to imagine the intense plotting and forethought that has gone into its execution; moments hinted at briefly which seem absolutely meaningless resurface 300 pages later and shed new light on everything up to that point. It of course follows suit that this novel needs more than one reading, indeed, needs more than two.Catch-22 is an extremely important work of art, not only for the generation it was written for, but for humanity as a whole, for its complexity, unabashed humanity, trenchant humor (even all these years later), mad genius and the sheer pleasure it provides in revisiting (the second lecture is much better than the first.)It is difficult to expound on Heller's genius for having writen this gem within the confines of 1000 words or less, and I usually take with healthy suspicion such raving reviews as I myself have given, but it is duly deserving. If I had to compress Catch-22 into a word, it would be 'timeless'. This novel, I am sure, will be read, appreciated and admired in 50, 100 years from now, far after the echoes of the war it was set in have faded from the failing memory of our species."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a story about a man named Yossarian who is a bombardierfor America during WWII the story is a mix between in-depth story telling and insanity.This book is not intended for the light reader.The book does have it's light flaws like many books do but one of it's most major flaws is it's order of story telling which can only be compared to a Quintin Terentino movie.

Boy will we miss him.There are only two ways to look at &quot;Catch-22.&quot; One side believes that it is a demoralizing work that compromises the integrity and honor of the United States military. The other side argues that this is a classic work of fiction to be enjoyed by generations to come. Who is right?Both sides are. I can honestly say that Heller's hilarious, upsetting, poignant, and disquieting work is one that I am proud to have in my library, even going so far as to say that it is truly one of my favorite works. Seeing as I serve in the US Air Force, one would ask, &quot;How can you so thoroughly enjoy a book which so blatantly criticizes the military and all that it stands for?&quot; To this I reply, &quot;That's the point.&quot;Stationed on an imaginary island off the coast of Italy called Pianosa, a disgruntled World War II bombardier is desparate to get out of the Air Force because he believes that everyone is trying to kill him. For most people, this plot wouldn't hold up in a 463-page novel, much less a short story! However, Heller's superior characterization (the squadron commanding officer's name was Major Major Major Major) and ability to make the most basic situation ironic (an aircrew member who is diagnosed insane is unfit for flying per Air Force regulations must actively request to be taken off of the flight roster, but if he is sane enough to make such a request, then he is deemed fit for flying) leads me to wonder why the book isn't even longer.The characters will tear at your emotions like a Cuisinart. You will both love and hate them at the same time, especially the conniving Milo Minderbinder, who had his own squadron bombed to further the causes of his international black-market goods cartel, a cartel which he runs with the use of the squadron's planes.Joseph Heller is now gone, but his legacy lives on. We salute you, sir, and your tale of Yossarian the bombardier shall never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"No book written in my lifetime has had a greater impact on my thinking or provided such a rich reading experience as Catch-22. More than just an antiwar screed, this sprawling novel with its intricate plots and huge cast of characters is a complex story of survival in an absurdly tragi/comic war. It manages to be both hysterically funny and saddly moving while forcing the reader to look differently at such concepts as 'honor', 'heroism', 'patriotism' and 'cowardice'.As several reveiwers have pointed out, the book is slow to start. Part of that has to do with the author's need to seduce the reader to his peculiar veiwpoint, to introduce the numerous characters and to set the stage that will make the absurd seem normal and the normal seem absurd. Once perceived, the structure of the book is a joy to experience. The recurring interrupted flashbacks, the seemingly unrelated subplots and digressions, the cast of characters, each stranger than the one before, all reveal more and more as the book progresses so that by the end one feels enmeshed in a real story of real people - though it is totally crazy. As if Lewis Carroll had written The Inferno instead of Dante.Some of the scenes and characters are as inventive as anything ever writtn and remain vivid in the mind long after the book is finished. Yossarian is a complete person, but much that he experiences is fragmented and bizarre. The 'soldier in white' (all readers will remember this one) is a perfect example of Heller's genius. This scene is both horrifying and hysterically funny, and goes to the heart of the book's message.Joesph Heller died yesterday. I will miss him because there will be no more Heller books. But in truth, though he continued to write and produced a series of interesting novels (including a sequel to Catch-22), nothing else that he produced came close to having the magic and the impact of that first one."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"For starters, forget everything you've ever been told about novels. Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is in a category all by itself. This laugh-out-loud tale of an American bombardier during the second half of World War II redefines what a novel can be. Yossarian's tale leads you through a series of encounters with numerous characters which include the craziest of the crazy, sanest of the sane, and even a Major named Major who bears a slight resemblance to Henry Fonda. Heller gives you a hilarious commentary of sinister bureaucratic rule that is no less than marvelous.The book takes place on the island of Pianosa (Pianosa is a real island, but Heller has taken the liberty to make it much larger for the sake of his novel) that sits off of the coast of Italy. Yossarian's main goal throughout the novel is to stay alive, or die trying. He is puzzled by the fact that millions of people that he doesn't even know yet want to kill him. His only hope is to be grounded, but the only man who has the power to do so, Doc Daneeka, refuses. Backing the doctor up in his assertion is Catch-22.\\"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. \`That's some catch that catch 22,' he observed. \`It's the best there is.' Doc Daneeka agreed.\\"(46) The concept of Catch-22 is an ever present theme, and its circular path of logic is referred to time and time again.Joseph Heller does a wonderful job exposing the corruption in our society. We are graced with flashbacks within flashbacks, followed up with flash forwards and even more flashbacks. This highly illogical order of events could have spelled disaster. In the hands of a lesser author this hilariously satirical piece could have turned into a jumbled mess, but Heller commands the stream of consciousness in a manner that can only be described as genius. The events and stories don't fall into place until the end of the novel, at which point the fog is lifted and everything becomes clear. The circular logic of the Catch-22 is even apparent in his writing technique. \\"The Texan turned out to be good-natured, generous and likeable. In three days no one could stand him.\\"(9) Upon closer examination of the novel one can see that Catch-22 is a very serious piece of literature. Heller uses our sense of humor to expose us to a grotesquely cruel world with a blatant disregard for human life. A world not all that different from our own, shown through rose colored glasses, distorted just enough to miraculously provide us with a clearer picture. Through Yossarian's fight to survive, he seems to be un-patriotic by your grandfather's standards, but the tenacity in which he fights for what he truly wants he provides with a sick twisted role model. His ideals add to the corruptness of those around him. \\"\`What would they do to me,' he asked in confidential tones, \`if I refused to fly them?' \`We'd probably shoot you,' ex-PFC. Wintergreen replied. \`We?' Yossarian cried in surprise. \`What do you mean, we? Since when are you on their side?' \`If you're going to be shot, whose side do you expect me to be on?' ex-PFC. Wintergreen retorted.\\"(59) As the plot continues to unfold, Heller provides you with a government that grows increasingly more evil. The complexity of the order of events keeps you glued to the text, if for no other reason than to be able to understand where Heller is heading with this story. As a reader we are provided with a surprise ending which in turn explains everything.All in all Catch-22 is a literary masterpiece. It flirts dangerously with the line between humor and absolute horror. In a world infatuated by cruelty, inhumanity, and absolute carnage, Heller provides us with a new look on an old idea, the morality of refusal. In not accepting the rules associated with Catch-22, Yossarian is able to rise above the cruel world that he is a part of and gives us hope when all is thought to be lost. Catch-22 is a must read staple of contemporary literature, a masterpiece of its time."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Though I have posted dialogue from the book, it DOES NOT contain spoilers!Obviously I am in the minority when it comes to rating this book, but I guess I'll add my opinion to Amazon's hard drive in the hopes that it will help someone to make a decision on this book:I really tried to read Catch-22. I have wanted to read it for about three years now, and have always heard good things about it. I went in knowing only what the term 'catch-22' meant, but nothing else.The first thing that struck me about the book was the humor. I was laughing and giggling for the first few chapters during the humorous dialogue that is rampant throughout that section. I cannot define the humor as deep, as it all seemed just a bit silly. That would be fine for me if it were in small doses - I get plenty of silly humor from my friends - but the book just beats it to death. I'll even demonstrate an example:There are no spoilers:*******************************************************************\\"In sixty days you'll be fighting Billy Petrolle,\\" the colonel with the big fat mustache roared. \\"And you think it's a big fat joke.\\"\\"I don't think it's a joke, sir,\\" Clevinger replied.\\"Don't interupt.\\"\\"Yes, sir.\\"\\"And say 'sir' when you do,\\" ordered Major Metcalf.\\"Yes, sir.\\"\\"Weren't you just ordered not to interrupt?\\" Major Metcalf inquired coldly.\\"But I didn't interrupt, sir,\\" Clevinger protested.\\"No. And you didn't say 'sir,' either...\\"******************************************************Ok, maybe Mr. Heller is trying to show that commanders aren't listening to the soldiers or maybe he's trying to demonstrate that the commanders are stupid, I don't know. Regardless, what I know is that this type of humor is repeated continuously through the first 80 pages and by that time it is completely overused.Ergo, my recommendations for the prospective reader therefore is this:If you think you can handle the described type of humor in large quantities, purchase this book. If you are unsure, rent it from the library. If the above dialogue seems disinteresting, I would search elsewhere for your next book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"War, for all its glory, gore, bloodshed, tragedy and horror, in the end is often one continuous story of insanity and inanity. People find themselves in circumstances that to the outsider, might seem quite funny. So goes this book; Catch-22, by Joseph Heller. Probably one of the great 20th century classics in war literature along with \\"Farewell to Arms\\" and \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\", this is the ultimate tragi-comedy of WW2. Based on the life of a group of bomber pilots based in Italy; the story focuses on Yosarian, and his group of buddies who do their best to survive the war, execute their missions, avoid their commanding officers, lay with hot nurses and escape vengeful widows of slain comrades. As the war progresses and their comrades are killed in bunches and spurts, the remainder find various ways to cope with the emotional loss and the inevitable sense of doom. They all want to go home alive; but the only way to go home alive is to fly a required number of bombing runs. But each bombing run exposes you to death from enemy fire. So here is the catch; fly your runs as quick as possible, hope you survive each one, so you can go home after the last one. Or, try to postpone each flight you have to take knowing that you will live longer in the short run, but also knowing that you eventually will have to fly them. The risk with the latter is that you might also get killed in other ways on the ground; example is Yosarian's friend - Hungry Joe who suffocates to death in his sleep because a cat slept on his face. In between the author shows in funny detail the life of soldiers, and those civilians who have to put up with them. The loss of life throughout the book keeps the tears flowing after you stop crying from the absurd comedy. This book is quite a classic of 20th century English literature, though it is probably not appropriate for anyone under high school."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is one of those rare books that absolutely everyone should read; I reccommend it unceasingly to anyone and everyone. Though it is long, it is very readable, and you'll probably go through it quickly because it's so entertaining. Aside from its sheer fun and humor however, is the true message behind the book. It is often cited as being one of the great ant-war novels - and, indeed, it is just about flawless in this respect - but it goes much deeper than that. Catch-22 is really a book about paradoxes, and the sheer (necessary) insanity of modern life. The title itself is now a common - and oft-heard - refrain in the English language, and many might be unaware of its original source. The dictionary defines &quot;Catch-22&quot; as &quot;a problematic situation for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule&quot; - and that is exactly what the novel presents: situations showing the sheer necessary insanity of modern life. (War is one such - perhaps the most obvious - instance, but there are many others. This book offers satire on other subjects as well - i.e., federal aid for farmers.) And could life as we know it exist without this inherent madness? The question might be a lot more difficult to answer than you think. The premise of this book can also be summed up in a phrase from another great author, Fyodor Dostoevsky, &quot;If everything on earth were rational, nothing would happen.&quot; That is what the book tries to say. It is not merely a simple anti-war book, despite what some shallow-headed readers and reviewers might say. I suggest that you read the book with an open mind: it's well worth it. The book is quite hilarous as well - the satire being very sharp-toothed. The book does not have a plot - indeed, it does not even attempt to tell a story, at least not in the usual sense. (Nearly) every chapter is named for a character in the book, and that chapter gradually portrays some of that particular character's crazy antics. Little bits of plot are glimpsed here and there, and then revealed gradually. The book is very non-linear and quite scattershot. It's similar to the way Kurt Vonnegut writes. I reccommend that everyone read this book. Quite aside from its near universal praise and the fact that an everyday word has sprung from it, it was in the Top 10 (#6, I believe) on New Modern Library's Top 100 Books of the 20th century. Put it on your reading list."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Heller's book has held such widespread acclaim that it's premise is actually considered a new word in the English Language. Catch-22 according to the dictionary is \\"a situation in which a desired outcome or solution is impossible to attain because of a set of inherently illogical rules or conditions.\\" Joseph Heller created the idiom and I believe its widespread use in the English-speaking world is proof that this book is genius. The books protagonist is named Yossarian and he is a bombardier during World War II. What is most baffling for Yossarian is that everyone is trying to kill him, people he knows and does not know personally - the Germans, the pilots that fly the planes, the Colonels that force him to be there.What's most baffling is that Yossarian cannot find a logical way to remove himself from the situation. The Doctors tell him that he may be grounded if he's crazy. If he continues to fly the missions he would be crazy, but if he asks the doctors to ground him for being crazy they could automatically deduct that he is quite sane and trying to preserve his life. That's the catch. Catch-22 - there is no possible situation that could work - a Lose vs. Lose circumstances.Lets just say that Heller thinks little of the situations that men and women must endure during their military careers during a time of war. The book is poignant, funny, and very readable. It's a long book, but I was sorry to see it end. For me - Yossarian will still live on and continue to persevere and fight against these Catch-22s! On a macro scale, we must ask ourselves why we glorify the victories (or losses) that our country undergoes during a time of war - have we won or have we lost the battle - or does it matter? Did we both lose? In other words, war is a Catch-22 - nobody wins. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"A true story:Some time ago, I was in the Marine Corps, scheduled for a deployment in Iraq. After six months of maddeningly boring pre-deployment \\"training\\", I had become somewhat scornful and skeptical of, not to mention endlessly disappointed, frustrated and disillusioned with, the military. All of this had me extremely depressed.During the few days of leave (just a few days; military policy is to give two weeks of leave, but we only got five days, and this is just one of the ways they screwed my unit over) between the end of the \\"training\\" and the movement to Iraq, I went to visit my brother.During the visit we happened to pass a bookstore, and he offered to buy me a copy of Catch-22. He thought I might identify with it. I replied that I was sure I would. I'd heard of the book, of course, but never read it, and figured that if it was as ingeniously satirical as everyone said, reading it at that point in my life might just drive me over the edge. I was afraid it would hit too close to home, and so I refused his generosity.I went to Iraq, which turned out to be even more maddening than the \\"training\\", stayed there for five months without incident, returned home and retired from the service just as soon as I could. And then I read Catch-22.As I was safely retired at that point, it didn't hit particularly close to home. It's well-written, and very effective in making its point. Unfortunately for me (and for any reader who has first-hand experience with the military) it's the most obvious point possible, and so most of the book's humor and absolutely all of its shock value are completely lost.In many instances the book is simply too true to be funny. There's hardly anything in it that didn't sound exactly like real life to me. Time after time, my reaction to the various absurd incidents of bureaucratic inertia, institutional asininity, and higher-up incompetence was a simple shrug. I'd seen it all myself, so why should Heller's fictive recounting of it seem like a revelation?"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"\\"Catch 22\\" is unlike any other book I've ever read. It is hilarious, absurd, shocking, disturbing, and one hell of a ride. I can understand why it holds such a place of high esteem in the canon of 20th Century Literature. The story revolves around John Yossarian, an American bombardier stationed on the island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean, during World War II. Yossarian no longer wants to fly missions, and attempts to find a way to get out of further bombing runs. The problem is catch-22, the unwritten, unofficial rule that states that an insane crewman can be grounded from missions, and a man who willingly continues to fly combat missions must be insane. However, if he makes the necessary formal request to stop flying such missions, the very act of filing the request proves that he is sane and, therefore, is ineligible to be grounded. Caught on this bureaucratic hook, Yossarian keeps flying missions while Colonel Cathcart, the squadron commander, keeps raising the number of missions the men must fly before they can go home. This is one of many bureaucratic absurdities that Yossarian encounters, and the ridiculousness of bureaucracy in war is one of the major themes in this book.Bureaucracy can create a unique type of madness in war. Trivialities (such as clerical errors) grow to be of extreme importance, while critical matters (matters of life and death) are marginalized. Soldiers are marched off to their doom with a false sense of duty, bravado, and patriotism, worrying about trivial matters, while giving no thought to survival. Yossarian labels this for what it is - insanity - and decides that to survive in an insane world, one must become insane. His insane survival techniques lead to some truly enlightening moments of lunacy, which are quite fun.The first half of \\"Catch 22\\" is biting, satirical, and has some truly hilarious moments. Heller uses slapstick humor and situations to get across the esprit de corps that soldiers in combat share. However, as the story progresses, it suddenly spirals from the comically absurd to the brutally cruel and irrational. In the last few chapters, the story takes a steep emotional drop that catches the reader by surprise, dragging them off a cliff into a dark emotional abyss. The story's sudden and abrupt turns to the cruelty, inhumanity, and unfairness of war is done in an understated manner which amplifies the irrationality of the situation. The reader comes away feeling the anguish and despair that Yossarian feels as his friends die, disappear, or commit atrocities abhorrent to Yossarian.Heller does an excellent job of communicating the inhumanity of war and the madness of bureaucracy in war. He shows that a bureaucracy, ran by cruel or insane men, can utterly destroy the rights of an individual, sometimes with the passive or active assistance of the individual themselves. The circular, non-linear story line is a little off-putting, but it allows for the reader to view situations from several different points of view which gives enhanced breadth and depth to the story."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Generally, when students recieve a list of books to read for school, they can expect to spend many nights toiling away at what teachers think is fine literature. I had no great expectations of Catch-22 when I bought it. I had chosen this book because I had heard the expression Catch-22 used before, and figured it must be somewhat intresting if it was a fairly common expression.The first two or three chapters went slowly like most books, somewhat difficult to understand why the Yossarian character was signing documents under other people's names. As the book progressed Joesph Heller becomes, in my mind one of the greatest comic geniuses of all time.Ever joke in this book is a long-running joke throughout the book. Everything that could go wrong does. The theory of Catch-22 is so realistic it is comical. The entire book shows the horror of war, but creates a laughable atmosphere about it. There are several dark, and even grusome scenes in this book, however Heller seems to take a comical approach to all of them starting jokes about them the next chapter. The jokes in this book never end, each joke is seen again and again, until the very humorous end.Don't be mistaken, although this book had me rolling on the floor laughing several times, it is also a great historical drama about life during World War 2 and the realism of fighting and Yossarian's fear of death for fighting something he doesn't belive in.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to all readers, as it is a Classic and is some of hte most enjoyable 400-something pages you'll read, more than likely, several times."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"If I step back into my college nerd-geek mindset, I can appreciate this book for the attempts at humor. To be sure, it's a simple humor, dressed up in pseudo-intellectualism; but it reminds me of some of my friends when they would make an odd comment simply for the sake of absurdity and then try to explain to me how what they said actually made total sense. They were funny and quirky and fun. However, they also had other moods and other traits, and my interactions with them were deeper than simple banter.What this book suffers from is using a device too much. To me, great artists - of any type - have a large toolbox. They may not be masters at using every one, but they are knowledgeable and proficient with each. But most importantly, they know when to use each one - or perhaps more to the point, when NOT to use each one. In Catch-22, Heller picks up one brush (absurdity) and uses it endlessly, repeatedly, for 500 some pages. This isn't masterful, and it almost comes across as an exercise, almost like a musical etude.For me, the trick is not to find something great and use it endlessly. That is sloppy and sophomoric. The real mastery in any art is using a tool only where it has greatest effect, to moderate yourself and allow yourself to use other tools. Otherwise, the effect you are aiming for loses its meaning and poignancy. By being relentlessly absurd - granted some argue he was doing this purposefully to make us feel the absurdity - he's created an absurd book. Kudos to doing what you set out to do, but that doesn't make the book itself \\"great\\".Just my $0.02."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"What a read, hilarity and substance that goes beyond the humor to delve into the reality of being stuck in a no win situation."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a wonderful book, engaging the reader, enabling them to watch these people live, as if right by their side. At first, I was a bit taken aback, wondering why in the world someone would recommend this book, but the reason soon became clear, diminishing any previous doubts. Heller is able to bring these characters to life, using his words to create realistic imagery. The characters become real, living, breathing people in your mind as you join them in their missions. It even leaves a sort of mystery until the last page or so. As much praise as Catch-22 deserves, however, there will be some that will argue, saying the language is too harsh, or the context too mature, but it is well written, and a true depiction of the lives of the people at war, or during the time. With all of the seriousness, though, Heller provides comic relief through Yossarian's sarcastic antics, making the novel somewhat hilarious. A person expecting a fairy tale, or an easy read, probably should not read this book, but I would still recommend it for readers of various sorts, whether you like action, war books, or not. It really is difficult to go wrong when choosing to read Catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"My title should say it all, this is an amazing book. If you have not read it, make sure that you do.

It will change your perception of sanity forever."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller's Catch-22 has been seen as a controversial but classic twentieth century novel because of its rebellious nature and questioning of authority that easily places it into the social context of the American 1960s. Through the main character, Yossarian, and his various situations the author seems to comment on the individual use of morality as a counter to the governmental use of authority and power in a military bureaucracy. Yossarian, a soldier in World War II, and his squadron's fate are placed in the hands of a group of leaders who are willing to sacrifice their men's lives for personal gain in the form of recognition. Heller seems to use this situation to comment on the authoritative use of bureaucracy in that the men are led into futile situations by a bureaucracy that not only discards logic, but also has no regard for its defenders. Yossarian and his fellow soldiers must use the illogical laws of their war bureaucracy to their advantages in order to survive. They are all subject to the law of Catch-22.Heller's Catch-22 ultimately defines situations in which all of the solutions of any given situation have negative results. The author uses Catch-22 throughout his novel to show how logic can be circumvented in order to force Yossarian and his squadron to suffer through numerous personal situations and remain at war in a sort of bureaucratic military entrapment. Catch-22 is used when Yossarian, as an instinct of preservation, tries to be discharged from the military-or at least tries to avoid combat-by claiming that he is insane. But by claiming that he is insane, he is therefore seen as sane because no reasonable person would want to fly bombing missions. Again, Catch-22 is used against Yossarian when he is offered the choice to be court-martialed or be released upon his approval of the policies of Colonels Cathcart and Korn. The Catch-22 is that the policies require the men to fly eighty missions before being sent home and thereby jeopardizes their lives.Perhaps the most important point that Heller makes in Catch-22 is that there is an alternative to Catch-22. At the end of the novel, Yossarian discounts Catch-22 by opting for a different way out of war. He deserts his unit and goes to Sweden, a neutral country, and rejects the military bureaucracy. By this, Heller seems to say that while Catch-22-a contradictory condition of circular reasoning that holds its sufferer in its irrational environment and benefits only those who have made up the law-may seem inescapable; there is ultimately a way out. Heller depicted World War II with a sense of disenchantment with the military. This may be what made Catch-22 so controversial during the Vietnam War (and in the wake of what was considered The Good War). Yossarian not only questions authority, but he finds an ultimate solution through desertion. This is definitely not something that the government would have wanted young American draftsmen reading, however, it is valuable in its depiction of morality in the face of illogical or immoral situations such as war."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is a novel set in final months of World War II. Yossarian, the protagonist, was a World War II Bombardier. In the novel, for thousands of people that didn't even know kept trying to kill him. This book I believe helps people to understand the meanings and feelings of war. For Yossarian lost several of his friends in war, bizzare accidnets, or even by fate, but he had to learn to handle it. This novel is not like every other novel, for it has no chronological order to it which gives it its uniqueness not only to the novel but also to the characters. For example, Yossarian goes crazy because he has gone through a lot but he gets through it. Major Major is a character to which he tells everyone they may visit him in his office, when he's not there. Some characters like Colonal Korn's just wants his picture in the paper and doesn't even care about his soldier or if they get bombed or anything. Heller makes the novel very interesting, but it is self-contradicting and has twisted reasoning for everything. He wants the reader to have to go back in the novel and remember certain events in order for it all to make sense. I also believe that because of all the little stories told about the other characters and the realationship Yossarian has with them, it ends up showing the reader a lot about Yossarian himself. For this novel is fun to read because it is field with numerous amounts of emotions from humor, to scary, to sadness and depressing moments allowing the reader to really get into the book. I enjoyed this book a lot, because I was able to keep reading it because I didn't want to put it down. I wanted to find out what kind of event was going to happen next. Catch 22 was none like any book I have read, and I recomend you read it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I first read CATCH-22 when I was young--so long ago, I don't remember when but, probably, when I was in junior high school. It was so powerful that, at that moment, it frightened me.Re-reading the novel as an adult, I realize that author Joseph Heller was a bona fide genius. In hindsight, it is difficult to believe that CATCH-22 won none of the predictable prizes at the time of its original publication.The absurdity of war, and the struggle of the average soldier to survive his tour of duty, never has been more successfully communicated in literature than Heller did here.Forty years after its first publication, the expression &quot;Catch-22&quot; and the concept behind it have become accepted usages in everyday vocabulary, referring to the cycle of irrationality of problem defying the solution, solution causing the problem.The information on the Amazon website that author Heller lives in East Hampton, New York is out-of-date. Sadly, Heller died in East Hampton a few years ago; as a resident of the town myself, I am certain of this fact.Time has proven that CATCH-22 is classic literature."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a roiling, boiling, oscillating set of absurdities flung at the reader at breakneck pace. The fictional Italian island of Pianoso serves as the backdrop for Joseph's Heller's satirical skewering of WWII and the American military. The storytelling is nearly manic as a cast of surreal characters strive to survive their military obligations amidst chaotic plots and implausible scenarios.Somewhat problematically, Catch-22 has been hailed for decades as among the ultimate in anti-war novels. It is beyond question anti-war, but it is also beyond question a work relying so completely on the absurd as to launch it well beyond satire into whimsy. One might think such pacifist acclaim might cling to something more sturdy.Nevertheless, Catch-22 does have it's heartbreaking moments of war-is-hell horror. I'm not giving anything away by noting that the final description of Snowden's death is emotionally disturbing. These instances, however, are rare. I enjoyed Catch-22 and consumed it quickly. One cannot read this book without developing a fondness for it's protagonist, Captain Yossarian, and a host of other characters far too eccentric to dislike.In the end, Catch-22 is a worthy reading experience, but I will forever wonder how such a fanciful tale can claim to seriously challenge the notion of national defense, an applied foreign policy, and the U.S. military's role within it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The funniest book I've ever read in my life..But some not so funny truths are buried under the humor"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"The amazing CATCH-22 essentially has three overlapping narratives. One shows senior officers who are comically unsympathetic to the interests of their men. Some of these, such as Colonel Cathcart and General Peckem, are careerists who make decisions according to self-interest (or stupidity and self-interest). Others are incompetents, such as Major Major Major Major and General Sheiskopff, whose authority far surpasses their ability. To me, the careerist officers, while satirical, seemed as real as any modern bungling boss, working smugly in the corner office.Milo Minderbinder, a genius trader and capitalist, is the dominant character in the second narrative. Technically, Milo is the mess officer at Pianosa, where Yossarian is based. But he has parlayed this job into a food supply syndicate and has become a major commercial player throughout the entire war zone. Milo is a profiteer and entrepreneur whose greed distorts, and sometimes overshadows, the war.With Milo, Heller shows a world of surrealistic capitalism that thrives as the men in the bombers die. But for me, Milo didn't add much. His adventures make twisted sense. Yet they hit only one note and don't really ripen into something more profound. Milo is the least successful part of this superior and complex book.The third narrative in CATCH-22 shows the men who fly in the bombers. Here, Heller's work is outstanding. There are men who can't shake the presence of death (Yossarian, Dunbar, Hungry Joe, and Dobbs). There are true believers who accept the mission and its risks (Clevinger and Havermeyer). There is a rich kid (Nately), a reckless hotdog (McWatt), and a doomed alcoholic (Chief White Halfoat). And there are the horrible fatalities (Snowden and Kid Sampson), whose deaths are gruesome and arbitrary.Heller's work with these characters is absolutely first-rate. While they have cartoonish aspects, each is distinct and each has a surprisingly moving story. Heller also writes about their combat missions with you-are-there intensity. Finally, he connects the reader emotionally to the plight of these characters, especially in the final 150 pages, when the power and poignance of his narratives merge and really hit home. Then, you feel the consequences when you learn that, say, Milo has substituted aspirin for morphine in McWatt's plane on the tragic and high-risk mission to Avignon. \\"There there,\\" murmurs Yossarian. \\"There there.\\"CATCH-22 is a long book. There is repetitiveness in its humor. Its iteration of events is occasionally maddening. But keep at it! CATCH 22 deserves its must-read reputation (although seventh place on the ML Best Novels list seems high). Regardless, this is a terrific novel."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is so good, my weak attempt at a review is not going to do it justice. But I'll try.I knew before I was half-way through that this is going to be a favorite and I plan to re-read it immediately. The writing is so fresh, the character studies so sharp, and the satire so relevant in today's increasingly bureaucratic (corporate) society, no wonder it was so hard for me to find a used copy. It's definitely a book I plan to hold onto and enjoy re-reading every year.Anyone who's ever worked for a big corporation (like myself) can identify with Heller's hilarious and angry take on bureaucracy. Gen. Peckem's quote reads like a line from Dilbert or Office Space:\\"Just pass the work I assign you along to somebody else and trust to luck. We call that delegation of responsibility. Somewhere down near the lowest level of this coordinated organization I run are people who do get the work done when it reaches them, and everything manages to run along smoothly without too much effort on my part.\\"It's sad how true that is in real life.But this book is not all satire. It has a big heart. I often found myself laughing and crying at the same time. I can tell Heller cares deeply for his characters, even when he makes high comedy out of their sad fates (such as what happens to poor Doc Daneeka). He's brutally honest about the horrors of war, and laces them with enough humanity to really break your heart. It all makes the climatic \\"miracle\\" that much more satisfying. It's a satire that ends with a message of hope. And I like that.Many people call this book ant-war, but I don't think it is. It really comes down to the last conversation btw. Yossarian and Danby. The ideals of war can be good - who can argue against rescuing Western Europe from Nazi domination. But it's the method of war - and all the evils that go with it - that makes no sense. Are these evils worth the ideals? It's a catch-22. And it's a dilemma that applies to life in general, not just to war."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Joseph Heller, who was an American bombardier in WWII, tells the story of a character in the same situation, John Yossarian, in his historical, satirical novel, Catch-22. The title refers to a military rule in the book in which circular logic is employed to keep air-men flying their missions, despite their best efforts to avoid them. It illustrates perfectly the message of the story: war is insane, and inane bureaucratic operation sustains it.I began reading the novel with optimistic expectations, mainly from the critical acclaim it has received over the decades, but also because the title's concept seemed a clever premise for a novel. However, as I read chapter after chapter I became disheartened. The jokes were not funny, they made no sense, and the characters rambled on insanely about seemingly unimportant topics. By about page 100 I was seriously considering moving on to something else, but then a colleague of mine saw it in my hand and said, \\"Catch-22, great novel, isn't it?\\" This guy was highly-educated and a veteran educator - was I missing something? \\"Actually,\\" I replied, \\"I'm not really getting into this one.\\" He smiled and nodded knowingly: \\"It took me five tries to finish it. The first hundred pages are tough, but once you get over that stretch it's really worth it.\\" Taking him at his word I trudged on, and I am deeply grateful I did. He was correct, as the story gradually began to come together brilliantly and by the end I decided that it was perhaps one of the most solid and intelligent novels that I have yet read.There were reasons for my troubles, and I fear that many give up with a sour impression of the book due to them. The novel is told from differing points of view, and the story is nonlinear. Events are told repeatedly by different people, often out of sequence, and are revealed more and more in their entirety each time further details are offered. This results in the completion of a set-up to a joke whose punch-line has already been told. It allows the reader to laugh at and understand later a situation which previously seemed frivolous and unfunny. It also changes one's perspective of characters that at first seemed insane, but are later found to be the sanest.Catch-22 offers many instances of poignant insight and telling observations. One of the most relevant to our own time involves a conversation between the American character Nately and an elderly Italian man:\\"You put so much stock in winning wars,\\" the grubby iniquitous old man scoffed. \\"The real trick lies in losing wars, in knowing which wars can be lost. Italy has been losing wars for centuries, and just see how splendidly we've done nonetheless. France wins wars and is in a continual state of crisis. Germany loses and prospers.\\" (Heller 255)And later...\\"There is nothing so absurd about risking your life for your country,\\" he [Nately] declared.\\"Isn't there?\\" asked the old man. \\"What is a country? A country is a piece of land surrounded on all sides by boundaries, usually unnatural. Englishmen are dying for England, Americans are dying for America, Germans are dying for Germany, Russians are dying for Russia. There are now fifty or sixty countries fighting in this war. Surely so many countries can't be worth dying for.\\"\\"Anything worth living for,\\" said Nately, \\"is worth dying for.\\"\\"And anything worth dying for,\\" answered the sacrilegious old man, \\"is certainly worth living for... How old are you? Twenty-five? Twenty-six?\\"\\"Nineteen,\\" said Nately, \\"I'll be twenty in January.\\"\\"If you live.\\" (Heller 257)Despite what justifications can be made for war, how else can war look to one who witnesses the carnage first-hand but to be absolutely without reason? And though certain wars may be just, certainly not all battles are. This is the experience of Yossarian.The novel contains the heart-breaking reality of war coupled with the zaniness of people on the brink of sanity's edge. It is real enough to be relevant, but surreal enough for the reader to laugh and enjoy without qualms of conscience. For those who have been inhibited by the confusion of the first hundred pages of the book, I beg you to return once more for the long haul. The journey is well-worth it."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This was a very popular book when it first came out, and millions of copies were sold in the paperback version in the 1960s.However, the reviews were mixed. The Sunday Times, for example, thought that the book was far too \\"repetitious\\" and it lacked \\"craft and sensibility.\\" But a reviewer from the Herald tribune in New York thought it was \\"a wild, moving, shocking, hilarious, raging, exhilarating, giant roller coaster ride of a book.\\" Those two reviews summarize the basic traits of the book. I am quoting Joseph Heller (above) who wrote a piece on the reviews for his book.The reviews were not unanimous because - and this is a simplification that I make here - this is not a novel in the purest sense as one might think of a novel such as Madame Bovary. It is not a well balanced work of art where one has a few strong characters and a strong plot. Rather, it is a wandering story or a series of short stories all linked by a common protagonist. The hero, Yossarian, is an air crew memeber in a bomber wing which is stationed off the coast of Italy during World War II. The book has a series of strong characters, all held together by a weak plot; it is a series of very funny portraits of various characters in the bomber wing. Each chapter is about a different member of the wing: various colonels, generals, fellow crew members, the chaplain, etc. It descibes their actions, motivations, and inner thoughts.The book describes how they cope with the isolation, the pressures of war, and the ambitions of the regular officers, especially the colonels who want to become generals.So, this is a great piece of literature but perhaps not the great American novel. It took Joseph Heller about 8 years to write this story of World War II, and we assume that he has drawn on his knowledge of the bomber wing from his own time in the air-force. It is irreverent humor which leaves the reader laughing out loud on many occasions during the read.The only other similar book that I have read is Slaughterhouse Five, but the present work is much longer and more complex.This is an interesting and entertaining read that can be read in a day or two."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"When I first started to read Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" I expected to get the typical war story. I didn't think that it would offer me anything new because I have seen and read several war stories. But as I progressed further into the book, I realized that this novel is unique and is unlike anything else I have ever read.The novel is based around a bomb squadron stationed on a small island near Italy. The main focus is on one of the members of the squadron named Yossarian, who is going insane because he is caught in the middle of World War II and people that he doesn't even know are trying to kill him. Yossarian tries desperately throughout the novel to get out of the war, and along the way he meets up with many interesting characters. And that is what makes this novel unique: the characters.Heller does an amazing job of developing every single person in the novel, giving them all a personality type of their own. Every personality in the novel adds a little something to the story. From Orr's obnoxious traits to Doc Daneeka's pessimistic outlook on life, all of the characters come together to show the horrifying truth of the madness of war. If one of the characters was missing, the novel just wouldn't have the same impact.The characters also do something besides helping to develop the story; they provide insight on many aspects of life. The discussions between characters in this book made me realize many important things. This book shows people that they shouldn't take things for granted or take advantage of people. Heller does this by showing the effect that it had on the characters that did those things. This novel is a real eye-opener.Heller also achieves a feat that many other authors haven't: a perfect blend of horror and humor. Although the novel is full of disgusting depictions of war, I often found myself chuckling. And at some points, I laughed out loud, which is something I do only if I find something truly hilarious. For example, about halfway through the novel, Yossarian has to constantly look over his shoulder because he is being stalked by a prostitute who is trying to kill him for something that he didn't even do.Overall, this is an outstanding novel. Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" is a masterpiece that should be read by anyone and everyone. It is a perfect blend of the horror and hilarity that is full of insight. It's definitely one of the best novels that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"&quot;Catch 22&quot; is one of the funniest books anyone's ever read. I use that phrasing intentionally because pretty much everyone who's read it, it seems, considers it one of the funniest books they've ever read. In fact, it's difficult to imagine anyone not finding this book utterly charming, despite the obvious dark themes which any novel about war will address. Nearly every single character in this work is hilarious, though they are extremely varied-no two are alike. This book shouldn't take very long for anyone to read, even though they'll probably be interrupted constantly by their own incessant gut-laughing."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"As a high schooler, I would recommend &quot;Catch-22&quot; to anyone who isn't intimitated by larger books. This book is a novel about war and its prospects, morals, and the effects it has on the people within it. The narrator focuses on the events occuring in the camp of Pianosa, located on an island off the coast of Italy. The main character, Yossarian, gains morals and fights the system during World War II. It is very good a keeps the reader's attention. It's a nice variation from most dull high school reading, and I would rank this book right up there with &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;. If you are a high schooler looking for a challenging book, I would most certainly recommend &quot;Catch-22&quot;. (Didn't that sound like it came straight out of Reading Rainbow?)"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 was a very intriguing book to say the least. The main character, Yossarian, seemed to be a bit of an oddball, which kept all of the story lines quite interesting. At times Catch 22 can get rather confusing as Joseph Heller jumps back and forth between one story and another, not really making any smooth transitions between them which tends to throw you off as a reader. The entire story is based during World War II and much of it is spent in different countries around Europe. You, as the reader get to travel with Yossarian from country to country while he makes deliveries, bombing runs, and becomes acquaintances with many people, including a hooker that he becomes quite fond of. Much of the story has humorous sections that leave you laughing and wanting to read more only to find out what type of antics Yossarian will perform next, including a time when he decides to become a nudist on the military base at which he is stationed. Overall, Catch 22 is by far one of the best books I've ever read. It keeps you on your toes with humor and action, along with a plot that only thickens as you read further into the book. I recommend this book only to more advanced readers, however, as it can get quite complicated to understand."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"This book is funny. This book is the greatest parody of war ever written. This book is a work of genius. I am amazed every time I read this book at how apropos the title is and how Heller manages to weave his main point, the absurdity of war, throughout every story in this book. There is the classic scene in which the phrase Catch-22 is coined. You can only leave the war if you are crazy, but if you have the mental capacity to want to leave the war then you must be sane. An impossible situation for Yossarian, but what character does not live his life in accordance with absurdity? Major Major tells his secretary that no one is allowed in to his office to see him while he is in his office. Chief White Halfcoat can not settle down anywhere because men searching for oil will uproot him to dig for crude wherever he sets down. The man in Yossarian's tent can not be removed because he never signed in, but he can never sign in because he died before he was able to. Milo strafes the men of his own division for money because the money he is making is for the men. And all this time Snowden lays dying in the back. Throughout all this absurdity this haunting little story line continues to appear about Snowden lying in the sunlight at the back of the plane shivering to death. This is the most crucial moment in the book, for it is when Snowden spills his guts (literally) to Yossarian that the war becomes all too real. People are dying, real people, people that Yossarian knows, and he is powerless to stop it or explain it. It is during Snowden's death that Yossarian subscribes to this code of absurdity as all the other characters have in order to somehow cope with the concept of war. There is a brilliant scene in which some new recruits come in to camp. They are young and innocent. They set up their stuff in Yossarian's tent. They light Orr's wood, which was never to be used, and warm themselves over it. They take the nameless man's belongings and simply chuck them outside, ignoring the logic trap which has kept this dead man alive for so long. They are oblivious to the way things have been working in the world of this book because the war is still only a concept to them. There is no need for them to buy into absurdity fully, for they have yet to come across something they cannot cope with. Their Snowden is still alive, and their world still makes sense. Catch-22 is not merely a funny book with quirky characters. It is a testament to the only sort of mindset in which a war can make sense, the mindset of absurdity."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Captain John Yossarian is a bombardier for the 256th Squadron, stationed on the island of Pianosa in the Mediterranean. He's sick of having people try to kill him. He 's finally realized that anyone willing to fly into the face of enemy fire must be crazy, so he wants to go home, but there's a catch:There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. 'That's some catch, that Catch-22, he (Yossarian) observed. 'It's the best there is,' Doc Daneeka agreed.And so he's stuck flying more missions (and ever more as the number of missions required keeps getting increased.)Serving alongside him in the 256th are:Col.

It is at heart an antibureaucratic polemic. While the specific target is the military, the attack is universal.It is especially interesting that this is a novel of World War II. One of the more vacuous tribal drums that is beating beneath today's culture is for the cult of the Depression/WWII generation, or as Tom Brokaw's book call them, the Greatest Generation (see Orrin's review). There's this quaint myth that somehow the folks who lived through the Depression and fought in WWII were an especially selfless or patriotic crew. They certainly look good in comparison to the wholly self-centered Baby Boomers, but books like this and the works of James Jones &amp; Kurt Vonnegut offer a welcome antidote to the notion that they marched happily off to a war to save the world without a thought for themselves.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Despite a bit of sluggishness in the fourth fifth of this book, Heller managed to create a truly great book in a manner nobody had ever successfully pulled off before.Like the equally great SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE--really the only significant novel thematically similar to CATCH-22 written in anything like Heller's style--CATCH-22 is usually labeled an anti-war novel. I disagree. I think both are pro-humanity books. Heller and Vonnegut, like Voltaire centuries earlier, both seem to have reached a place when writing these classics where they could no longer stomach the absurdities of their day. It wasn't just war that nauseated them; it was the ease--the eagerness--in which they saw men become animals.They are, unfortunately, depressing books. Great books, but depressing nonetheless."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Although it lacks the credibility of Faulkner and Hemingway's works, Catch 22 is one of the better modern novels.

I read this at the beach a couple years ago in a few days, and annoyed everyone by giggling all day."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Heller's style is very similar to Kurt Vonnegut's, and being a huge Vonnegut fan, I really enjoyed Catch-22. The structure of the story was very interesting too - each chapter was about a different character, such that instead of getting a whole story, you get glimpses of the story from many different perspectives, which I think helped develop the characters very well.The Everyman's Library edition is a very good looking book. And not as bulky as usual hard covers."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Heller's masterpiece; Catch-22 (Set in WW2 the story of a bombardier named Yossarian who thinks everyone wants to get him killed) is so because of a multitude of reasons. The more literary aspects are known but what I found most endearing was the sheer class of humour he uses. From seemingly absurd sentences rises the glory of a dark dry humour. I was in splits throughout the book!Read the book if you are dying to read something really great and really different. Also, read the book if your are feeling depressive. Its that good!If you are in two minds I can suggest a sure fire way to resolve your doubt. Get your hands on and read any 2-3 page excerpt. If you don't fall in love don't buy it. But I must warn you that you would probably end up wishing to get your hands onto the book real fast!The title itself is a mirror to whats inside.

The average rating so far is 4 1/2. Why are you bothering to read my review, isn't that recomendation enough?You want more? Fine.I give this book 5 stars because it is the most ingenious, funny and entertaining book I have read in a long time. It is not so much a novel, but a collection of stories about a squadron group in WW2 which somehow all tie in together. Each character has their own foibles, and each is described in amusing detail. At time it does repeat itself (how many times is Snowden's death referred to?), but this doesn't detract from the great wartime yarns that are being told.

Their are a whole lot of plot threads that arise that you don't find out about until a great deal of the way through the book. But after I got through the first 75 pages the novel began to come into picture.Heller's book is ...funny in places and also pretty sad in others. For people who don't find this book funny they need to lighten up. Though the humor is far from sophisticated it's still pretty hilarious. I loved the whole backwards name thing, Washington Irving and Irving Washington. And how can you not laugh at Major Major Major. General Dreedle scaring ... people by threatening to have them shot is also great.The book can be pretty sobering too. Yossarian is dreadfully affraid dying and when he has a nervous breakdown in the air you are watching someone unravel.Overall this is one of my favorite books.

My take on the book was that the circle of insanity was the very thing that was holding the characters together to make it through their lives, keeping them sane. Life is often a contradiction. Like the good ol' military term: Hurry up, and wait.When I watched the movie of this same title I was literally ill by the way the characters were portrayed. Read the book, it's a whole other story. You never once get a sense of the pain that the characters are suffering through in the movie, as you do in the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 by Joseph Heller is a very strange novel. It definitely has its high and low points like every novel. This book however seemed a little more confusing than some other books that I have read in the past. There were definitely many twists and turns throughout the story.Catch-22 is about a fighter pilot named Yossarian. Yossarian is a man that finds himself in the middle of World War II. He is very confused about what is going on but he is the only man that seems to know that his life is in jeopardy. During the novel he takes you on many different adventures. Some of them are quite funny while others are totally confusing. He does not like the position he is in and he wants to get out of the war before he is killed. Throughout the novel he runs into many different and interesting people. While all of this is going on he is still trying to save his own life by trying to get out of the war. This is where he runs into all of these different catches which forbid him from exiting duty.Overall I thought that this was a very good novel. Throughout the book I ran into several confusing and misleading parts but it all seemed to make a connection later on in the book. I think that the author did a very good job writing the novel. It kept me very entertained. I would highly recommend this book, although the reading level is a little more advanced I think that it is suitable for any high school student looking for a bit of a challenge."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"What can I say...I was blown away by this book.

This will give you a better perspective as to what is happening and why.I thought it to be an excellent movie and well worth the money and time spent viewing it--in fact, I watched it twice--so far."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"\\"It's a Catch 22.\\" It seems I've heard the phrase all of my life and never been able to put my finger on what it actually meant. Reading the book mostly clarified it. A Catch 22 is illogical thinking, explained in a logical manner contrived to suit the people who make the rules. For example: If you are crazy, you should not be in the army. How does one go about getting classified as crazy? You'd have to tell the doctor you are. Having the insight to tell the doctor though, means you are sane.It's difficult. I liked it - don't get me wrong, but the man has an extensive vocabulary and really seems to enjoy using it. Also, he's a bit crazy and reading crazy sometimes makes me feel it.It's an Anti-War story written about the Second WW. I guess when Vietnam was going on these books were really important - they showed the pain of war, rather than the glory. I've read a couple of them in the past year or so and I feel almost the same about each. I get why they were written but I don't identify. I feel like I've missed something almost by not having a comparative analysis of my own.It's also a black comedy, but by the end I couldn't shake the \\"black\\" enough to enjoy the \\"comedy.\\"I really did like it, I just don't think for the same reasons it became a best seller.The main character of this book is Yossarian, though he is not in all of the chapters. He is a philosophical character whose anecdotes constantly put him in center stage. His demise is heartbreaking, his brilliance is beautiful and his thoughts are totally soulful."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22 is a collage of bittersweet revelations. Joseph Heller shows you fault after fault in mankind, but does so with such enjoyable dry wit that you hardly realize he's pulling apart your perception of reality at the seams. It's a good thing, too, since otherwise it would be 430 pages of despair and hopelessness. By the end, perhaps, you might even be glad he flipped your view of life upside-down.The majority of the plot focuses on Captain Yossarian, a lusty bombardier who's convinced that everyone's out to kill him and wants nothing more than to be sent home. He's stopped at every turn, however, by the titular rule catch-22. Heller doesn't focus on the actual rule itself--it's mentioned by name only a few times in the entire novel--but rather on what it embodies and stands for. It states that for an officer to be grounded, he must be crazy, but he has to ask for it, though if he asks to be grounded on the grounds that he is crazy, he must not be crazy. Throughout the novel, catch-22 mutates into a way that the military can justify whatever it does. To quote Yossarian and his friend Doc Daneeka, \\"That's some catch, that catch-22.\\" \\"It's the best there is.\\" (Heller, 55)Between Yossarian's storyline are dozens of smaller stories about everyone around him, from his commanding officer Colonel Catchcart to the chaplain. These, along with the rest of the chapters, occur only in partial chronological order. For every set of chapters that appear in order, Heller throws in a story completely out of order. Sometimes they help explain the events of the surrounding chapters, but other times they seem to be shuffled around capriciously. The side stories also have a tendency to grow somewhat tedious, mostly because of a lack of dialogue and movement. It isn't unusual for Heller to continue a single paragraph for several pages; he has a liking for run-on sentences as well. Still, none of them are unbearably long or boring and they do give the reader a chance to see events from the multiple characters' points of view.Most of the book takes place in the Air Force base where Yossarian lives, but there are a smattering of scenes set in Rome and smaller locations throughout Italy. Heller obviously did his research on WWII, as there's very accurate descriptions of technology from that era. Unless the reader was there themselves, they might come out wondering if Heller was actually a bombardier himself.Catch-22 is the epitome of military satire, but Heller doesn't let his choice of setting limit himself. Nothing is safe against ridicule: society, bureaucracy, and humans themselves all fall prey to his dark wit. Still, for all his jabbings in the ribs of life, his humor usually stays well away from being tasteless. If you do throw Catch-22 down in disgust, it's probably because you just realized how incompetent man really is. In that way, his style is somewhat similar to Douglas Adams, though more subtle and less quirky. Heller's sense of humor may be so subtle, in fact, that readers more used to conventional and obvious humor may completely miss some of the implied jokes. Mixed in with the biting comedy are ideas that really make the reader think: \\"You're inches away from death every time you go on a mission. How much older can you be at your age?\\" (Heller, 48) At times it seems like Heller is softening the reader up with humor just so he can blindside them with a ponderous thought.Despite it's age, Catch-22 is a surprising accessible read. It's hardly a book for young adults; Heller obviously wrote his most famous work for a very adult audience. There is some rough language and adult themes. Some readers may be intimidated by it's length, but aside from a few sluggish parts, the book can get rather exciting.Readers with a bit of patience and an open mind will probably enjoy this novel. Heller will make you laugh, cry, and possibly rethink your outlook on life. Even before you turn the last page, you will understand why Catch-22 has earned its influential place in literature history."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch 22 is among the funniest books I've ever read. This story of a sane man in an insane world follows an airman's exploits in Europe during World War II. Yossarian, the main character, has only one goal: to stay alive when so many people are trying to kill him.The characters of the book, comprised mainly of members of his unit and various higher-ups, are well-developed and lead to a lot of laughs. Because of the depth and quantity of characters like Milo Minderbender and Major Major, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of who's who but well worth the read."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Every character is free to think what they want of themselves, and of anyone else they come in contact with. Everyone is paranoid of everyone else being crazy, no one can truly diagnose someone else as being crazy, for if a pilot says he should be grounded because he's crazy, he's showing concern for his well being, therefore he can't be crazy. By saying you're crazy, you're not crazy. I live in a major metropolitan city, and strangely enough, although not to me, every character is free to think what they want of themselves, and of anyone else they come in contact with. Everyone is paranoid of everyone else being crazy, no one can truly daignose someone else as being crazy. It's strange how art imitates life, or perhaps I'm crazy and I'm just seeing life imitate art. But if I say i'm crazy.....Best part of the book was when Yo-Yo starts moaning outloud at the sight of General Dreedles nurse, and then everyone else starts moaning outloud right along side of him, right in front of their General. I was in stiches. This is a masterpiece, I look forward to reading it again and again.Best quote: &quot;I yearn for you tragically&quot;, or &quot;..because they had never taken Danby outside and shot him before.&quot;Oh. My. God."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I rad this book as a Junior in high school a year ago and has convinced that it was quite possibly the best book ever. It has a dry yet witty sense of humor and its many characters and a diverse spread. All of the characters are different in there own way and make you smile. True the book does take a dark twist about 3/4 the way through but the end inspires us with the everpresent idea of hope, peace, and resolution."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"While this book is draining, emotionally, mentally, and even somewhat physically, it certainly deserves is position as one of the ten greatest novels of all time. This cleverly written work of fiction is filled with masterfully utilized irony, paradox, humor, and suspense. It is a shocking novel that makes you chuckle, but with regret. Yossarian is one of the most unforgettable protagonists, the ultimate anti-hero. In addition, the novel is lush with characters crafted to make you laugh, cry, gasp, or pound your fist in rage. I once read another review of this novel in which the reviewer said the novel was &quot;frustrating.&quot; I agree, to an extent. It is frustrating because Yossarian is constantly trying to get himself out of a horrible situation, but he keeps getting sucked back in and trapped (hence Catch-22). If you are looking for an easy read, this is not it. But if you are searching for a fun, hilarious ride of a book, you've made a wise decision."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Don't read this book because it is a classic. Read it because it is damn good.Catch-22 is the type of book that will make you laugh, make you cringe and make you think. This is a story that will enchant you with its characters, its humor, its descriptions and its truths.Catch-22 is not a pacifist rant. The morality of fighting World War II isn't the issue here. It is about the abuses of power, politics and hypocrisy that occur within military organizations during war. Yossarian is a man who has already gone beyond the call of duty for his country, yet is forced beyond his breaking point by men who are more interested in wealth and power than in concluding the conflict.In our lives and work, most of us observe people making decisions driven by personal ambitions and ego to the detriment of all around them. Catch-22 is a dark comedy of those traits when they play out in the most lethal business of all: the business of war.Heller's writing style breaks many of the literati's proscribed rules. He makes heavy use of repetition, along with strings of adjectives and adverbs. Although the story spends a lot of time exploring the characters, it does little to develop its nonlinear plot. Nevertheless, I found the rhythm of his writing hypnotic and engaging. You'll find yourself turning the pages to learn more about the people of the story."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I cannot think why it has taken me nearly forty years to read Heller's masterpiece. It lived up to all I had ever heard. The hero (?) Yossarian is desperate to get away from the insanity of war. The Catch is that he cannot convince the authorities of his madness because anyone wanting to get away from the war must be sane. This is the thread, which runs through the book. In the process we meet a host of bizarre, comic and tragic characters. There is the brilliant Major Major Major who will only allow men to come in and see him when he is out. In fact the higher they go the madder they get - Cargill, Cathcart, Dreedle and the wonderful Scheisskopf whose dream is to put his men in a parade. But for me the genius of the book is in the creation of Milo Minderbinder who manages to turn the war into an unrivalled business opportunity. Throughout the book there is the haunting spectre of Snowden - what really happened to him.I cannot imagine that there is a more entertaining, more gripping and more powerful account of the insanity of war. Nobody should go through life without reading this."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"While this was one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read it does one thing poorly. It does not [tick]people off enough. After reading this book one sighs and thinks that there is simply no hope for the human race. People are too stupid and self-motivated.Before we lose the little freedom and privacy that we possess in this fine but quickly faltering country please take a look at How to Save America and the World by Joseph Francione. It connects the dots in such a way as to show what to do after faced with the likes of the idiots in Catch 22."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I have read hundreds of books, and the enormous amount of hype surrounding this novel is unparalleled. Personally, I attribute most of it to the chance luck of Heller in creating the often used phrase \\"Catch-22.\\" Essentially, he coined a phrase that became an advertisement for the book. If his title had been something slightly less appealing like \\"Catch-33\\" or if the term \\"Catch-22\\" was used but hidden in the text, rather than used as the title, no one would have ever heard of this book.Another important attribute of this hype is the hipster element of Heller's title phrase. It seems to imply that someone who read the book is deeply philosophical or understands a truth not many know. This is not just my own imagination. In college, I knew a guy who having already read the book, brought it (on a plane, cross country) seemingly to display in his dorm room. Once, apropos of nothing, he picked it up and explained that it was his favorite book. Coincidently, he also happened to be a dandy who wore (I think) satin shirts.Heller's prose is plain and uninspired rather than brilliant or funny. Worse yet, it goes on and on. Incidents which might have made mediocre short stories get added together and filled out to a torturing tediousness. Characters are wooden. Dialogue and prose are mostly indiscernible from each other, except that the first is surrounded by quotation marks. The result is too silly and boring to be a satire. This is not Swift, or Graves's \\"I, Claudius\\", instead I would compare it to Graham Greene's horrible \\"Our Man in Havana.\\"This is the sort of book that you might hear people discuss at snobbish cocktail parties. If you get a third way it into and you are bored to tears, drop it like a brick, or better yet, avoid reading it all together."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Pathetic.I forced myself to finish this book because it was heralded as &quot;one of the greatest novels of the century.&quot; I found it an amazing chore to trudge through page after page of absurd, repetitive babble, replete with needless descriptions of depraved immorality.If the point is that government/military institutions are insanely inefficient and bureaucratic, ok. I got that in the first 100 pages. Were the next 400 pages simply meant to illustrate that point -- making me &quot;experience&quot; the absurdity?. I really can't believe I read the whole thing.In all sincerity, I can not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I will not pay $12.99 for a Kindle book. I think the publisher is loosing money by trying to sell it at this price. I can buy it on Amazon for $4.00."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I cannot see why this book is considered a 20th century classic.It was a chore to trudge through it.What is the point? Yes yes, war is hell, and yes, the military has a lot of stupid regulations, but really, is it all really necessary?This book is apparently supposed to be funny. Perhaps the monotonous dialogue that I imagine is supposed to pass as witty banter was new and funny in the '50's, but now it is just tiring.An example:\\"...I have a liver condition.\\"\\"Oh yes, I forgot,\\" said Milo, in a voice lowered deferentially. \\"Is it bad?\\"\\"Just bad enough,\\" Yossarian answered cheerfully.\\"I see,\\" said Milo. \\"what does that mean?\\"\\"It means that it couldn't be better.\\"\\"I don't think I understand.\\"\\"...without being worse. Now do you see?\\"\\"Yes, now I see. But I still don't think I understand.\\"\\"Well, don't let it trouble you. Let it trouble me. You see, I don't really have a liver condition. I've just got the symptoms. I have a Garnett-Flieschaker syndrome.\\"\\"I see,\\" said Milo. \\"And what is a Garnett-Flieschaker sybnrome?\\"A liver condition.\\"Hilarious right?\\""},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I know people will downvote me like crazy for this review, so shame on me for being honest, I guess.I was disappointed with this book. I had borrowed it from the library recently and tried sitting through it. I mainly borrowed it because of all the praise it got and the amount of hype surrounding it. I do enjoy a little \\"brain popcorn\\" now and then, so I'd enjoy it.I didn't.First off, the writing here is garbage. Actually, it's every bit as bad as Twilight. The worst crime with the writing is that, like the aforementioned Twilight saga, Heller does more telling than showing. Yeah, the gun is across the room. you don't need to tell us that. How about \\"Clevinger was surprised to discover the inexorable hatred of the Action board, which was the strangest of many things happening\\". That is way better than, paraphrasing here, \\"There were many strange things happening. The strangest of all was the inexorable hatred of the Action Board. Clevinger was surprised to discover it.\\" There are more examples of that throughout the book, and they are WAY longer than the one I provided. There are several run-on sentences and examples of bad grammar, which are annoying. And the dialogue is just \\"shoot me in the head\\" awful. Further, he abuses such tags as \\"He lied\\" or \\"He questioned\\", which gets repetitive.The plot? Was there even any plot? I could hardly distinguish one. Just random events happening. Also, the book tries to make itself like a movie by jumping around from character to character when it comes to certain things, something I hate. The names are stupid too- Major Major Major Major? Colonel Korn? I get that this book is meant to be a satire, but those names are just childish. Hell, even Family Guy is more creative with the names.Was the book funny? In some parts it was. I'll admit, the first three chapters are so absurdly funny, it's beautiful. And the ending was funny as well- I felt like someone had spiked my coffee with LSD by the time I got to the end.Lastly, the book's worst crime is that it's downright BORING. There's hardly any plot here, the characters, particularly Yossarian, are unlikeable and shallow, and the book is too long for its own good, yet simultaneously not long enough for the amount of stuff crammed in it.Overall, this book was incredibly frustrating to read. If you want a good satire, read Slaughterhouse Five. It's better than this.OK guys, I am now ready to be crucified for my negative review. Hammer away at the nails."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I didn't even finish this book. Completely lost me. I think I just didn't get it. Hopefully that is not a sign of my intelligence.

This book just tries too hard to be funny without any attempt to build on the storyline and the characters. Unfortunately this was twenty bucks I won't get back.

And??? The characters are relentlessly stupid and I never felt, for a second, like I would ever want to have to do with them.Yossarian dumps his bombs willy nilly (of course, nobody ever questions that he might be dropping them on civilians or that the bombers might have to go back to do the job he failed to, and thus present more risk to his fellow Americans) and sticks around sick bay. What a guy.Bah!"},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Some of the passages in this novel made me chuckle a little. No much, though. The kind of humor employed was strange and I have never seen it before but it just wasn't that funny. The novel had no plot. I don't think it was ever meant to have a plot. But the thing I hated most about this incredibly boring novel was the author's style which when he wanted to refer to something he repeated what the think was completely and used no pronouns.

I hate this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"Catch-22, by Joseph Heller, stsarts out by introducing the characters. It takes place in World-War II with American soldiers in Italy. Yossarian is the name of the main character who often mentions wanting to be sent homw. Many of the characters are portrayed as crazy. This is illustrated when Yossarian stsates, \\"Then why don't you ground me? I'm crazy. Ask Clevinger\\"(54). By being grounded Yossarian is referring to being sent homw. The man he saks is Doc Daneeka, who wallows in his own self pity. Doc Daneeka answered Yossarian saying, \\"Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy\\"(55). The characters aren't caught up in the usuall \\"American Spirit.\\" Many of the men are questioning why they're even there.Much of the humor in this book is based on irony and the idiosyncraises of the characters. Many events that took place portrayed them as children, and the battle field their play ground. Most of the characters, especially Yossarian, spend most of their time trying to get out of flying the number of missions required to be sent home. Everyone tries to get someone else to do their job for them, which I found irritating.Most of the storyline of Catch-22 are the flashbacks provided by the narrator, more than the characters themselves. It's almost as if each flashback is it's own little story, mkaing it hard to follow any kind of rising action.As much as this book is recommended, I would ask readers to stay clear of it. The story lacked a climax, and the characters lacked a certain depth making it hard feel any kind of emotional connection. If you are still interested, I would recommend reading the first few chapters, then seeing if it is something you enjoy."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"I always wanted to read Catch 22 because it was a famous book (and of course the term was used in a Metallica song). I began reading it three times but after 50 pages or so, I always lost interest. I never could discover a story and the many dialogues and events are strange, to say the least. Someone once told me it is a great book after page 100 but I never got that far. So I can only say: don't even try reading Catch 22', read '1984' by George Orwell and listen to Metallica."},{"Title":"Catch 22","review":"In my words Catch-22 is overrated. This book could have been summed up in one chapter, and in all its wordiness the only point is that war is extremely boring. Although each chapter had something exciting, Joseph Heller droned on relentlessly about a single character. The climax of the book is when Yossarian is up in the bomber on a mission to Bologna and the gunners guts fall out, because a piece of flak went into his stomach. The whole time the gunner is crying out \\"I'm cold, I'm cold!\\" One side of the book that I liked was how Joseph Heller made each chapter about one person, which makes it slightly better, because the cast is always growing. Each character is unique, and I value that, but his subject matter poor.
