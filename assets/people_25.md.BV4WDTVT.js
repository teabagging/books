Hard read"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Published a few years after the acclaimed PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, this novel paints an intimate portrait of country gentry inearly 19th century England. Describing the social milieus with which she was so familiar, Austen alternates the plot development between modest estates and the seaside resorts of Lyme and Bath. Travel aand communication proved serious obstacles, so letters and notes were the more prized and preserved. Austen weaves a tapestry of strict social customs,explaining the value of keeping up appearances, of keeping one's place--which was clearly deliniated by time-honored class snobbery and ritual. Other themes which are quietly included:be wary of schemers, evaluate the counsel of interfering extended famly, and do not trust superficial impressions.Narrated in the usual third person, ths intense story revolves around Anne Elliot, the middle daughter of vain but impoverished Sir Walter. The author might well have chosen to make this a first person novel, since we always know what the modestprotagonist is doing, feeling and thinking. Austen gently ridicules the struggle between vanity and financial reality, as the family's streightened circumstances obliged them to rent out their beloved Kellynch Hall and take rooms in Bath. But where to find suitable tenants for the ancestral home? Their circle includes the neighboring Musgroves, whose son married the youngest Elliot daughter. Fortunately for the marriageablegirls, their limited horizons are expandaded by the arrival of three young naval captains--one of whom Anne was forced to renounce 7 years before. She represents the first victim ofof the art of familial persuasion. Yet her heart still beats fast at the mention of his name...Austen presents many themes and events which also appear in her signature novel; she deftly reveals a woman's intimate understanding of her heroine's private torment. The social ritual between country gentry is almost ridiculous in their extreme scruples regarding proper behavior--even to their own relatives and in-laws. Austen exposes the time-honored web of duty an public behavior, even on vacation. One wonders if the women of Austen's day were taught--direclty or indirectly--to value their own &quot;nothingness,&quot; as Anne puts it. Is a teachable heart (one that can be persuaded to reason, even in violation of its natural instincts, to be admired in that society? Or in our own time? Were Austen's women true Victorian ladies or more rational creatures thanmale authors of the time generally portrayed them? Anne pounced upon the eternal argument which provoked the denouement: which of the genders is more (or less) &quot;inconstant.&quot; These and many other soul-searching issues are elucidated in this short novel (225 pages) which should be evaluated by the standards of a by-gone era. Thoughtful readers must discern for themselves which truths are valid for all times; if they prove universal, then the work is a true classic. An insightful novel which will appeal to most caring women."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This wasn't my favorite Jane Austen, but I liked the main character better than some of the others I've read, like Emma. The main character, Anne, was sympathetic, and you felt bad for her through much of the book when she was putting up with the other insufferable characters. Jane Austen's books always manage to make me very glad that I didn't live in the Victorian Era. It would have been terrible to not be able to escape the very awful relations always described in her books. The expectations of poor relations seem nearly unbearable. I wouldn't have been able to bear the types of jabs Mary aimed at Anne regularly. It makes me very glad to live in a time when a woman earning her own living is not seen as a disreputable person."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My review isn't about the story aspect of the book, but rather the physical quality of this edition. It's, well, crap. I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. As someone else said, it looks cheap. As if this was some new author who had her book printed independently. And the print is miniscule. I never complain about print, but this book is just dreadful. Tiny print and the lines are extremely close together.I'm supposed to be reading this for my book club, but I strongly suspect I'm going to be looking for another edition to use. I suppose I got what I paid for; the quality of this one is just awful."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"have to admit, Jane Austen's Persuasion was just . . . pretty boring. The book mainly consists of the main character, Anne Elliot, hanging about until finally realizing that the man she really wants is a sailor whose love she turned away several years ago. Anne herself is not particularly interesting, nor are there the really fun, memorable characters like the father in Emma. The only dramatic incident in the book is one of Anne's acquaintances taking a tumble and bumping her head, but she's not really hurt and the whole incident is designed to help dispose of one of Anne's potential suitors. In six months I'll have completely forgotten what this book is about, but I will say it offers an interesting historical look at what daily life might be like in the lower-echelons of the the English gentry. It also demonstrates the high regard that Englishmen held for the navy as one of the few avenues for citizens of mundane birth to advance themselves into positions of power, wealth, and prestige.For essays, John Wiltshire's \\"Modern Interpretations\\" discusses how, although the slow-moving and even mournful Persuasion was Austen's final published novel, she was working on a \\"high-spirited satire\\" at the time of her death. Wiltshire also talks about a couple of recent filmed versions of the book. Maggie Lane's \\"Regency Life\\" has an interesting discussion on the role of the navy during the period in which Austen was writing, as well as the use of seaside resorts as places visited for both recreation and their supposed medicinal effects. Caroline Sanderson's \\"Geographical Settings\\" focusses primarily on Bath and Lyme Regis, while Josephine Ross' \\"A Modern Perspective\\" offers an interesting portrait of Jane Austen's own failed romantic pursuits and how that may have influenced her writing."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Overall, Persuasion was not bad, but I would have enjoyed it more with some plot adjustments.I felt like I was never well acquainted with the object of Anne Elliot's affection, Captain Wentworth. Although Austen described why Wentworth was such a good man, I did not participate much in Anne's love for him (although I did empathize with her feelings). There were great moments and good characters, but there could have been so much more in the relationship between Anne and Frederick Wentworth.Also, I was disappointed that the the end was summarized in narration. The climax of the story pertaining to the romance and to the foes of the family, though starting out well, ended too soon in narration rather than dramatic action."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Anne is the middle daughter of a snobbish and foolish lord living in Victorian England. Her mother died when she was a young teenager, and she has very little in common with her older sister or her younger sister. Anne's older sister is a carbon copy of their father, and the two of them managed to spend beyond their means, to the point that they now have to rent out their home and move someplace more affordable. Anne's younger sister has made a decent match in marriage and is now settled into a life that requires near constant attention from others, especially when one of her frequent imaginary illnesses pops up.Anne is mostly ignored by her family, and they don't know that she once had a brief attachment to a young naval officer, Frederick Wentworth. A family friend, Anne's surrogate mother figure, thought Anne would be able to find someone better, and advised her to break off her commitment. Anne took the advice, which resulted in devastation both for herself and for the young man.Now, seven years later, Wentworth's sister and her husband are renting Anne's family home. When the now-Captain Wentworth visits, he and Anne find themselves thrown into the same social circle, and spend many months trying to decide if they still have the same feelings for each other that they did so long ago.I liked this story, with its insight into the amount of effort it took for Victorians to make proper matches and ensure their way of life would continue. I liked the social rankings and the elaborate rules of behavior, which must have been absolutely stifling for someone living through this time.However, I didn't identify at all with Anne as a protagonist. I understand that rules of etiquette were different in those days, and it is difficult for me to read this book without looking through a modern-day filter. However, Anne had no sense of self-value, and only seemed to see herself as important when she was being \\"useful\\" to others. It is true that her family treated her as a tool, but I couldn't see how she could see herself that way and still have been attractive to the men who vie for her attention."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I'm a longtime Persuasion fan, and know the novel well. I bought the Brilliance Audio edition because it's tough to find unabridged versions and I like hearing my favorite old stories aloud.The tapes are certainly sturdy for repeated library lendings, and the narrator is easy to hear and understand, but otherwise Michael Page is the wrong reader for this story! His vocal characterizations are quavery and pinched, and don't usually fit the characters--or degrade them to farce level. The music signalling the end of each cassette is distracting, jarring even.Not a great reading of Persuasion. Not even a good intro to the novel for first timers, and terrible for those of us who know the characters already."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I rate this book three stars. This is the first book from Jane Austen I have read and am not accustomed to her style of writing. I liked this book very much, don't get me wrong, but at times it dragged on, going over tons of social class and position stuff. The end is expected, but suprising at the same time. There is romance in the book, but not enough for my satisfaction. But overall this books is a good one! I would definetly buy it regardless of my personal tastes."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"If (like me) you value Austen primarily for her wit, you may pass on Persuasion.Persuasion is a bit tedious. It's all mincing and moralizing, with none of the wit and good humor that make Pride and Prejudice worthwhile. Persuasion's protagonist, the wilting Anne Elliot, is a doormat for her self-involved relations, whom she not only tolerates but also excuses. Anne's blushing weakness may add to the melodrama (maybe the romance), but it also sucks all the satire out of the narrative. As a result, the reader is deprived of a richly deserved laugh at the pompous antagonists' expense. And without a good laugh, the story is hardly worth the trouble."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Let me start off by saying, maybe my review of this book is not fair- I have, so far, only read about 40% of it and was SO disgustingly BORED that I stopped & went on to another book.My first Jane Austen book that I read was Pride & Prejudice- I LOVED that book! I was very excited to start this book, hoping I would love it just as much as P&P...; but I have the exact oposite feeling about it. I was bored in the begining, but I forced myself to keep reading thinking that it would get better. Finally I just couldn't stand it & moved to another book. After reading so many good reviews on here, I will try to read it again- hopefully the 2nd time will be the charm- ?"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I bought them (Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, Mansfield Park and Emma) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"As an Austen fan I was disappointed. To a non Austen fan this book is akin to watching paint dry while listening to a 4 hour lecture on the intricacies of interpretive dance, followed by a cyborg reading the phone book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I would rank this one as the number 3 Austen book I've read, below Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. I like the heroine because she was well-developed. She wasn't purely weak and selfless like many heroines from this genre. The love story was kind of anti-climactic, but I still liked it because it was also not typical of this genre. The heroine wasn't only about pursuing her love. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a break from the cookie-cutter story lines and character development of contemporary fiction."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"this is terrible. you cannot read it because the lines are all misaligned. a complete waste of money."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen is my favorite author when it comes to the classics. Her writing is timeless. It's delicate, romantic & sometimes humorous. All these years later you can still read her work and enjoy it.I liked Anne, I think she was just too young and naive when she broke off her engagement to Wentworth and in seeing him again all those years later, she was more mature and knew what she wanted for herself. I like Wentworth, he's now my second favorite Austen hero, the man can write a wonderful love letter. This was a great novel, the storyline was really good.Wentworths love letter is divine!'I can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach. You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own, than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago'"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Readers of Jane Austin will immediately recognise the basic plot of Persuasion: single women/girls being courted by men of various levels of eligibility. Two sisters (a third is already married) and their father, a minor noble, have fallen on hard times. Sir Walter Elliot has been widowed, they have lived beyond their means, and now they must rent out the family estate and live in diminished circumstances in Bath. The putative heir to the estate, cousin William Elliot, is vain and arrogant, refusing any interaction with the family.The main character of Persuasion is Anne, the disregarded middle Elliot daughter. She is kind, gentle, and tolerant, which puts her is rigid conflict with the rest of her family who are pompously jealous of rank and privelege. In fact, the rest of the Elliot family supplies much of the satire for the novel: their scheming to arrange meetings with their betters and the scorn they show to their lessers. This reviewer might even go so far as to say that the humour is not so much satirical as it is ascerbic - nowhere else does Austin seem to dislike her characters so much, and to make them the objects of such ridicule. This is not a criticism, as this ascerbic wit sets up many funny moments and observations; more, I think, than any of her previous works.Unfortunately, I found this to be the most confusing of Austin's works: I had trouble keeping track of all the characters. Confusion is increased because all the men seem to be named Charles! Luckily, a thorough knowledge of all the characters is not required to follow the main storylines (although the reader might miss a few subtle jokes).I'm not an expert on Jane Austin, nor on English literature. However, I have read most of Austin's works, and this layman's opinion is that Persuasion is enjoyable and the funniest of Austin's works."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have read a couple of other Jane Austen novels, and I think this one stands with the best of them. Although we all know it will have a happy ending, Austen sustains the emotional suspense of *how* Anne and Wentworth will finally reunite, and I was not disappointed. Wentworth's letter brought tears to my eyes; it was so wrenchingly emotional and bare. Aside from the romantic plot line, this novel also draws a clear and humorous picture of the characters and social dynamics of the time, which I found fascinating. I recommend this book highly, especially to those who may be new to Austen, as it is shorter and less complicated that some of her more famous ones. The ending makes it all worthwhile!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The novel Persuasion by Jane Austen is very good. Although slow at places, it definatly redeems itself throughout the novel. The protagonist, Anne, is in love with a man, but is persuaded out of love because of his social status. The book is a classic romatice novel, but is not cheesy to say the least. I encourage everyone who enjoys a good novel to read this book, but especially females. This book is centered around the social status and appearance of the people in the early 1800's. The way Anne doesn't care, makes her differant than the rest of the characters, but also helps the reader consider thinking for themselves instead of being persuaded by other people's thoughts. By the end of the novel, the reader has the decision whether persuasion is good or bad. I really enjoyed the novel. The reader just needs to be able to make it through the first couple of chapters, then the book is really enjoyable."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Not all readers are captivated by this quiet, sad, reflective work. But it is also very joyful. It is Jane Austen toward the end of her life reflecting once again on love, companionship and the eternal knot of family, class and society. Anne Elliot is one of the truly abiding heroines of the modern novel: gentle ,wise, politic and balanced. She is a young, beautiful woman thwarted in an early love by societal and family interests. But it is a joy to see her rise again by the recognition of others seeing these same virtues. This is very different novel than Pride and Prejudice but if you don't think it as great a novel meditate again on its resonant power."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"As a fan of Jane Austen and one who ranks \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" among the great literary accomplishments of the millennium, it disappoints me to rate \\"Persuasion\\" as a ho-hum novel. Unfortunately, the book fulfils the expectations of a two-hundred-year-old romance novel from Old England: dull.The book has a strong and compelling intro. Anne Elliot is one of three daughters of widower Sir Walter Elliot, a vain but financially challenged baronet whose daughters have reached marrying age. As a young lady, Anne had a romance with a certain Captain Wentworth, but this relationship breaks up for reasons that are dribbled out over the course of the book, and Wentworth goes off with the Navy for many years. The story line then wanders off in no apparent direction for a couple of hundred pages as we are introduced to other characters and led thru events with unclear purpose or relevance. But Wentworth reappears on the scene and slowly the plot evolves. Austen tries to persuade us to keep reading with mild intrigue over the Elliot estate, conniving cousins, convoluted love triangles, and the ultimate question: will Anne and the Captain reignited their romance?Although Anne Elliot is a strong and likable character, she seems to do little to advance her own cause. Things just seem to happen to her. While Austen's sentence-by-sentence prose is as beautiful and lyrical as ever, she does an insufficient job in the book's middle of persuading contemporary readers, who prefer faster-paced fiction, to brave the huge passages of wordy exposition and press on to the end. Rabid Austen fans, readers of romance novels, and lovers of classic literature will undoubtedly appreciate Persuasion, but I hesitate to recommend it as an introduction to Jane Austen. I'm afraid that if this were her only novel, she'd have been lost to the ages. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I especially love the extra information for further study that is provided within this edition. There are many fascinating, scholarly essays in the back of it. :) Great buy!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"When people think of Jane Austen they think of her major works such as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Emma\\" but I think that \\"Persuasion\\" is one of her best books that is often overlooked.

One of my all time favorite books."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Short and Sweet Review, by Michelle:Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel. I love Anne. Despite being a sensible heroine, she's also a true romantic and I can completely relate to that. Even the sensible girls love and want to be loved in return.

Cirian Hinds makes a delicious Captain Wentworth. ;)"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Anne Elliot is the quiet, tractable daughter of a widower to whom rank and consequence is of first importance in his life. She's never gotten over her first love, Frederick Wentworth, whom she was convinced not to marry, as he lacked both status and wealth. Now, at 27, she's fated to be a spinster for life, passed back and forth between her father and equally status-conscious elder sister and her hypocondriac, self-centered younger sister.Frederick Wentworth, on the other hand, did not pine away, but joined the Royal Navy and made a not-inconsiderable fortune. A series of strange events forces them into each other's company again, but Anne is reluctant to show any favoritism for fear of looking like a fortune hunter, and Captain Wentworth has no desire to be burned again.This is one of Jane Austen's quieter novels. We know from the beginning Anne and the Captain will fall in love all over again -- the enjoyment is in getting there. Not quite up there with her other novels, in my opinion, but if you're a fan of Jane Austen or just the genre, it's worth a read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I'm slowly becoming a Jane Austen fan.

So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple.

I am in my forties now and seem to have gained a deeper appreciation for Anne Eliot's heroic character-- heroic in the moral sense...if we had had Anne Eliots for Wallstreet Bankers we would not be in the trouble we are in now, and truly, honestly, Austen is superb in subtly building her arc of suspense with enough plot twists worthy of any Hollywood blockbuster...which is why, if she had lived today she'd be a Nora Ephron and have a great movie out every other year.The novel also served as the proverbial mirror, or as so many have argued, true art is holding up a mirror to Nature...looking into that mirror myself, I felt many personal shortcomings vis a vis patient and virtuous Anne, and I think the next generation, my children's generation which I think of as the \\"on demand\\" generation would greatly benefit from exploring this novel and mirroring their own commonalities and shortcomings on someone like Anne...Inez Hollander Lake[...]"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My wife loves owning the classics (including Austen) and went looking for a good hardcover publisher of her favorite books.

It starts out very slow, but once you get into the story, it is splendid."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is the 6th published novel by Jane Austen. Anne Elliott is a sweet 27-year-old woman of good breeding and integrity. She is intelligent, thoughtful, considerate. This may come as a surprise, given that, after losing her mother at 14, she has been encumbered with a father, Sir Walter Elliot, and an older sister, Miss Elizabeth, who are both vain spendthrifts and find her inconsequential; both of whom are blind to the fact that Elizabeth's poorer \\"friend\\", the fawning Mrs Clay, is intent on marrying Sir Walter to become Lady Elliot. Her younger, married sister, Mary is selfish and self-centred. The only person in her life who cares about her at all is a friend of her mother's, Lady Russell, who, when Anne was nineteen, persuaded her not to accept the offer of sailor Frederick Wentworth, as he had no position. Lady Russell tries to persuade Anne, when her estranged cousin, William, heir to the Elliot estate, reappears, that it would be prudent to accept his offer. But Anne is suspicious of his change of attitude. This is the last full novel written by Jane Austen, probably her most mature novel, and it is a great pity she died not long after this novel was completed. This novel has intrigue and humour and, of course, romance. Truly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My Thoughts:Persuasion is one of my favorite movie adaptations in the world. I could watch the Masterpiece Theater version over and over without getting sick of it. That's how much I love it. Since I had never read a Jane Austen book before, I decided to go with that one for my Summer Romance Challenge. I have to admit it was not easy at first. The very beginning with the details on the family and friends of the family was a struggle to get through. I think the reason why is because I know the story so well from the movie. Once more dialogue came about, it became very enjoyable.Anne Elliot was once engaged to Frederick Wentworth when she was very young. Since her friend Lady Russell didn't approve of the match, she persuaded Anne to break off the engagement. Fast forward eight years later. Anne's father Sir Walter and sister Elizabeth have nearly brought the family to bankruptcy. They have to let the house to someone while they get things back to where it should be financially. The person who takes up residency is Admiral and Mrs. Croft. And guess who happens to be the brother of Mrs. Croft? You guessed it--Frederick, now Captain Wentworth.So now Anne is forced into being around him often, watching him from afar, imagining him as not wanting anything to do with her. Especially when it seems he is preferring the company of another. As time goes on, he gets to see a different side of her, how selfless she is. And when it seems he is attentive to her, Mr. Elliot, her cousin, seems to be very interested in Anne. But where does Anne stand? Does she have a chance with Frederick again?Like I said, this is one of my favorite movie adaptations. Reading the book was like icing on the cake, completely put it all into perspective, getting into the mind of the characters. Jane Austen really is an amazing author. I wish I hadn't taken so long to read one of her novels. Definitely one of the best classics I've read so far.My Rating:Very Good... Stay up late"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is only the second Jane Austen book I have read, having read Pride and Prejudice some time ago. It took me a little while to get into it. The early chapters feel like they get bogged down in bringing us up to date with the back story. However it's worth persevering as the book gets much easier to read as it develops. Jane Austen's observations on society of that time and the way that she captures the feelings of the protagonists feel so fresh and modern that at times it is hard to believe that the book was written almost 200 years ago.The heroine is Anne Elliott, the middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliott: a vain and snobbish man who has been living beyond his means for some time. For financial reasons he decides to rent out his family home, Kellynch Hall, and moves to Bath with his oldest daughter who shares his obsession with status and appearances. Anne goes to stay for a time with her younger sister, Mary, who is married and lives nearby. Anne is easily the most likeable of the three girls, but is still single at the age of 27. Several years ago she met the love of her life, Captain Wentworth, but she was \\"persuaded\\" by her friends and family that he was not an appropriate match for her. She has never forgotten him.As it happens, Captain Wentworth comes back into her life, as it is his sister who has hired Kellynch Hall. However he appears to no longer have any interest in Anne and spends his time with the daughters of Mary's husband's family. In the meantime a new suitor has come into Anne's life, being her father's probable heir. He is pleasant and polite and certainly a good catch - but she finds it hard to let her feelings for Captain Wentworth go. When she finally realises who she is meant to be with, the book feels as alive and the romance as intense as any chicklit novel you might read today.I read the Brandywine edition of the book. The font size is quite small and densely packed. I probably would have preferred to read another version with an easier layout to read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book may be pure fantasy, but it is my favorite Jane Austen novel. Who doesn't enjoy the idea of love lasting, even after betrayal, for so long. Anne made a mistake, but all is not lost. Captain Wentworth is every girl's dream and the scene at the concert is probably my favorite in any novel ever."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Most people love Pride and prejudice, but Persuasion is my absolute favorite book by Jane AustenJane Austen is THE most brilliant author all times.I find all romance novels of today based loosely on the format that she followed for her classicsI so WISH there were more books by herThe chemistry and the connection between the Anna and Capt fredrick is extremely soulful. You can feel it jump out at you from the pages and so like the unforgettable characters that make up all Jane Austen's BooksA true masterpiece"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"SLIGHT SPOILERSSo, Persuasion. Austen has an uncanny ability to create characters who are so petty and unlikable that one simply wants to put the book down, for lack of someone with sense. This problem, for me, brings Northanger Abbey to its knees, and weighs down Persuasion for the first seventy pages. It's a while before we get to be inside Anne Elliot's head, and in the meantime we must satisfy ourselves with her imbecilic, preening father and his protegee daughter, Elizabeth. But finally, we get to Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth, to marriage intrigue and the questioning of glances and motives--all of the things for which one absolutely loves Austen. This book provides the goods, so don't give up on it too early.Persuasion is it's own creature, however. I was immediately struck by the difference in style from her earlier book Pride and Prejudice; in Persuasion, Austen strings together dependent clauses as though the story desperately required the reader to be in suspense as to what verb she will next employ. Take, for instance, the reader's first impression of Bath:\\"They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer; the rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.\\"Some will take pleasure in reading these lines, but I personally think they do her no credit. At its best, her prose style is lucid, and suffused with that clean, English wit we expect. That being said, I find Austen more charming than aesthetically stunning, and to my tastes, her simplicity of style adds to that charm. Her convolutions detract from it.This issue was exacerbated by the decision of the editor, Gillian Beer, to not standardize punctuation. Austen has a tendency to interrupt an otherwise complete clause with a comma, which is off-putting to modern readers and detracts from her otherwise fluid style. Likewise, there has been no attempt to regulate her use of the semicolon, which 19th century authors used with abandon. Beer might argue that these editorial decisions might affect interpretation, but I never noticed a moment when emphasis might depend upon an otherwise superfluous comma. Furthermore, if there had been any instance where punctuation greatly affected meaning, I think Beer would have mentioned it in her notes--she was so very thorough. Incidentally, this lack of editorial judiciousness brings me to my final contention with the edition.While there are different opinions as to the proper domain of footnotes, I believe they exist for only a few purposes. 1.) They should explain historical and cultural references that may otherwise be outside the reader's ken. 2.) They should explain a historical use of a word that a modern reader may otherwise not know. 3.) They should give manuscript variations, when applicable. They should not (in my opinion) explain turns of phrase, or help the reader interpret the plot, or offer critiques of the novel. My reasoning is that these three tasks belong to the reader; for an editor to do all the heavy lifting actually detracts from the pleasure of reading the book. For instance, when Mr. Elliot implies that he would like to marry Anne, he says,\\"The name of Anne Elliot,\\" said he, \\"has long had an interesting sound to me. Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\\"To this excellent, shining line of dialogue, Beer graciously provides a footnote: \\"An oblique proposal: her name and his are the same, Elliot.\\" This is completely unnecessary, and for me mars the beauty of the original sentence. Also, it is inconceivable that the reader might not yet know that both Anne and Mr. Elliot share the same last name, as this exchange occurs late in the book. Unfortunately, this is not the only stupid footnote in the Penguin edition. For the sake of space, I will refrain from listing any others.On the whole, this is a fine novel; not as accomplished as some of Austen's other work, but very engaging and fun to read. She seems to be a bit more moralistic as here well, which is not to my taste, but may be to others. Oh that Mr. Elliot and his \\"Sunday travelling\\"--ought he not to be in church? My only complaint with the novel itself (other than the occasional tortuous/torturous sentence) is the speedy resolution, which I felt could have benefited from a couple more scenes concerning the novel's two main antagonists--a confrontation would have been nice here. Also, I felt Austen took the easy way out by not forcing Anne to make a choice between two eligible suitors. Otherwise, if you like Austen, this is probably exactly what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was my first foray into Jane Austen. I must admit it took a while for me get accustomed to the literary style, but once I got into the flow of it, I quite enjoyed it. I am looking forward to reading more of her classic works!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although I am an English major and have always loved reading, I confess that when I picked up Persuasion, it was the first Jane Austen book I had ever actually read. Watching the films had made me love the stories, but I had never truly experienced the original text. This is the only one I have read so far, and so declaring it my favorite seems a stretch. However I can say with confidence that at this moment, I can't think of another book I've read this year that I liked half so well.The characters in the book have personalities that range from immature to mature, logical to illogical, playful to disdainful, and shallow to deeply heartfelt. Jane Austen has a true talent of capturing real people, in moments of weakness, in strength, and just about everything in between. Anne's sister Mary is one who feels that the world is never quite kind enough to her, while her father feels a lack of need to be terribly kind to the world. Lady Russell, a friend and mentor of the heroine Anne, is logical and sensitive to family connection so much so that occasionally she cannot see the inherent flaws in those whom she is trying to reconnect. The main character, Anne, is a complex creature through whose eyes it is fascinating to watch the world. She is sweet and humble, yet occasionally sarcastic and unfailingly realistic.Another aspect of the book is the implicit value of integrity. Anne does not do anything which she feels to be untrue or unworthy, and she stands up for what she believes in despite the disapproval of her worldly father. One example of this is when she decides to visit an old school mate who has been both widowed and crippled instead of going with her father and sister to visit Lady Dalrymple, a distant cousin of the family who hold a title of nobility. Consistently throughout the book, there is a deep and unwavering determination to do the right thing.Jane Austen is able to capture the complex relationships between people and the intricacies of human nature in beautiful and captivating language, and her skill of tone allow the reader to be completely transported and involved in the world she writes from. I look forward to reading the rest of the books as soon as I can, for through fiction she seems to speak poignantly about my life in a way I couldn't. Sometimes she goes against the adage of \\"Show don't tell,\\" by summarizing conversations and describing peoples attributes without allowing the reader to see them in action. However, this is a matter of style, and no great downfall for the book itself."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Take this opportunity to read Persuasion, it will take your breath away.Anne Elliot was \\"forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older.\\" She was not given the choice by her family and friends to marry the man that she loved and who loved her. She sent Fredrick Wentworth away to the navy with no promise of ever having their love renewed. Fredrick spends his time in the navy honorably, becoming a captain, and tries his best to forget Anne. Anne, left at home, realizes what a mistake it was to ignore her heart and follow the advice of those who she thought she trusted.Persuasion takes place almost ten years after these events when fate pulls these star-crossed lovers together again. They must find a way to forgive each other, one for being sent away, and the other for never returning.Jane Austen wrote Persuasion at the end of her life, and thus had a different perspective while writing it then she did when writing all the rest of her books. This is the only Austen book written after the two protagonists have met and fallen in love. Austen pulls you into Anne's story, demanding that you stick around until you know what happens between Anne and Wentworth. The reader can easily see the emotions that both Anne and Wentworth feel, while both characters are blind to the feelings of the other.Anne taught me that I have to trust my heart. I can listen to the people in my life that I trust, but they will not be able to tell me what to do to be happy. Anne becomes miserable because she followed the advice of those she loved, but she doesn't blame them because she realizes that they told her to do what they thought was best. I enjoyed watching Anne grow and become an amazing woman who knows what she wants and is willing to stand up to the people in her life.One issue that I had with this book is the language that is used in it; it was not written for our day. The language is archaic and difficult to decipher. It is best to know the basic plot before reading this book or else you will get lost in the details of what is happening. However, the joy that is elicited from being part of Anne's life is without a doubt worth the effort."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering. Truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's Persuasion stands shoulder to shoulder with the best of the author's work. Emma and Pride & Prejudice are equally extraordinary novels and I don't think one has to engage in a tug of war over which is best: each has its charms and delights. The story of Anne Elliot, who enters into an engagement at age 20, only to succumb to family pressure and break it off, is 28 and alone when we meet her. Time has proven what she instinctively knows: Frederick Wentworth was the right man for her and she was foolish to let him go.His reappearance sets the stage for what is, at once a masterpiece of comedy, romance and satire. Anne's vainglorious father and sisters are deftly skewered, but in that mocking but never mean Austen style. The appearance of an estranged cousin and Captain Wentworth's apparent attachment to a neighborhood belle complicates matters wonderfully until we reach the inevitable happy conclusion.What sets this novel apparent, I think are two characteristics. Picking up the story eight years after Anne's mistake is a wonderful device. We don't meet a perfectly sensible woman (Elizabeth Bennett) or a delightful ingenue (Emma Woodhouse). Anne Elliot is a mature woman, indeed by social standards close to an old maid, and one left to regret her own poor judgment. Her situation is one any empathetic reader can identify with (who hasn't judged wrongly in Romance?) and creates a humility that is quite appealing. Unlike Elizabeth and Emma who need to learn the error of their ways, Anne already knows--she simply needs to be excused them.Secondly, unlike some Austen works, characters are far more dimensional. Anne is weak, but well-intended. Wentworth acknowledges he is bitter and resentful and acknowledges he fails to initiate a reconciliation out of pride, losing further years they might have been together. Elliot pere and Elliot the heir are quite cartoonish as is sister Elizabeth. However Anne's friend and confident and her sister Mary are more nuanced and therfore more appealing than most of Austen's minor characters.Is Persuasion worth reading? Without a doubt! Where does it fit in the Austen cannon? I think in the first rank. But everyone should decide for themselves."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Austen's last is one of the famed four -- Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, and this novel, the most melancholy but also perhaps most romatic of the quartet. I also highly recommend the filmPersuasion"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I started reading this novel years ago, when I was reading all of Jane Austen, and I didn't finish it. It was too tense and agonizing. The suspense was almost painful: here is this young woman in her late twenties, still in love with a man she rejected because of family pressure eight years ago, and he comes back into her life. At first he seems cold and distant, but then she begins to think that maybe he still loves her too. But in this society, the woman can't speak first. She can't simply say to him, \\"I still love you, and I'm sorry I didn't accept your proposal eight years ago. I was given bad advice by my family.\\" No, she has to wait for him to put aside his pride and ask if maybe she's changed her mind about him. She's on pins and needles the whole time, and there are terrible humiliations, and she's treated very badly by her family, but in the end it all works out.Still, it's so painful to think that women once lived like this: utterly dependent on marriage for survival; dreading being an old maid; prevented from doing any kind of real work at all; prisoners of a rigid class system; and silenced by rigid gender role conventions."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's last completed work before her death. It differs from her other more well known works such as Pride & Prejudice, and Emma. It focuses on a relationship who have a second chance to re-ignite true love but whether or not they will depends on so many things that make a good story and are still applicable today.A crazy family, social expectations, unforgiveness, competing love interests, and a little bit of that classic Austen wit that bites in just the right places.It's shorter than Austen's other works as well, and the plot less complicated and detailed than Pride & Prejudice and Mansfield Park.If for no other reason than the famous \\"you pierce my soul\\" letter, this should be a must on everyone's read list."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Frankly I am puzzled by the criticisms leveled at this edition. There is another edition [also by Barnes and Noble] and it is cheaper, though the quality is very flimsy and I wonder if the other reviewers were confused with that edition?This edition of Persuasion is beautifully bound, with a cloth spine, and has a lovely portrait on the cover. The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands. Besides the main text of Austen's novel itself, it has added features - a brief chronology of the world of Jane Austen & Persuasion, an introduction, the main text, as well as useful endnotes, works inspired by Persuasion,comments, as well as a list of resources for further reading and criticisms.

Austen had only 11 months to live when she completed it in 1816. Austen is the best writer in the language at taking a few upper-middle class rural families, a few love stories and arch social commentary into the heady mix that is her literary genius! Her observations of the social mores and balls, clothing style, music, literature, architecture and daily life of Regency England(1811-1820-the Prince Regent George IV assumed responsibility while his father George III became insane). is superb in its comic prose.The tale's main theme is how humans are persuaded to perform and also avoid moral actions which will determine how they live their lives. Eight years prior to the novel's opening we learn that Anne Eliot had earlier rejected the proposal of British naval officer Frederick Wentworth. She was persuaded to pursue this action due to the advice of her of a well meaning wealthy woman.Now Anne's impecunious and fatuously highfaultin baronet of a father has to lease his home due to pay his many debts. Her older sister Elizabeth is a hypocritcal prig who has to be one of the most odious creatures in Austen's work. Captain Wentworth returns to the village of Kellynch since his sister and her husband have rented the Eliot home. (they have departed for the watering hole of Bath). Eventually Anne and her Wentworth met, reconcile and are wed. Along the way we meet such characters as Anne's idiotic sister Mary and her husband who spends most of his time hunting. There are also a few subsidary love stories featuring Anne's siblings and the Musgrave girls. The fall of Lousia Mulgrave off the cob at Lyme is famous at is shows Anne that Wentworth still has feelings of love for her.The novel is lighter and less complex than such tomes as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Mansfield Park\\" and \\"Emma.\\" It was published in four volumes along with Jane's early work \\"Northanger Abbey\\" following her early death.One is left to wonder how many more small but elegant literary gems would have been produced by Miss Austen. Her books take us back over 150 years to a relatively stable and staid society. If one would be allowed b by the literary gods to invite three authors to dinner this reviewer would choose: Samuel Johnson, Oscar Wilde and Jane Austen. \\"Persuasion\\"will be broadcast on the BBC production to be shown on Masterpiece Theatre this autumn. Hopefully viewers of the series will turn to the real McCoy and enjoy the many pages of the preacher's kid named Jane!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I just recently went through a really rough break up and a friend of mine suggested that I read this book to start working on getting over it. It is a beautifully written book and the story is not at all predictable. It twists and turns and the whole time you find yourself on the edge of your seat, not able to put the book down untill you find out what is going to happen between Anne and Mr. Wentworth... will they see eachother? Will they speak? The characters are all very clear, and all very different. There's the annoying \\" it's all about her\\" sister, the well to do Friend, the loner bookworm, the bitter widow, the scheming cousin, each character is unique. Anne is polite and loveable. Everyone loves her and you will too. In the end, this beautiful love story gives a single girl like me hope that there is that perfect someone out there for me, but you don't have to be going through a loss to love this book. Everyone should read it. It is one of my new favorites of all time!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"this one and northanger abbey are my favorite. both of them are surprisingly easy to read. i like this one best of the two because i like the character of Ann so much, and i like her silly sisters. there are a lot of characters but i never got lost amongst them all. i recommend, for a first time Austen reader, to read this one becasue it is much easier to understand than most of her other works and it really is a good story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen, and I tend to read it when I have that need for some \\"Austen therapy\\". Anne is much older than any other Austen heroine (she is 28 by the end of the book), but that difference in age has made her more wise, thoughtful, intelligent, and sensitive. She has known the pain of disappointed love, and has lived through it. She didn't \\"die of a broken heart\\" or anything like that. She suffered, learned from it, and managed to come out the other side with her senses intact.Like all Austen heroines, there is nothing sentimental about her or her romance with Captain Wentworth. In fact, their interactions with each other, after an absence of eight years, illustrate how very realistic the story is. Wentworth is angry and resentful, and uses the young, spirited Louisa Musgrove to make Anne see that she has no power over him, even to make her jealous. Most of us have had similar experiences with ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends. The book is completely relevant to the lives of modern readers, which is the very thing that keeps Jane Austen fresh after all these years.Persuasion is also supremely entertaining, with delightful and hilariously vapid characters, such as the vain Sir Walter Elliot, the conniving William Elliot, the the petulant and constantly ill-used Mary Musgrove, and the scheming Mrs. Clay. Any fan of Austen will already have read this book, but any beginner Austen fan, or someone who has not yet ventured to try Austen yet, but is curious, should read this book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I bought this for my kindle..50 cents! Goodness I am almost ashamed. Sick with a cold, I read it almost straight through. Don't know how I missed this before. It is a joy. So much better than much of what is put out today."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages.

A must read if you really want to understand the movie."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I finally got around to reading this lovely novel by the infamous Jane Austen. It was written in her middle age and published posthumously. Slightly shorter and less intense than Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion is still detailed and enjoyable, full of Austen's trademark wit, deft dialogue, and insight into human nature.The protagonist is Anne Elliot, the twenty-seven-year-old daughter of a baronet. Like other Austen heroines, Anne shares little sympathy or similarity with her family members. Her one romantic attachment is over half a decade old - she was engaged to a naval officer whom her friends disapproved of. At the beginning of the novel, Anne goes to stay with her married younger sister. Her father and older sister have been forced to give up their family home because of their spendthrift habits. Captain Wentworth, Anne's former fiance, reappears in her life, and Anne is forced to learn to interact with him in a polite and detached way. She must watch him pursue others, and decide how to respond to her own suitors.The entire novel is engaging and good, though at times I found Anne almost too calm a heroine. I absolutely loved the climax of the story, near the ending. It is so sweet and surprising.

Since I had just seen the latest Masterpiece Theater version of Persuasion on PBS, that seemed a likely choice. The possibility of two problems loomed as the book was purchased: First, the book and the taped version would probably have major differences. Second, Having been written 200 years ago, the style would also be different, more narrative than action, for instance. I was to discover that sentence structure was also very different. (Although I have read many books in this style in my lifetime, the popular style today is, of course, more fast-paced and active in comparison.)I was quite right about the pacing and the style. At first, it was a difficult read, taking more concentration than modern popular fiction requires. But as the machinations of the Elliott family and their kin unfolded, I was drawn into the story. How could Sir Walter be so oblivious to Anne's favors? How could Anne have listened to Lady Russell and rejected Wentworth's proposal eight years earlier? How could anyone have wanted to wed Anne's sister Mary whose ailments and spells are so blatantly self-serving? And would a man of Wentworth's personality, station, and eventual rise wait eight years to marry in an era when marrying well was so important to the upper and upper-middle classes?All of the shenanigans listed above and many more are documented in detail in the book. There is no way one can get the same flavor of scheming and hoping in a play or film. At least I've not seen one that accomplished that. It is tough going sometimes for the modern reader. However, it is well worth the effort. Seeing society as Jane Austen did is one of those experiences one can most often get only from books. I'm glad that I picked up this one and now plan to read more of her work: Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma among them. It should be an interesting summer."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The volumes I purchased all prove excellent. These are texts most useful in an academic environment in contrast to casual reading. As such, they are splendid."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"As far as reading the text goes, it's easy to read. It's just like any other version of Austen that I have read.HOWEVER, I do want to make a very important point for those considering this version and others by this company. The pictures really ruin the flow of the book. You will be reading, then there is a huge blank space after the text. Click next page and you get a picture that is really hard to get a look at, then next page you see the caption and some space before the text continues. It really disrupts the reading to have this randomly throughout the chapters.Aside from that, the kindle version is decent."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is beautiful. It is also poignant, thought-provoking, heart-wrenching, satirical... I re-read it at least once a year, and am always amazed at how much Anne's story has come to mean to me.This book makes me laugh and it makes me cry. It combines all the elements that make an Austen novel an Austen novel. Sir Walter is a most hilarious buffoon, Mr. Elliot is as evil a villain as there can be, Mary is the quintessential spoiled, selfish baby sister, and Captain Wentworth (sigh) is her most dashing, romantic hero. Yes, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Darcy, but his love and devotion were not tested for &quot;eight years and a half.&quot; IMNSHO, someone who is NOT moved by Captain Wentworth's letter has a heart of stone."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon.This edition includes a chapter that was omitted in the completed version, it was kind of a first draft option and Jane Austen chose another scene instead. I don't know if other versions of this book have that chapter. It was interesting to see the alternative ideas Jane Austen had."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion, Jane Austen's last novel, is the story of Anne Elliott and Frederick Wentworth, two young lovers who are persuaded to be separated rather than marrying when they first fall in love around age nineteen because of lack of prospects. The story picks up eight years later when circumstances have changed and the now Captain Wentworth has returned to the area with a successful career and Anne's family is now reduced in financial status. Anne wonders if perhaps Frederick might still harbor feelings for her, but this being Austen, things never go smoothly and there is quite a lot of wondering and subterfuge, and colorful characters to keep things amusing.This is not my favorite Austen; things started off quite slowly and there is not a great deal of dialogue. I did enjoy the fact that Frederick and Anne rediscovered each other relatively later in their lives, and as always, the build-up to the happy ending kept me smiling. While Persuasion doesn't have quite the emotional zing that Austen's earlier works do, it is still enjoyable. I doubt there's such a thing as an Austen novel that won't capture you in some way, and Persuasion accomplishes just that in its subtle, quiet style."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Those who read PERSUASION by Jane Austen tend to view it as a book primarily concerned with marriage in the typical Austen romantic comedy sense of young ladies seeking to marry upward and young men also seeking partners--but not necessarily to each other. While much of Austen's novel deals with precisely that, to view this solitary strand of thought as Austen's most telling point is surely to miss that point totally. In PERSUASION, Austen took her earlier PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and sought to show that her view on how single women relate to their families, their friends, their proposed husbands and to society at large underwent a significant change from the latter to the former.In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, Austen places Elizabeth Bennett squarely in the traditional role of the 18th century woman who sought somehow to gain economic equality with men in such a way so as not to upset or circumvent the established social order that dictated that women must obey their parents and marry the men whom they selected as suitable candidates. Miss Bennett uses reason and general smarts to cause changes in Darcy that would in turn cause changes in the larger social order that acted as a behind the scenes puppeteer. The comedy then was a function of a small change in Miss Bennett causing a larger one in Darcy. In PERSUASION, Austen takes the similar plot of a young woman breaking up with a man that perhaps needed breaking up with and updated it to include Anne Elliot doing much the same thing with Captain Wentworth. In Elizabeth Bennett's case, Darcy determined not be chased away. In Anne Eliot's case, Wentworth made no such determination and left the scene for eight years. The difference between the two acts of breaking up and their respective reconciliations did not lay in a profound change in the social order. What changed was Jane Austen, who became more finely attuned to the winds of Romanticism that were then wafting from one country to another. The relentless focus on rationalism that dominated the Augustan Age had slowly morphed over just a few decades to one in which human feeling and emotion trumped human reason.Austen, in her choice of \\"Persuasion\\" as the title, subtly implied that what was at stake was not simply potential marriage partners waltzing a predictable if unstable dance towards the altar. Rather, she wished to point the reader in the direction of seeing not only how and why persuasive rhetoric might impact on lovers' lives, but also to ascertain the consequences of treating emotional people as if they were devoid of those emotions. In Miss Bennett's case, \\"persuasion\\" was used in the context of rational discourse used to alter the world view of Darcy. In Anne Elliot's case, it was used to fortify the existing social order at the expense of using \\"right reason\\" to convince Anne to break up with Wentworth on the grounds that he was simply too low on the economic and social pecking order to marry a woman who is supposed to be a few rungs higher than he. Actually, Austen satirizes Anne by implying that, if anything, her loftier position in society, exists mostly in her and her father's eyes, not at society's at large. Anne differs from Elizabeth Bennett in that in PERSUASION, Anne sees that she has erred in being falsely persuaded but is allowed to show and vent emotion in re-establishing accepted marital order even if the somewhat stodgier and old-fashioned social order balks. As Anne Elliot uses both head and heart to win back the love of a man who felt rightfully scorned for no good reason, Jane Austen focused attention on basic human romantic entanglements that for many frustrated lovers remain tangled even today."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is one of Austen's shorter, simpler pieces, sweet and charming without as much intrigue as her other novels. It tells the story of sweet, quiet, even-tempered Anne Elliot, a plain spinster disregarded by her family because she is not attractive enough for them. Anne's only share of romance had been years before, with a naval man deemed beneath her --- a man named Wentworth, who she was persuaded to reject because of his lower connections.Anne's father is a lazy spender who cares more for his vanity and title than his family, and spends them all to the point of bankruptcy and they are forced to move to Bath, giving up their long-time home of Kellynch Hall. While the rest of the family moves, Anne is left to take care of the more menial tasks and visit her sister --- a woman who delights in \\"fancying herself ill.\\" While visiting Mary and her family, Anne is once again thrown into the company of Wentworth --- now CAPTAIN Wentworth.As is typical of Jane Austen, this novel is filled with charm, wit, and humor. The story is perfectly thought-out, with just enough twists to keep it interesting, and enough romance to make you sigh. The characters are flawlessly designed.I laughed and I cried in this novel. After \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" this is my favorite of hers."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Any person considering reading PERSUASION by Jane Austen must have several thoughts in mind before beginning. This book is a classic, written by a master. It requires an investment of your time, your patience, your understanding and your attention. It is a book to be savored, not galloped through as if it were a modern fiction bodice ripper. If you are willing to approach this book with an open mind, expecting only to receive pleasure from the written word, you will most likely enjoy it tremendously.I read a lot of modern romance fiction. One of the things I have noticed on researching a book through the Amazon review system before I buy it is that so often reviewers state that they were able to finish the book in two hours, three hours, four hours. Do they honestly think that is a compliment to the author? One thing I can guarantee here, you will never be able to say that about PERSUASION. Slow down, read for pleasure, read for the pure joy of observing Jane Austen's manner of combining words. Her punctuation style is totally different from modern fiction. It requires that you hold thoughts in your mind long enough for her to have completed her lengthy and complicated sentence structure.Fans of Jane Austen often say that one specific book is their favorite. My favorite is the one I happen to be reading at the time. I've read them all multiple times and am always able to find nuggets of pleasure either not noticed before or now understood from a fresh perspective. PERSUASION is a book which shows very clearly Miss Austen's feelings on the English class system and how appearances are very often deceiving. Anne Elliot's own family is (in their minds at least) in the top strata of society. In actual fact, they are very small fish in a wide pond and do not amount to much except when within their own corner of England. Anne spends much time with the Musgrove family and all those surrounding that happy, boisterous group. Although lower in the social standings, they are loving, kind and generous, traits which are totally lacking in her own father and older sister. Anne is considered of no consequence to her family yet is loved and admired by those outside her social set who can see her value and worth. This is a story of young love lost with the opportunity to reclaim that love when maturity has given new insights into reasons, details and personalities. This book does not specifically leave you with a \\"happily ever after\\" feeling. Anne will never be mistress of Kellynch-hall, probably never even live there again. Captain Wentworth is a career naval officer with all that implies in his future service during wars. And yet, you cannot help but feel that Anne and Frederick will be quietly, calmly, gloriously happy for their remaining days. Partially because of the eight long years of separation which allowed them both to mature and grow and partially because they are just so very right for each other.Do not begin reading this book expecting a \\"romance\\" novel as written today. If you do, you are doomed to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I recently finished reading Jane Austen's Persuasion. It wasn't originally within my reading plans for the year, but I was inspired to read it by both The Lake House and the recent Pride and Prejudice film.Jane Austen's work is notable for reflecting on the class structure of its times. Written in the early 1800s, at the time of the end of the Napoleonic Wars, England's upper classes are well structured, with rules in place to dictate exactly who has greater stature, and constricting how discourse occurs, and how romance should proceed. In Persuasion, the main character Anne Elliot finds herself ruing the decision she made some 8 years previously, that saw her send away the man she loved, because her family saw that the man had little stature. Well, he went off to fight in the Wars, and has come back, as many have come back, with greatly changed riches and improved stature. Anne finds herself still in love with the man in question, and over time the poor man finds that he has not changed his thoughts either, and they persuade themselves to re-unite, and marry, finally.Some of what's observed, herein, is how the rules of society are changing to accommodate the newly-rich...and how Austen distinguishes between \\"gentlemen\\" (those who act as good people) and those with stature, but then doesn't allow her characters to be guided towards the gentlemen so easily. In today's terms, we would think Anne Elliot foolish for turning her back on love because her parent says the man is not a good match, because of stature, but these things happen even today. So, I think in this respect that the novel remains a good reflection on how poorly people navigate through the minefields of love, and how poorly people can themselves fare when they don't act according to their own true wishes.This was Austen's last completed novel, as I understand it. It was a little more adult in terms of how it handled its themes, and it surprised me with some of its skill. A major character nearly dies part-way through the story; it happens abruptly, and it is handled as a natural abrupt event in a way that was momentarily shocking...a true sign of skill. Definitely, this is worth a read for fans of novels of this time period."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"It being my 27th year of spinsterhood (the same age of our heroine Anne Elliot), and being Austen-inclined, I picked up (and consequently couldn't put down) my beloved, aged Complete Works of Jane Austen in order to reread Persuasion, a close third favorite (only just after her masterpiece P&P and the profound S&S). Oh, Jane, how I love you, my most favorite author. So funny; I was cackling with laughter at your comedic timing, your witty and ironic eye, and your amazing attention to detail in human psychology, character, and behavior. Not just moved to laughter, but even to tears (Captain Wentworth's final love letter still gives me collywobbles). Falling into Jane's books is like falling into a vat of literary chocolate. Oh, yes, there is the beautiful love story (one of her absolute best, by far her most mature, perhaps her most moving and emotional) between the broken-hearted and angry Captain Wentworth and the spinster, past-her-prime Anne Elliot, torn asunder years before because she was persuaded that he was unworthy of her, now reunited, yet distant. (How Jane so perfectly and honestly describes the pining, unrequited heart!) But--as with all of Jane's works--the love story is really only a vehicle for her greater messages and observations about society, reality, human psychology--messages that are still profoundly pertinent. It's not only that her characters and situations could be walking around onto on our concrete streets. It's that Jane knew humanity down to its core two hundred years ago. When her incredibly real and troubled characters find romance, it is a meeting of internal discovery. Persuasion, needless to say, is about the necessity of finding the balance between yielding to outside forces (i.e. advice) and staying true to your own desires and conscience. What human being hadn't had to contend with that? This book is perfection itself. Still powerful, meaningful, humorous, moving, and utterly delightful. Grade: A+"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The magic and sheer excellence of 'Persuasion' lies in the personalities of the variouscharacters: Anne Elliot, the heroine of the book, is quiet, caring and proper but beneaththat surface of hers, she's a woman who has loved and lost.

Captain Frederick Wentworth, Anne's love from her past, is just excellent!He's the male image of Regency cool: tall, handsome, a man of hard work and lady-killer.As a novel, 'Persuasion' is a thoughtful insight into the women left behind because ofbad choices, yet it is never self-pitying. I couldn't understand why while I was reading the bookand at the end, I saw what Austen was trying to show.That is the wicked factor of 'Persuasion', Austen allows you to eitherbe persuaded or dissuaded.As a social commentary, it is subtle in how it mocks certainaspects of society such as the 'dandies' of Regency England, the men who indulged in vanity,personified by Sir Walter Elliot. Yet, the books acts as a platform for the debate of marriagebegs the question, is marrying outside your station suicidal?One critic said that 'Persuasion' was like a Regency version of the Cinderella tale: Anne Elliotis Cinderella, Cpt. Frederick Wentworth her Prince Charming and Lady Russell as theWicked Stepmother. This is a blatant over-simplification!

It certainly contains enough genuine insight into humanity, and social relationships in particular, to be considered a \\"serious\\" novel. But \\"Persuasion\\" defies the stereotype that accompanies this genre. Rather than being ponderous and solemn, it is instead a work of sheer joy to read. Readers are treated to a complex novel that reads like a summer beach book.Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of \\"Persuasion\\" is how it balances the depth and richness with pure entertainment. Anne, her sisters, her father, and of course Captain Wentworth, are all very complex and fully fleshed-out characters. At the same time, however, they are all delightful people to read about. Anne in particular is charming and compassionate. Austen's prose is wonderful; witty, intelligent, and clear. And the story itself, a tale of people in love, is universal in its appeal and yet never once becomes formulaic. The novel, then, is a fantastic success in every possible way.

The first appearance of Sir Gerald Tarrant, the father-like head of British Intelligence, and Gabriel, a ruthless and ancient adversary of Modesty Blaise. We are also privy to Modesty's past as a young girl, whom O'Donnell portrays as a brilliant neophyte, creating the criminal organization known as The Network. Additionally, we are provided the origin of her unique and deeply intimate friendship (always platonic) with Willie Garvin, an astute and proficient 'comrade-in-arms.'Although the book is cumbersome at times with technical descriptions involving an elaborate heist, the action and excitement outweigh it. Look for a spectacular hand-to-hand battle between Modesty and Mrs. Fothergill, one of Gabriel's eccentric bodyguards. Mrs. Fothergill is portrayed as chillingly cold-blooded and combat-competent, yet Modesty's fighting expertise is more than a match for Mrs. Fothergill's martial arts and gymnastic acumen.Modesty Blaise is far from an ordinary 'spy' (hardly a 007 rip-off). In fact, she's an exceptional woman way ahead of her time!"},{"Title":"Modesty Blaise","review":"The above quotation is uttered by Willie Garvin at the end of chapter 18 of \\"Modesty Blaise\\". Two chapters later the book is over, and readers can agree with Willie and conclude that this book is different. Enjoyably and intriguingly different.\\"Modesty Blaise\\" was Peter O'Donnell's first book, published in 1965 when he was 45 years old. Prior to that he had had a long career as the author of scripts for comic strips and writing short stories. In fact, the Modesty Blaise character was first launched as a comic strip in a London newspaper in 1963, so Peter O'Donnell had the background and major story elements well worked out when he wrote this book.This book became the first book in a series of 11 novels and two collections of short stories about Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin, Modesty's loyal and trusted companion.In this review I'll concentrate on certain aspects of the book \\"Modesty Blaise\\" itself, in the hopes that the reader already has a general knowledge of the whole Modesty Blaise series of books. If this is not the case then you may want to look at my \\"So You'd Like To\\" guide about books by Peter O'Donnell. It includes a link to my MSN group about Modesty Blaise where you can find more information about this whole series of books and why I love them.In \\"Modesty Blaise\\" the basic story is that Modesty, a former criminal, is recruited to the side of the good guys. She and Willie then go up against a ruthless team of bad guys and find themselves captured and scheduled to be killed. In order to survive despite the incredible odds against them they have to fight for their lives, using their fighting skills and their ingenuity.In this book Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin are introduced to us in a very effective way. In chapters one and two Willie is in serious trouble and Modesty rescues him, the relationship between the two of them made very clear by the way they interact.Also introduced in this book are Sir Gerald Tarrant, John (Jack) Fraser and Weng, three secondary characters who appear in many of the other books in the series. And we are introduced to Modesty's penthouse apartment overlooking Hyde Park in London and Willie's pub The Treadmill on the bank of the Thames near Maidenhead.The bad guys in the Modesty books are always very special. In this book the memorable villains are Gabriel (who has a penchant for watching cartoons when he's not sentencing people to death), McWhirter (Scottish henchman who jokes about torture) and Mrs. Fothergill (not too bright or attractive but very good with the unarmed combat). Mrs. Fothergill plays a very special role towards the end of the book - but I can't say how without giving too much away.This book introduces the special fighting techniques and weapons that are typical for the Modesty books. In particular, we're presented with Modesty's favorite weapon, the kongo, and Willie's throwing knives, plus a couple of unusual weapons invented by Willie.\\"Modesty Blaise\\" is a wonderful book, and a great start to the whole series, and I'm awarding it five stars. If the above information is not enough to convince you, please read my article \\"Why I love the Modesty Blaise books\\", which can be found on my MSN group about Modesty Blaise.In the interests of fairness I'll conclude this review with a few points that I found slightly negative about this book.The book, at 224 pages, is too short. It's over too soon and you're wishing there was more.I find some of the things Tarrant and Fraser do to be a tad too silly to be consistent with their positions. Examples: Tarrant complimenting Fraser on his articulation (pg 15), Tarrant expressing relief that a hotel chef has declined leaving his job at the hotel (pg 61), Tarrant worried about being made fun of by Modesty or Willie (pg 70-71 and 128), and Fraser pretending to be angry when talking to Boyd (pg 141).Finally, in spite of Peter O'Donnell's desire to make Willie an equal to the other characters despite his lower-class background, I detected a condescending tone at times. Examples: \\"Willie had views\\" (pg 106), \\"and to Tarrant's surprise Willie carried his share with ease\\" (pg 127), \\"there was no patronage in his manner\\" (pg 129). (Page numbers refer to the original Souvenir Press edition.)Highly recommended. Read this book, and if you like it then you'll also like at least the next five or six books in the series. (After that the series declines a bit.)Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"Modesty Blaise","review":"Okay, so you've seen Quentin Tarantino's movie \\"Pulp Fiction.\\" And you've noticed that every time Vincent Vega (John Travolta) goes to the bathroom, he takes a book along to read.

As a gesture of homage to Peter O'Donnell, I created an action duo, John Pilgrim and Sally Brandon. They're not straight copies of the originals and the best, Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin, but I've tried to hit their target of plenty of action, with a little humor.I own the complete series of Modesty Blaise books, and one of them is always on my bedside table.

Rosenberg who mentions Stieg Larson was a big fan of the Modesty books. Modesty is a tough, brilliant and beautiful woman along the lines of The Avenger's Mrs. Peale, but more deadly. She is expert in martial arts and a variety of weapons. If these books were wrtten in this decade instead of the 60's, she would probably also be computer geek extraordinaire . Don't be put off by the tacky cover illustrations, the books are about brilliant, daring and often outlandish escapades (including - spoiler alert - shooting a defector over the Berlin Wall via a circus canon) rather than sexual encounters, which are plentiful but not explicit, very much a la Ian Fleming's James Bond and with humor like Lawrence Block's Tanner series. The books are entertaining, clever, humorous, thrilling and very well wriiten. I'm sorry there are only 13 books and the author sadly is no more.If you want to read them in order:Modesty BlaiseSabre ToothI, LuciferA Taste For DeathImpossible VirginPieces of ModestyThe Silver MistressLast Day In LimboDragon's ClawThe Xanadu TalismanThe Night of MorningstarDead Man's HandleCobra Trap"},{"Title":"Modesty Blaise","review":"I heard a lot about Modesty Blaise from others online and thought I'd check it out. When I saw DC Comics had done a reprint using one of my fav artists, Dick Giordano (Green Lantern, etc.) I could not resist.It seems this graphic novel is of Modesty's early adventures. Hardened as a child at a refugee camp, she took over a criminal organization and dealt in everything except drugs and sex. She took on a partner and did quite well, getting out of the business.Another man of a British organization (Sir Gerald Tarrant) wants her help and he convinces her by letting her know of one of her friends is in a prison, whom she frees. Grateful, she helps our modest British agent get the goods on a diamond smuggling ring.The rest of the tale is quite well done. Modesty is very sexy; some of the scenes are really well done (thanks Dick!) and the James Bond like instruments of death (grenade in a shoe, etc.) are fun to read about as well.The Modesty character is brazen, strong and can be soft when she wants. She uses her feminine ways to get the goods on the clueless male bad guys, even in one scene when a common thug gets the goods on her.Most of these strips came from author Peter O'Donnell, who wrote these in the Sixties at the time of the James Bond films. Another femme fatale in comics and television is Honey West, (Honey West #1) but Modesty is tougher!O'Donnell wrote many novels and even a screenplay of the character from what I understand. And yes, though I'm a newbie to this strip, I really must follow up on more graphic novels and maybe even check out that screenplay!Tied up, a knife to her back, how will she escape? Read and see!

I consider myself a well read mystery fan and I had never heard of this series. According to what I read, Modesty was one of the characters that Lisbeth was modeled after. Well, just like with Lisbeth, I fell in literary love with Modesty. What a wonderful series ala the female James Bond like character, although that does not do justice to her character. And the relationship between Modesty and Willie her partner in crime is a wonder to behold. I just wonder if we could all learn from their relationship. You don't have to be sexually involved to be VERY close to someone from the opposite sex. In any case once I read the first book \\"Modest Blaise\\" I was hooked. I immediately put together the entire series from a variety of sources. I am happily ensconsed in the AC reading about Modesty and Willie and their latest caper while it is horrid outside. I hate to admit it, but they even brought the occasional tear to my eye, and this from a hard-boiled life long mystery/suspense reader. You can't go wrong.

This is the first novel in the series, and introduces the setting and most of the main characters.Modesty Blaise is a former refugee and survivor of the terrible disruptions caused by the war, and as a child drifted across Eastern Europe and the Middle East in the company of an old professor. She had to be tough to survive; but her companion instilled in her a strong moral code. She took over a small criminal gang and built it up into a powerful criminal organisation infused with that moral code--they never touched drugs or vice, and occasionally co-operated with the police and intelligence services to help clean up such crimes. She retired a wealthy woman at the age of 24.As the novel opens, Modesty and her friend and former second-in-command Willie Garvin are finding that retirement is boring and adrenaline an addiction they cannot shake. Sir Gerald Tarrant, the head of British Intelligence, exploits that addiction to recruit them for an intelligence operation for which they are peculiarly suited. What follows is a thrilling caper novel pitting Modesty and Willie against a bizarre criminal mastermind. Tight plotting and wonderful prose make this a very entertaining read, with a unique pair of heroes. It's wonderful to see Souvenir Press reissuing the novels, making them available again to both a new generation of fans and those with fond memories."},{"Title":"Nightdreamers (Doctor Who)","review":"Hello, my name is Tom Arden,And I'm a big goofball.I'm not harmin' like Kate Orman,No, I am mad like Mad Magrs is.NIGHTDREAMERS is what you'd get if you went back in time and handed William Shakespeare an elementary Physics textbook, a kiddie version of the Grimm's Fairy Tales, and a crack-pipe. This book is as goofy as all get out. I liked it, but it's possible that you would have to be in the mood to read something as wacky as this. It's a very fine line between outrageous fun and tedious illogic, and I can definitely see how others could hate this. Personally, this was just what I was in the mood for, so it worked for me. Every time I turned a page, I'd think, &quot;Well, the story can't possible get any goofier&quot; only to be proved wrong yet again. Maybe if I read it a second time in a different frame of mind, I wouldn't have the same reaction. But at least I would know what I was in for.The story has a very fairy tale feel to it. It's about royal families and magical demons. The prose has a childlike quality. Yet, despite these characteristics, it doesn't quite succeed at being a fairy tale, as there simply isn't enough death, destruction and random violence. Traditional fairy tales are much darker, much more grisly than this. This is like a Disney-extreme version, resulting in something that lacks the edge of its basis. It seems to be written at a young child's level, but I'm not sure that kids wouldn't feel they were being talked down to. I imagine this is an attempt at being a nostalgia version of a fairy tale -- the pleasant, happy stuff, from an adult point of view where all the darker elements have been forgotten.Still, if the book isn't a successful fairy-tale, I did find it hugely entertaining. Maybe it was just the mood I was in, but I was laughing like someone who needs locking up. The third Doctor is, of course, the perfect foil to the bizarre unnatural behavior going on around him. Monsters are roaming the woods, princesses need rescuing, and the Doctor is wandering around mumbling about his sonic screwdrivers and his physics. It's a hoot! This sort of thing would be unbelievably awful if expanded out to novel length, but it's much easier to keep up this spoof insanity for the mere one hundred and five pages that this story lasts.Ultimately, I really enjoyed NIGHTDREAMERS as a celebration of style over substance. In other words, it's got a lot of goofy style, but absolutely no substance at all. I laughed a lot, though to be perfectly honest, I don't know whether I was laughing with it or at it. Was I was meant to be amused by some of the action adventure clich&eacute;s or was I somehow expected to take this nonsense seriously? There's absolutely nothing original about anything here, the only question is whether these particular stock pieces have been ripped off exactly this sort of way before. I can't fathom what the author was attempting, but the result just entertained me. Judging by Katy Manning's foreword (where she talks about losing her house keys, visiting her mother, being evicted from her apartment, and, oh yes, says a few words at the end about the book), she didn't quite know what to make of it either. And, paradoxically, despite the fact that I can't think of a single story like this one, this is probably the most faithful print recreation of the Third Doctor era that I can think of. Go figure."},{"Title":"How to Read better and Faster","review":"Books by Norman Lewis are still bought avidly by English book readers even on the streets of India but are not very popular in America. The basic speed reading strategies are not that many and are not that difficult to master. For some unknown reason, it is not even offered as a class in most high schools and colleges! Imagine all the hours you will save if you could finish your required reading in half the time or less?In 1989, I was preparing to take the GRE test to come to America and was intimidated by all the reading material I had to go through in order to prepare for the test. Then, as I was passing one of those street sellers that are such a common sight in India, I saw a copy of this book and the title caught my attention. I decided to make this my first book to read so I could finish the rest of the books faster. The strategy paid off and I increased my reading speed from 100 words per minute to over 2000 words per minute in less than 6 months! In the process, my engineering grades picked up as I was not only reading faster but also retaining complex material better. Needless to say, I did fantastic on my test scores and came to America to attend graduate school in 1991.The basis behind the author's theory is that speed reading, high concentration and material retention are all linked. You can't do one without the other very effectively. So, if you start reading fast, you are forced to concentrate and this increases retention. The high concentration that is induced when you try to read faster results in some interesting physiological changes in the brain where the memory of what you are reading gets etched more permanently than the times when you don't have high concentration. This is not explained in the book, but I came to that conclusion after I became curious about what makes the book's techniques so effective and researched deeper into the subject. I don't want to go too much into the book's techniques because I think they are more effective if you read them directly from the book for the first time.Since then, I have purchased several other books on speed reading but I still find this to be the best book on the subject. My perception may be skewed because I had already increased my reading speed to the physical limits of how fast my eyes could move. But the reason I like this book is because Norman Lewis does not make any ridiculous claims and his methods are very simple, common-sense techniques that are easy to follow. In some of the other books, I found a few of the techniques to be so silly that I never even tried them.People who meet me and eventually learn about my reading speed always ask me how I was able to make such a dramatic change. When I tell them about this book, they try finding it at the local bookstore and are never able to find it! So, I end up parting with my copy and picking up a new one the next time I visit India. I am glad that one can find this book on Amazon.com now. I can tell my friends to get a copy from here.Your reading speed tends to drop over time if you don't relearn these techniques once every few years. Of course, people with glasses will see results that are less dramatic than people without glasses due to the restriction in their field of vision. But everyone benefits from these solid, proven techniques. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did and recommend it to your friends that are interested in sharpening their brains."},{"Title":"How to Read better and Faster","review":"This is the most useful book on speed-reading I've found so far. It goes from the goals of reading (getting the main idea, getting specific details, overall perception) to specific techniques that help achieving those goals.

The story revolves around Cassie and her family, specifically her mother and siblings.Cassie's family used to be a lot like the other family's in her upscale neighborhood. They had a nice, sufficiently large house. They took vacations. twelve-year-old Cassie used to be on the swim team at their sports club. Her older sister, Miranda, didn't have to worry about doing the shopping after school. Six-year-old Jackson never used to spend so much time alone in his room.That was all before Cassie's father \\"left the picture\\" and the remaining family had to move into a \\"unit\\" house in the poorer part of town. Shunned by her old friends, hated by her English teacher, and utterly unnoticed at home--Cassie tries to deal with all of her mounting problems on her own. This novel is the story of why and how those efforts fail. And how Cassie picks herself up again afterwards.Cassie is definitely a strong character. Thanks to her neglectful sister and overworked mother, Cassie is largely the only one paying attention to family concerns. And she works really hard to try and handle all of that. Unfortunately, that doesn't make her a particularly real or likable character.My first issue is that Cassie is really shallow. After the first few pages of the novel it's clear that her old friends (the ones who ignore her now) were jerks and that she is better off without them. But Cassie doesn't see that right away, fine she's only twelve. The thing is, even after she does realize as much Cassie continues to try to be friendly with them and ignore Bess, the girl who is obviously going to be a way better friend in the long run.As the novel progresses, Dee tries to show Cassie growing as a character. I can see that happening. But it's two steps forward and then two steps back so that even at the end of the novel Cassie is still making disparaging remarks that she was supposed to have moved past by now. The recurring point being cracks about Bess' weight. Bess is overweight and Cassie continues to wonder how Bess can possibly weigh so much when she never eats at school posturing that she might, scarily, binge at home. Later, after the girls become friendlier, Cassie finds herself surprised to learn that Bess lives in a really swank neighborhood. I found this entire subplot really infuriating. Cassie might as well meet an African American kid at school and be surprised that they live in a mansion. It's just completely ridiculous and, the truth is, Dee does not have Cassie evolve enough on this point to make such observations even relevant.I was also less than impressed by Dee's writing style. The premise was interesting, as were the inclusions of Cassie's fantasy novel (mirroring what's going on in her real life), and even excerpts from her English class quizzes. But Dee never really takes the grammar thing to a high enough level that it should be in the book. I would have liked to see some kind of appendix explaining some of the English rules mentioned (who/whom for instance) since Dee spent so much of the novel mentioning them.Throughout the narrative Dee was at pains to make Cassie seem real, one might even venture \\"insanely\\" so. But she never quites get there. Cassie uses quotes a lot when she's narrating to discuss Dad being \\"out of the picture\\" and the \\"unit\\" the family lives in. That gets old after the second chapter. And, in terms of narration, it becomes inadequate. Points where Cassie knows nothing about what's going on (Why is Dad \\"out of the picture?\\" Where does Miranda go after school when she's supposed to be at home?) are never fully developed, making the novel seem more half baked than insanely real."},{"Title":"Just Another Day in My Insanely Real Life","review":"There are kids' books I've read as an adult that I've liked but am pretty sure I wouldn't have liked when I was ten or eleven. Then there are kids books that I like and I know I would have devoured when I was eleven. This is one of them.Before her father left, Cassie's family lived in a nice house, Cassie was on the swim team, had two best friends and the life of your average middle class, middle school kid. But now Cassie lives in an apartment with her mom (who works all the time), her older sister (Miranda, who never does what she promises she's going to do--like buy groceries), and her younger brother, Jackson, who Cassie's concerned has a learning disability. Add to that the fact her supposed best friends act like she's no longer good enough for them to hang out with. Fun life, right?This could be a depressing book, but it's not. In fact, for a book that deals with some serious stuff, it's pretty dang funny. For instance, after Cassie becomes convinced her teacher isn't bothering to read the journals he requires his class to write, she starts writing all kinds of crazy, silly stuff that cracked me up and will crack kids up, too.Though it takes a little while, Cassie starts finding her way. Sure, she messes up a lot, she makes mistakes, she thinks she knows what's going on, but she doesn't always (she's all wrong when it comes to her English teacher, for instance). But she figures things out, too: like who she can trust, and who her real friends are. A definite good read, with fully developed characters and realistic situations.

Usually, one of the parents gets to keep the lavish house that they all once lived in as a happy family, but no one ended up keeping the house. Instead, Cassie and her mom and two siblings all move into a run-down apartment, selling the car and the house. Now Cassie has to manage everything, especially since her mother is always working late, her older sister is forgetting to get the groceries or is always on the phone, and her little brother is just crying out for some attention.It's not only home that's changing for Cassie.

An example of this would be when she thought her teacher just graded her on the pages she wrote so she felt very frustrated. She went to talk to the teacher and he said that he graded her on the writing not the pages. Another example would be when her sister was supposed to take care of Cassie's brother but her sister never came home so Cassie had to take care of him. At that point Cassie was really mad at her sister, it had been her job to take care of her brother! This book made me insane because I couldn't put it down! I would give it four stars out of five."},{"Title":"Just Another Day in My Insanely Real Life","review":"It was a fantastic book with very descriptive words and chapters. I would recommend it to anyone. It is about a girl and her difficult life. The main character is Cassie. Her father left her, and she has to take care of her little brother. Her older sister is always out until after midnight, so Cassie has to do the cooking and cleaning plus her homework. It is a really good book so read it if you want but really try to read it!!!!"},{"Title":"Just Another Day in My Insanely Real Life","review":"I am not a bookworm like my sister or brother but I was mesmerized by this book.

I could not put the book down. The main character had the burden of keeping her family's life together. She expressed her feelings about this by writing stories in her English journal. She has a mean English teacher and her friends are not true friends. Her life gets scrambled and gushed all together at the same time. Barbara Dee writes this fantastic story of life. I can relate to it. I too write stories that help me with my feelings. I also ease my burdens by reading books like this. Two thumbs up and a hip-hip hooray for the book of the day!"},{"Title":"Just Another Day in My Insanely Real Life","review":"This is an uplifting story in which the main character finds herself in a very difficult situation over which she has little control. Despite all her problems she remains involved, and struggles to make her life and the lives of those around her better. She is open to experiencing new romantic feelings, and to distinguishing between a true friend from those who were false friends. Many teenagers who struggle with similar conflicts will see someone they can identify with and hopefully grow in similar ways."},{"Title":"Just Another Day in My Insanely Real Life","review":"I'm an elementary school teacher, and I can highly recommend this book.

She wanted to talk about it with me, so how could I resist her enthusiasm? I had enjoyed the other novel that Ms. Dee wrote, SOLVING ZOE (you can read my review here), so I dropped the other book I was reading and jumped in!As was the case with SOLVING ZOE, I thoroughly enjoyed this middle-grade novel -- I can totally see why Booking Daughter was so anxious to have me read it! I think I enjoyed it even more than SOLVING ZOE and I really liked that book! JUST ANOTHER DAY IN MY INSANELY REAL LIFE is the story of Cassie, a seventh grader whose life is suddenly turned upside-down. When her father leaves (for no apparent reason to the kids), Cassie's and her family have to leave their house and move into a small apartment. In addition, Cassie's mother has to work long hours to support the family; and Cassie's older sister Miranda is always leaving Cassie with her younger brother and all the household responsibilities. To make matters even worse, she is having problems at school and making bad grades. With all that going on, no wonder Cassie feels that her life is a little insane!As a mother, I couldn't help but love Cassie. She had so much responsibility thrown on her at such a young ago, and her personality made her try to protect everyone she loved. Of course, I felt sorry for her situation, but I loved her snarky sense of humor -- she was too funny! As a result of all the changes in her life, Cassie ended up having to give up extra-curricular activities and eventually some of her so-called friends. In fact, Booking Daughter made the comment to me that both of the young girls in Ms. Dee's books were outsiders and felt like they didn't have any real friends. I thought that was really insightful, but I'm a little biased, wouldn't you say?I love how much this book made my daughter think! When she described the story to me, it was very obvious not only how much she liked the book, but also how much she took away from it. I can't help but recommend books like this one to every young girl (and boy!) I actually think JUST ANOTHER DAY IN MY INSANELY REAL LIFE would make an ideal selection for our mother-daughter book club. Ms. Dee has a fantastic website which provides some discussion questions not only for this book, but also SOLVING ZOE!"},{"Title":"Living Huge: Discovering the Path to a Better Lifestyle","review":"I have read this book more than once and I recommend it to anyone who aspire to move on to the next level in their journey towards excellence.

Discussing this between two men is not as useful as having more than one woman in on the discussion to lead you to an understanding of what all men fear, inadequacy in communication.

The Dance of Deception provides an insightful overview of how our own personal truths get blocked by both systemic forces such as society, cultural expectations, family secrets, as well as by inner forces such as overwhelming emotions, personal narratives, and internal confusion. Harriet explores the process of truth-telling in women's lives which begins with tuning into our own personal truths and then effectively sharing these truths with others. Her book clearly illuminates how the quest for our deepest truths is a prerequisite for authentic relationships with both the self and others."},{"Title":"The Dance of Deception: Pretending and Truth-Telling in Women's Lives","review":"After reading The Dance of Anger, I was charged with energy to change patterns in relationships that I had fallen into. I thought this book would have a similar effect, because I know that I hide things that seem too painful to discuss. However, I couldn't get into it because it seemed more of a political agenda than a guide to improving relationships. What on earth does the author's stance on abortions (very pro-choice) have to do with deception in personal relationships? I haven't gotten much constructive self-knowledge out of this book."},{"Title":"The Dance of Deception: Pretending and Truth-Telling in Women's Lives","review":"This book articulates for woman the costs of deception and the benefits that accrue when you give up deception. I love to reread it."},{"Title":"The Dance of Deception: Pretending and Truth-Telling in Women's Lives","review":"Though this book is not new, I just discovered it. Having read it, I now take a different perspective on how 'honest' I am, and how I can approach more honesty - in healthy ways - in all of my relationships. I am not the typical image of 'feminism', in the negative ways the word has come to represent, but I do know that being a woman is an experience to be conscious of. Though it has a heavy feminist bent, one of the best things about this book is that it addresses more than just women's concerns. It tackles the many ways that we all deceive ourselves, and those we come into contact with. It addresses the issues of secrecy within families, 'faking' orgasm, playing out the scripts that we are given for life, and the important distinction between pretending and lying. I appreciated the suggestions about laying groundwork with others before approaching hard truths, and the concept of 'trying on' a different behavior in order to find out where our truths really are.As a fair assessment, I would say that it takes a while to get into the style or format of the book. It's not laid out in sequential order, so it took a few chapters to get totally engrossed. But the case studies, and her responses, rang true so many times, that I got to the point of almost being late for work because I couldn't put it down.I am married and work in a small non-profit with 3 men. I've shared several of my discoveries from the book with them, and had meaningful discussions with all. My ED even photocopied a few pages to share with his wife - another testimony to the concepts presented. You do need to be ready to read the book with an open attitude toward your own behaviors and ways of dealing with others. It's not always easy to admit to things we do, but don't want to claim. I would recommend this to anyone trying to sort out the best path to a whole, healthy, happy life."},{"Title":"The Dance of Deception: Pretending and Truth-Telling in Women's Lives","review":"Full disclosure: I'm a guy, and I read this book at a time when, in my early 20's, I was trying to understand, and come to grips with, my perception that several of my relationships with women (some strictly platonic, some not) were crippled by a certain lack of honesty. So feel free to discount my reaction to this book by whatever degree you feel appropriate, based on the perspective I brought to it. That said, I was disappointed and frustrated by what I found to be Lerner's somewhat shallow and defensive treatment of the topic. I'm oversimplifying a bit, but Lerner's basic philosophy, as presented in the book, seems to be: Dishonesty is often a good thing because not sharing hurtful truths can help you avoid hurting someone's feelings. E.g., not telling a friend that you think certain behavior patterns are harmful or unpleasant serves the &quot;greater truth&quot; that you nevertheless care about her and think she's a good person. Therefore, Lerner suggests, women who deceive the other people in their lives often aren't &quot;really&quot; lying, they're just being kind. Lerner doesn't really confront the ultimately circular nature of this argument. Nor does she provide any reasoned way of distinguishing between innocuous applications of this &quot;if you mean well, it isn't really a lie&quot; approach and more problematic ones. Telling a friend that you really like her disastrous new haircut, about which she's feeling self-conscious and vulnerable, is one thing. Not telling her that you've been deliberately excluding her from certain social situations because your other friends find her manipulative or overly critical is something else entirely. Nor does Lerner, IMHO, deal meaninfully with the question of whether deception that we rationalize on the grounds that it protects a friend from unpleasantness is not often, in reality, an attempt to protect ourselves from the emotional messiness of communicating hard truths. These aren't easy issues, and I don't claim to know the &quot;truth&quot;, or even that there is a single correct approach to dealing with them. But I was disappointed by Lerner's failure to grapple honestly with them."},{"Title":"The Dance of Deception: Pretending and Truth-Telling in Women's Lives","review":"Wow. I consider myself to be a truthful, honest person. I hate liars and hypocrites more than I hate anything else in the world. So I had to take a really deep breath and really THINK when I finally woke up to the idea that truth and honesty are not always what they should be. I took a good, long, ugly look at myself and realized that I use truth as a weapon, rather than as a tool. I am not always honest with people because I want to create a better relationship. I am sometimes honest just to be hurtful, to shock people, or to get attention away from whoever is monopolizing the conversation at the moment. Hm. Ugly!The problematic relationship (s) in my life are like cans. I can pick up a big ol' truth-sledgehammer and knock the heck out of that can, or I can use truth gently, like a can opener and let that can open up and get to what's inside.One option gives me the satisfaction of 'letting so and so have it' because I'm darn tired of biting my tongue and pretending that things are OK when they're NOT. And the other option lets me be honest, but gives the other person (the can) the chance of telling truth back to me, too.The feminist rhetoric falls short, as it always does with me. If you don't want to hang out in the kitchen and pop out babies, for heaven's sake, DON'T. But don't blame men if that's what you decide to do with your life and then change your mind later. Don't you think men change their minds about wanting to be married daddies sometimes, too? There is too much blaming going on. People need to own their lives. If you know your situation is messed up, you know enough to change it.Also, the whole thing about minorities and tokens rings very false when Lerner presents the statistic in her final chapter that women actually outnumber men in the world. So, hello? How can we consider to whine and consider ourselves a token or a minority when we are numerically superior? I don't really get that at all.Anyway. 4 stars. It's an eye-opener!"},{"Title":"The Dance of Deception: Pretending and Truth-Telling in Women's Lives","review":"Harriet Lerner has long been writing books that are both insightful and accessible. In 'The Dance of Deception' she has achieved something miraculous: she has written a book that can help you reconnect with estranged family members and friends, improve your rapport with your children, no matter their age, and, perhaps most importantly, help alleviate the pain that deception has caused you in your own life. I have suffered greatly because of family secrets and have also struggled recently to communicate with my loved ones about painful topics. This book has served as an indispensable guide through these difficult processes and has helped me emerge a stronger, happier person. I am greatly indebted to Harriet Lerner. And I firmly believe the world is a better place for having her in it!!"},{"Title":"The Dance of Deception: Pretending and Truth-Telling in Women's Lives","review":"I bought The Dance of Anger while going through a divorce and it was such a definitivelty written, clear, concise, and useful book that I read it twice. I was hoping another book in the series would prove just as powerful for me but was very dissapointed. While the Anger book outlines a way of looking at how we let anger rule our lives, the Deception book seemed to be a meandering quest to identify what does and does not constitute deception. Not useful as a self-help book, and not signigicant philosophically."},{"Title":"The Dance of Deception: Pretending and Truth-Telling in Women's Lives","review":"Truth-telling is the foundation of an authentic life. Harriet Lerner has written a very powerful exploration of deception and pretending in women's lives, and of the impact hiding the truth can have upon relationships, marriage and family life. She focuses upon the problems which are created by patterns of dishonesty and exaggeration in women's lives, and suggests that we are all affected by \\"lying and faking, by silence and pretending, by self-deception, and by brave - as well as misguided-- efforts to tell the truth.\\" From hiding abuse to faking orgasm, Lerner argues that women's failure to live authentically and \\"speak truly\\" limits our ability to find joy, self-regard, and real intimate connections with others.The Dance of Deception explores the many ways that women have been raised to embrace secrecy, an unhelpful (exaggerated) sense of privacy, and even outright dishonesty in the interest of preserving family and intimate relationships. She illustrates how pretending has become part of our culture's definition of femininity. She argues that women have long been discouraged or deterred from telling truths with might disrupt or create disharmony in relationships. Speaking out (about, for example, domestic violence in the home) may cause emotional or physical harm; however, \\"privacy\\" can serve to isolate women and keep them trapped in dangerous, unhealthy, and profoundly unfulfilling lives.Living a lie prevents both the development of self-knowledge and the development of real intimacy with others, while living honestly can allow for growth within one's self and growth in relationships. Yet at the same time fantasy and pretending can enable women to imagine other possibilities and eventually to \\"grow into\\" desired qualities. Lerner writes passionately about the need for women to be in conversation with each other in order to be one's self and explore one's self; she believes that women need each other in order to understand the more complex truths about themselves and their lives. In community with others, we can let go of patterns of \\"showing the false and hiding the real\\"."},{"Title":"The Dance of Deception: Pretending and Truth-Telling in Women's Lives","review":"I also have the Dance of Anger and the Dance of Connection. The Dance of Deception is the first one that I read and I found it very enlightening. I have reread all 3 multiple times. They are all very good to have in your library to go back to when those issues come around again."},{"Title":"The Dance of Deception: Pretending and Truth-Telling in Women's Lives","review":"this book covers a huge amount of territory, and covers it well, but the chapter I found most helpful detailed the effects of intentional with-holding of an important truth that has direct impact on a child's identity. This 'with-holding' is not based on selfishness or malevolence, but perhaps because it is easier for the family to deal with the issue via avoidance, or because it is deemed in the best interest of the child, etc. I particularly like Lerner's emphasis on the good intentions and complexity behind many decision-processess that culminate in deception and with-holding of the truth.I found this book particularly helpful because our family had an ethnic secret. My parents were torn on whether or not to keep this secret from me, and I am grateful to them for dropping a few hints, my father intentionally, my mother I'm not sure whether intentionally or unintentionally - so that eventually I was able to figure it out. Lerner spoke to me through this book, and understood my issues with this situation more than any of the people I have actually told about it! (including my therapist, although she has been great, too, in her own way.)The ethnic secret, especially in today's world, is really no big deal - but the effect the secret-keeping had on me was to make me feel excluded within my own family. I know other people feel this way, too, for other reasons, but in my case a big part of the quasi-exclusion was the ethnic issue. When I uncovered this secret, I felt very much alone, since it is not any of the more well-known and well-acknowledged ethnic problems, so people often seem more perplexed than sympathetic when I 'share.' The issue of truth in intimate relationships is the real hub of the matter. I feel that sometimes people focus too much on the racial issues and not enough on the effect on me of the 'with-holding of truth,' in my opinion the core issue. Harriet Lerner made me feel so supported, and gave me wonderfully helpful insights into myself as well, through this book.

I have read other Cornwell books including the Sharpe series, Stonehenge, and others. They were OK for pulp fiction, but not particularly memorable. The Saxon Chronicles, however, are the best work that Cornwell has done by far. There is little data about the time period that this series covers, and most of what is available is unreliable propaganda written by the church to protect its image. Cornwell cuts through the haze to produce interesting and reasonably accurate historical fiction. I particularly like the closing comments at the end of each book where Cornwell reveals what is historical and what he invented to move the plot along.The critics who blast Mr. Cornwall as \\"anti-Christian,\\" obviously know little or no church history. Cornwell's claims that the church invented land grants, sold dispensations, and generally behaved worse than a current multi-national corporation are factual. Is the church much better today? Judging from the pedophilia, refusal to recognize female clergy, and insistence on outmoded sexual behaviors, I'd say unfortunately not... But I digress -The Saxon Chronicles is an entertaining and relatively accurate historical look at the end of the first millennium. For those interested in English history, this series is a fun read. WELL worth the time and expense.

This is historical fiction. . not politically correct fiction. Plus, I dont think a reader has to agree with every viewpoint in a book to enjoy it.I have also noticed some criticims about Alfred the Great not being in the book enough or a strong enough character. This book is not a book about Alfred the Great. If that is what you are looking for, look elsewhere.I also noticed some criticism about how the main character in the book is \\"likeable\\" enough. He is a young child/teenager thorughout most of the book thrown into multiple situations that would have killed most people (or drove them to kill themselves).

The Last Kingdom did that for me. So much so, that I read all 5 in the series in less than 3 weeks and am waiting for the next to be published. I thought it was well written. There was just enough detail and backstory to make you care about the characters but not enough to bog down the pace of the story. The dialog could have been hokey & difficult given that the characters are 9th century Vikings but the author used enough old english to give the story authenticity but not so much that is was difficult to read and I often found myself smiling at Uthred's sarcasm.

The author illuminates these times that must have, even then, seemed cinematic in scope. If you managed to live at all, what a whoop of an adventurous life you could live!Cornwell has created a marvelous protagonist, Utred Utredson (or, eventually, Ragnarson) the son of a Saxon Earl of Northumberland. He is adopted by a Norse earl, Ragnar Ravenson, and we get to follow Utred's raising, from learning how to fight and survive in the shield wall, to steer a Viking ship, and to celebrate a proper Yule, (with singing and drinking and storytelling, and lots of warriors out vomiting in the snow.) It is positively swashbuckling; it is enormous fun! But also, as we follow young Utred's growing up, we absorb the myths, stories and beliefs that were at the heart of the Viking life and worldview.Go with it.

They're that good.)"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I'm not going to review the story, plot, or history; those reviews always annoy me.

You will read through it quicker than you thought you would, because the story really sucks you in."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I picked this book up at my local bookstore because I wanted to read something different, and written by a guy since nearly all my historical fiction books I've read have been written by females, I can say that I wasn't disappointed.The writing style of the book is was got me at first. I'm not a big grammar person but at first the long sentences, the many and's and the rambling got on my nerves. I had to wonder what happened in editing that let this go through. But the more I read the more it actually made sense to the overall style of the book. The main character, Uthred wasn't highly educated and this book was written as if he were writing it himself. Therefore the rambling, many and's and long sentences fit the personality of the character.There is a lot of detail and action in this book. You're not bogged down with too much killing or too much court life, there's enough spread around that you're not wishing someone was killed off earlier or who's doing what. This book is also very irreverent and even something very funny. I also like that Cornwell chose to use the Old English versions of many place names to lend a sort of old feeling to the book.I'm reading the second book now and I can't wait to finish them all. I'm hooked."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"***** The Last Kingdom, a Conflict of LoyaltiesDecember 6, 2007By Mary OlsenThe story is based on Uhtred a boy of ten and the son of an English nobleman. He is captured by the Earl Ragnar a Danish chieftain who raised him as his own. Ragnar taught him to fight like a Viking. Uhtred was expected to fight against the English, his people and to take part in the raids and bloody massacres. Uhtred struggled with divided loyalties, between Ragnar who loved him like a father and King Alfred who was his king. It takes the joys of marriage and an awful slaughter for Uhtred to discover his true allegiance.Mr. Cornwell did a brilliant job of explaining the human side of war as well as the importance of loyalty to ones country. Without knowing who you are and what you stand for it is pretty difficult to take a stand and keep it. Bernard Cornwell brought this out in his book The Last Kingdom very clearly. I was very impressed with his ability to bring this story to life; I felt at times I was there with Uhtred. A compelling story and a book that is hard to put down. The battles, though bloody and clearly descriptive, brought realness to the reading.This is the first Bernard Cornwell book I have read, but I will devote time to reading his other work. This is an excellent book for history classes and all lovers of History. I highly recommend this novel to anyone interested in Alfred the Great."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"After 88 reviews there's little reason to describe the story, and written in the first person narrative, it took awhile for me to get into the story, but once I did, I couldn't put the book down. Brutal and savage, (which took some time to adjust to),the story was simply mesmerizing and time passed and pages turned, and I was hooked and lost in the brutal but magical world of Vikings. Although quite different in style, and with far more romance, (more geared for women readers) Elizabeth Vaughan's Trilogy \\"Warprize\\", \\"Warsworn\\" and \\"Warlord\\" was equally as good, and I would say between both of these authors, these were the best books I've read all year."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"What would you do if your lands were stolen, your father killed, and were taken prisoner by an invading barbarian army? I believe when doing the immense amount of research for this book, and the latter ones, Bernard Cornwell asked himself some of these questions.I had read some really excellent historical fiction novels about the crusades when Amazon suggested The Last Kingdom by Bernard Cornwell. Bernard Cornwell does an incredible job of pulling the reading immediately into the story, right in the prologue. The story is told in the first person by Uthred, son of Uthred, and so forth. He comes from the north, where his lands are taken, and his father slain, and his throne usurped by his uncle.This novel, although told about the early life (This is part of a continuating series which is up to book 4) of Uthred, the story is really about King Alfred, later known as Alfred the Great, as he defends The Last Kingdom of England, Wessex. At the time England was divided into 4 kingdoms; which are each being invaded by the Danes from the North. Uthred gives in great, but flowing detail, his life growing up his new family, and \\"adopted\\" father Ragnar. As Uthred grows up, we see what is is like to be Pagan, and how literal God and Christianity was at the time. (I have no dissprect for anyone today, but at the time Faith was much more in Gods hands than I believe it is in our scientific times, today).The story is extremely easy to read, and I find that I have a lot in common with Uthred. While Christianity is very boring from Uthred's eyes, being 10 years old, a boy does not wish to be on his knee's all day, but going out and seeing the world, learning how to fight, forge and shape steal, and learn about the Pagan Gods.While the story is told from Uthred's point of view, about half way through we're introduced to Alfred, and it is from this point that we see the destinies of Uthred and Alfred are closely tied.Readers will not be disappointed, as this story flows easily, and naturally, and once started, you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This is the first book in Cornwell's Saxon Chronicles, which consists of four books and has at least one more coming. The Last Kingdom features warfare, cross-cultural encounters, romance, humor, religion, politics, and revenge. We meet our hero, Uhtred, when he is a child. He becomes involved in the wars between his own people and the Danes. This leads to his being raised by the Danes and with their values, but he never forgets his homeland; he is the rightful king of othe area in which he grew up but his uncle has usurped the position for himself.Uhtred meets Alfred, who is determined to unite the Saxons against the Danes. Uhtred doesn't think much of him, but for various reasons finds himself entering Alfred's service even though his primary loyalty at this point is to the Danes and their gods. Arthur hopes to save his soul. For all of Uhtred's disrespect towards Alfred and Christianity, Alfred respects Uhtred as a warrior and thinks he is vital to saving the Saxon lands from the Danes. Uhtred, therefore, frequently has to re-evaluate his loyalties.The characters are well written--so well that when characters mentioned in the first chapters are reintroduced towards the end, they are instantly recognizable and remembered. While many characters--such as Uhtred--are Cornwell's invention, many of the warlords who appear are historical and their engagements fit well within the historical context in which they actually occurred."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Bernard Cornwell's The Last Kingdom is what every novel, not merely every historical novel, should aspire to. It grabs you from the first pages and commands your attention, well Uhtred commands your attention. Though he is not always an appealing character, the reader is forced to understand (as Uhtred understands) the Heroic Culture that governed the Viking Age. In addition, it draws stark contrast between this culture set forth in Beowulf and the Christian that succeeded it, and Corwell deftly shows the fallacies inherent to both. Without giving away the plot (it really is too good to not discover with Uhtred as he intended), there are some characters you will love, and some that you thought you would going in (Alfred), but end up sharing a view with Uhtred that the unimpressive King of Wessex is an over-pious penitent Christian. The battles are stunningly done, and Cornwell's knowledge of the subject is threaded in seamlessly, with hardly any errors as to weaponry and culture (despite what he says, neither the Danes nor the Saxons had metal rimmed shields, at least from an archaeological perspective). His vivid descriptions of the ships and the shieldwalls especailly bely his true interest in the subject and I would recommend the novel to anyone, whatever your normal reading preferences are."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I haven't finished with the book yet, but at my current pace, I will set a personal record for book completion. I can't wait to start the next book in the series. I'm also giddy because this is my first Bernard Cornwell book and he has such a large (and highly regarded) body of work I will enjoy for years to come."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I did not expect to like this book. Blood-stained medieval epics are not usually my thing. But this book, I believe, would capture the attention of anyone interested in historical fiction. Cornwell creates compelling characters (wow, what an alliteration!), Uhtred in particular, but also King Alfred and any number of Uhtred's friends and enemies. Uhtred's perspective for most of the novel is that of a child, forced into the world that is very adult and very bloody, and it makes it particularly interesting. The author also possesses an uncommon skill in weaving real historical characters into a swashbuckling narrative--the Lothbrockson brothers, King Alfred, King Gorm (Guthrum)--as well as showing us just how close England (and most of its heritage we value today) had come to disappearing. Cornwell's writing is very good, for the most part, though he is occasionally given to uttering cheesy pronouncements (\\"Destiny is everything!\\" \\"Fate is Inexorable!\\" All right, all right, we get it. Fate is important in this novel.) I waited 'till I got through the entire trilogy (though according to the author, it will stop being a trilogy sometime soon, as he is writing another Uhtred book) to write this--and I must say that the excellent quality of this series survives for the most part in the followups--\\"The Pale Horseman\\" (perhaps even more rollicking than this one) and \\"Lords of the North.\\""},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Another Excellent book...I think this is my favorite trillogy so far. Can't put it down...love the carachters and the humor the infuses in his text."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I enjoyed this story so much. The reason I like it so much is that Bernard Cornwell is great at making the protaganist (Uhtred) come to life. He is a guy you would want to have some ale with and stand next to in a shield wall. And speaking of shield walls, no writer is better than Mr. Cornwell at describing ancient battles. Not even Pressfield, and he is darned good!A great adventure that is well researched, smartly written, and just a fun read from start to finish."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I read a fair amount of historical fiction but have heretofore dodged the Cornwell bullet. However, his medieval stuff is pretty good -- The Archer was exceptional, and Heretic almost as good. But he really takes off with this 3-part series about the long struggle between the Saxons and the Danes in 9th century England. The Last Kingdom and The Pale Horseman held my interest from page one to the end and beyond -- I can't wait for the final volume. The series is grounded on solid historical research and the characters, from major to minor, are fleshed out in three dimensions. The hand-to-hand combat of the time is described with an evocative skill I've seen in only a handful of other writers; Steven Pressfield comes to mind."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Bernard Cornwell is by far my favourite author, I love his writing style and it seems to just get more interesting with each new book.With all Cornwells books you get a great story combined with a remarkably detailed view of life throughout different historical periods. With this book you find yourself quickly fixated on the story while all the time learning about the culture of the Danes and Britons, a huge amount of research goes into each of these books to provide an accurate account of life many years ago.This book was great and I would seriously recommend it to anyone interested in historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This book is FABULOUS! Uhtred is but a young boy when his father takes him to battle against the Danes. His spirit and will endear him to Ragnar the Danish war leader and he thus takes young Uhtred hostage. That undeniable spirit and will continue to work for Uhtred as he grows from boy to man through the story of this book and experiences the good and bad of both the Danish and English sides of the battle for England. I liked the description of the Danes and their way of life. It is a side I had not yet explored in my readings of historical England. I found it fascinating and very believable. Cornwall does an amazing job of bringing his characters to life. I felt for Uhtred every step of the way and shared with him his fears, his loves and his losses. The only other account I had read of Alfred the Great, was dramtically different. This Alfred is pious and sickly and his wife is a shrew. I continually found myself hoping Uhtred would chose to remain a Dane and revenge the wrongs done to him. My only criticism of Cornwall in the past has been his over-done scenic descriptions. They continue in this book, but the action and the characters over-shadow any complaints and this book cannot pass with fewer than the 5 stars it deserves. I look very forward to the continuation of this story."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"The Last Kingdom is a real page turner. I couldn't put the book down. I have read numerous books by Bernard Cornwell, but I really enjoyed The Last Kingdom. I look forward to the next book in the series, The Pale Horseman. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves English history and gripping historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Azincourt was my introduction to Bernard Cornwell, and I was immediately hooked. When I tried to find more books by him, I saw that he mostly wrote about earlier historical periods, Vikings, and such. I know English History pretty well after Edward the Confessor, but if you start talking to me about anything going on in Mercia, I'm pretty sure that you're quoting lines from Monty Python and the Holy Grail (\\"we have ridden through the Kingdom of Mercia, since the snows of winter covered this land.\\" \\"Ridden what? You've got two coconut shells and you're just banging them together\\").So I wasn't sure whether I was going to get into this story, or if I would be left wondering what the historical context was and feeling kind of lost. But I am so glad that I took a chance! To start with, it was so much more about the story than the history, so even though I didn't know a lot of the contemporary events, I was able to follow the story just fine. And the storytelling is just sublime. I never once wished that it was anything other than what it was.I loved the characters, and thought they were all really well developed. I never wondered why someone was doing something - it all just seemed really clear, and it flowed wonderfully.As a side note, at the same time I was reading this, my husband started reading a book on the history of ships, and he randomly asked me whether I had ever heard of Alfred the Great, who built the first English navy, and thanks to the fact that I was far enough along in this book, I had. Now I'm really interested in learning more about this time period, and will be getting some non-fiction books. I also can't wait to read the rest of the series.Highly recommended for anyone who is into history, or really awesome stories."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Against the backdrop of the Danish invasion of England during the 870's, Cornwell introduces the fictional Uhtred - the latest son in several generations of sons by that name, who claim the right to rule Bebbanburg (Bamburgh Castle today). Uhtred is 10 when his father dies in battle and he is kidnapped by the Danes.Eventually coming to love the family who kidnapped him, Uhtred stays with them until he is kidnapped again - this time by Alfred, King of the West Saxons - at around age 15/16. Through a series of manipulations, Alfred secures Ultred's loyalty. He becomes a warrior fighting for the king, but still dreaming of securing Bebbanburg.While the fictional story takes precedence, Cornwell provides an overview of the history. Alfred is a sickly, pious man determined to hold his ground. The Danes are blood-thirsty warriors equally determined to conquer all the land they can. Other rulers throughout what is now England are weak. They fall to one or the other leaders.THE LAST KINGDOM is the first in a promising series of books on the Saxons."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I have just read the three books that make up this Saxon Series and they are so entertaining. You will find yourself living in their time period. When my husband suggested them, I wasn't too enthusiastic, but after reading the first 10 pages I was hooked. Now waiting on Book 4.I felt book 2 The Pale Horseman was the best, just because it was such an entertaining read and you want to read it cover to cover as fast as you can. I read book 3 slower, just because I knew book 4 wasn't out yet.Now I am on the the Arthur Series, everyone seems to like these also."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"To find quality historical fiction is difficult, yet Cornwell may be the best at this time. This version of Alfred the Great's victory in uniting England and saving it from the \\"Lords of the North,\\" i.e. the Danes, is a gripping story. As others have stated earlier, his version is not without prejudice, yet that is the flaw of historical fictions. Often the author is more important than the history. I did not feel this was the case with this book, although his depiction of much of the christian church is stereotypical, with little nuance. That being said, this book is good fun- great entertainment!"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Before \\"The Last Kingdom\\", I had only read the Warlord Chronicles Trilogy from Cornwell, includingThe Winter King: A Novel of Arthur (The Warlord Chronicles: I),Enemy of God: A Novel of Arthur (The Warlord Chronicles: II)andExcalibur: A Novel of Arthur (The Warlord Chronicles: III). While I enjoyed that, I sort of felt something was lacking. I wondered if \\"The Last Kingdom\\" would be more of the same repackaged.\\"The Last Kingdom\\" kicks off in 868, when the Danes are ravaging and invading the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Written in the first person from the viewpoint Uhtred of Bebbanburg, the plot follows the ebb and flow of Uhtred's life, though it is a very high-paced \\"ebb and flow\\". Right from the start, Uhtred's life is thrown into chaos as he finds himself a prisoner of the Danes. This unwillingness does not last long, and soon Uhtred almost becomes one.Alfred the Great also looms large, casting a long shadow over the plot, even when he is not directly in focus. Uhtred is relatively keen to offer his observations about Alfred, as well as a host of other things, and some elicited a good giggle from me. Uhtred and some of his companions have a great turn of phrase.The thing that I noticed with Uhtred, as opposed to Derfal in the Warlord Chronicles, is his depth and three-dimensional substance. While I had Derfal pretty much pegged, Uhtred had me puzzled about his inner motivations until the end of the book. The major elements are discernible enough, but there are shadows in Uhtred's character that do not easily yield to prying. This aspect of Uhtred is one of his most appealing, a mark of Cornwell's growing skills in characterisation, (which I thought were excellent to begin with).\\"The Last Kingdom\\" far surpassed the Warlord Chronicles, I am happy to say. I loved every page and was hooked right to the end. I can only hope it is not too long before volume four comes out, as I may soon be in need of it. This is some of the best fun I have had while sitting down."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"The Last Kingdom is the fist Bernard Cornwell book I have read, but it won't be the last. Cornwell weaves a wonderful tale, full of interesting and compelling characters, around real historical events and people. Cornwell mixes just enough historical fact to make The Last Kingdom interesting to history buffs without belaboring the point and making it boring. His characters are real and believable and his descriptions of scenes evoke vivid mental images, you can almost hear the banners snapping in the breeze as you anticipate the battle to come. The Last Kingdom is a wonderful story and a very enjoyable read, a page turner that is hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This is the first Cornwell book I've read -- I generaly eschew historical fiction -- but now I am going to read all of his other books because he has blown me away with this visit to ancient England.

I have been ok with the lastest Conrwell books; but I felt that Gallows Theif and The Grail Quest serise have been missing something. Here Cornwell has found whatever whatever it was that had been missing a good story with strong and complexcated charecters.It is interesting to see as the book goes on who conflictred Uthred is over everything should he fit the English who are the people of his birth or should he fight the Danes who treated him like one of their own? Also there is a large amount of dry wit here that has been missing in most of Bernard Cornwell's books since the last of the Warlord serise.Overall this book is a promising trend in the writting of this author and I hope that this book is part of a larger serise."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Although it wasn't as electric as The Archer's Tale or some of the stunning historical fiction of Steven Pressfield (Hot Gates, esp.), this book was a fun read. I am looking forward to continuing the series of a young Northumbrian warrior's upward trajectory within the realm of King Alfred, who looks to fight back the Danish worde seeking to envelop the whole land. Only Sussex survives and Uhtred, raised by Hagnar the Dane, the man who killed his brother and led the Danish army against Northumbria, crushing the army his dad was helping to lead, straddles both worlds.What a tale! Cornwell is a master of historical fiction and did a great job bringing to life AD 866 England with its awkward place names, though he has a listing of the place names to help, and the vivid names.Pagan England--newly Christianized in many parts--lives and breathes in this novel. I couldn't help but root for the pagans, though. Ouch! Like the Huron Indians in the New World, once a people go Christian, they go soft, making them a ripe target for the still-pagan Iroquois. Or Danes.My only criticism is that I wanted some sexual imagery, though the violence was apt. Spice it up, Mr. Cornwell, who, in describing a woman, never seems to go below the face. After all, this book is for guys. Not that we're looking for a Harlequin romance, but I think some occasional T & A references would fit in nicely after the swordplay. Weapons, ale, and a curvaceous woman--not much has changed in all these centuries--to make a guy happy. We're such simple creatures.But we make history, which Bernard Cornwell very much brings to life here."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Bernard Cornwell's \\"The Last Kingdom\\" is fantastically written historical-fiction. If I had to read the actual history books of Alfred the Great, I'd probably bore myself to death. But Cornwell's insertion of the fictional protaganist Uhtred to mix it up with the real historical figures of Alfred, Ivar, Ubba among others, makes \\"The Last Kingdom\\" a book that you will not be able to put down. I read it in 7 days.The dedication to detail by Cornwell concerning the battles, the trades of those days and the religious issues in the 9th Century England will leave a lasting mark in your mind well after you've finished reading it. If you're a Christian, you might find the anti-Christian attitude amongst the protaganist and the Danes a bit offensive, but at the same time a Christian shouldn't really be offended because we know who ultimately wins out in the end of these epic battles. Every Christian knows that not every person was, is, or will be a Christian. Also, Jesus Christ is openly glorified by Alfred the Great altough he knows he is a great sinner at the same time.I recommend this epic masterpiece to any Medieval history buff and I eagerly, eagerly await \\"The Pale Horseman\\", the 2nd installment in this new series by Bernard Cornwell.

I did enjoy this read and have every intention of reading the next volume in the series, as well as some other Cornwell books, but I thought this could have gone deeper somehow, been more satisfying in terms of probing/developing the main character more fully. This could be absolutely magnificent with the time and setting but falls short somehow. I was a bit surprised with the close of the story -- following a gory battle with talk of a harp.....what? It just didn't seem to flow or make sense to me. Again, I'll go for the next volume and will also try \\"Agincourt,\\" which sounds really good. Perhaps the characters will be a bit more intriguing.

Uhtred, the son of an Earl becomes an orphan at ten and is captured and adopted by Ragnar the Dane. He is taught the Viking ways and Ragnar becomes more a father to him than his own father ever was. He loves the unrestricted, impious ways of the Danes and learns to become a formidable warrior.King Alfred, (later known as \\"The Great\\") is portrayed as an over pious but clever King of Essex. While Alfred is not a well-liked King, he is an intelligent one and soon comes to bind Uhtred to his cause against the Danes.The brutally descriptive battle scenes are exciting and repellant at the same time. Battles and wars are not described here as glorious and heroic circumstances but as what they really were, brutal, bloody, and often times fatal.This title was an excellent read and I just couldn't put it down many times at night. I've read it until the wee hours of the morning. I believe this is the best BC title I have ever read to date, even though I haven't read any of the Sharpe's novels (that era and place settings are not of interest to me).

The hero is a spunky boy who amuses a Viking chief during a battle and is adopted; the Norse life proves to be more suited to his taste and he grows up as a Dane.

If you enjoyed the Warlord Chronicles you will be sure to enjoy his Saxon stories. The reason this novel lost stars is because it has a number of problems that make it somewhat inferior to other books Cornwell has written.First, the main character Uhtred is just a recycled version of Derfel from the Warlord Chronicles. Like Derfel, he is a pagan warrior who narrates the story and has most of Derfel's beliefs and mannerisms. Unlike Derfel, he is highly unlikable because he is arrogant and only shows loyalty to whoever can benefit him at the moment. Despite these traits, Uhtred is made out to be the perfect hero of the book.Which brings me to another point. In this book and its sequel \\"The Pale Horseman\\", Cornwell seems to place far too much historical importance on the actions of his fictional protagonist. After all, these books are supposed to be about Alfred the Great, the Saxon king who drove out the Danish invaders. Yet Cornwell seems content to portray Alfred as an annoyingly pious weakling who only succeeded in defeating the Danes because of the fictional Uhtred. Uhtred is gifted with the hindsight of the author and is therefore able to predict everything that the Danes will do and know exactly how to defeat them in every engagement. For some punk who isn't even out of his teens, this all seems too much to achieve.Also, Cornwell always has an axe to grind against Christianity and this book is no exception. Like almost all his books, in this story Christian characters are generally portrayed as sniveling and stupid weaklings. He always throws in one token likable Christian character, but this person is usually not a proper Christian at all. I enjoy Cornwell's books, but as a Christian it never ceases to annoy me when the author insists on depicting all Christians as horrible and misguided people simply because he has some unfathomable grudge against us.If you find yourself looking past these problems, you will no doubt enjoy this book very much. It has all the good qualities which are characteristic of this author, and it was interesting to learn a bit about a period of England's history that I myself was not at all familiar with before reading this book."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Name the Kings of England.Well, there's mad old George III, who lost the Revolutionary War. That's one. And Henry VII, everyone remembers him. After that, there's King James, who we recall from his version of the Bible, and the one who gave up his crown to marry the American woman, and the one who got his head chopped off.After them, and maybe Richard III from the Shakespeare play, the collective memory (at least on this side of the Atlantic) goes a bit dim.But only one of those Kings of England who we really don't know or remember was named \\"the Great,\\" and that was Alfred, who ruled from 871 to 900, back in the days when the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was on the bestseller list, at least for people who could read. Bernard Cornwell thinks we should know more about Alfred and his times, which is why he has written THE LAST KINGDOM. That should be enough of a recommendation for anyone.Cornwell is the author of the bestselling Richard Sharpe series, which follows the adventures of a hard-charging British soldier during the Peninsular Campaign. Although Sharpe is a great character by himself, one thing he serves to do is to illustrate the greatness of Lord Wellington --- the commander of the British forces in Spain, and Sharpe's own patron. Wellington (at least as portrayed by Cornwell) is far too stiff, aloof and unlikable to ever be the hero of his own tale, and Sharpe ably stands in.The same trick is tried in THE LAST KINGDOM, with a twist. The first-person narrator here is Uhtred, who is the son of a minor lord of Northumbria. As a child, he is captured by a raiding pack of Danes that are \\"going Viking,\\" or raiding the coast. The young Uhtred becomes the adopted son of a Viking leader and learns a central, universal truth: Vikings are cool.Vikings are cool for the same reasons that Vikings have always been cool. Vikings don't have to brush their teeth (not that anybody did, much, in the ninth century). Vikings get cool swords and stand shoulder to shoulder in the shield wall. Vikings don't have to learn how to read, or say their prayers, or build a stable, efficient society based on the rule of law. Vikings don't have to do any of that, so they arecool.While Uhtred is with the Vikings, learning the way of the warrior from his surrogate parents (and bedding a nubile wench or two along the way), the story meanders along, explaining the Viking way of revenge and the blood feud and the glories of Valhalla. But Uhtred is English and wants nothing more than to reclaim his lost castle and birthright; to do that, he may have to return to his own people. And when treacherous Danish opponents of his foster family launch a surprise attack, he has no choice but to do so.Alfred is different because he, at least for his day and age, was civilized. Uhtred misses few opportunities to sneer at Alfred for his Christianity, his belief in law, and his supposed softness. Uhtred takes off the cross and puts on the hammer of Thor because he finds Thor to be the stronger --- but Thor lives on today only in the pages of Marvel Comics and in the name of Thursday. It was Alfred, and Western Civilization, that were the stronger in the battle, and it is Cornwell's job to show why.THE LAST KINGDOM is the first of a proposed trilogy, which will show how Alfred defeated the Danes and established England as England and not as a Viking protectorate. As such, it is just the beginning of the story, and a long and bloody epic it promises to be. Cornwell is a talented historical novelist, and he's at the top of his game here --- all the more so because the history of the ninth century is much less documented than the nineteenth.The novel provides a lot of insight to our time, of course, with Western Civilization again under threat. And the character of Uhtred, going back and forth between the civilized and uncivilized worlds, is emblematic of the struggle (as well as being a skilled teller of tales and describer of battles). But none of this explains the appeal of THE LAST KINGDOM so much as these three words, which are all you need to know about the book.Vikings are cool.--- Reviewed by Curtis Edmonds"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Bernard Cornwell, perhaps our best writer of the historical adventure novel today, scores high with the first book in his Saxon Stories. I'm a devoted follower of Cornwell, and in my opinion, The Last Kingdom ranks with the better Sharpe stories and exceeds The Heretic.The Last Kingdom tells the story of the 9th-century Danish (Norse or 'Viking') invasion of Anglo-Saxon England (or Englaland as they said a millennium or so ago). The fierce Danes roll over three of the four kingdoms and have only to finish off the pious Alfred, King of Wessex. This book begins the story of Alfred's resistance. The Saxon Stories relate how Alfred became known as the only 'Great' king in English history.Highly recommended for fans of Cornwell or anyone who like historical adventure stories. Terribly exciting battle scenes on the 'shield wall'."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It's a great story with intricate characters. Cornwell lets us get to know many different sides of one story. You get to know the Vikings or rather Danes and what kind of people they are and the people of England who are barely Christians and also the priests and pious kings. It's very interesting to read about a time in the English history that isn't written about much in historical fiction. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Bernard Cornwell's \\"The Last Kingdom\\" sees our favorite spinner of rollicking historical fiction turn his clever eyes to the historical mists surrounding England's King Alfred the Great and his defense of England against the invading Danes (known to you and me as the Vikings). For those familiar with Cornwell, there are few surprises here, and that is a major plus.This tale of 9th-century England is told by Uthred, a fictional character (while many of the other characters in the novel are real-life historical figures). A Northumbrian, Uthred is captured in battle by the Danes as a child and raised as a Dane, learning their mythology and values. Yet Uthred remains English at heart, and knows that even while he has learned to honor (and even love) Danes, his destiny will see him fighting in the shield wall against their invasion. Uthred's inner conflicts make him one Cornwell's more compelling heroes.9th-century England is really four separate kingdoms, and over the course of the novel the Danes sweep over three, leaving Wessex to stand alone as the Last Kingdom of the title. Wessex is led by the scholarly, sickly, pious, and reluctantly randy Alfred. Uthred has little affection for this man, particularly when placed alongside Uthred's favorite reckless Danes, but Alfred remains a player to be reckoned with. Alfred has the talent to see Uthred's military prowess, and Uthred rises to become a leader of the English forces.As one can expect from Cornwell, battle scenes pepper the novel, and Uthred finally gets the chance to satisfy his dream of standing in the front of a massive shield wall against hundreds of foes. Fortunately for the reader, Uthred is a man of humor as well as might, and Uthred spends a lot of his time bedeviling Christian priests by pointing out the inherent weaknesses of their faith when compared to the noble (and relatively reasonable) worship of Odin and the other Norse gods. Uthred also has a remarkable ability to be able to tell folks what they want to hear -- while most of Cornwell's heroes have a tendency towards brutal honesty, Uthred has a refreshing talent for mendacity.Since this is clearly the first novel in a series, the climactic scenes are relatively reserved but are nevertheless satisfying. Several juicy plot lines remain unresolved, and there are still Danes aplenty in England at the conclusion of the novel. One can hope that this series will progress in the same fashion as Cornwell's other medieval trilogies, the Grail Quest series and the King Arthur series. In \\"The Last Kingdom,\\" Cornwell has taken a lean, mean first step with plenty of thrills and a surprising amount of humor. One heck of an enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"As an avid reader of history and historical fiction, I have developed high standards. I was not disappointed with The Last Kingdom. It is not contrived, it does not have people acting outside of character to benefit the plot, and its descriptions of life in the times ring remarkably true. I can't wait for the sequel, and will likely dip into other Cornwell before it comes out.The book tells the tale of the Danish invasion of Britain in the ninth century through the eyes of Uhtred, a Northumbrian ealdorman who is orphaned at age ten and sees his patrimony stolen by an uncle. Raised by his Danish captors, he grows into an accomplished warrior while grappling with conflicting loyalties and religious convictions. Don't start this book if you have something else that needs to be done quickly, since you may find that you can't do anything until the last page is turned."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I first heard of this series because one of my other favorite authors, George R R Martin (The song of Ice and Fire series), had posted a blurb on his website describing how wonderful Cornwell is.Martin was right. 100% right. I was blown away by what I read and could hardly put the book down.Usually I enjoy reading high fantasy fiction as written by Martin and Jordan. I was extremely happy with the book despite being used to reading about magic and dragons. The story is excellent and the characters are well done. The pacing is quick, the numerous battles are written beautifully. Important events happen frequently and are surprising. All in all, an excellent read.I cannot wait to devour the other 30 or so Cornwell books. It will most likely take me years, but after reading the first couple of chapters of THE LAST KINGDOM, I knew I was in for the long haul.Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"The Last Kingdom is Cornwell's latest foray into the historical novel, and yet once again he displays his ability to mix fact with fiction, intertwining plots and subplots with actual historical events.In the past he has created great heroic figures in Richard Sharpe and Nate Starbuck, and his latest avatar, Uhtred of Bebbanburg, will I think, take his place alongside Cornwell's other beloved characters.Despite the story opening with Uhtred at the tender age of ten, the character is no less developed than other Cornwell creations, and within very few pages the readers find themselves fully engaged within the story.We follow the lonely young man. While accompanying his father in an attempt to defend his home from Viking raiders, Uhtred is captured and we learn his struggles to survive his new situation. We also follow the history of the ninth century, and Alfred \\"The Great\\" and his struggle to preserve Wessex and the English country.From what I have read in this opening book in his new series, Cornwell has again given us a window to the past through his obvious love of history and appreciation for the periods he writes about.Armchair Interviews says: We're looking forward to reading the next in the series The Pale Horseman and know we won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"One of the negative Amazon reviews for this book says it's the kind of stuff only 12-year-old boys will like. Well, I'm a 52-year-old woman and the unabridged audiobook version read by Tom Sellwood has just become my favorite audiobook of all time. If you love pre-medieval history, paganism, and warriors, there's no way you won't love this book. If you appreciate strong, real characters and a reader who brings each one to life with so much individuality, you forget it IS only one reader, you'll especially love the unabridged audiobook. I listened to it twice in a row. The only thing wrong with it is that it's too short!I desperately hope that Bernard Cornwell will insist on Tom Sellwood reading the audiobook versions of the rest of the books in this series when they come out. (And hurry about that...please!)"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"The Last Kingdom by Bernard Cornwell was one of the better novels I've read recently. The novel is the story of Danish invasion of England in the middle of the 800th century. After having conquered three of the four English kingdoms, Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia, the Danes turn their eyes to the last kingdom, Wessex. Wessex however, is led by King Alfred the Great, who although pious, won't give up as easily as the other lands. Alfred must put together a force of fighters to hold off the Danes, or all of England will be lost. The story is told through Uhtred of Bebbanburg, a lord holding land in Northumbria. The novel begins in the year 866 A.D. with the capture of ten year old Uhred by the Danes. From their Uhtred tells the tale of his time with the Danes, his escape, and his greatest triumph. Everything we see in the novel is through him, and he proves to be an incredibly engaging protagonist. It had everything I look for in a good book. It had excellent action, awesome, powerful dialogue, and incredibly realistic battle scenes. Cornwell's characters were varied, and engaging in their own ways, and there was enough humor to keep the plot from becoming to serious. Cornwell also did a great job in keeping the plot moving and excitement present throughout the novel.I would give the novel a perfect five out of five stars, and recommend it to anyone that would enjoy an action filled portrayal of 800th century England, and the trials of the times. As long as you can also handle some gore in the battle descriptions and a little crude talk and humor, The Last Kingdom by Bernard Cornwell is the perfect book for you."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I really enjoy Cornwell's books. I especially liked the Warlord series with King Arthur. That was one of my favorite reads of all time. (I even liked it better than the Fire and Ice series from Martin.) This book seems like more of the same. Uhtred and Brida = Derfel and Nimue. Are his novels becoming too formulaic? Still, I enjoyed it and have ordered the second book in the series. Good read but not spectacular."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"As much as I love historical fiction, I had put off Bernard Cornwell for a while because I'd heard his work is very war-based, which is not normally my type of historical fiction. But when this was reduced to only $0.99 on Kindle, I thought I might as well give it a try. If I didn't like it, I hadn't lost much and then I'd know for certain that Cornwell's work is not up my alley.As expected, there are certainly several battles featured but I was surprised to find I enjoyed them. I don't think I'm going to be jumping into the whole sub-genre of historical war novels but Cornwell's battles are so well written and engaging, I did not find myself bored or lost.But I also realized that \\"The Last Kingdom\\" is so much more than battles. The characters are interesting, the time period comes to life, the plot keeps me wanting to know what happens next. Which I guess is what any well written novel should do, whether war-based or not.I was also surprised by the fact that Alfred is really not the protagonist and a good portion of the book is portrayed from the Danes point of view, specifically from a fictional character called Uhtred. All I really knew about the series when I got the book was that it was based on Alfred the Great. But it's actually more about Uhtred, which isn't a complaint. Uhtred is a highly entertaining character and the book surprised me once again by being so amusing at times. I found the Danes attitude towards life and the English to be hilarious sometimes. The humor trailed off in the second half but it showed how Uhtred changed and matured.Even better, it familiarized me with historical figures and a period of history I previously didn't know much about and I always love that. I'm so glad I gave it a chance and I'll definitely be reading the rest of the series. I'm especially excited because I'd been looking for a novel based on Alfred the Great's daughter and apparently a few of the books in this series strongly feature her."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This is SUCH an awesome book. Interesting to read, great storyline, suspenseful, a little dragged out at times, but I could hardly put this book down. It's been quite a while since I read a book this awesome. I totally loved it! The characters were great! I mean, who thought history could be so interesting? The only downside was the crude language (Extremely crude, do not recommend for young teens, children or christian people, or anyone who has a problem with crude language). It became a bit unnerving at times but i kept at it cuz the story was too good. Anyway, sad to say, I do not think I will be reading the other books in this series because of that reason. But I must say, good job mr. cornwell, you really delivered."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"As an avid reader of historical fiction, I find Bernard Cornwell's prose to be some of the most likable and unforgettable the genre has to offer. Within the first few pages you feel like the main character, Uhtred, is speaking directly to you in the 9th century. Cornwell doesn't come at the reader with the style of a 21st century novelist, but from the \\"fresh\\" perspective of someone who actually lived in the age. To be frank, he writes like I imagine someone in that time period speaks (granted, with allowances for his audience). Cornwell isn't selling to 9th century pagans, after all.Uhtred is both a highly likeable and deplorable character. He is arrogant and selfish and wants nothing more than to fight and earn a reputation so he can regain his ancestral home that was surreptitiously stolen from him by his uncle. He is honorable in his own unique way, and is blessed (and cursed) with an upbringing by both Danish warlords and his native Saxons. At times he reveals himself to be highly intelligent and battle-strategy savvy - highly unlikely in this novel due to the fact that he's a teenager, and I doubt he's picked up a recent copy of Sun Tzu's Art of War - and at other times he's a stupid, immature kid who acts his age.Regardless of your opinion of the story's protagonist throughout the novel, the storyline is excellent, the supporting cast both humorous and vibrant, and the battle scenes exquisite - the latter of these being my favorite piece of the novel. Cornwell's fight scenes are simply incredible. You have to read them to believe them."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I originally purchased this for my husband who has a double major in English and History with an emphasis on the Middle Ages. Because of all the reviewers who were very impressed with the quality of the writing and awed by the authenticity of the historical references in this novel, I thought it would be right up his alley. It was, and he was blown-away. He then insisted that I read it - convinced that I would enjoy it just as much as he did. I did! Although not my usual genre, Cornwell's gripping writing style pulled me quickly into the story. His characters were realistic and likable, and his detailed descriptions of the sights, sounds and smells of this period really brought it to life. A fun adventure from start to finish!"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"The first novel in Cornwell's \\"The Saxon Tales\\" is a overwhelming success! This is a series that you don't have to read in order. I read the fifth novel first and the first novel second, if that makes any sense, and I didn't miss any background information. That's how well written these books are! How Cornwell can juggle all these serial novels at the same time is remarkable. I keep flip-flopping between Bernard Cornwell and Sharon Kay Penman as to who is the best medieval historical fiction writer. I guess it depends on whose book I read last.The period of the novel is between the years 866 and 877 in what is now known as England, but at the time was divided into four parts. The Danes had conquered three parts and were getting ready to take Wessex, the last bastion of the United Kingdom. The protagonist is a ten year old boy named Uhtred, son of Uhtred, Earl of Bebbanburg in Northumbria. Uhtred is captured by Danish Earl Ragnar in a battle that kills Uhtred's father. Ragnar takes Uhtred under his wing and rears him as a pagan and a warrior. Uhtred loves his 'new' father, but has mixed loyalty between his adopted Viking friends and the King of Wessex, Alfred The Great. When the unimaginable happens, the young christian/pagan warrior is out on his own to discover who he really is. I think this is the main theme of this series, and it leads the reader to a disambiguation of Uhtred's thoughts and motives throughout the six novel series.The characterization in this novel is terrific, even making some of the Vikings lovable. The author notes that most of people in this novel are real, as are most of the major battles. The main character ( Uhtred ) and his adopted father, Ragnar are fictitious, but very believable. I also enjoyed the Priest Beocca and the rascality of Uhtred's friend, Brida. Cornwell lets us hang for the next book to find out what happens with Ragnar's son, who is searching for his sister and planing revenge on the despicable Kjartan and his one-eyed son. You will have to read the second book in this series, \\"The Pale Horseman\\" to find out! That's what makes this series so much fun.If you haven't read a Cornwell novel, you don't know what you are missing. There are many chronicles, series, and stand- alone novels to choose from. I give this novel my highest rating."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"My wife and I have listened to all six action packed audio books beginning with \\"The Last Kingdom\\" and ending with \\"The Death of Kings.\\" Bernard Cornwell does a wonderful job of creating fictional characters and making them come alive during the historical time of King Alfred the Great and the Saxon/Danish wars. We mostly listened to the books when traveling in my car but would become so engrossed that we often sat in our garage after arriving home and continued to play the CD'S for 15 or 20 minutes. We liked them so much that we gave the first two books to all my brothers for Christmas presents. They are great and I highly recommend them.

Job well done, again by this awesome British author. He did his researches very well. A book not to miss.A boy called Uhtred was the main protagonist of this series. He lived during the Viking and English warring period. Story continues with his adventures and confusions between his double identity: a Briton, and yet a Viking. Cornwell is the master in mixing the history with normal day-to-day life during the period. History fans should read this novel.Anyone enjoying such historical fiction stories, should also try the Vagabond series by the same author. Another series of books not to miss!!!"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This is my first time reading Cornwell.

I've reread this book many times since I first got it. Throughout the book I keep thinking what I would do if I was in Uhtred's situation. Would I stay with Ragnar and the danes becoming a warrior to fight Alfred and the English. Or join the over pious Alfred and defend England. As much as i hate to admit it, being a dane would, in my mind be a better choice. The only down side to this book is that, it kind of makes you start disliking Christianity and wanting to be a pagan.All in all this was a fantastic book. A most have for anyone who enjoys historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I tried reading a Cornwell novel some years ago and wasn't impressed enough to finish it. I don't even remember what it was anymore, but it read too much like male-fantasy, damsels in distress, easily identifiable good and bad guys, etc. I like adventure and action, but I want full-bodied, complex characters also.I'm glad that after reading many good reviews I decided to give Cornwell another chance. This novel delivers in many ways. I found the historical context very interesting. I loved all the strange place names and found this transitionary period sort of post-Roman and pre a unified Britain very interesting. It fills in a lot of blanks, actually, and provides a foundation from which to understand works of early English literature like Beowulf. Actually, part of what I like about this is how strong the narrator's voice is. It submerges you in a different world and in a way of seeing the world which reminded me of the trance you can get into reading original works from distant times, like Gilgamesh and the Iliad. That's not something that most contemporary novelists writing about the distant past usually managed to do. Cornwell really achieved something in that.And the action is great. Deadly, brutal, frightening. I wouldn't have wanted to be in a shield wall, but it's fascinating to read about. This is still a very manly book, but it has a feeling of mythic history about it. And in a strange way it's sensitive to the fate of women in this world. The narrator doesn't get soft about it, but again and again we see just how difficult and dangerous this world was for women as well. One night could change the fate of your life forever, and that happens several times in this book. I like it just about as much as I liked Pride of Carthage. It's not as large in scope as that book, but page for page its tight and focussed.My only disappointment was that at the end it's so very obvious we've just read the introduction to a series. I know this should be a good thing since I liked the book, but I would've like to have seen Uhtred's story given a full treatment. Instead we're told this is just the beginning, and that Uhtred will have a part in future books but not be the central character. It's no big complaint, but I don't quite like reading a whole book to be set up for the next product in the production line."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"What an incredible book!!!I will not go into the synopsis of the book - you can read it in other reviews. I have read several Cornwell books, my favorite of which is the Warlord Chronicles, and this book is just as good. I also loved the Grail Quest series. It seems that I gravitate to Cornwell's Dark Ages books.The book seems to follow a similar pattern as that of the Warlord Chronicles, the Grail Quest series, and the Starbuck Chronicles. Whatever Cornwell is doing - I hope he doesn't stop.This book is filled with twists and I felt my loyalties being swayed as the main character moved between the waring factions.I rarely give a book a five star rating; however, I feel this book is worthy. Pick this book up if you like anything Cornwell writes. The formula will be familiar, but the story is outstanding!"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Bernard Cornwell has not written a bad book. I remember buying the first Richard Sharpe novel many years ago, and hoping that there would be more of Cornwell. He has written a trio of thrillers, but his forte is historical fiction.The Last Kingdom is the first of a promised series set in medieval England at the time of Alfred the Great. The protagonist, Uthred, is captured by the Northmen and raised by them. He is conflicted by his affection for his adopted father, Ragnar, and his nascent love of England. There is historical detail in plenty, excellent character development, and Cornwell's excellent prose style to please even the critical reader.In sum, Cornwell has produced another splendid book."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This book is a prize winner. I do plenty of Norse research, and nobody has it as right on the mark as Bernard Cornwell. And such fun.Can you just picture those Saxon's and those Norse pledging their oaths? King Alfred and his priests with their totems: the feather of a dove that Noah released from the ark, a glove that belonged to Saint Cedd revered for reversing the disaster of Babel, and most sacred of all the toe ring of Mary Magdalene. And then the Viking, Guthrum, forcing King Alfred to pledge on his mother's bone he wears in his hair. All of these medieval guys now bound by oath to uphold the peace---which none of them intend to do anyway. So very lovely.The shield walls, the oar walking, the catholics and the pagans--Cornwell has is all perfectly."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This one is a nicely done rendition of the period when the Danes were overrunning England and Alfred, king of the holdout English kingdom of Wessex (land of the West Saxons), stood nearly alone against them. After the other kingdoms, including Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia had fallen, there was only Alfred's Wessex and Alfred, a somewhat prissy churchman, seemed the least likely of English kings to hold them off. But he proved a surprise to his contemporaries and, of course, to the Danes.This tale tracks an English lord, an ealdorman, who is snatched from home and hearth at the tender age of ten in the course of a Danish raid on his father's coastal holdings and subsequently reared as a Dane. Coming of age in the warlike culture of the vikings, young Uthred Uthredsson must balance competing loyalties to his adopted Danish father and his English heritage. This first volume in a projected series carries Uthred to King Alfred and his first big decision, and then back again into the jaws of destiny.There is not much of a story here . . . just lots of fighting and running (or sailing) about. But it's all well told and keeps the reader with Uhtred all the way. The book suffers from a certain thinness in characterization though. None of the players are particularly memorable, not even Uhtred, our protagonist. And Bernard Cornwell spends an awful lot of time giving us details of time and place, showing off his extensive research. But he makes it all work.I liked this one much better than I liked the first in his Warlord series, The Winter King (I never read the other two in that series because the first just failed to move me). That earlier one was about the Romano-Celt, Arthur, in his legendary fight to hold back the Saxon tide and defend the Celtic land of Britain. But, of course, as we all know Arthur lost despite his brief moment of glory when he defeated the Saxons in a series of big battles. This one, on the other hand, is about the descendants of those temporarily defeated Saxons, now firmly established in the land they conquered after Arthur, as they struggle to defend themselves against new invaders from their old homeland, their cousins the Danes.Of course, the Danes were among the earliest vikings so this one is basically a viking tale and there's a great deal more historical information to work with in telling it, including the record left behind by the English clerics of the period, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which reports the earliest invasions of Saxon leaders like Hengest and Horsa and takes us right up to later viking times.But if you really like viking tales, as I do, there are lots of others out there, some better than this one. Among my favorites are The Golden Warrior: The Story of Harold and William by Hope Muntz, about the struggles of Harold, the last English king, against William of Normandy for the English throne, and the recently publishedSaga: A Novel of Medieval Icelandby Jeff Janoda. This one brilliantly retells a fascinating tale found in the Eyrbyggja Saga, one of the most famous of the sagas of old Iceland. Both are powerful novels in the old Norse saga tradition and either one has Cornwell's new entry beat. But The Last Kingdom is a decent read, too, and better than some of Cornwell's other efforts.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I won't go over the basic plot line, as that has been discussed many times so far on this page.

Now I'm at a point where I need to read a few books to complete the current research. The book was called The Ruin, though I recently changed the title to Wyrd, which is Anglo-Saxon for destiny. While the book is set in the fifth century in England and has characters that may turn out to be Arthurian (I'm not sure yet), the intention of the novel is to encompass the feel and texture of the Early Middle Ages, at a time when society was essentially beginning anew for this forgotten island.When I started reading The Last Kingdom by one of my favorite authors I got the chilling feeling that Cornwell had done what I was trying to do with my book. And after finishing it, there's a lot in it that I can see coming out in my novel, and yet Wyrd will go in different directions and achieve different goals. Nevertheless, The Last Kingdom was a great book for anyone wanting to get a feel of the ninth century and what it was like for the Anglo-Saxons living there and having to deal with the invading Vikings who were trying to settle and do essentially what the Anglo-Saxons had done a couple of centuries before to the Britons. While the main character, Uhtred, is but a boy at the beginning and the narrator, our hero is Alfred the Great (the only British king ever to be called \\"the Great\\") and while I'm not sure how long the series is going to be, the reader will see Alfred grow up and become the great king that earned him the title. I'm quite familiar with Alfred's history and life and how he emulated Charlemagne in a lot of ways, and it's really enjoyable to see this fictionalized account from one of my favorite authors, which has been well researched, and to see these historical characteristics in the people in the book.I will freely admit that Bernard Cornwell isn't exactly the most in depth and complex historical fiction writers, and his characters aren't always the fully developed real people they should be, but he still does the job well and gets his point across in giving the reader a look into this life, just as he did with his Grail series set in the Later Middle Ages, and his Arthur series. It's also the kind of book that anyone can pick up and get fully sucked into without getting confused or lost along the way with heavy history and jargon. Cornwell is also sure to point out as much of the native languages as he can, with plenty of translations, to clarify it all.For more book reviews, and other writings, go to [...]"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I have always thought the history of my own name's patron, Alfred the Great, king of Wessex 871-899, would make a great historical novel. Now Bernard Cornwell has risen to the task, and the result is interesting, if not always satisfying. Since my interest is in Alfred rather than the author, I have not read any of Cornwell's other novels, so I cannot compare them to the present one.Generally Alfred is considered the hero who saved the British Isles from the invading Viking hordes. However, in Cornwell's saga we encounter Alfred's world through the experience of the narrator, Uhtred, who grew up among the Danes and feels much sympathy for them. Cornwell clearly enjoys his contrarian history, where the Anglo-Saxons are a bunch of pious whiners and the Danes are the admirable and free-spirited heros--aside from a bit of mass murder, of course.Now, we do eventually get the point that we are looking at history through the eyes of an aged narrator who remembers his childhood and adolescence, and not always accurately at that. But after a while the prejudices get grating.It is not that the story drags; for the most part it moves quite well and keeps our attention. But it seems that whenever we turn the page we encounter yet another priest or bishop who is stupid, superstitious, and has a runny nose. Not only does this get quite tedious, it is also the most unhistorical facet of the whole narrative. To be sure, all the chronicles praise Alfred's outstanding, and in some eyes perhaps excessive, piety and devotion to the church. But all we know about early Medieval Christianity belies the picture we get from this otherwise historically mostly accurate novel.One rather suspects that when it comes to religion the author's own prejudice gets in the way of his formidable talent as a storyteller. If it were not for that, the book would surely merit four stars as a very good, although perhaps not outstanding, piece of historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"The Last Kingdom has a decent story line, but the writing itself is pretty dull. I found myself skimming by half way through the book, wishing I could just quit. In the end I finished, but I did not find the story telling to be very engaging.

Mostly, however, he is a believable character, given how young he is: 10 to 20.The book is like a slightly raunchier version of Robert Louis Stevenson.The writing is uncluttered; the action sequences good; Cornwell's devotion to \\"the idea of England\\" (whatever that may be) puzzling."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"The title of this review and the review are written in Anglo-Saxon or Old English, which was the language of England during the time period in which this story takes place.

But although the concept was exciting, the reading was not.I didn't expect this to be a great work of literature, but I did at least expect it to hold my attention. Instead, the story plowed ahead, leaving interesting characters and situations behind. For example, Uhtred declaims about the blood feud for his \\"father\\" Ragnar, but later doesn't really want to go with Ragnar's son Ragnar Ragnarson to kill Ragnar I's murderer.Too much emphasis is placed on Uhtred's being torn between the Danes and the English. We've seen it all before, come up with something new!Granted, this is the first of a projected series, but it ends in a rather truncated manner. Uhtred even says something like \\"The story speeds up now\\" which seems like Cornwell got tired of writing at this point and decided things better wrap up quickly.I guess if you have a really good attention span and don't mind it when authors repeat certain phrases they think are really awesome (\\"Destiny is everything!\\"), by all means, read this book."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Cornwell is one of my favorite authors, thus the 3 stars.This book, however, is not up to par for him. It is obviously setting up a trilogy (at least) but it did not have the power that his other trilogies like Vagabond / Archer's Tale / Winter King, etc. had.This seemed like one long introduction for the next book.Hey, everybody has bad days."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Yeah, this is an alright book, with a main character and plot that's interesting enough to keep you turning pages. It is however a nearly complete recycling of his very successful king Arthur series. The point of view, the prejudices, many of the characters - nearly everything - are just like The Winter King, except that it isn't as good. This is quite normal, as creative inspiration hits on a certain idea once, and then you really need to move on before you get bogged down in repetition.In addition to the lack of new ideas from the mechanics of writing (plot, characters, style, you name it, it's not new), the book is mired in post-modern skepticism that makes it popular to the modern reader, but utter trash as history. Both Derval (narrator from Winter King) and Uthred (narrator here) share an amazing doubtfulness of many core beliefs of the time period that is so close to what 'popular culture' teaches us now, that most readers don't even notice it. If you're at all familiar with the period, and the actual thinking of the period as reflected in their various sagas and writings, you'll see this as the rubbish it is.As part of this thinking, Cornwell undermines the internal setting itself and undermines your ability to believe in it, mostly due to poor craftsmanship. His pathetic anti-Christian attitude portrays all churchmen as slimy schemers, any Christian as a feeble, guilt-ridden whiner, and most of the leaders as duplicitous persons completely uninformed by an ethical religion (even pagan). You wonder how Christianity survived the time since it is being espoused by a bunch of low-lifes who don't even have the ability to explain their own beliefs to the main character, and who generally express themselves in terms of superstitious nonsense that is really paganism, despite the religion being nearly 1000 years old at that point.2000 years of history shows us that Christianity acted, and acts, as a civilizing influence over people's greed, narcissism, vile and violent impulses. It spreads literacy and education, encourages rule by law and not by the sword, discourages murderous blood feuds, the massacre of innocents and the oppression of the weak and vulnerable. It also has a beautiful and powerful message to deliver about humankind and it's relation to the infinite. The pagan Danes had the moral compunction of modern Mafiosi, with a gangster mentality that belongs to \\"The Godfather\\" films, the Sopranos, et al. Their own sagas reveal the endless cycle of murder, theft, exploitation and amorality that typifies their style of living, but you won't hear it from Cornwell. He makes it sound like a wild rock concert with shieldwalls. Also, he conveniently overlooks that somehow, despite the shortcomings (the _humanity_) of its adherents, Christianity succeeds in getting the Norsemen bowing their heads before any military defeat did.All this is unmentioned in Cornwell's juvenile approach where he juxtaposes a sort of hippy 'do-what-you-like' paganism against an oppressive 'hey kid, toe the line' Christianity that is completely unbalanced. You get the feeling he just doesn't have a good grasp of history, or he just has a post-modern agenda against the only civilizing influence the Barbarian West has ever had since it destroyed Roman hegemony.Overall, a lackluster piece of hack writing, but better than nothing for those of us who enjoy the Dark Ages and want to read it in a style that resonates with our modern, spiritually bleak, secularist lives."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I was looking forward to starting another Cornwell series after completing the Grail Quest and Starbuck Chronicles. What a disappointment. I had to force myself to read the first 40 pages and finally gave up. The first person perspective relating youthful events by an aged narrator just didn't work for me. \\"It was a long time ago, so I may not remember exactly...\\" got tiresome in a hurry. There was potential for exciting passages with Viking raids, but the vivid descriptions I enjoyed in Grail Quest were nonexistent. I'm in the minority, but I thought this was dreadfully boring."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I recieved the book in a timely manner and in the condition I expected it to be in, which is the condition the seller said it would be in.

Not unlike this present ageI look forward to reading the other books in this series. Thank you to the author ..Gilian M Beresford Holby."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"It's hard to say enough good about this novel. Cornwell's descriptions of battle are amongst the best ever written. His characterization is mostly excellent, especially Uhtred. His novels move fast and keep you constantly engaged. I would say his weakness is writing female characters who, frankly, are a bit less than convincing. Anyone who loves medieval historical fiction has probably already read this novel, but if they haven't they should."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I most frequently read female-centric historical fiction books, many of them happening to be written by female authors, and most of them clocking in around 900 pages. This book was somewhat of a departure from my comfort zone, but it was a pleasant journey. I don't find Cornwell to be as descriptive as other authors in this genre, and I found myself missing some information about the landscape or identifying features of the places in the book so that I could try and match them with their modern day equivalents. I also wish there had been better character development of the supporting cast, but I thought he did a nice job with Uhtred. After reading this book, I was eager to move on to the next in the series - I attribute this in part to the easy length. As a time-challenged person, it's hard to find time to read for pleasure, so the thought of reading a series of 900-pagers can be hard to commit to. This was a good, palatable size; the story moved swiftly; and Uhtred has enough dimension to keep him interesting.Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I love historical fiction. Granted, my definition of the category is fairly broad - covering pretty much any piece of fiction that delves into a realistically historical past. I love the more literary works, but also love good historical action and adventure. I cut my teeth on Conn Iggulden's \\"Conquerer\\" series, which provides a fascinating look at the lives and conquests of Genghis Khan and his immediate successors. I'm a big fan of Roman historicals as well, and so Simon Scarrow's military-focused \\"Eagle\\" series does the trick.What I'd read from both Iggulden and Scarrow is that they look to Bernard Cornwell as one of their own authorial heroes. With their recommendations, there was little to hold me back, so I finally jumped into Cornwell's world with \\"The Last Kingdom\\" - a story follows the invasion of what will become England by the Danish, (aka Vikings). Cornwell focuses his story around the young Uhtred, inheritor of an Earl-dom in the North who's abducted and eventually adopted by the Danes. Uhtred's allegiances vary over the course of the novel but he never loses his foundational character elements born from both his English and Danish upbringings. Cornwell deftly balances these characteristics without forcing all-too-easy clich&eacute;s.Through Uhtred's eyes, we visit a world in transition - between early British settlers, or what the Roman's would've considered barbarians, and those that would become \`English', with the Danes/Vikings making a significant play for outright ownership of the British Isles. Being a fan of Roman history, I liked Cornwell's integration of the ghosts of Roman existence throughout the locations in the story. Roman ruins exist throughout the kingdoms, some only as ruins, and some as the foundation for current inhabitants.Cornwell also explores the role of religion through the comparisons of the monotheistic world of the English and the pagan world of the Danes. And again we see world in transition. While few Danes start adopting Christianity, we see many in England who still hold tightly to the pagan gods of the North. Some of Cornwell's funniest exchanges revolve around religion, and usually delve into its most practical impact on their lives.King Edmund and the Danes are negotiating a peace and he states, \\"There is only one god, and you must serve him.\\" A Danish leader responds rather pragmatically, \\"But we're winning,\\" Ivar explained patiently, almost as if he talked to a child, \\"which means our gods are beating your one god.\\"In the most practical sense, the Danes are invading England as a play for more land and more territory, but Cornwell also imbues the story with a more cosmic view, \\"There's a war between the gods, Uhtred, war between the Christian god and our gods, and when there is a war in Asgard the gods make us fight for them on earth.\\"Another running theme is the role of fate in the lives of these characters. While they're free to make decisions and run with their own lives, characters on both sides of the religious divide believe, in the end, that \\"fate is unstoppable\\".Cornwell writes with the fluidity of the seas that surround the islands that he clearly loves. He develops believable characters, and personalities that are intimately relatable despite the great width of time and circumstances that lies between the pages and the readers. The story lines are dramatic and heavy, but Cornwell doesn't mind poking fun either, as evidenced in this introduction to one of Uhtred's more distant uncles: \\"I found another uncle, this one called Ealdorman thelred, son of thelred, brother of thelwulf, father of thelred, and brother to another thelred who had been the father of lswith who was married to Alfred, and Ealdorman thelred, with his confusing family, grudgingly acknowledged me as a nephew...\\"\\"The Last Kingdom\\" succeeds, as all good historical action novels do, by permeating its blockbuster scenes of battle and blood, with good characters and effectively threaded plotlines. I'm a Cornwell convert and have already placed his next Saxon Chronicle on my wishlist."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Amazing book.

All he wanted to do was fight/kill and have sex. We see very little of his emotions. Within the first few pages I had a mental image of Arnold as Uhtred.

Cornwell's literary worlds always feel rich and deeply lived in. You can practically feel the ancient English landscape spring up around you as you connect to his magnificent protagonists (and devilish antagonists). This novel feels a little less visceral than some of his other books, but there's still plenty of action and suspense to keep you turning the page. Pick it up when you want to be transported to another world - you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This is a terrific begining to a multi-book tale. I enjoyed the author's attention to detail of the era and to the inclusion of the cultural dynamic between Danes and the various English peoples in the 9th century. The character of Uthred is developed from childhood through early adulthood and should appeal to young and older readers, and including female characters is a nice touch.The use of locations in England is interesting as the author uses the ancient names and makes one want to look up the modern possible locations.

Cornwell goes into great detail about the time period, the clothes, weapons and the politics of the time, this is what promises to make this series a truly great one.As with most of Cornwell's novels the main character is an ordinary guy in this case Uhtred who is the son of an English noble who at the age of nine is captured by the Danes and raised by one of their finest warriors. After many years and many lessons in the ways of war he has grown into a strong and fierce warrior, but after the murder of his adopted father he turns his back of the Dane way of life and joins the armies of Alfred The Great who is the last surviving King of England to batter and destroy the Dane threat for good, but also to get revenge for the murder of his adopted father.For those who like history mixed with action this series is for you, a brilliant read."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This is the first time I have read any of Bernard Cornwell.

I read for pleasure, and Cornwell delivers every time. Just when I think \\"he can't surprise me anymore\\" -- because I've read all his books -- well, he does anyway. Okay, most of his novels are rip-roaring grand adventures, but they're more than that. They're imaginative. They tear chunks out of fascinating (mostly British) history and I feel like I'm there. It's an illusion of course. All historical fiction is fantasy at some level, no matter how true to the facts -- as we know them (after all, as the cliche goes, history is written by the victors) -- but writers (myself included) have to remain comfortable to the modern-day reader. So, dialogue is necessarily 20th century in most historicals. Anachronisms are the norm, not the exception. But, we love it that way. We have to relate to the story, first and foremost.And Cornwell does that. At least, and I'm guessing here, he relates to the male readers. Strong male leads, heroic and sometimes bloody-minded, who grow by the end of their books in ways adventure heroes rarely do. But here, in this book, the first of the Saxon Chronicles (my favorite, to date from Cornwell, with the possible exception of the Arthurian trilogy) -- here the women are stronger, deeper, richer and maybe as true to the dark ages as we can be while not alienating modern readers. There's rape (nuns and such), there's blood, betrayal, slavery, oath-breaking, Northmen (not Vikings Cornwell's quick to point out, that means \\"pillagers and raiders\\" not Northmen) -- I'm truly surprised movies aren't made of each and every one of Cornwell's epics. They're so movie-perfect.But Cornwell, high adventurist or not, does bring us deep into character here. Perhaps it's the first person perspective. As with the Arthur trilogy, it brings the reader deep into the \\"mind\\" of a hero from the dark ages. I think Cornwell is the master of the first person adventure novel. It's so rarely done. Most thriller writers (self included) want the freedom to jump over to a new point of view. But here, Cornwell maintains suspense, even in the first person, and allows us to know Uhtred, his hero, a Saxon who is raised by Northmen. All the way through, Uhtred struggles with his loyalties. He fights for Saxon's against the Northmen -- but it's the Northmen he loves. It adds a rich dimension to this imaginative adventure that otherwise is missing in many historical epics.It's the story of Uhtred, but ultimately the history of Alfred the Great, a compelling character in history who Cornwell does NOT glamorize. If anything, it's the bloody Northmen who are glamorized, and the pagans at the expense of rising Christianity. It's such a compelling point of view, jumping into a pagan character's point of view and making Christianity seem superstitious. The irony is magnificent. And real. Because I'm so very sure this is the sort of thing that went through the heads of people of the day.You'll tear through this book in a day. I'm so glad I picked mine up at a time when books 2 and 3 were already on the shelves. I would have had a difficult time waiting for them to come out a year later. Read them all. They're entertaining, in some ways thought-provoking (bear in mind, they're mostly adventure historical fiction), and as true to the dark ages as you can be without turning away the reader."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Much has been made of the comment that Bernard Cornwell is the heir apparant to the late Patrick O'Brian. No where is that statement more fully realized than in this grasping and grappling ripsnorter of a novel. The battles are bloody, but then they no doubt were so and the characters involved are lusty and often bloodthirsty, but certainly not without compassion and humanity, although none of them are particularly \\"nice\\" by contemporary standards. These tales are not for the squeamish or otherwise faint of heart, but then history seldom is as tidy or aseptic as we might like. Nonetheless, this is an exceptional historical novel and highly recommended. If you love O'Brian or Stephen Lawhead or even the westerns of L'Amour or Zane Grey or the sophisticated historical fantasies of Guy Gavriel Kay, you'll find in Cornwell similarities, but his style is uniquely his own."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Historical fiction at its best.

So much so in fact that I have read it twice this summer.Cornwell tells the story and history in such a way that it is very vivid in the mind's eye. I was drawn deep into the life of Uhtred and found myself wanting to know more. I will be reading the second novel on this topic soon.For those who like action novels that require a more than a little IQ to enjoy, this one is for you."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I've been reading Bernard Cornwell since I discovered (and devoured) the Sharpe series about 15 years ago. He writes a wonderfully fast-paced narrative with great action and enough background where you end up learning all sorts of things about the historical period where the story takes place. After finishing the Grail quest series, I moved on to other writers, notably George R. R. Martin and his excellent series A Game Of Thrones. But am I glad Cornwell's back and writing about a period that interests me to no end. His characted of Uhthred reminds me so much of Derfel from the Arthur series. Heroic, stubborn, fearless, I read this book in 2 days, couldn't put it down. I just picked up the second from this series, The Pale Horseman, and I'm tearing through it. I just wish the third installment was already out in the stores so I could continue the saga. If anyone wants to read an exciting historical novel set in the early Middle Ages, this is the one for you. Absolutely great!"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"The Last Kingdom is definitely not Chick-Lit. This is a classic tale of adventure set in the time before England became a nation. There are bloody battles in the shield wall, storms on the high seas, palace intrigue, and the passions of a young man. The Saxons (English) were being attacked on a regular basis by the Danes (Vikings) and the years of battles provide the backdrop of this tale of a young man's life.Bernard Cornwell weaves the more or less true story of Alfred, the first \\"Good King\\" of England, with incredible detail. He stays away from the over-hashed reworking of Alfred's legend and gives readers a fresh look by using a fictional boy named Uhtred. Born as the second son of Uhtred earl of Bebbanburg he is captured when the attacking Danes kill his older brother and father in battle.Uhtred is raised by the leader of the Danish force, Rangar, that killed his father. He is treated as a slave until he rescues Rangar's eight year old daughter from an attempted rape. His first act of bravery earns him the respect of his captor who now raises him as a son. It also earns him his first enemy. Uhtred grows to become a warrior and loves it.His fate is complicated by his Saxon blood lines and he crosses back and forth between camps several time during this tale. He manages to maintain close ties with both sides which complicate his choices about which side to remain loyal to.This is a great story of a young man growing up as a warrior. It's told from the perspective of an older Uhtred looking back on a grand life. He clearly loves the simple life of being a warrior and fighting in the shield line with his friends. He forges deep friendships and goes toe-to-toe with his enemies. His years have given him an understanding of how foolish and lucky he was as a young man and in his latter years he is yearning for the young man he once was.I recommend this book to anybody that is looking for a good adventure story. But be warned, this is the first in a series about Uhtred and Alfred. You are going to want to read them all if you read the first one."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"How does Cornwell do this? Once again, he has come up with a great idea to blend his excellent characters into an interesting period of history. Sure, there are some unlikely events and 11-year old Uhtred can be wise beyond his years, but all in all this is an excellent book that I recommend to anyone interested in historical fiction, in particular 9th century England and the invasion of the Danes. This is Cornwell at (or near) his best."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"The Norsemen raided the English kingdoms for decades, but in 866, they attempt outright conquest. Huge armies of Danes descend first on Northumbria, then Mercia, then East Anglia, until only Wessex, the richest Saxon kingdom and the most southern, survives. And the Danes plan that Wessex will be next. After everyone else has fallen before them, few doubt that Wessex will fall--and English culture will be eliminated from the world. But King Alfred isn't willing to give up so easily.Early in the invasion, Uhtred of Northumbria is captured by the Danes. For his ten-year-old bravery after his father is killed in battle, the Danes adopt him, raise him, and teach him to fight. He adopts their religion--which is the religion of his ancestors although the English had adopted Christianity after their conquest of most of Britain--their fighting ways, and their casual attitudes toward sex. But when his adoptive father is killed in a feud, Uhtred flees to Wessex where he is welcomed by Alfred and put to work. Although his kingdom is under threat, already Alfred plans on a time when the Danes will be defeated. He wants Northumbrian, Angliacan, and Mercian noblemen under his banner--under his control.Author Bernard Cornwell personalizes a mostly historical tale with the fictional life of Uhtred. Through his eyes, we see the power and ambition of the Danes, the long odds against their invasion's success, but also how close to success they came. Because the Danes were a society of warriors, they were able to put a much higher proportion of their men into battle.Cornwell's battle descriptions are high points of the story--both vivid and convincingly detailed. It's easy to imagine the shield wall as men fight and die. Because Uhtred is committed neither to the Danes nor to Wessex, Cornwell is able to play with the personalities of the historical figures, letting Uhtred see both their strengths and their weaknesses.Cornwell is a master of military-historical fiction and THE LAST KINGDOM is a welcome addition to his work."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This is my first Bernard Cornwall novel and I have already ordered the second in the series and started it. Others have described the story but it is about a fictional character living during the time of Saxon king Alfred the Great. The era is harsh and there is evidence all around the characters of the decline in life since the Romans left 500 years before. The Saxons invaded, expelling the Britons to Wales and Cornwall. Now the Danes are raiding from the sea, then settling in the eastern parts of England after killing or expelling the Saxon inhabitants. The character is captured by the Danes as a boy of 10 after his father is killed. His captor takes a liking to the boy after he tries to attack the Danes with a boy's small sword. He lives with the Danes and becomes a warrior with them. His captor, Ragnar, eventually names him his second son.Eventually, he returns as a young man of 20 to the Saxons but does not like Alfred and is disliked and encounters treachery far worse than the life he has led with the Danes. The battle scenes and, indeed the whole tone of the novel, resemble the novels of Steven Pressfield. There is some similarity toGates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae, Pressfield's best novel. This is as good and is a new area of history that I know less about than the Greeks. I look forward to reading more of Cornwall's books.I read this on Kindle which is satisfactory although it would be nice to be able to flip back to the pages with place names to check the Saxon name against the modern name (London is Lundene, for example). I recommend the book and will continue reading the series."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Oh please Mister Cornwell, why do you insist on portraying my Viking Ancestors as cynical, battle scarred, insensitive savage heathens? Oh, wait a minute...that's right, they were. But then, that was just our women! The men? Well, they did provide the English world with the word 'berserk.'As a die-hard Cornwell fan I am in awe of the range of historical eras that he writes so well about. As a hack writer I'm a little jealous as well. Okay, more than a little.His research and attention to historical battle detail makes for interesting reading. His characters are always interesting, always memorable and occasionally more dark and frightening than any of the latest vampire yarns and yawns. Vampires aren't real. Cornwell's dark blood lusting characters are very much entrenched in fact.Is THE LAST KINGDOM a good book? Yes. Do you sometime stumble over the names and tongue-twisting ancient places? Yes. But will you be highly entertained and historically enlightened? Viking-A!Bernard Cornwell brings history alive and in the process of entertainment he teaches us more about what we should have learned in school, if only we had remained awake then, or say, were beaten more.Go through all of his series when you get the chance. Cornwell is a treat!"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This is the first book in the series. I'm currently reading the second, the Pale Horseman. I've decided to stick with it because I am learning a lot about this period of English history and I find the books interesting enough. However, I am a bit disappointed. The book is narrated by the main character as an old man looking back on his youth. I usually find first person narratives limiting for lengthier works and definitely it is not the best for this four(?) volume series. Because the narration is first person we are limited to Uhtred's view of all the action. Because he is looking back across many years to his youth, there is a feeling of distance from the action and characters. None are truly developed. We hardly know him, let alone his friends, surrogate parents, rivals, enemies. What little we do know of Uhtred is not so very engaging or sympathetic. He appears to be loyal to no one, we see no real insights into his mercenary soul or his supposed longing to reclaim his inheritance. While there is lots of moral ambiguity, there's no corresponding exploration of human nature caught in morally ambiguous circumstances. It's a nice history lesson, but not much more."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I got this on a whim from the base library and it is great. Normally, I listen to books as I drive in the car, but this one was good enough to bring in and finish in the house instead of watching TV. The book is written in the first person and is very descriptive and draws you right into the narative. I knew nothing of the ~900s English time period, but his descriptions are so complete, that it's very real. The reader is excellent, just the right amount of emotion and a good speed for listening. I'll definitely look for more by this author and reader!"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I am a Richard Sharpe fan, I've read every one of everything ever published about Sharpe. Bernard Cornwell is a genius writer of historical novels and gives you the real history at the conclusion of his slightly fictionalized writing. I've read the Sharpe series three or four times and will read them all again. But wait! The Saxon Chronicles! Cornwell has done it again, a wonderful look at 799, that's even before the great depression. The Danes, the Saxons, the Vikings, the Northmen and Uhtred. Wonderful story, wonderfully crafted by Cornwell. An ancient page turner that leads to a rewarding trilogy. Try it..you'll like it. And if you're very lucky you'll read it on a Kindle, as I was lucky enough to do. My first Kindle experience...ah, but that was four books ago and I've had my kindle ten days. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I've tried Cornwell's Sharpe series and didn't like them and only reluctantly tried this book, but I was very pleasantly surprised.This book is very well written. It's a fictional biography from Uthred, a Saxon ealdorman's point of view, written as an old man and starting from his birth.Some of the reviewers didn't like the book because they didn't like Cornwell's portrayal of the church or Anglo-Saxon England, but hey, it's not Cornwell's portrayal or an accurate presentation of history, it's supposed to be Uthred's bio from his point of view.History and religion aside, the book is easy to read and flows along smoothly. The characters were well written, and have the required \\"depth\\". To me, this is the best part. I like the characters in it, and they are really what makes the book. OK some of them are too cliche, but that's alright. Cliche characters exist in real life too, think about that mean boss or that supercilious waiter. And I have met modern real life Vikings who would have been right at home 1000 years ago.There is enough action but not overly so. After all, this is historical Anglo-Saxon fiction dealing with the Viking invasions and I'd be very disappointed if there wasn't a lot of fighting. It's also good that we see this fictional history from the Dane's point of view since we only generally see this from the English side. I like the historical interpretation as well, and remember, it's from Uthred's point of view! A really nice bonus was the humor written in the book.So to summarize, what do we have here? We have Anglo-Saxon historical fiction that is well written and fun to read, characters that are realistic and fun to read, and history from a side we don't usually see. What's there not to like? I like this book a lot and can't wait to read the rest of the series. A 10/10."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"\\"The Last Kingdom\\" is set in ninth century England and sees a Northumbrian nobleman called Uhtred look back to the early part of his life. Uhtred's father, also called Uhtred, was the Ealdorman of a region between the Trent and the Tyne. The family home is called Bebbanburg, a practically impregnable fortress. Although the family are good Christians, the Wolf Banner flies from the fortress - claiming the family's descent from Woden, the Saxon God of War. Since England was made up of several kingdoms at the time, Uhtred was subject to the King of Northumbria - Wessex, East Anglia and Mercia also had their own Kings. Uhtred's story begins in 866, when he was nine years old, on a trip along the coast with his father, his elder brother and Aelfric, an uncle. In a time when priests are praying that God will \\"spare us from the fury of the Northmen\\", the three Danish ships they spotted sailing up the coast were obviously a cause for concern. Uhtred's elder brother is sent with a dozen men, scouting after them. However, Uhtred the Elder only wants to know where they land and gives strict instructions to return before nightfall. Unfortunately, his son is snared and one of the Viking warriors kindly delivers his severed head the next day.When the raiders take the city of Eoferwic a week later, Bebbanburg's army joins a combined Northumbrian force. Unfortunately, it gets suckered at the city, Uhtred the Elder gets killed - along with Northumbria's King and Ealdorman Aella. Uhtred the Younger, our narrator, is taken by the same Viking -Ragnar the Fearless - who killed his brother. The Vikings install Ealdorman Egbert as Northumbria's King - he is, however, only there to do as the Danes tell him.Uhtred is raised by Ragnar as a son, and he doesn't take too long in adapting to the Viking way of life. He embraces the Viking religion, doesn't miss his father and plainly likes the man who killed his father and his brother. Ragnar already has three children - his eldest of which is already a warrior who is fighting in Ireland. Rorik, his second son, is only a year younger than Uhtred and the pair become good friends.The Danish expedition is one of conquest, and is being led by two brothers - Ubba and Ivar. Ubba is a fearsome warrior, though superstitious - he will only fight when the signs are right. Ivar, on the other hand, has a little more sense than his brother. As a result, things become complicated for Uhtred. Being raised as a Dane inevitably leads to him fighting against his own countrymen. Northumbria is only the beginning - as time passes, more Danes arrive and the invasions move to Mercia, East Anglia and Wessex. The information they have on Wessex leads them to believe there won't be much resistance. The region has a weak new King, while the King's brother - Alfred - is only concerned with chasing women.Things are complicated further on the Danish side by Kjarten and his bad-tempered son, Sven. Kjarten commanded one of Ragnar's ships until Sven took a grave liberty with Thyra, Ragnar's daughter. Luckily, Uhtred manages to save her - though Sven isn't let off lightly when Ragnar hears of it. Nevertheless, the father and son pairing will remain enemies for life. Aelfric, Uhtred's uncle, also proves a threat. Since he now smells an opportunity to become Ealdorman himself, he's now quite like to see Uhtred absence from Bebbanburg become a lot more permanent. From early in the book, however, it's clear he plans to win back his rightful home - and also that he owes a great debt to Alfred, his king.An easily read and a very well-researched book overall, although - naturally - there has been the odd tweak here and there. There only slight weakness was Uhtred's tendency to obsess on certain things - especially shadow-walkers and shield-wall. Life was very different then - for example, priests and bishops didn't remain celibate and your average daughter didn't get too far into her teens without being married off. Sex was obviously a big recreational hobby, though since nothing rude (!!) is ever described in detail those with an innocent mind will make it through unscathed. (Uhtred, amusingly, did once ask a bishop if there were women in Heaven he could hump). A likeable, easily read book."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Bernard Cornwell does a wonderful job of portraying interesting characters in fascinating situations. Great storytelling of the conflict between Saxons and Danes in a Hobbesian world, with an unexpectedly sensitive side for a book with such rousing battles.Some may be disturbed by the graphic violence and its aftermath, so this is not for kids. When you get this book, buy the second one (\\"The Pale Horsemen\\") as well, because you'll want it when you finish the first one.There are some interesting similarities between \\"The Last Kingdom\\" and \\"The Last Light of the Sun\\" by Guy Gavriel Kay, which also involves Alfred the Great. Similar title, topics, themes, and characters, but both books have lots to offer and are worth reading."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I must confess I owe my introduction to Bernard Cornwell, the writer, to Sean Bean's debonair performance as captain Richard Sharpe in the screen version of his Sharpe's novels. And for that I will forever be in debt to Mr. Bean, because Bernard Cornwell's writing is a rare, most satisfying treat.Uhtred, the protagonist of his on going saga The Saxon Tales, is again a young warrior. Strong, handsome, fearless, and impetuous, Uhtred is nevertheless a devoted friend and a passionate and faithful lover.Saxon by birth, Dane at heart, he is like his country (Britain in the ninth century AD) torn between two peoples, two cultures, two gods.Raised by Ragnar the warrior Dane who killed his family and destroyed his village when he was ten, Uhtred grows to love his adoptive father and his Viking ways. But, as Uhtred reminds us repeatedly, the three sisters under the Tree of life spin the threads that are our lives and the boy's world is again turned upside down when his new family is also killed and he, left to wander in the warring landscape that was England at the time.Circumstances force Uhtred to swear his alliance to Alfred, the only Saxon king still fighting the Danes. Bound to him by honor now, he must help this king he despises, even as he knows that Alfred's victory will impose a religion and a new order that will eventually destroy the world he loves.Action packed, and terribly amusing, this is historical fiction at his best."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This is the first Bernard Cornwell I have read, and he is a very easy and captivating author.

A good feal for the life of that time."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"One of the endorsements on the back of the book stated \\"the direct heir to Patrick O'Brian\\". In all fairness to Cornwell, I think this is rather insulting. Cornwell excels in many of the areas where I feel O'Brian is lacking, most specifically the ability to tell a coherent story. Whereas O'Brian skips over crucial plot points, offers confusing dialogue, and tries to impress the reader with arcane language, Cornwell is able to place the reader in the time period, describe customs and technologies, and offer a riveting story.After having read some rather dry historical books on Viking history I was hoping to read a novel which would bring some of the historical events to life. Cornwell does this quite well. He describes the pagan religion in good detail as well as some of the customs. He interjects historical events into the story, albeit with slight twists at times (if the reader is familiar with the events it will bring a smile to their face since he executes the twists cleverly).The one short coming of the story is the main character who is some what lacking in the protagonist department. He serves as a vehicle to tell the story, but I didn't feel overly attached to him or his fate. I don't know if this would change after reading the next book or not.To end on a positive note.

Yet as war between the Saxons and Vikings threatens to determine the fate of England, Uhtred must discover where his true allegiance lies. Cornwell's masterful storytelling has the reader rooting for both sides in this conflict. The Danes are happy, life-loving people, while Alfred and his Saxons are quite dour folks. But still, Cornwell has us sympathizing with the Saxons' plight. In the end, Uhtred's decision is as difficult for the reader as it is for the main character, which is why this novel works so well.

Great story line based around history in a loose sort of way."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"They mostly won't admit it (because it sounds unprofessional), but in studying two cultures who come into conflict in the past, even historians have their personal favorites, like anyone else. Not the \\"best\\" side, simply the side they unconsciously root for. I tend to favor the barbarians. Of course, one generation's long-haired invaders are the next generation's defenders of civilization against the next round of newcomers. To the Romanized Britons, the Saxons were the interlopers. To the Anglo-Saxons a few centuries later, it was the Danes. Cornwell, one of the best writers of military historical novels in the business, makes a very convincing case for the warrior culture of the Danish invaders of the 9th century as the superior side, though they aren't really that different from the Anglo-Saxons, aside from the addition of Christianity.It's A.D. 866 and Uhtred, younger son of the Anglo-Saxon lord of Bamburgh Castle in Northumbria, is ten years old when his older brother is killed by a Danish raiding party. But the Danes aren't just going a-viking this time. Led by the three sons of the late Ragnar Lothbrok (who is only mentioned once or twice, actually) they're there for revenge, and to capture the four kingdoms of England and settle in. Then Uhtred's father dies in battle and the boy is captured, to be adopted and raised by Lord Ragnar, who treats him like another son. Before long, Uhtred is more Danish than Saxon -- a division of loyalties that will follow him the rest of his life. The story follows the progress of the Danish invasion, as seen through Uhtred's eyes as he grows up, and the defeat of three of the four kingdoms, until only Wessex is left. And Alfred is the new king of Wessex. He will become the only English monarch ever to be called \\"the Great,\\" but Cornwell's portrait is of a prim, sickly, God-bothered king who believes all it will take to defeat his pagan enemies is enough prayer. He will eventually learn differently, of course, but the more realistic of his supporters will suffer in the meantime. Uhtred can't stand his pious obsequies and his bowing to the venality of the priests and bishops. In fact, even though one can't assume one knows the social position of an author by reading the opinions of his characters (a favorite fundamentalist failing, in fact, regarding books they don't approve of), I think it's pretty clear that Cornwell is extremely skeptical of the supposed good the Christian church has done in English history. Quite aside from that issue, however, the author's well honed descriptive powers are at their peak in describing the nature of the Scandinavian culture when it comes to diffuse leadership, polytheism, attitudes toward battle and death, and the larger world views of the antagonists. As always, the accuracy of his take on the physical culture of the world he depicts is very high -- no winged helmets here -- and The character and emotional development of the young, arrogant Uhtred is explored in many dimensions and I found him fascinating and entirely believable.

I read this novel in 4 days, whereas the last book I read took me over a month. It's fantastic.I love this period, where so-called kings are really just successful warlords and politicians, and the land is ruled by chaos as much as everything else. The action is thrilling, the characters interesting, and the descriptions ultra-vivid.My only demur is that Uhtred is portrayed as a rather heartless man, but perhaps part of the theme of the novel is that in order to survive as a warrior in the ninth century, one had to be pretty heartless. He is certainly a compelling anti-hero, and I'm eager to read about how he finally becomes a loyal subject to King Alfred."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"The Last Kingdom is a great read. Using the first person device employed by Cornwell in the Warlord Chronicles (The Winter King etc) and brilliantly by Pressfield in Gates of Fire, we see the story of England's invasion by the Danes and the resistance of Alfred of Wessex, later \\"the Great\\", from the perspective of a witness and slightly removed participant in the events. As a result we see Alfred, and the Danes, with a more objective eye, because it is Uhtred, son of Uhtred, son of another Uhtred who, as protagonist, attracts our pathos and admiration.The story is a ripper, because it is set in the backdrop of real events and, as we know, truth (or whatever truth there is in history) is stranger than fiction. Uhtred is a strong, independent character who has learned to be a warrior since he was kidnapped by the Danes, although he by birthright the earl of a small patch of Northumbria, which is the first to fall to the Danes. From this early component of the story, Cornwell develops a device whereby we can see the perspective of both sides of the story - the battle lust yet tender family relationships of the Danes, and the religious wimpiness yet backs-to-the-wall courage of Alfred and his Wessex-men.To a degree, it has a bit of same-ness about it when compared to the Arthurian tales of the Warlord books (Winter King etc). It is impossible to avoid comparing Uhtred with Derfel, who also has a foot in both camps (being Saxon born) and discoveres early his propensity for being a feared and fearless warrior. However, the question to ask is - does it bother you? For mine, the answer is a resounding NO!!! The Warlord books were just so excruciatingly good I was annoyed at their ending, and in a way the Last kingdom promises more of what I have previously loved, as a 300 years later kind of sequel.I'll agree that it's not the most original book in the world, but only by comparison with Cornwell and that's okay with me because the man is a marvel. I give it four stars because of the slight lack of originality, and I suppose because it doesn't quite measure up to the Warlord books. If you haven't read Cornwell before, or have only read the Sharpe books, then this one will get you excavating his back-catalogue and sieving it for more nuggets like this book."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I don't usually go in for historical fiction and I was pleasantly surprised at this one: informative but never boring, something of a page-turner.

True there is something vaguely familiar about this - it does seem to be alot like the Warlord series but who cares. That was a great trilogy and this one promises to be equally enthralling. Well done, Mr. Cornwell. I'll look forward to the next book in the series!"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This isn't exactly a proper book review, because I did not finish the book. I have read at least a dozen Bernard Cornwell novels, including most of the Sharpe series and every contemporary novel he has written to date.Cornwell is a masterful storyteller. He has a particular gift for describing action sequences. He creates memorable, definite characters. In The Last Kingdom these traits are evident in abundance. In fact, as I began the book I felt that Cornwell was at the top of his story-telling form.However, one thing has always bothered me about Cornwell's historical novels. He seems to have a compulsion to impose a 21st century religious skepticism and moral relativism upon his main characters. I have always found this practice to be a blight on his otherwise fine writing, because it is almost always at odds with the historical context in which he writes. Even so, I usually overlook it because the man really knows how to write.But imagine a novel narrated by a born-again Christian protagonist. Suppose the protagonist continually soliloquizes about the great virtues of Christianity, and how wonderful it is to be Christian. Now imagine that halfway through the story, this Christian protagonist goes to live among the pagans. Through his character, the author continues to sermonize, this time about evils and tediousness of paganism. Subplots arise, serving as little morality lessons to show what idiots pagans are. Even though I am an Evangelical Christian myself, I would put down any such novel. It makes for stupid writing and irritating reading.Yet that is exactly what Cornwell has done in The Last Kingdom - only in reverse. His protagonist is a pagan, who is constantly \\"preaching\\" at the reader about how great it is to be an immoral pagan, and how boring and hypocritical and evil Christianity is. He introduces lots of little subplots, all with this basic message: \\"Christians. What a bunch of stupid, hypocritical jerks.\\"For myself, I'm not interested in preaching disguised as character soliloquy, whether the character agrees with me or not. I'm not interested in morality-play subplots. Cornwell has never taken it this far, and I was deeply disappointed. I finally put the book down, more than halfway through.I understand that the protagonist is a pagan. I can even understand his character expressing a negative view of Christianity. I have no trouble with that. But Cornwell turns it into a constant barrage of mini-sermons, as preachy as any third-rate Evangelical novel, and just as small-minded, albeit for the opposite viewpoint.In addition, Cornwell paints a false picture of history, in that unbridled immorality in the 9th century was not only less common than he makes it out to be, even among the Danes, but was also fraught with huge negative consequences. There was no defense against syphilis or gonorrhea or unwanted pregnancy other than abstinence and monogamy. Thus these two practices were far more common, even among pagans, than they are today.I know Mr. Cornwell can do better this. He has a huge talent. I hope this is not a sign that the chip on his shoulder about religious issues is going to become a fatal flaw."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"The last kingdom is set just two centuries shy of AD 1000, and follows a fictional (I think) English born, Dane raised warrior during tumultous times on the British continent.Like much historical fiction the novel suffers from a lack of fictional skill as it must stick somewhat to history, but also can't be taken as 'true'The first act of the novel is the strongest, where the protaginist is raised by Danes, and we are introduced to interesting and uniquely described characters.As the story wears on it weakens somewhat, the protaganist hardly seems to barely react to massive changes in their situation (switching between English and Danish positions) and we start to loose tract of who characters are and what their importance is.The most annoying part is however, that all the tensions initially built are not to be resolved in this novel, and we'll have to read later books to see the confrontation of the protaganist's nemesis and discover why he hates Alfred.Overall the book is a worthwhile read, but I wouldn't say brilliant, maybe just buyable. especially if you like medieval battle scenes."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Great story Mr. Cornwell.It captures your attention and immagination from the first page and I cannot wait for the next installment,The Pale Horseman (Which I've already ordered)."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"England in the Dark Ages is a tough subject to make entertaining, but once again Cornwell has shown his strength at matching historical research and obscure parts of history with excellent storytelling and pacing.

Uhtred may not be perfect, but in Cornwell's books, he is much more likable than the characters who try to be perfect. The battle scenes held my interest, despite a personal distaste for violence. Bloody fights are just part of that world and are depicted as what it takes to stay alive. It's amazing how many warriors died in the battles of that time, and how many died from disease.

A man looking back over his life and explaining the history of the invasion of England by the Dane's.Entirely accurate from what I have learned in my studies of the Vikings and the middle ages, the book is like a history book come alive.There is no boring or tedious description of place or person, rather the information provided is of historic value or is necessary to move the plot forward.A wonderful beginning to a trilogy that I look forward to finishing.

I felt the impact run up my arm as her tip punctured his belly muscles, and I was already twisting her, ripping her up and free, sawing through leather, skin, muscle, and guts, and his blood was warm on my cold hand, and he screamed, ale breath in my face, and I punched him down with the shield's heavy boss, stamped on his groin, killed him with Wasp-Sting's tip in his throat.Beware the man who loves battle. Ravn had told me that only one man in three or perhaps one man in four is a real warrior and the rest are reluctant fighters, but I was to learn that only one man in twenty is a lover of battle.

They do what historical fiction should do: bring the history of the age to life.Cornwell bends recorded historical recorded fact, which is something by which I am never fully convinced, to suit his good story.Uhthred is the leading character. We witness his development over ten years from the age of ten. He becomes heir to a minor lordship in the north east of England, on the mainland coast opposite Lindisfarne, when his brother is captured and beheaded by the marauding Vikings.Uhtred is captured and adopted by the very Viking leader who killed his brother. He comes to enjoy the Danish ways and finds them much more exciting than the Saxon and Christian ways. This leads to difficult personal choices as he gorws up. His loyalties are severely tested all the way through, and he is never completely sure of where he should be. This becomes even more difficult after he is summoned by King Alfred the Great.I cannot tell you much more with out spoiling it for you.Some of the characters, including Uhtred, develop very strongly, whilst others remain shallow and weak. I fear for the development of King Alfred's character in particular. As one of the main characters in the entire series, he should have more depth and colour by the end of the first book. He has his own weaknesses and flaws, but these should be part of a rich character development. I actually came to believe that Cornwell disliked the King that he researched, and his prejudice comes shining through. I may be wrong, but my hope is that the weaker characters will build in the second book, which I intend to read very soon."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I received a new Kindle as a Valentine's present and I knew this would be my first Kindle book. I was not disappointed. This may be Cornwell's best novel(I've only read 2, but I can't imagine anything topping this!). It is NEVER boring, the prose is effortless, and the insights on 9th century life and warfare are very interesting. I especially like the way Cornwell is telling the tale of Alfred the Great in an oblique manner. Alfred as the central protagonist would not make for a great novel, but seeing him through the young warrior-hero's eyes provides the perfect perspective. It also helps answer the question of how civilization survived the Viking threat. Both the English & Danes are treated with balance & respect, and as the reader you share the hero's dilemma about which side to choose. And when the choice is made, Cornwell does it so perfectly and convincingly that there is no doubting it. Destiny is all!"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"There is are reasons why Bernard Cornwell has been one of the most appreciated historical fiction novelists and this book is most definitely one of them.

I've been doing it in chunks, mainly because it's historical fiction and involves a lot of research and I've essentially been getting stuck at some point and needing to research more before I can get started writing again. Now I'm at a point where I need to read a few books to complete the current research. The book was called The Ruin, though I recently changed the title to Wyrd, which is Anglo-Saxon for destiny. While the book is set in the fifth century in England and has characters that may turn out to be Arthurian (I'm not sure yet), the intention of the novel is to encompass the feel and texture of the Early Middle Ages, at a time when society was essentially beginning anew for this forgotten island.When I started reading The Last Kingdom by one of my favorite authors I got the chilling feeling that Cornwell had done what I was trying to do with my book. And after finishing it, there's a lot in it that I can see coming out in my novel, and yet Wyrd will go in different directions and achieve different goals. Nevertheless, The Last Kingdom was a great book for anyone wanting to get a feel of the ninth century and what it was like for the Anglo-Saxons living there and having to deal with the invading Vikings who were trying to settle and do essentially what the Anglo-Saxons had done a couple of centuries before to the Britons. While the main character, Uhtred, is but a boy at the beginning and the narrator, our hero is Alfred the Great (the only British king ever to be called \\"the Great\\") and while I'm not sure how long the series is going to be, the reader will see Alfred grow up and become the great king that earned him the title. I'm quite familiar with Alfred's history and life and how he emulated Charlemagne in a lot of ways, and it's really enjoyable to see this fictionalized account from a great author, which has been well researched, and to see these historical characteristics in the fictionalized characters.I will freely admit that Bernard Cornwell isn't exactly the most in depth and complex of historical fiction writers, and his characters aren't always the fully developed real people they should be, but he still does the job well and gets his point across in giving the reader a look into this life, just as he did with his Grail series set in the Later Middle Ages, and his Arthurian series. It's also the kind of book that anyone can pick up and get fully sucked into without getting confused or lost along the way with heavy history and jargon. Cornwell is also sure to point out as much of the native languages as he can, with plenty of translations, to clarify it all.Next I have The Pale Horseman to read in the series, with Lords of the North to come in January.Originally written on September 15th, 2006 Alex C.

Story takes you to the early Dark Ages. As you read you can imagine the swash and blood."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I have read a standalone Cornwell book in the past and really enjoyed it but this was my first of his books within a series. The Last Kingdom is the first book in his currently ongoing Saxon Stories series. As the story is told from the first person perspective, we get right into the thick of things with Uhtred as he bounces back and forth between being a Dane and being a Saxon.I enjoyed this start to the series because I haven't really read anything about this period in history. There is a plethora of battles that we are privy to and with Uhtred changing sides so often we really get to see how both the Saxons and Danes looked at this endeavor. Usually I try to avoid books which are primarily focused on wars and battles, but I have come to love Cornwell's interpretations and depictions. Cornwell also does a great job at helping the reader to understand a culture that they have probably not had any experience with before.I did have some minor issues with the novel though - thus giving it my 4 stars. The main character, Uhtred, is the epitome of a flip-flopper. One minute he is a Saxon, then a Dane, and then a Saxon, etc and no one seems to call him on this. It made it hard for me to connect with him because I wasn't sure who he was going to be from one minute to the next. I also wish that the women in his life were more developed. We hear mention of his wife, but we don't really meet her. We hear about his implied care and concern for her, but don't actually feel it. He also has a friend from childhood who we see a little bit and get the allusion that there might have been something between them, but that is where it stops. I would have just liked to have a little bit more details about them.I am eager to read book two in the series because the ending was so very abrupt. I actually thought that my iPod had died but then realized that the story had actually ended. It didn't feel like a cliff hanger or make you feel like it had ended - it just stopped.As always when I read a book set in a place or time that I am very unfamiliar with, I am very glad for audio versions because they pronounce the words for me and I learn something from it. Believe me, I would sit in my car and repeat some of the words over and over just to get the sound of it - I would love to be a fly on the wall sometimes! The narrator's voice was very fitting to the novel and he would evoke emotions when necessary - such as yelling in a battle scene. The way he would read would suck you into the action - picking up speed when at the heart of an event and slowing down at necessary points too."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This first book in Cornwell's Saxon series is a page turning saga bringing to life England of the 9th century, through the adventures of Uhtred, a valiant Saxon boy Uhthred, the son of Earldoman Uhtred of Bebbanberg, Northumbria. Uhtred's father is killed in a battle with the invading Danes at Eoferwic (York) and Uhthred is captured by Danish warlord Ragnar accepts Uhtred into his household and he is brought up to be a valiant Danish warrior, who is a better fighter than Ragnar's own sons. At twelve he rescues Ragnar's daughter Thyra from a sexual assault by Sven, son of Kjartan and makes a great impression on Ragnar as his adopted father, completely identifying as a Dane.Uhtred takes part in the Danish conquest of Mercia, East Anglia and the invasion of Wessex. Later he is to join King Alfred, represented as both neurotically pious and cunning He also determines to avenge the murder of Ragnar and his family.The story is full of action and details of battle which will delight those who are enthusiastic about military history, it has exciting twists and turns. It is an pleasurable and easy read. On the downside the female characters only come into the story and their characters are not fully developed. We do not get o explore the characters of these women such as Brida, the small part of which she played could have made for an interesting character. I enjoy reading spunky and fully fleshed out female characters in historical novels, as is brilliantly done by writers like David Gemmel, Margaret George, Sharon Kay Penman and in some of her better novels, Philipa Gregory. In this book, as some of Cornwell's others the author falls short in this regard. Furthermore he contrasts the lusty, robust and warlike Danes with the Saxons who he presents as rather dour. In reality they were most likely not that different in character from the Danes, who were their cousins.Cornwell delves into this novel into the struggle at the time in England between Paganism and Christianity, and presents a fascinating account of the death of the Saxon King known as Edmund the Martyr killed by Danes after refusing to denounce his Christian faith and asked to test his belied that God would protect him.Overall an enthralling read and well researched."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"In this, the first of three novels centred on Uhtred, Bernard Cornwell breathes life into 9th century Wessex and the struggle between the (West) Saxons and the Danes. Cornwell's writing style is suited to the action of combat, conflict and intrigue and the images he invokes in my imagination feel very real.Uhtred moves between the Christian world of Alfred the Great and the pagan world of the Danes. By belonging to neither world, and to both, Uhtred is perfectly placed to take the reader into the conflict for the last of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The story is narrated by Uhtred in his old age and paints a quite different picture of King Alfred (the Great).This is a struggle between different civilizations, cultures and values. Neither side has a monopoly on righteousness, or on evil. Be warned: if bloodthirsty battle makes you squeamish, this book may not be for you. For myself, I've found a new hero in Uhtred.Read it, enjoy it - and then read the next in the series!Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I came to Cornwell's \\"Saxon Chronicles\\" series through his latest novel, Agincourt, which was a thrilling recreation in fiction of a pivotal moment in medieval history. If The Last Kingdom is any indication, the Saxon Chronicles are even better than Agincourt.The Last Kingdom begins with the narrator, Uhtred, as a young boy. He is the son of an ealdorman in Northumbria, and as a child is captured by the invading Danes and raised in the Viking culture. There he learns the Viking way of life and comes to love his captor, Ragnar, who comes to love him like a second son. There he also meets Brida, an English girl captured during another raid and on track to become a sorceress. When he accompanies his new Danish family to war against the titular last English kingdom, Wessex, Uhtred meets King Alfred the Great, who is trying to ward off the Danes long enough to preserve his kingdom. He also meets Beocca, an enthusiastic priest who used to serve Uhtred's family in Northumbria, but now forms part of Alfred's entourage. When Beocca arranges for Uhtred to be \\"saved\\"--that is, kidnapped--from the Danes, Uhtred and Brida escape and return to their life with Ragnar.I could tell more of the story, but to do so would be to give too much away. Suffice it to say that Uhtred, who believes that fate rules all, finds himself again and again in contact with Alfred, and in the end leads an English army against the Danes.The plot leaves lots of threads hanging, but as this is clearly intended to be the first of a series (so far of four, though Cornwell has a fifth due out this fall) that's not a problem--ending on a cliffhanger is a sure way to get me to return to the series.But Cornwell does have one huge problem--Christians. He hates them, and it shows. I found out later that Cornwell was raised in a puritanical sect known as the \\"Peculiar People,\\" and his rejection of their extreme beliefs has poisoned his opinion of Christians of all stripes. He's entitled to his opinion, but it gets progressively more annoying as he paints each and every Christian that Uhtred encounters as a sniveling, hypocritical dipstick. No insult is spared them--Alfred is a user, Beocca is ugly, Alfred's queen doesn't like dogs, and Kind Edmund, who was tortured and executed by the Danes, is even subjected to jokes about the size of his manhood. It's childish and irritating, and hopefully he'll tone it down in the next book.That's the only problem with Cornwell's book, but since it pervades nearly the entire story it's annoying enough to drop my rating a star. Most of his research is good and his grasp of the period--other than the obvious religion thing--is great. I was thrilled at the recreation of Viking culture, with its set-piece duels, longships, and hall-burnings. Cornwell has done his homework and the reader profits by it.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Having played title roles in both Hamlet and Henry V, British actor Jamie Glover is the perfect choice to read Bernard Cornwell's latest historical adventure. Glover is expressive without being overly dramatic as he takes listeners back to the 9th and 10th centuries and a young warrior, Uhtred, who discovers his allegiances are divided in the midst of a bloody war.Appreciated for his historical authenticity and rousing battle scenes, Cornwell paints an almost vanquished King Alfred pitted against the dreaded Vikings as he strives to protect a last outpost. Uhtred, of noble blood, is captured after seeing his father slain in battle. He's but a boy of ten in A.D. 866 and is influenced by the Earl Ragnar who raises the boy with affection and trains him in Viking warfare.Uhtred feels beholden to and loves the man who has brought him up but also knows that he is English and owes an allegiance to the King. It will take years, the love of a woman, and the loss of many lives for Uhtred to choose which path he must follow.What a saga; what a terrifically entertaining listen!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This is the first book I've read by the author, but I really liked this book.

The Commanders of this armed force, which chroniclers call \\"The Great Heathen Army\\" are Ivar the Boneless, Ubbe and Halfdan, the sons of legendary Vikingsheroe Ragnar Ragnarr Lobr&oacute;k. As before, this time their activities should not confine on \\"V&iacute;kingr\\" (old nordic.: robbing, plunder, taking booty) only. Rather this time ist is the start of an invasion to colonize. After conquering Eastanglia, Northumbria with it's capital Eoferwic (Jorvik/York) and Mercia, the Danish occupying forces are finally attacking Wessex, the last remaining anglo-saxon kingdom.........from this historical background Bernard Cornwell develops his story about the second germanic invasion of the Britannia, that was called \\"Lloeggyr\\" (the lost Land) by the celtic-roman people, who had been driven out of it to Wales and Cornwall. The novel focusses the fate of the (fictional) Northumbrian nobleman Uthred Uthredson, who sometimes unintentional, sometimes deliberately has to change front and loyalty between his anglo-saxon relatives and his scandinavian friends. On this occasion his interests come into conflict with the intensions of King lfreds of Wessex, who will (as the only sovereign of the islandkingdom) get later the epithet \\"the Great\\"...After his \\"Warlord Chronicles\\" about the Anglo-Saxon Invasion of Britain in the \\"Dark Age\\" (at the End of the 5th Century), with the trilogy \\"The Winterking\\", \\"Enemy of God\\" and \\"Excalibur\\") Bernard Cornwell with \\"The Last Kingdom\\" succeed again in a first part of a new novel series. Again a central topic is the conflict between the (meanwhile) christian \\"inhabitants\\" und pagan \\"invaders\\", who are oppositing in shieldbarriers. But some descendants of the former anglosaxon conquerers countinue worshipping the old gods. Because of the numerous battle- and other rough scenes the novel could not be recommend readers with tender natures. The same applies for the peculiar humor of the northmen, particular in relation to Christianity and it's priests, who comes \\"still more black\\" in the english way, but meets the historical background.In his \\"Historical Note\\" Bernard Cornwell makes a clear separation between historical facts and literary fiction. With the \\"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\\" und \\"Asser's Life of King Alfred\\" he reveals the important sources for his novel. Already at the beginning of the book the readers can find interesting and helpful materials, as a map of Britain at the end of the 9th century an a synops with the anglo-saxon names of towns, villages etc., as well as their danish an today designations.The thrilling and informative novel scores 5 Amazonstars and forces the reader to purchase it's sequel \\"The Pale Horseman\\" and \\"The Lords of the North\\" immediately...."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Britain in the 9th Century is a tough place. Raiders from the north and east take the short hop across the Northern Sea in their dragon boats to rape and pillage coastal villages. It's a time when a man of 40 is considered elderly, and a woman not married with two or three births by 16 is considered an unmarriageable old maid. And by the second half of that century, the Danes, finding Britain's fertile valleys more suited to raising families than the rocky crags of their homeland, decide to stay. Starting in the northeastern kingdom of Northumbria, the raiders become invaders and finally occupiers, relegating the local nobility to figureheads, and reawakening the ancient pagan culture practiced in Britain before the Romans ruled the land. Uhtred, the fictional 10-year-old son of a Northumbrian earl, sees his family slain at the hands of the invading Danes, and is captured and taken into slavery by the warlord Ragnar. After the kingdoms of Mercia and East Anglia fall to the Dane swords and battle-axes, only Alfred's kingdom of Wessex stands between Britain and total domination by the Danes.It is young Uhtred who narrates this lively and authoritative historical novel spanning the decade in which Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, the southern-most kingdom, resists the Danes and lays the foundations for what would become England. Uhtred is a warrior at heart, and is spared death on the battlefield that changes the course of his life as well as that of England. Demonstrating his resourcefulness as a slave, he is eventually virtually adopted by Ragnar, who treats the young Englishman as a second son. Uhtred learns the Norse ways, and finds Ragnar's lust for life and battle a more than fitting substitute for his own late but dour and unloving father. While still consumed with the dream of returning to Bebbanburg to reclaim is homeland, Uhtred finds logic and fairness in God Oden and the pagan ways, confusing his allegiance between country and the occupying Danes who have embraced him.Cornwell's history, as always, is well researched and easily read. Far, far from the dry and simply factual narrative that often is synonymous with fiction based on historical events, Cornwell's words and characters fly off the pages, spinning a gripping story that is truly a page-turner. The battle scenes, authentic and gloriously gory, capture the true horror of medieval combat and the shield wall, while the political maneuverings of both sides unfold like the best of the pop thrillers. Setting this author ahead of the pack is his dry wit, gently mocking the still-fledging Christian Church and the ribald priests and nuns who prayed and counseled, but were not above the occasional rape and pillaging of their own. Nor is Cornwell afraid to put his own spin on the historical record: the pious and saintly Alfred is rendered with more than his fair share of human foibles - an often sickly leader who spends a great portion of this young adulthood rutting servant girls.In summary, a spell binding novel, a slice of history painstakingly told with a cast - both historical and fictional - that you'll care about and that will keep you reading well past any prior plans. \\"The Last Kingdom\\" is the first in a series of novels of England's Saxon period, leaving more looking forward to \\"The Pale Horseman\\". Well done, Mr. Cornwell!"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I won't repeat many of the other reviews by framing out the plot and characters for you. It will be much more enjoyable for you to do so on your own by actually reading. What I will say is that it is an excellent read, start to finish.As I began reading this book, I was reminded of Cornwell's magic when he wrote The Warlord Chronicles. And it was a great change from the boredom I felt reading Stonehenge. In The Last Kingdom, the story revolves around England vs the Danes and a warrior named Uthred, whose fictional life tells us the story of the people, the places, and the battles of England in the late 800's. The are lots of historical facts to be gained by reading this book as well as Cornwell's great ability to make battle scenes come alive.While I appreciate and admire all the research that Cornwell puts into his books, I do find the names of locations hard to grasp. He uses town and city names that were used in the time period in which the story takes place. There is a key in the front of the book, but I find it interrupts my reading to constantly flip back and forth to find out to what city he is referring. There is also a map but it is not all inclusive - just the major cities are labeled. It would be better if there were a pull out map with all the locations included on it that one could refer to while reading. Then again, perhaps I'm just being lazy and need to do more research into England and Wales of the late 800's.And I must say that I enjoy the barbs Cornwell gives to the church by pointing out the contradictions in their actions and the ways in which history was rewritten to serve their purposes.Overall - an excellent book! Great for readers who enjoy stories of medieval times, historical England, Arthur (though it's not about Arthur), battles, etc."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Bernard Cornwell is back to his brilliant best after what I thought a slight stutter with Stonehenge. This book is excellent and it is difficult to give a brief synopsis of it without giving too much of the plot away, but here goes.The book begins in the late 9th century AD. The Vikings are seen in the coastal water of Northumbria. The news comes through to the Ealdorman of the major stronghold in Northumbria that the Vikings have captured Eoferwic (York) and he marches with his army and his ten year old son to join forces with the other English forces to retake the city.The battle is a resounding success for the Vikings and the young boy is captured and taken into the family of Ragnar one of the senior Vikings. Ragnar likes the boy Uhtred and treats him as his own son.The struggle between the English and the Danes and how the boy grows up not knowing where is true loyalties lie is the background to the book. His eventual marriage moves him closer to the English cause, and when he is drawn into a battle against one of the greatest Viking chieftains he realises at last his true allegiance.This really is a blood and guts novel and a really good read."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Great depiction of Danish/Viking life and their invasion of England, juxtaposed against that of the English defenders fighting desperately to hold on. The hero has a foot in each fascinating, vividly drawn world. This book is very similar to but IMO surpasses his Arthur trilogy in terms of characterization and plotting. The climactic battle will blow you away. Impossible to stop reading.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I have to admit I do enjoy a good Cornwell adventure. I read for pleasure, and Cornwell delivers every time. Just when I think \\"he can't surprise me anymore\\" -- because I've read all his books -- well, he does anyway. Okay, most of his novels are rip-roaring grand adventures, but they're more than that. They're imaginative. They tear chunks out of fascinating (mostly British) history and I feel like I'm there. It's an illusion of course. All historical fiction is fantasy at some level, no matter how true to the facts -- as we know them (after all, as the cliche goes, history is written by the victors) -- but writers (myself included) have to remain comfortable to the modern-day reader. So, dialogue is necessarily 20th century in most historicals. Anachronisms are the norm, not the exception. But, we love it that way. We have to relate to the story, first and foremost.And Cornwell does that. At least, and I'm guessing here, he relates to the male readers. Strong male leads, heroic and sometimes bloody-minded, who grow by the end of their books in ways adventure heroes rarely do. But here, in this book, the first of the Saxon Chronicles (my favorite, to date from Cornwell, with the possible exception of the Arthurian trilogy) -- here the women are stronger, deeper, richer and maybe as true to the dark ages as we can be while not alienating modern readers. There's rape (nuns and such), there's blood, betrayal, slavery, oath-breaking, Northmen (not Vikings Cornwell's quick to point out, that means \\"pillagers and raiders\\" not Northmen) -- I'm truly surprised movies aren't made of each and every one of Cornwell's epics. They're so movie-perfect.But Cornwell, high adventurist or not, does bring us deep into character here. Perhaps it's the first person perspective. As with the Arthur trilogy, it brings the reader deep into the \\"mind\\" of a hero from the dark ages. I think Cornwell is the master of the first person adventure novel. It's so rarely done. Most thriller writers (self included) want the freedom to jump over to a new point of view. But here, Cornwell maintains suspense, even in the first person, and allows us to know Uhtred, his hero, a Saxon who is raised by Northmen. All the way through, Uhtred struggles with his loyalties. He fights for Saxon's against the Northmen -- but it's the Northmen he loves. It adds a rich dimension to this imaginative adventure that otherwise is missing in many historical epics.It's the story of Uhtred, but ultimately the history of Alfred the Great, a compelling character in history who Cornwell does NOT glamorize. If anything, it's the bloody Northmen who are glamorized, and the pagans at the expense of rising Christianity. It's such a compelling point of view, jumping into a pagan character's point of view and making Christianity seem superstitious. The irony is magnificent. And real. Because I'm so very sure this is the sort of thing that went through the heads of people of the day.You'll tear through this book in a day. I'm so glad I picked mine up at a time when books 2 and 3 were already on the shelves. I would have had a difficult time waiting for them to come out a year later. Read them all. They're entertaining, in some ways thought-provoking (bear in mind, they're mostly adventure historical fiction), and as true to the dark ages as you can be without turning away the reader."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I'm a fan of historical fiction, so I was excited to read this book since it had so many great reviews. However, I must agree with those who have already cited some of the major flaws of this book. I felt it lacked character development; the main character felt thin, and the supporting characters (e.g. Brida) felt like afterthoughts. The events in the story felt very repetitive in the way they were described and I didn't feel like the book painted a very vivid picture of life in the 800s. I couldn't help but contrast the writing style to the author I consider to the master of period fiction, Larry McMurtry... McMurtry's ability to paint a vivid picture draws you in to the story in such a way that you feel lost in the world he's describing. I guess I was hoping this story would provide the same depth, but somehow it just lacked any tension or spark. I enjoyed some of the humorous moments and the bits of historical insight the book did offer, but it wasn't enough to make me want to read the sequels."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"What do we know about history? Sure, history classes have armed us with the basics of how the world has evolved. We all know that war, politics and religion (and more recently - knowledge) are the basic food groups that have massaged the passage of time to form our society today. Throughout college and beyond, I have read scores of well researched tomes that both described and analyzed the evolution of peoples in geographies around the world. Mostly dry, an academic approach to history leaves me educated, but also does so safely perched in the proverbial ivory tower, high above the level of detail that drove the molding of history.Bernard Cornwell gives readers the opportunity to take a swan dive from the cold detachment of history books and into the detailed lives of those who made history.Beginning with his historical novel The Last Kingdom, and throughout another four books (with a fifth coming this winter to the US), Cornwell transports the reader back into the dark ages. The year is 876AD, and modern England is split into several loosely organized kingdoms. The Romans are but a memory, the only evidence of their one time occupation of the British Isles apparent in the amazingly engineered stone structures they left behind, still standing. Uthred, the hero of our story, opens this first novel as a 10 year old boy whose father is a lord of Northumbria and proudly occupies what is today Bamburgh Castle (which offers itself up as a wedding venue these days) in northern England. Danish ships are sighted coming from the north, and with that, a period of bloody struggle begins as the Danish spend the next several decades trying to conquer and occupy the British isle.Captured by the Danes, and raised by the warrior Rangar, Uthred learned their language and worshipped their gods until he no longer knew whether he was Danish or English. After eight years as a Dane, a night of treachery forces Uthred to flee to Wessex, the last unconquered English Kingdom, where he allies to its King Alfred. Though Alfred the Great would go on to unite all of the Saxon kingdoms to form a united England, that comes later in Cornwall's telling of this period.As the grand canopy of history is unfurled throughout this and Cornwell's other \`Saxon Tales' books, the reader learns of how ships were made, how battles were fought, how armies were raised, how Christianity clashed with Paganism, how swords were made, how the dead were burned (Danes) or buried (English), how game was hunted, how women of the time lived, how slaves were treated, how the landed gentry were organized....let's just say that I'm glad for the detail of the period even if just to appreciate life today.This is my second time reading through this series. Some of the details I remember like a hazy dream, while others seem new and just as exciting to me as though reading it for the first time. I highly recommend this book and the series, and I look forward to the release of the newest book in the series this winter."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"The Last Kingdom is the first in a three-volume series called The Saxon Chronicles. The narrator is an old warrior, Uhtred, who begins his life story in the year 866, \\"when I was ten years old and first saw the Danes.\\" The Danish invasion of England unfolds through Uhtred's eyes, first as a pre-teen, then as an adolescent, and into teen-age manhood.The device that Cornwall uses to perfection is the capture of Uhtred by the dynamic Danish Earl, Ragnar the Fearless, who found Uhtred's small sword and gritty determination to fight amusing and so slung him over his saddle and carried him off.Uhtred is, above all, a teenage boy of his time - an unsentimental know-it-all, not the least bit interested in learning to read and write, as required of a noble son of Northumbria. He finds Thor more appealing than the Christian God, and the take-no-prisoners approach to battle more effective than the compromising ways of the weak kings of England. And so, he becomes a Dane.Over the course of a decade, the progress of the invaders is slowed by King Alfred of the southern kingdom of Defnascir, and the dicey relationship between the pious Alfred and the pagan Uhtred is imaginatively rendered. The book ends with the battle of Cynuit, which Uhtred survives, and in the ensuing power struggles among the victorious English nobility, he learns that petty squabbles and jealousies (and sometimes women) mean more to a career on the rise or in a downslide than the larger issue of winning the battle.Recommended for: Lovers of historical fiction. Mature boys who want to read about the now politically incorrect love of battle and glory. And for mature girls who want to understand such boys."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I cannot wait ot pick up the other books in this series. Well written, fast paced and you learn some history in the process. Not for the faint of heart - well described violence."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"The first installment in The Saxon Chronicles is a guaranteed page-turner. Places and people were painted vividly under the author's pen. Dialogues and scenes were often humorous and faintly sarcastic, reflecting the eccentricities of the more prominent characters; like Ragnar the Fearless, whose boisterous laughter in the face of enemy and adversity makes him an adorable figure, Father Beocca, whose single-minded, but often fumbling, attempts in teaching Uhtred to read and be a Christian reveals him being more of a pest than a threat, Brida, whose irascible wit and courage makes her a fitting female Dane warrior (if such a thing was only allowed).And then there's Uhtred, whose foray into the world of manhood and the warrior from a lad of ten could be described as nothing less than baptism by fire. His deep love of his land in Bebbanburg struggled mightily with the love and respect he eventually felt for the Danes who plucked him from his home and later regarded him as one of their own. From them, he learned of warfare, of a thirst for sword and battles, as well as love for laughter and merrymaking, unencumbered by what he saw as the illogical posturings of a Christian religion or faith. The invasion of England by the Danes through his eyes are told in simple terms, sometimes disdainful and mocking, but always conscious of his own limits as a young, brash whelp whose actions are hewn by the Fates.This author is a superb storyteller. I particularly appreciated the fact that he refrained from a protracted description of battle positions - be it on land or sea. There's nothing more boring (for me) than pages and pages detailing how armies are placed in a geographical point. Cornwell made his descriptions succinct and understandable. And the battle scenes themselves (though only really a handful for this first book) were rich that one can hear and feel the clang of steel against steel, of the splintering of wood and rending of the flesh.But, again, of course, the winning point for me in this novel is the interaction among the characters. Be it between a powerful lord and a scrawny brat, a long-suffering king and an audacious earl, or a haggard priest and an erstwhile student. Though a smidgen of humor is almost always there, there is also ferocity, cunning, and wit.Great start to a series. Can't wait to read the following novel!"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Cornwell tells the story of Alfred the Great's resisting the Vikings and forging England into a single nation. It's seen through the eyes of Uthred, a young boy taken captive and then raised by the Danes. Uthred, of noble birth, dreams of retaking his family's domains from a usurper and vaguely of freeing England from Viking oppression, but meanwhile loves the freebooting Viking ways of his protector, the warlord Ragnar.Alfred wants to rescue the young boy, but the latter would rather stay with the Vikings and become a young warrior. Uthred's divided loyalties make a fine lens through which to view England's tormented 870s, when kingdom after kingdom fall to the Danes - Alfred's Wessex is the last one standing - and when both sides are divided by internal rivalries. And there are those on both sides who want Uthred dead.Cornwell does a great job with Uthred's medieval voice, conveying the Vikings' pagan martial spirit in contrast to Alfred's deeply religious ways. Cornwell's anticlericalism once again finds voice here. Uthred, taking to the Vikings' paganism, can never thereafter view Christianity as anything but a boring and pious killjoy force on a warrior's life. But Christianity meanwhile is what binds the English together to resist the Vikings, more so as priests and nuns become the targets of Viking wrath, plunder, rapine and slaughter. Uthred's ambivalence about religion as well as his own national loyalties help create a fine tension that keeps this book from becoming two-dimensional.Uthred's ability to walk in both cultures helps him stay alive as he finds himself first in one camp and then another. No one is certain when or if Wessex will finally fall, leaving Britain a Viking state, its own residents vanquished, their culture exterminated."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Bernard Cornwell, known mainly for the Sharpe series about the Napoleonic period, shows in this book that he's equally at home with the time of King Alfred the Great. The author overcomes many difficult problems in dealing with this period for an English-speaking, modern audience. For most of us moderns the issues of Christian English vs. pagan Vikings does not get us very excited, or even leads us to show more interest in the latter. Worse, the notion that the Danes were the \\"bad guys\\" because they were the aggressors likewise does not excite us because their foes, the Anglo-Saxons, were also recent invaders.Cornwell's hero, therefore, lives among the Danes, and admires them, for a substantial time and changes sides because of circumstances beyond his control. Like Napoleonic soldier Sharpe, Lord Uhtred, hero of this book, is a soldier's soldier: he revels in being the biggest, meanest hombre' of the bunch, actually enjoying fighting and killing. Of course this goes readily with our modern notions (or is it stereotypes?) of that period (even more than with the Napoleonic age), and the author somehow manages to make this ring true even though for most writers and readers of today, that psychology is totally unlike us.The author has done enough research that the work rings true to the times in other ways; he uses place names and titles in the languages current in the period, which gives us the impression we're even learning the languages (Middle English, or Old Norse). This might be a bit harder for British readers who would recognize the locations; for Americans it's no problem since we mostly wouldn't recognize the places anyway.The book is fast paced, keeps you eagerly waiting for more, and that's a good thing because it's the first in a series! I'm going to read the others."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I went to quite a good English school but it occurs to me that I have probably learnt more about British history via the pen of Bernard Cornwell then through any other source. Obviously more well known for the Sharpe series set in the Napoleonic Wars, Cornwall has also written about Agincourt, the Hundred Years War and Arthurian times.The Last Kingdom is the first of his series set in Saxon times and deals with Alfred The Great. Alfred's story is told from the perspective of a fictional character, Uthred, taken by the Danes as a young boy who is caught between his admiration for the lifestyle of the Danes and his English heritage.This book deals with Uthred's early years and gently introduces us to the Saxon landscape and the emergence of Alfred at a time when all of England nearly fell to the Danes. As with all of Cornwell's books, this is easy and absorbing reading. His use of Uthred as a participant in the various Danish campaigns is a slightly convenient vehicle to allow the reader to be dragged through every event and location of those times, travelling between Northumberland, York, Reading, London, Winchester, Cirencester, Bath and various other locations with very little sense of distance or difficulty. But that is a very minor quibble as it gives us perspective on a range of events, battles and key meetings. It also allows us to see the growth of Alfred from a young regional ruler to someone who would eventually become the only British monarch to be commonly known as \\"Great\\".Cornwell always writes well and does his usual fine job here with a fast moving, educational and interesting story. The style (told in the first person) felt very different to the Sharpe books but demonstrated Cornwell's knowledge, research while continuing to demonstrate his significant writing ability.Recommended and, as usual, I now know a little more about my country's history."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"One major reason The Saxon Chronicles are so enjoyable is the main character, Uhtred. Put simply, Uhtred rules. He might possibly be the coolest narrator to every grace the pages of a book. Cornwell is an expert on religions of the time, and the Saxon Chronicles has a heavy dose of religious history and the growing domination of Christianity. Cornwell doesn't hide the fact that he's a fan of paganism, and I really like that aspect of his writing.Descriptions of battles just don't get any better. These aren't Braveheart-style free-for-alls, but true to history 9th century battles. Men fought in shield walls, slipped over blood and guts, moved the enemy's shield a fraction so you could get a sword in to cut at his ankles. Not romantic by any means, but realistic and absolutely thrilling. Cornwell's blow-by-blow descriptions put you smack dab in the middle of the action.Some of you may think a historical fiction book would read like a textbook. You couldn't be more wrong. I'm not sure I've ever read as fast-paced a book as these Saxon Chronicles. You can't read four pages without action. If you're looking for some very entertaining medieval historical fiction, look no farther than the Saxon Chronicles.I would give all these books 4.5 stars out of 5 and I'm really having a hard time deciding whether to give them 4 or 5. I just can't put much fantasy on the same level as George R. R. Martin, but this gets close."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"The Last Kingdom, a historical novel, is the first in a series of sagas about Alfred the Great of England, 886-867 A.D.

Ragnar and his wife Sigrid teach Uhtred their language, customs, and the skills necessary to be a warrior. Uhtred begins to respect and accept Danish customs and becomes an excellent soldier.The Last Kingdom is not so much about Alfred the Great as it is about the Danes who invade England. Cornwell pictures Danish culture in great detail, especially their methods of war. I was especially intrigued about the tactics involved in the \\"shield wall\\" where warriors link their shields and fight as a unit. Shield wall skills and strength often make the difference between victory and defeat in battle.If you like historical fiction, if you enjoy viewing brutal battles, and if you appreciate learning about the roots of the English culture, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Like all of his writings this is great.

Overall a good story line."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Cornwell takes the old stones of history and fills in the gap with a mortar of boyish fantasy. Ever wonder what the steps in making a medieval sword were? Ever wonder how they got the charcoal? Ever wonder how the Danes constructed their ships? Well, that last one is the only one not answered or described in (too much?) detail. Nice for history addicts (ie me) but the general audience might tend to yawn through those parts of the story.This first book is okay but Uhtred resembles Dervel in too many ways. And the story seems to drag. The Warlord series consisted of 6 shield walls, 2 in each book. It feels like this is book 4.That said the action picks up at the end of the book but again, Uhtred's coming to Alfred who has been given a bogus story from Odda resembles Dervel's return to Arthur who has been given Lancelot's bogus story about St. Michel or whatever it was called in Warlords. Anyway, the beginning of the second book makes up for this short coming where we get to see a young noble start to build up his forces starting with nothing but debt. It's fun. In fact, it is every boy's fantasy of being a knight, lord, pirate, arrogant bastard nicknamed 'the Wicked'. And it is a little more realistic that this is how a man would develop having been taught to murder as a child and it is a pleasant deviation from the nauseatingly perfect Dervel.That said, Alfred wasn't named 'Great' for nothing and Cornwell seems to question whether he deserved the title. There is a possibility that Alfred had Crohne's disease, however, honestly, how would a man accomplish so much with such a debilitating disease (I've known people who have suffered from Crohne's) in a time when it couldn't be treated at all (I'm pretty sure they didn't know to remove the scarred parts of his digestive tract let alone be able to prescribe anti-inflammatories). That said Alfred was a fan of the Christian church so of course Cornwell will make him into being a sniveling pansie while most of those priests around him are money grubbing careerists. I'm guessing the Hammer and the Captain were also sniveling men in Cornwell's eyes, because no where in the five books I've read has there been a character resembling the popular characterization of those men. *shrugs*"},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"This is a saga of betrayal, rage, treachery, bloody massacres, and fidelity (divided loyalties). In 855 A.D. Northumbria was connected to Scotland to the North and Wales and East Anglia to the South. This was the \\"center stage\\" for King Alfred during the ninth and tenth centuries, as he sought to defend 'his last kingdom.' The Vikings hd captures and occupied three of England's four kingdoms.The title character, Unthred, son a nobleman, had been captured by a Danish chieftain, Earl Ragnar, who 'adopted' him as a son and expected him to learn the Vikings' ferocious ways of war. He was trained to participate in violent acts during raids against England. We follow Uhthred as he dreams to \\"take back the land from those who stole it from me.\\" He'd been only ten years old when abducted and brought up as an alien to his firthplace. It was a beautiful Autumn day when he and his seventeen-year-old brother were out surveying their father's land boundaries. At the sea, they saw seals on the rocks, and a host of seabirds enjoying the scene, so that they could not let the hawks off their leashes on their wrists. Then they saw the Danes and the massacre of their people.Although he was well cared for by the Vikings (the first to invade America, also), he was loyal to King Alfred the Great's causes. It was not until after his marriage, from which he experienced unexpected joy, was he ready to rise to his greatest challenge. I was called such a thing by someone dear to me and I let it slide. Only now, do I have an inkling of his consternation enough to write it for me to contemplate. When you overcome such a 'challenge' and keep on with routine affairs, you are truly a complete personality in every respect.King Alfred was one of the most remarkable figues in English history. His success in defending the remaining Anglo-Saxon outposts, to endure such atrocities in order to secure the survival of his culture. If he fails, \\"the entire course of history will change.\\"Bernard Cornwall has written many novels including EXCALIBUR, BATTLE FLAG, COPPERHEAD, REDCOAT, and STONEHENGE. He also had a prolific series featuring his alter ego, Richard Sharpe -- twenty (count them!) such novels from 1799 to 1821: WATERLOO CAMPAIGN (1815) and two about Portugal, 1809 and 1812."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"Going against the stream here, I have to say I didn't like this book. It was well written; I take nothing from the writer's ability in my not being pleased with it. I didn't expect the degree of murder that was almost revelled in though (see for instance, Uthred's live-in girl friend who likes to lick blood from swords), nor the street language that the writer indulges in. But these are incidentals and come with the age we live in.My biggest disappointment has to be the way that one of the greatest heroes of English history - though always in the shadows of the Arthur of Arthurian myth makers - is treated. Alfred, in this book, is a religious phoney, a killjoy. Everyone hates him. He has no personality and no friends. One almost has to spit before mentioning his name. Contrast that with Asser's life.Perhaps in subsequent books Cornwell will turn all things round, but in this book Alfred is the baddie while the Vikings - fully in touch with their emotional side - are just out for a bit of harmless rape and pillage."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"I liked the author's style when I read the sample chapter, and the reviews were promising. So I purchased the book anticipating a story worthy of the potentially rich backdrop of Vikings and early English ancestors.

It was as dry as a history book from high school.I enjoy Saxon, Nordic, Celtic, etc. European history. I should have loved this novel. Instead, I was put off by the 1st person write. It left me wondering how the other characters felt, what their point of view was. I feel it limited the book.Also, I found his terms rather confusing. This was not \\"England\\" and there were no English yet, yet he uses not only that term, but Britons. I believe he must of meant the Angles, but he's not really clear. His names for the cities were not what would have chosen either. There were discrepencies.He describes all obese people as grotesque in his novels, and horribly ugly. I think he has a prejudice there.There is only a casual mention of the main characters wife, although he goes into explicit detail in the battle scenes and his love for fighting.His depiction of \\"Alfred The Great\\" was anything but great! The king was sickly & superstitious, making it difficult to believe he could have won any battle under his flag.This book was obviously a \\"Part One\\". I think I will pass on \\"Part Two\\", The Pale Horseman. Bernard let me down on this one."},{"Title":"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)","review":"FIRST, I really like Mr. cornwell's earlier books, but I found this book to be boring, the main character is suppose be 11 years old, but is expressing the wisdom of someone much older.

I believe Mr. Cornwell needs to return to the type books that made him famous such as the Sharpe novels, the Nathaniel Starbuck Chronicles, etc. It appears that Mr. Cornwell has become rich, well known and is now trying to find his \\"roots\\" in writing fictional British history books"},{"Title":"Eastland: Legacy of the Titanic","review":"Outstanding documentary of the events leading up to the disaster of the Great Lakes steamer in 1915. Author provides solid documentation tying the loss the Titanic three years previous and the consequences it had on regulations of lifeboats and rafts. Great explanation in layman's terms on shipboard stability. Good illustrations throughout the book. Organization of story chronologically superb. I got this book off the library shelf becuase my grandmother was a survivor of the Eastland disaster. Hilton has, after 80 years, told the story correctly erasing myths concerning the actual reasons leading up to the disaster. Great detail concerning the lives of the people involved."},{"Title":"Eastland: Legacy of the Titanic","review":"Hilton has researched this subject extensively. If you are looking for flowery personal stories of the disaster, you won't find them here. What you will find is a massive source of information about the ship's construction, a detached account of the disaster, and an account of the legal proceedings and investigations following the disaster. The amount of researched facts in this book is unmatched and this amount of information about the EASTLAND cannot be found in any other source."},{"Title":"Eastland: Legacy of the Titanic","review":"The two stars are for the amount of information in this book. The fact that it only gets two is because most of the book is blatantly spun to try and support Mr. Hilton's economic beliefs and dislike of the LaFollette Act.There are a number of places in the book where it appears that Mr. Hilton deliberately twists or conceals the facts. For example, he states in the prologue that the president of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company announced that his company would be going out business immediately after the application of the requirements of the LaFollette Act in 1915, which he uses as evidence that the Act destroyed American shipping across the Pacific. What he DOESN'T mention is that the company did NOT go out of business and was bought out by another American company, and was still in operation as late as 1949.Everything in the book is spun to support his theory that the Eastland capsized because of its added lifeboats, and that the lifeboats were added because of the LaFollette Act. In order to do this he ignores other theories and information that he must have known because they occur in sources he quotes for other information. For instance, he insists that the Eastland wasn't overloaded with people based on the testimony of the dock agents (who have an obvious motive for lying.) He fails to address a statement in a book by Dwight Boyer which he quotes elsewhere that the dock agents actually let on quite a few more people than the Eastland's capacity because of how passengers were counted based on ticketing.I feel there are several other omissions and distortions of this type in the book. Let the reader beware, and don't rely on this book for information about the Eastland sinking unless you've read a number of other books and articles on the subject."},{"Title":"Eastland: Legacy of the Titanic","review":"The EASTLAND incident offers a great deal to students of history as well as mariners. George Hilton's account will satisfy most readers, with its fascinating story, remarkable research and good technical descriptions. He has wrung more from the historical record than any previous writer on this subject, while managing to give the reader some human perspective on the tragedy. Helpful drawings and photographs add to the value of this book."},{"Title":"Eastland: Legacy of the Titanic","review":"George Hilton was the first to publish a book about the little-known tragedy of the capsizing of the Eastland at its dock on the Chicago River. As an historian who has extensively researched this disaster from primary sources for years before it ever became more commonly known, I find his treatise to be well researched in part, but of dubious quality because of Hilton's blatant political bias against the regulation of business. His conclusions about the capsizing having occurred because of the addition of lifeboats and other safety features mandated by progressive Republican Senator Robert La Follette's \\"Seaman's Act\\" are factually incorrect according to contemporary accounts including the official report concerning the disaster. While his account of the event itself is basically accurate, his conclusions are politically driven, and wrong in the light of his bias.At the time of the disaster, the Seaman's Act was facing repeal by Congress because of the pressure of the steamship industry against the expenses incurred by them to bring their ships into compliance. The act had been passed because of a series of shipping disasters, most of them freight ships, on the Great Lakes. Other disasters, notably the burning of the General Slocum, contributed to public support for reform of a very corrupt federal inspection system. The act was primarily passed because of the demands of the seamen who worked on these ships. The truth was it was a general practice in the shipping industry, both freight and passenger, to overload ships and equip them with only the absolute minimum in safety equipment, thereby maximizing profit and minimizing cost. It was equally true those who had oversight powers rarely, if ever, exercised them because of corruption with the shipping industry. Once the Eastland tragedy struck, all talk of repeal of the act ended and the steamship industry slowly became adequately regulated. As a result, there have been far fewer ship disasters since that time.It has been a long-standing mantra of Republicans, Libertarians and business that regulations only harm American business and destroy profitability, thereby causing the collapse of those businesses and the loss of jobs. Hilton recognized this disaster, which took the lives of at least 822 mostly poor, working class people, as an opportunity to show \\"concrete\\" evidence proving this hypothesis. The problem is, the facts do not in any way support Hilton's conclusions. Long before the safety upgrades to the Eastland, the seamen who worked on her knew her to be an exceptionally unstable ship. The Eastland had numerous documented problems and complaints for years prior to her capsizing. The primary problems appeared to be a poorly designed keel and a horrible ballast system that could not adequately balance the ship. The primary causes of the disaster were the intense overcrowding of the ship and the preexisting design problems. After the offical report on the \\"sinking\\", it was established beyond doubt there were significantly more aboard than the allowable 1400 for which the ship was rated. Contemporary experts concluded at least 2400 people had boarded with or without tickets. Hilton actually does a good job at disproving his own hypothesis if you bother to research further.In its time, steamship travel was often used for more than seeing the sights. They were often a venue for the poor for secret sexual liasons and other activities frowned upon in this post-Victorian era. In just a few years the automobile changed all this and motels and motor excursions became the preferred way to exercise these freedoms. Short-trip steamship excursions lost popularity not because of regulation, but because of the competion of the automotive industry and nothing else. No significant damage was done to the freight business at all. Lately the shipping industry has seen a huge passenger resurgence in the current cruise ships, a newer poorly-regulated industry. Many of these ships are also quite top-heavy and I sometimes wonder if we will come full circle to see another ship \\"turn turtle\\" in our time.Read the book, but borrow it, don't buy it. Then read the other two on the subject, which are far more accurate and honest. And if you really want to know about the disaster, go to Chicago and see the museum exhibit dedicated to this tragedy of greed."},{"Title":"Eastland: Legacy of the Titanic","review":"I'm going to cheat. I'm going to write one review and use it on three separate books. No doubt I'll offend the review gods at Amazon, but this subject merits it. Even though I live only 4 hours away from Chicago, I had never heard of the Eastland until I was searching for something entirely different and found a Western Electric website mentioning it. This is an utterly incredible story. I promptly ordered \\"The Sinking of the Eastland.\\" The book goes into a fair amount of detail about the tragedy itself, yet its primary purpose is to describe the people involved and how they were affected. The author never claims to be a technical authority and instead makes reference several times to another book \\"Eastland: Legacy of the Titanic.\\" I promptly ordered that one as well and while searching for additional information I learned of a third book \\"The Eastland Disaster (Images of America).\\" That one was ordered as well. Since you have read this far, you are obviously interested in my opinions and in my opinion, all three are required reading to grasp what happened. \\"The Eastland Disaster\\" is primarily a collection of relevant photographs which augment the other two books. Many more photographs of the events surrounding the ship, the sinking and the aftermath. And finally, \\"Eastland: Legacy of the Titanic\\" is much more technically oriented including the naval architecture concepts concerning the ship itself. I found this book to be especially good as it attempts to provide as much of a balanced view as possible, including several contemporary naval experts analyzing the court testimony of a leading architect of the day. Absolutely fascinating stuff. Not only that, but it is interesting to learn our concern for American jobs being lost to China is not a new thing. Ninety years ago people were worried about the same thing as a result of new regulations coming from the Titanic sinking. All three books solidly contribute to gaining knowledge about the disaster."},{"Title":"Eastland: Legacy of the Titanic","review":"Good coverage of the Eastland disaster.

Litigation is not only extremely stressful and likely to make a bad situation worse, but it is also extremely time consuming, expensive and emotional damaging, particularly when children are involved. This book is great at presenting alternative approaches, such as mediation and collaborative law that reduces divorce anxieties (both emotional and financial).With that said, divorce involves parties coming to terms on issues that are often extremely complex and do-it-yourself approaches without expert guidance and assistance is not only overwhelming, but can be costly in the long term if one or both parties are unclear about their various rights and obligations and how to properly document any agreement for submission to the courts.This book is definitely recommended for those who are considering rushing off to an attorney for assistance without understanding all their options, but it is only a first step and shouldn't really be viewed as an alternative to professional assistance. After reading this book and becoming educated about alternatives to litigation, it would be my further recommendation to seek expert guidance from an experienced mediator, preferably a divorce mediation attorney, who can provide professional guidance and assistance, prepare a customized settlement agreement, and complete all requisite filings with the court.

What it does lack (where the title is a bit misleading) is that there's really nothing in the way of doing divorce on your own without either. So, it's not really a \\"do it yourself\\" divorce book. However, if you are looking at a very expensive divorce and 70-100k of legal fees, this book could save you a lot of money if you go the mediator or collaborative route - not to mention the fact it could save a lot of emotional hurt too.If you have few assets and no children, this book is not really as good for you, since you probably won't even need a mediator. If you have many assets, children, and are worried about a protracted legal battle, this book becomes an invaluable tool to own. Mediation is a new technique, becoming more common, and it can in many ways be preferable. Check it out!"},{"Title":"Divorce Without Court: A Guide to Mediation & Collaborative Divorce","review":"\\"Collaborative and Mediating Divorcing\\" are different types of divorcing that are pretty recent, claims the book. This book is designed to help further and ease the processes of divorce on families that feel they need to divorce. Further reading is encouraged by the authors, but they offer some assistance on how to have a systematic divorce where a couple is able to sort most things out willfully before they present themselves to a court and reduce future regrets and remorse. Litigation (lawyers of each spouse negotiates for their respective client) and the Collaborative/Mediative (both spouses do their own pre-negotiation avoid lawyers deciding for them) approaches are compared a bit in the first chapter. It seems like collaborative approach is simply a systematic approach to divorcing where a reasonable settlement can be reached and reduce the stress divorce places on the couple and the children.Other chapters help out by detailing a bit on the process of using and finding a mediator or collaborative attorney. Advisers are also recommended to used in this process when needed, especially a Financial Adviser who can take into account fees and costs of making a legal move. There re also tips on what not to do on mediation or collaborations such as not patronizing the other spouse when introducing the options of collaboration or mediation.Information gathering is also an important part of the process and sample worksheets are provided to give an idea of how to go about this area.Court-sponsored mediation is given it's own treatment on the issue too along with systematic tips on what to when encountering difficulties in mediation and collaboration. There is even a chapter on collaboration and mediation for \\"unmarried\\" couples.Finally, the only complaint I have for this book is that thought there are some \\"Real world examples\\", there could be more to help dive the points throughout the book. Aside from this the book is a good book for anyone studying the divorcing process or is considering , unfortunately, to divorce.Since this book is about trying to make for a reasonable divorce process, it would be wise for people to consider the long term effects of divorce on children of divorce before they decide to divorce. For this I recommend a sociological 25 year study on what happens to children of divorce and what divorce creates for the next generation of potential spouses - it's not pretty.

Nolo guides are very thorough resources and I have used several previously.This type of book should not be used as a way to get around lawyer costs. For something this important and complex I think it is vital to hire a professional. This book provides an excellent supplementation."},{"Title":"Divorce Without Court: A Guide to Mediation & Collaborative Divorce","review":"Let's be honest - the first thing to go out the window in the middle of a divorce is usually common sense. Emotions run high, tempers flare, and things get ugly. Which is where this book comes in - a genuine and reasonable attempt to insert some common sense into an emotionally-charged process.'Divorce Without Court' is a well-organized and thorough document of two specific divorce processes: mediated and collaborative divorce. They are basically the way divorces should go, ideally, if the couple can be reasonable and civil to one another. We all know it doesn't often happen that way, but this approach is worth considering.For those methods, I found 'Divorce Without Court' very informative and well-documented. There's a lot of repetition and chances are good that, even if you're using the methods described, not all of the subject matter will apply to your situation. Most of the chapters include a summary at the beginning and advice about when you're good to skip that chapter, or when you should be reading it, so you won't waste much time in reading things you don't need, and you almost certainly won't need to read the whole book.The book also includes chapters near the end on other situations, including legalities for unmarried and/or same-sex couples, and what to do when you're considering the legal ramifications of a new relationship. There's also lots of other resources referred to in each chapter, both printed sources and online, and worksheet templates you can use to shape the process in the Appendices.Simply put, if you are using a mediator or collaborative lawyer, or considering either of these for your divorce, this is an excellent book to read as a reference and you'll likely get a lot out of it. If your divorce is going the traditional court route, or if you're doing it yourself, then this is almost certainly not the book you should be reading.I personally did not go through a mediator or collaborating lawyer approach in my divorce, but I still found many tidbits and useful information in it. In the end, the information and advice in these pages helped inject some common sense into a difficult process, and even though my divorce didn't fit the profile described here, I'm glad I read this when I did.Because even a little common sense is a good thing."},{"Title":"Divorce Without Court: A Guide to Mediation & Collaborative Divorce","review":"If you are facing a divorce this book is a lifesaver. It is filled with information, good information that will keep you sane. Perhaps even more important is the fact that it deals with getting your soon-to-be-ex to work with you whatever their emotional state in the divorce. No divorce is easy but but doesn't have to be punishing, overly costly, and brutal. This book is packed with legal direction, various approaches to collaboration which you choose based on your particular situation, how to communicate with the person you are divorcing. This book teaches you that divorce doesn't have to be a winner/loser battle. It lays out the price of divorce war where the only winner is the lawyer. Most importantly it leaves the family with enough cohesiveness to remain a parenting couple even if you aren't a married couple. There are lots of resources for each state.My lawyer pointed out what he felt was a hole in the approach. He said that if you hire two lawyers who agree to work together in a collaborative way and then to have them sign an agreement to step down from your case if a solution isn't reached and it has to go to court is unwise. He said you would then be hiring new lawyers who hadn't worked with you and hadn't spent time with your background.

It also provides information on where you can look to get started no matter where you live.There are helpful worksheets for laypersons to use in preparing to meet with mediators, collaborative attorneys, and expeditors. I love the idea of including these, even though many professionals have their own forms, because they will help separating couples begin to think about the issues and focus on the things they can fix and do in order to move forward. Although the forms themselves are a little light on explanation (what, for example, is included in tax-free income besides social security?), they are at least a place from which to start the mutual exchange of information necessary to achieve a full and fair settlement of the incidents of couplehood.The book also includes a discussion of same-sex uncoupling, a decidedly piecemeal area of the law in which collaboration is especially necessary, given the rapidly changing legal landscape.I recommend this book to people who are undergoing a separation and I also recommend it to attorneys who are interested in the collaborative or holistic divorce process.

Some headings present questions - that are answered in the text, others give do's and do nots, while other headings give clear directions for the reader to follow.One example of how the text clarifies the issues of divorce is the \\"Tell It Like It Is: A Vocabulary of Emotions\\" chart. This helps the reader clarify language for the intended audience. For example, the emotions listed include nostalgic, inconsolable, miserable, hysterical, and bereft.This level of detail about every aspect of divorce follows throughout the book.

NOLO's book is a wonderful reference for people to use even if they do wind up in the legal system, if only to become familiar with the terminology and legalese. It also assists people in realizing how many paths and choices there are in divorce. These paths can be emotional, social, financial, or none/all of the above.It's a good book to have if you and your partner are considering divorce and don't want it to be acriomonious - and it offers online updates, directories, and dictionaries."},{"Title":"Divorce Without Court: A Guide to Mediation & Collaborative Divorce","review":"If you want to learn about the process of mediation or collaborative divorce (where lawyers work with their respective clients, but agree to avoid the court process), this book is a good starting point. If you are trying to figure out what's a fair settlement or resolution, who should get what under the law, don't bother with this book.The book discusses options for proceeding to divorce without the expense of court through the process of mediation or collaboration. One key feature of these processes is that the divorcing couple actually decides the outcome, with help from the mediator or attorneys. The laws that would dictate the result in a courtroom do not necessarily apply. Because of this, the book doesn't provide clear guidance on how to split assets --Chapters include:The Role of Mediation and Collaborative Law in the Divorce ProcessWhat Happens in MediationWhat Happens in Collaborative DivorceDeciding to Mediate or CollaborateProposing Mediation or CollaborationFinding a Mediator or Collaborative AttorneyUsing Advisers and Doing Legal ResearchInformation GatheringPreparing for the First SEssionEvaluating ProgressCommunicating & NegotiatingCourt-Sponsored MediationDifficultiesWriting the AgreementWomen & Men, Unmarried CouplesMediation and Collaboration After DivorceThere are plenty of worksheets to use for recording issues, outlining concerns, etc. Particularly unique are the model letters from one spouse to the other suggesting mediation or collaboration.Overall, useful to review if you're contemplating a collaborative divorce. Less useful if you're looking for specific guidance on splitting the assets & liabilities."},{"Title":"Divorce Without Court: A Guide to Mediation & Collaborative Divorce","review":"In case you've never been involved in an adversarial divorce, it is the most expensive activity you can be involved in. Lawyers charge $400 or more per hour in 0.25 hour increments. So called \\"forensic accountants\\" (most of whom could not properly calculate the correct tip for a dinner check) will charge you more than the lawyers will. The divorce industry is a huge one. If you want other people to end up with your money (instead of you and your soon to be ex-spouse), go the route of an adversarial divorce.If you can maintain some sanity during this very stressful period, a nonadversarial, mediated divorce is the way to go. How much you save will depend on how much you have. But it will definitely be substantial.This book is a good starting point for a nonadversarial divorce. This book is a very well organized overview of the collaberation and mediation process. There's not a lot of advice on financial issues, especially complicated cases. You will need to seek out other sources for dealing with this.The sad truth of the matter is that well over half of all marriages end in divorce. There are way too many millionaire divorce lawyers and accountants out there. Save yourself a lot of money. Be reasonable to each other and do it yourself. At least you'll be left with some cash to start the next chapter of your life.This book is another excellent product of the NOLO series. I've reviewed several of these books on various topics, and have read several others. They always deliver what they promise and I've never been disappointed."},{"Title":"Divorce Without Court: A Guide to Mediation & Collaborative Divorce","review":"The book gives you a basic run down on why mediation is cheaper and more productive than divorce. As a therapist, I've seen how children suffer the most as couples often utilize them as \\"pawns\\" to get what they want in a divorce. Mediation is a very easy and cheap tool so that both parties can walk away equally happy (or unhappy). The book also showed sample letters how you can suggest mediation to your spouse."},{"Title":"Divorce Without Court: A Guide to Mediation & Collaborative Divorce","review":"If they had published this thirty years ago, I could have save a lot of money and time! If you are contemplating divorce, do not proceed further until you have read this book!"},{"Title":"Divorce Without Court: A Guide to Mediation & Collaborative Divorce","review":"Going through a divorce is an emotionally and financially taxing time. To make matters worse, the complexities of the unknown process and the adversarial conflict that often accompanies divorces increase the stresses tenfold. One has to ask, \\"can you have a civilized divorce and minimize the financial and emotional conflict?\\" Attorney - Mediator Katherine E. Stoner answers this question with an unflinching, \\"Yes!\\" Her book, \\"Divorce Without Court: A Guide to Mediation & Collaborative Divorce, 2nd Edition\\" provides a guide to the steps necessary to negotiate a divorce settlement using divorce mediation or the new innovative approach called collaborative divorce. Even if you chose to go through a divorce the traditional way with both parties \\"lawyering up,\\" I believe the advice in this book could prove useful in finding resolution, especially if your state requires mediation during the process.Like all Nolo books, this guide helps make the law accessible to the layperson. It is an easy to read and user friendly guide to the mediation portion of divorce and the newer collaborative divorce. The book does a good job of explaining what mediation is and what the collaborative divorce process is, and then how to find a mediator or collaborative attorney.Then there are chapters to help you find advisers when needed in the process, gathering information to assist with the process, preparing for your first session, evaluating your progress, effective communication, and negotiation. There is also a chapter on court-sponsored mediation, and another that looks at some of the difficulties that arise during mediation and collaboration of divorce. There is a short chapter on writing up the agreement, and then a short chapter on women and men in mediation and collaborative divorce. The final chapters are on unmarried couples using the processes and using mediation and collaboration after divorce. The book concludes with an appendix that contains a few forms that will be helpful during the process.If you are going to go through a divorce without representation, this is not the ONLY guide you will need. It will be important to obtain references that include a lot of the nuts and bolts of divorce. This book is very good to help with the process, and to find a mediator or collaborative attorney to assist you. Sometimes courts will also have guides available for people that explain the nuts and bolts. If you have a complex divorce, finding a good mediator or collaborative attorney will be very beneficial, and this guide will assist. The book does not show you exactly how to divide things, just how to work together with a mediator to get it done.I do think this book will be extremely valuable as an addition to the nuts and bolts type book for anyone who wants to avoid a messy litigated divorce and attempt a mediation or collaborative approach. As an attorney-mediator myself, I believe in mediation 100%. It can be so much more effective than litigating. I don't have the experience with collaborative divorce, but have learned more about the collaborative areas of law during continuing legal education conferences and believe it to be a process that can greatly assist people in certain areas. If you are facing divorce, regardless if you have an attorney or will do it yourself, Stoner's \\"Divorce Without Court: A Guide to Mediation & Collaborative Divorce\\" can save you time, money, and reduce the stress associated with an already extremely difficult situation.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of a regular column on negotiation for The Montana Lawyer."},{"Title":"Divorce Without Court: A Guide to Mediation & Collaborative Divorce","review":"Divorce Without Courtis a good primer on the topics of collaborative divorce and mediation. Having known several mediators and having an interest in law, I was keen to read this book and see what I could learn about the process. Obviously, divorce is a very difficult situation to deal with, and one that does not always lend itself to collaboration, much less good faith.THE GOODThere were several things that the book covered that exceeded my expectations. The book certainly covers a lot of ground. Namely, the book includes considerations for dealing with difficult challenges like substance abuse and domestic violence. There is even mention, however brief, of the considerations for same-sex unions.Perhaps this book's greatest strength is in it's focus on the internalized decision making process. Contextual information about how to address conflicts is peppered throughout, but chapter 15 provides the most concentrated example. It covers what to do when encountering difficulties during the mediation process. While the potential pitfalls are covered in a generalized way, each scenario is broken down with potential explanations and what to do in response. This seems well designed to help people deal with a wide variety of situations than can come up.The book also includes a series of valuable work-sheets. Topics that are covered include where to look for lawyers, questions to ask potential mediators and attorneys, and how to calculate your assets, debts and monthly income and expenses. There are even worksheets to document the results of mediation sessions and to evaluation your own ability to cope with the process.AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCHHowever, this text is either given at the 20,000 foot view or at the microscopic view with too little in between. For the most part, I would describe the work-sheets to be the areas covered with microscopic analysis while the text is written at the 20,000 foot view. Both of those components are useful, but neither yields a sufficient understanding of the issues to make this text a comprehensive resource.The authors mention state to state variances, and suggest that readers research them. But a reference text like this really needs more information on the basic differences from state to state. At the very least, readers should be able to easily determine if they are living in a state where one of the topics is not an option for them.Financial issues can be very contentious and are not covered in sufficient detail. The worksheets covering assets, debts, expenses and income are included and discussed in approximately 10 pages in chapter 9. How are child support and spousal support amounts determined? What's more, while the text addresses conflicts in a generic way, it does little to tell readers how they can begin to address conflicts from a financial perspective. The use of experts for asset valuation is just one example. One will need to consult other texts for these topics even if only to understand what the attorneys are proposing.CONCLUSIONThis book is a good start. The included worksheets are worthwhile. But most people will need more than this. Those who want to be prepared to deal with variations in state law and financial issues will need to add other references to their reading list. I still recommend this book with those caveats in mind.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Warrior's Song: Medieval Song Quartet #4","review":"What kind of rapist gets to be a hero in another book? When I first started reading this book I wasn't very impressed to begin with. I have read some of Catherine Coulter's other books and found them very enjoyable. Imagine my surprise and disgust when after I read that horrible rape scene I turn to the back of the book and-viola!- the VILIAN has his own romance staring HIM as the hero??? Just knowing this made me unable to finish the book. I realize that the plot is set hundreds of years ago and although this might have happened then I certainly don't want it happening in my reading. What ever happened to the hero having integrity? Honor? Courage? Did the author hope to make this look like a \\"nice\\" rape? It ruined the entire book for me and I doubt I will be reading the other books in this series."},{"Title":"Warrior's Song: Medieval Song Quartet #4","review":"I like Catherine Coulter novels. True, they're not always historically accurate, but romance readers are used to some lack of fact in most works of this genre. However, the plot line itself is so inane that most readers will have difficulty in suspending belief. This book is a rewrite of a much earlier work. I think Ms. Coulter should have abandoned ship on this project.Our heroine is raised as a squire--a nice touch if you like the feminist, athletic bit. However, she has difficulty in grasping the most basic concepts, so protraying her as remotely intelligent or faintly likable is an exercise in futility. I liked the character of Mary, since she is the only person in the novel that displays a lick of common sense.The lead female is so obsessively male about everything she does that this plot line is stale long before the reader has reached the halfway point in the novel. You simply want to scream &quot;Enough already.&quot; And so the reader moves from what was at least a coherent plot to the Crusades in the blink of an eye. The husband, who started the novel as a likable character, becomes increasingly authoritarian as the plot (which should thicken and doesn't), proceeds.A rapist, introduced earlier in the novel, is portrayed sypathetically, an error in judgement on the author's part, as well as a display of a complete lack of taste and sense. I found it offensive. The rape scene itself, which is not necessary, is too wooden and phony.I do hope Ms. Coulter gives up on the idea of revitalizing these weak earlier novels and writes fresh material with stronger plot lines, adding more depth and some intelligence to both the characters and the plot."},{"Title":"Warrior's Song: Medieval Song Quartet #4","review":"When I was about 10 years younger, I used to love the &quot;strong, silent hero&quot; type - and so fell into reading Catherine Coulter. At that time, the rape scene did not disturb me so much (I thought she was being realistic), although I realized later that the rapist becomes a hero in another book, and shows no contrition for what he did to the victim.What is horrendous about this book is the rewrite of the mother's character. In the original CHANDRA, Lady Dorothy (?) is helpless, weak, silly, but not deliberately malicious. In this book, she is close to absolute evil, conniving at her daughter's forced marriage to a rapist-invader and also threatening her husband with a sudden death if Chandra is not married off. And yes, this time, I did get the incestuous overtones in the relationship between Chandra and her father - almost made me feel sorry for Lady Dorothy, if *that* was going on. [Note - there is no actual incest, but the relationship is - ahem - rather strange].Chandra and Jerval did not feel particularly romantic to me on this re-read. I must have had different tastes back then. Right now, Catherine Coulter - thanks to the trend of her writing - is going on my &quot;do not buy&quot; list.Rating = 1 star (the lowest possible for a distasteful unromantic book)"},{"Title":"Warrior's Song: Medieval Song Quartet #4","review":"I had a very hard time actually reading this book through after the first chapter in which a character who becomes a hero at the end of the book and in fact stars in his own in a future book rapes one of the characters. I think that the attempt to make him seem less hated was that he was &quot;nice&quot; about it. Right there, that is a huge strike against the book. I don't care if this was the times, that is why it is fiction. Rape is not a part of romance and a rapist should not be the hero of a romance...at least not by an author who I ever plan to read again. The other problem I had was with the main characters and the changes that she goes through. She becomes the nice docile wife she is meant to become and he becomes a little more tolerant after &quot;taming&quot; her with sex. That is supposed to be romantic? My &quot;favorite&quot; line to hate was when she told him she was pregnant, shut him up and then it went on to say that it was probably the last time she ever got the best of him. Sounds like a match made in sexism 101."},{"Title":"Warrior's Song: Medieval Song Quartet #4","review":"In reading a preview for this book, I found that this was a rewrite from a previous novel and was used to 'fit' into the 'Song Series'. It didn't fit very well from my perspective. Within the first few pages of this book, a woman is raped by a (supposed) leading character in a future novel by Ms. Coulter. It is beyond my thinking that this would equate to a &quot;good romance&quot;. I found nothing of value in this book and would not recommend it to another. If I had wanted to read a gruesome true to life novel, I certainly would not have thought to find it located in the romance section. This book was not a romance or very well written. The characters were not well developed and were somewhat shallow and narrow. I am sorry that I purchased this book and will not purchase anything by this author again."},{"Title":"Warrior's Song: Medieval Song Quartet #4","review":"I liked this book initially, as I had never read a romance novel before I was somewhat dubious. I had heard good things about Catherine Coulter so I decided to give her a try. The beginning was good, the firey Chandra made me laugh and I could identify with her. I also liked the sexual tension between her and Jerval, but as the novel progressed I became dissappointed, what happened to Chandra's spunk? Why did she all of a sudden become so easily dominated by Jerval? I realize that would have been realistic for the time but it was still a little dissappointing. I also found several typos throughout the book, things that should have been taken care of during editing, but I suppose getting the book on the shelves supercedes grammatical accuracy. I didn't give up on Coulter yet, however, I read The Deception which I really enjoyed, even with the incorrect conjugation of her french verbs. The Deception was a nice, exciting read and I would reccommend that. Feeling hopeful, I read The Courtship; what a waste. I didn't like the characters nor the general plot. Don't get me wrong, I like a good sex scene just as much as the other girl, but I don't want a pathetic quickie, I'm reading an &quot;escape&quot; novel to do just that, not to be reminded of the crappy sex I've had. Oh well, I liked Coulter enough to read three of her books, but not enough to read any more, I would reccomend Theresa Meideros or Marylyle Rogers."},{"Title":"Warrior's Song: Medieval Song Quartet #4","review":"When I first read the rape scene in the beginning of the book, my biggest fear was that the rapist would turn out to be the hero, because of his attitude in approaching it: i.e. the \\"I don't want to do this but you're forcing me to\\" attitude. I have to say, though, that my relief was short-lived.The hero himself does an inexplicable about-face immediately following their wedding. He goes on to reinforce all Chandra's fears about losing her identity to a man, trying to destroy all the qualities in her that he adored before the wedding. This, I think, is the most insidious part of the whole novel. It could be an excellent story of a woman whose identity deteriorates under the pressure of her husband's expectations and demands, but in the way it's presented makes it clear that we're supposed to find it romantic and that aspect really doesn't work for me."},{"Title":"Warrior's Song: Medieval Song Quartet #4","review":"What an awful book! There was no 'romance' at all! There was barely even any sex. Jerval boasts that he gives Chandra her \\"woman's pleasure\\", but that's about it. Sure, he lusts after her, but while he appreciated her warrior side at first, he really disapproved of it after they were married, and it seemed that the only reason she had any affection for him was because he reminded her of her father! There was definitely some strange sort of attraction going on there. And what kind of name is 'Jerval' anyway? It kept making me think of hamsters. This was my first Coulter book, and it will probably be my last."},{"Title":"Warrior's Song: Medieval Song Quartet #4","review":"I just read Warrior's Song. It was not as great as her other books. Yes, it kept you wanting to know what happened next but, there were too many events happening. Catherine Coulter rewrote this book and changed the title. She said that this is better than the original story. I don't think it is. Also, there is a disturbing rape scene in the first few chapters. This gives you a bad feeling about the book already."},{"Title":"Warrior's Song: Medieval Song Quartet #4","review":"Even though I'm not overly fond of Catherine Coulter, I bought this book after reading the back. It was supposed to be about a woman who was a warrior and the man who had to learn to love her and not try to change her. After I read Earth Song and found it enjoyable, I finally picked this book up and started to read it.The book starts out with a character I recognised as a hero from another book trying to force marriage on our heroine. How does he do that? Well of course by raping her friend. I freely admit to skipping over the actual rape because I didn't want to read it. That being said, the rape didn't really color my judgment as much as it did other people.Quite frankly there were too many things wrong with this book for it to be good. It WAS an easy read. The writing style was good and for a part of the book the banter between the characters was enjoyable.Let's look at loose ends. The first half of the story has many many many undertones that our heroine Chandra was in love with her father and her father was also in love with her. The only reason why the two hadn't committed major incest was because neither one of them was willing to even privately face that they felt that way. There seemed to be no particular point to this, other than being incredibly gross, since after she's married it's never touched upon again. Let's not forget that the man her father chose for her is someone who looks exactly like him. Chandra's mother is an enemy and the truth about why she hated her was a foreshadowing to future issues, or so you would think, but after they are married nothing ever comes up about it again.Even though Jerval claims to love Chandra, the reality is probably more along the lines of the fact that he's in love with her looks. As soon as they are married he decides that she has to go be his wife and give up being a warrior including everything that is strictly for men, like hunting or jousting or practicing. Instead he wants her running the household and sewing and weeding the garden and so on and so forth. Yes, Chandra was a pain sometimes but the simple fact of the matter is, if that's who she is, then why did he try to change her?I wanted to read a story about a strong woman who was a warrior that grew up in a time where that just wasn't done. An epic style romance between her and the man who loved her, who could only have her if he accepted her the way she was. Change is everything in romance because all the characters have to change who they are to some extent to be together. In this case, Chandra changed to the point of being a completely different person, and Jerval changed only in so far as he became less accepting of Chandra as who she was instead of who he wanted her to be.I'll agree also with other reviews that the only characters that were really enjoyable were the prince and princess. Aside from that everyone had too many issues to be really likable. And Mary was the worst of the lot because she was the wonderful epitome of everything that Jerval wanted Chandra to be. It really saddened me in the end that she had a girl. I realize that if you wanted her to have a happy ending she should have had a girl, but I kept thinking that Mark supposedly loved her but he would have hated her if she'd had a boy. There was no real test for any of the characters as to whether or not they really loved each other. Everything worked out to fall exactly as they wanted.It ended on a disappointing note that made it from just unlikably okay to frustratingly annoying. Do I recommend this book? No way, but while most people won't like it, there will always be people who love it. This book is enjoyable for some but was not what I was looking for. If it had been described as a girl who was raised as a boy learning to be a woman, but it wasn't. So if you want to read it, I'd say if you don't have a very open mind to it, you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Warrior's Song: Medieval Song Quartet #4","review":"I have been a big fan of Ms Coulter for 5 years.

I love the way she writes intimate scenes explicitly. Jerval and Chandra were truely hero and heroine. There were many excitements from time to time in the story.

Warrior's song just fell flat after the first four or five chapters. Inane plot, characters, dialogue, etc. Jerval is just allright and Chandra leaves much to be desired with her obstinancy. Enough is enough. Yes, the rape scene was completely unnecessary; it had nothing really to do with the overall point of the story, so why put it in there? Just for the sake of writing about rape?

I read it all the way through hoping that at some point there would be a rainbow lining...nope.I honestly don't know what Coulter was thinking when she wrote this book. Don't make the mistake I did and assume that the reviewers who rated this book so poorly could be wrong.

Warrior's Song is the &quot;prequel&quot; to the Song trilogy, now the Song quadriligy.

Now instead of her lying to Jerval about why she won't come to his bed on their wedding night, she does go to his bed and discovers all the pleasures that await. But it is not enough to make her give herself to him in the most important way that matters. To give him her heart. Jerval is the most patient of husbands without being soft because he loves Chandra and wants to teach her to love him.

I appreciated the \\"realism\\" of the \\"rape scene\\" as far as I know that sort of thing did happen during that time period and I was appropriately horrified and that much more interested to see what came next. I enjoyed the courtship of Jerval and Chandra, finding their friendship and his lust for her to be charming and romantic.I was immediately disappointed once they were married, however, finding that the change in their relationship did not suit the characters I had come to know and they both lost all of their charm. The entire middle of the book dragged on to me and I kept waiting for something interesting or some sort of awakening or turning point which never seemed to come.Then, suddenly, it was four months later and they were a part of a crusade. I did actually find that the story finally got a little interesting here and I enjoyed the experiences of Chandra and Graelem. I still did not feel any particular chemistry between Chandra and Jerval anymore and although, in words, they were finding their love for each other, their relationship felt empty to me.Overall, the story did not flow together well at all and I found myself hurrying through it, waiting for it to be over so I could move on to a different, and hopefully actually good book."},{"Title":"Warrior's Song: Medieval Song Quartet #4","review":"Set in 1272 in England and the Middle East, this is the story of Chandra, who was raised by her father to be a warrior, to fight like a man and to enjoy the company of men. She loathes the traditional role of women that confines them to being a broodmare under a man's domination. She loves her father and her home, Croyland Castle, on the Welsh border and never wants to leave. But her father has other plans. He has found a man who respects Chandra, Jerval de Vernon, who has even saved her from a bad guy (the hero in FIRE SONG) and has decreed she will marry Jerval whether she likes it or not. Chandra thinks of Jerval as a friend, a playmate, but when she marries him, he turns into a domineering man just like all the others.This is a great, fast-paced story that takes you from the Welsh marches of England to Cumbria on the border of Scotland and then to the Mediterranean and the Holy Land on crusade with King Edward. During many adventures, Chandra and Jerval discover how to blend their different personalities and to find love in the midst of many challenges. Chandra is a heroine to die for: brave, unique, independent and willing to fight for her right to use her gifts. She takes a bad beginning with a mother who doesn't love her and uses it to build strengths. I loved this woman. Jerval instantly finds himself lusting after her but doesn't realize that when they are married she will still be the warrior woman she is when they meet. Like many husbands, he thinks to change her. But they both change.Coulter did a great job on the research of the times and gave us a feeling for both England and the 9th and last Holy Land Crusade. Her dialog is excellent, her characters rich and the plot is believable (though I admit Chandra's skills are a bit over the top). I really enjoyed this one and think you will, too.The Medieval Song Series:WARRIOR'S SONG (earlier version titled CHANDRA)FIRE SONGEARTH SONGSECRET SONG"},{"Title":"Warrior's Song: Medieval Song Quartet #4","review":"Not worth reading.The rape at the begining was a tasteless scene I could have done with out in my mind..Rape is such a deplorable problem in our society that to put into a book I want to read for enjoyment, had me putting it down with a bad picure in my head.

There were some twist and turns just like Graelam de Morton who had appeared in the first chapter as a villain and a raper eventually became their friend at the end of the story.

The author admitts to change facts about the historical events she puts in the book. The villain becomes the hero and you realize the only people you like in the story are Future King of England and his wife?Welcome to the horrible Warrior's Song.The heroine Chandra is suppose to come off as a warrior/lady but she comes off as a spoiled brat. Her constant whining and disreguarding anything anyone tries to tell her gets old fast. She more then once goes against any sound advice (common sense) getting herself into dangerous and stupid situations that your sadden that she lives. There's nothing heroic or likable about Chandra.Jerval is written as coming in to save her from the villain (who by the end of the book is supposely the hero of the story despite him raping one of her ladies in the beginning of the story) Jerval isn't written well enough for you to care about him.There's nothing herotic about rape and letting the villain become one is disgusting.Catherine Coulter admitts at the end she nixed the part of the Crusades which I hate. If your going to write about a historical event such as the Crusades in particular a well known battles, with well know people keep it factual. Don't change it or speed it up. What's the point of the story if your change the facts?That brings me to the two only charactors that held my interest were (oddly enough) Prince Edward (future King of England) and his Princess. Truly those were the only two keeping me going. In fact when Edward was facing death was I the only one wishing it was Chandra and she would die?The ending makes no sense.

It is written by one of the founders of DoubleClick, Kevin O'Connor. He takes you through the steps he believes are necessary to go from and an idea which are easy to come up with to a business which is difficult. He lays on the line how difficult it will be. The proof in the pudding is if anyone following his advice can create a successful business. There is a lot of good wisdom in this book. Some people may think it's obvious but for me, I'm an Excel-VBA software developer with 100's of ideas and my own business, it's great advice and hopefully I'll follow it and make it big time some day.The book includes many pearls of wisdom. He steps you through the details of his main ideas which are:1. How to come up with a large # of ideas2. How to Pick the right idea to pursue3. How to create a business plan4. How to get funding5. How to hire great peopleOther reviewers claimed he was self-aggrandizing but this didn't bother me at all.He includes his business plan for DoubleClick in the appendix.The only downsides to this book is that it's a little dated, due to the current economic crisis, Mar. 2009, good luck in trying to go public and he doesn't talk about other ways to grow your business without funding from a boot-strap method."},{"Title":"The Map of Innovation: Creating Something Out of Nothing","review":"I bought this book on the advice of a good friend--a friend whose recommendations have been uniformly spot-on; until now.I found the book trite, pat and predictable.

I wonder how many people who have read The Map of Innovation have subsequently achieved significant business success; my guess is: zero.In any case, to my friend's dismay, I couldn't even finish the book.

I almost threw in the towel when he claimed he invented the internet but didnt do anything about it.Also heaping praise on Ford, Edison and bill gates for creativity, when it is generally accepted that these people used others' ideas albiet with good marketing.Anyway there are some good suggestions in here if you can force yourself to read through it.

I think it is well worth the money and I refer to it all the time."},{"Title":"Recordable Cd Bible","review":"A book with this title should also highlight the best CD-Rs available like the Ultradisc CD-R from Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab. Afterall, anyone who has ever damaged a CD-R through abrasion or excessive exposure to heat or light knows that CD-Rs are an imperfect technology and it's all too facile and common to lose priceless data. For ocassions when you can't afford to endanger your data, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab is proud to introduce the Ultradisc CD-R. Our 24KT Gold ULTRADISC CD-R is designed for professional, data critical, music and graphic archival applications, and all other data storage where there is no margin for loss or error. These specially-gold-plated ULTRADISC CD-Rs ensure excellent reflectivity, are non corrosive, and have dramatically enhanced resistance to light and heat. Additional features include instantaneous pit burning (burst burning) for superior pit formation and extremely low to no error rate; and an added, patented, scratch resistant, protective surface. Due to these features, little if any error correction is required upon retrieval of information, producing precise reproduction of stored data.Where as the average CD-R has a projected lifespan of only 20 years-if stored in ideal conditions, our accelerated aging tests predict that the 24KT Gold ULTRADISC CD-R will retain its specifications for more than 300 years. Meaning that, now, information can be accurately stored and retrieved longer than ever before.Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab created the world's first 24 Karat Gold music CD in 1987: The ULTRADISC. Now MFSL has put that expertise in the development of the 24KT Gold ULTRADISC CD-R. The combination of the superior reflectivity and longevity of 99.99% pure 24 Karat Gold, in addition to a specialized, patented bonding agent, ensures that the ULTRADISC CD-R will never oxidize and fail to output information, as many commercially available CD-Rs do. The ULTRADISC CD-R is extremely stable in the real world environment. Unlike commonly used CD-Rs containing Cyanine (blue/green dye) or Metal Azo (deep blue dye), which lose their characteristics quickly from exposure to light and heat, the 24KT Gold ULTRADISC CD-R utilizes a patented photosensitive dye which ensures accurate burning and stability, plus exceptional longevity and durability. Whereas the two other types of dye are formed with linear molecular structures, which break down easily when exposed to the elements, the unique photosensitive dye utilized in the ULTRADISC CD-R has an annular structure which forms a strong and extremely stable chemical bond. On top of this, MFSL has added a patented, reinforcing coating for extra protection from scratching. Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab has chosen to offer only slower speed (1-12X) CD-Rs. Although the current trend is \\"faster is better,\\" MFSL engineers strongly disagree and urge audio professionals, archivists, audiophiles, and discriminating collectors alike to burn their data in real time, better known as 1X. Through a careful battery of tests conducted at Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, we have observed that real-time burning has always yielded superior results. Higher burning rates cause errors and do not allow for proper pit formation. Furthermore, higher speeds cause vibration in the drive when burning the disc, thereby increasing jitter. In order to attain even higher burning accuracy and overall quality, a specially formulated dye was created for these slow-burn, precision ULTRADISC CD-Rs.The ULTRADISC CD-R's specialized dye reacts more quickly to the writing laser than do other dyes. It reacts in a &quot;burst&quot; mode instead of the sluggish &quot;melt&quot; mode. Due to this instantaneous reaction, precise pit edges are formed. This is crucial for the laser pickup to accurately interpret the information, and thereby reducing or eliminating the use of interpolation/error correction circuitry. Additionally, a specially formulated, black ink is used to coat one side of the disc in order to reduce stray reflections which could alter readings. Utilizing the highest quality control standards in the industry, all the manufacturing and packaging of the ULTRADISC CD-R is done in state-of-the-art cleanroom conditions. Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab has rejected random sampling techniques, which are simply not stringent enough for critical data storage applications. Instead, MFSL utilizes an unprecedented 4-level quality control process. First, a sample out of every 3,000 discs is tested, critically examined and evaluated for over 2 hours until given the approval for MFSL specifications. Second, every single ULTRADISC CD-R is tested as it comes off the replication line. High tech, extremely sophisticated computer analysis is used to test jitter, thickness tolerances, gold uniformity and disc eccentricity. Third, an inspector (wearing medical gloves) picks up and visually examines the ULTRADISC CD-Rs for pinholes, gold consistency, oyster shelling, or any other anomalies. Fourth, another inspector repeats this very time-consuming, manual/visual examination just before the specialized, stray-reflection-reducing black coating is applied. ULTRADISC CD-Rs have to pass all levels of QC before they can be shipped. If a disc does not pass Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab's elevated specifications, it will not be accepted as an ULTRADISC CD-R. This is MFSL's guarantee to the user that every ULTRADISC CD-R is the finest engineered recordable CD media available in the world."},{"Title":"Edison and the Electric Chair","review":"This is a great book for historians, crime readers and science &amp; engineering buffs.

Bruce Bouchard For those of us in the church seeking to bring positive social change, the task can often be frustrating. Members of the congregation can be quite enthusiastic in caring about others in one to one relationships. They can spend hours volunteering to visit the sick and the lonely, feed the hungry, or even to share faith with those who despair. However, when it comes to standing back from the picture of individual hurts and looking at the larger panorama of systematic injustice such as poverty, human rights abuse, or war as a means of international conflict resolution, the faithful often do not seem to see the problem. Seldom is it a matter of not caring about the pain of others, rather it is a difficulty in comprehending human hurt on a systematic level. Those who try to motivate the faithful on to bring justice and responsible conflict resolution to a larger world often feel that their pleas fall on deaf ears and all their efforts are ineffective. One might be left asking the question: &quot;Should one even bother to try?&quot; Disruptive Religion: The Force of Faith in Social-Movement Activism, (New York and London: Routledge , 1996) an anthology edited by Christian Smith, offers an encouraging and inside look at how religious faith has influenced social change in such differing scenarios as the civil rights movement, the election of Hitler, the anti-apartheid movement, the Iranian revolution, and workers strikes in communist Poland. Unlike many works that apply the same formula to all social problems and turn the crank, the sociologists who author these essays seek insight into the special role that religion plays in each particular situation. The essays are further arranged into five topics area that help to keep the reader focused on the various ways that religion effects the outcome of a specific social change. For example, the first topic area describes how religious groups can often be the only ones in a repressive society with the organization and leadership structure to act on behalf of the oppressed. We see this dynamic demonstrated through Aldon Morris' essay &quot;The Black Church in the Civil Rights Movement: the SCLC as the Decentralized Radical Arm of the Black Church.&quot; A second essay by M. M. Salehi reveal a similar dynamic in a very different social setting in &quot;Radical Islamic Insurgency in the Iranian Revolution of 1975-1979.&quot; Other topics include religious ritual as providing a setting for the development of insurgent consciousness, the church as having the capacity to mobilizes against repression, and the symbolic world of faith providing an activist identity. The final section addresses religious ideology and disruptive tactics. An article by James Aho yields some surprises as to why certain individuals join hate groups. Finally, a professor from Mount Saint Mary's College, Ron Pagnucco, compares secular and faith-based groups. He demonstrates an amazing tenacity among faith groups to persevere against defeat and discouragement. The books is well worth the reading on many levels. For the social change agent, the essays provide many well proven strategies. It is also encouraging to see that people of faith have been successful and significant in many important social movements of the late twentieth century. For the curious mind, we receive an insiders view of some of the dynamics in social change that the media missed in these one time, front page, news stories. As an added bonus: almost all of the essays are reader friendly which is not to be always expected in a scholarly work."},{"Title":"Consolidators: Air Travel's Bargain Basement","review":"I have traveled the world for 3 1/2 years, I have 2 websites.

And he shares his platform by encouraging people to visit the wide array of independent journalists in the blogosphere. His book \\"Blog ...\\" is an excellent primer for anyone who desires to make their opinion known and available to everyone in the world with an internet connection."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"This impeccably well-written book (this dude can write!) is about blogs and how they are melting down mainstream media's influence and importance.Hugh Hewitt asserts that \\"People's attentions are up for grabs\\" and blogs are capturing much of that attention. He is a national syndicated radio host and has one of the most popular political opinion blogs with over 100,000 unique visitors some days. His knowledge of the blogoshere is apparent. He examines recent events that have brought blogs into the mainstream consciousness including Dan Rather's recent disaster involving forged documents.Hugh doesn't hide his political opinions or the fact that he is a political junkie. Although this book is a quick and fun read, those not interested in US politics may end up skimming some of the later sections including the 41-page appendix A, \\"Early Writings on Blogging.\\"Part 1 contains historical information on significant blogging events, all political in nature, a fascinating comparison of the development of the movable type printing press and blogs, and a brief history of text as it relates to blogging. Although I ignore politics as much as possible, each of his examples were familiar to me as they were \\"big deals\\" in the news. His concept of \\"blog storms\\" is interesting; when many blogs start examining the same events or story, an opinion storm brews and if it breaks, fundamentally changes the public's perceptions. Examples include John Kerry's Vietnam service in August 2004 and Dan Rather's blind faith in his forged documents in September 2004.Part 2 focuses on the meltdown of mainstream media due in part to their extreme leftwing political bias and loss of trust with most news consumers. Hugh also comments briefly on a large number of influential and widely read blogs, primarily political in nature. He makes a good case that blogs have gained the trust that mainstream media has lost. \\"Why bloggers blog?\\" is an interesting question. Hewitt believes that bloggers are vain and blog for two reasons: to persuade, and to leave a record of having been there. He claims that both pursuits are a blast in real time and I concur. In the recent past, those who wanted to persuade had to persuade someone to let them persuade, for example a magazine or newspaper editor. Today the gatekeeper is gone. Anyone can start a blog, and if they have something interesting to say and some luck, might generate an enormous audience. The public takes on the role of editor by choosing what to read or not read. Bloggers have the same authority as big name columnists for the mainstream media, whether they have 10 or 10,000 regular readers.Part 3 is the most fascinating but by its nature least detailed section. It concentrates on blogs and business uses, which are in their infancy. Hewitt suggests first developing a defensive blog strategy, as the destructive power of the blogosphere is immense. He then moves onto ways to use blogs for public relations and marketing purposes, including suggestions on finding appropriate bloggers for organizations, and advertising on blogs. Hewitt's \\"A Dozen Blogs I Would Start If I Were . . .\\" contains some fascinating thoughts on uses for blogs. The last chapter, \\"Getting Started: The Technology,\\" contains very little technical advice as Hewitt isn't a technologist, but does have a superb list of key rules of \\"blogging success and significance.\\"I fully enjoyed this book despite despising politics. Since much of blog's recent rise into the public consciousness has been due to political events, some political content is unavoidable. Hewitt makes no apology for his political views or focus, and he shouldn't. He simply uses his experiences with blogs, which are unabashedly political, as his primary view into the blogosphere. The book is worth reading just for Hewitt's many insights, for example that bloggers run the spectrum from pure aggregators of other's materials to pure analysts, \\"blogs are about trust,\\" and bloggers are part of a new culture of hyperscutiny."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"One of my current interests is \\"how to blog successfully\\", and when I came across Hugh Hewitt's book Blog: Understanding the Information Reformation That's Changing Your World, it inevitably peaked my interest, wanting to look for insights that can help me become a better blogger.However, this is the wrong book for that - or rather, this is a prequel to the howto's that I was wishing for.Hewitt's book is intended as a business justification for individuals and businesses that are still undecided on the virtue of blogging. He started the book by providing real world examples where the blogosphere generated impacts at national and world stages. That used to be the realm of influence for the Main Stream Media (MSM), but the toppling of Trent Lott and the Rathergate incident opened the door for the blogosphere as a legitimate alternative media outlet. Hewitt then further extrapolate the trend and draw parallels to Gutenberg's printing revolution to predict an oncoming media revolution, and ask reader to prepare and utilize for oncoming blog swarm. And finally, he shared some thoughts on what can people blog, and how to prepare a blog strategy for businesses.While Hewitt gave extensive treatment and account on the historical blogosphere events and formulate his thesis on the blog revolution, it provides little information on implementation. Of course, the title of the book does not suggest an in-depth analysis of successful blogging, so it would be unfair of me to say this book did not meet an objective that it should not meet, but it would be interesting to see if the author would publish a sequel on that particular topic.Now - I did not know of Hugh Hewitt before I pick up the book, and I was surprised to the amount of political overtones and the despise toward MSM in the book. He is definitely not shy about his views on some of these subjects, and it feels \\"in-you-face\\". If you are not a Hewitt fan already or you are not used to hearing people speaking in tones of \\"I know better than you\\", then you might not enjoy this book too much.Who will get benefit from this book?If you are thinking of blogging, either for personal or business reasons, but are still unsure about the possible impacts (or returns), then this book should do it for you.On the other hand, if you are already blogging, or decided to start blogging, then you can safely skip this book without losing much. But of course, you can always buy the book for an interesting recount of what happened to Lott and Rather ;)"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I suppose time will tell wether Hugh is a prophet or a farce and as he predicts, blogging does for our society what the printing press did for the reformation.I picked up his book at our local library last week and read it in a few hours and have been re-reading various chapters over the past few days. My gut tells me that he is right...Blogging, as we speak, is revolutionizing our world in a million different ways.Over the past few years I have wondered how families who are working long difficult hours trying to make marriages, businesses, and lives work were going to overcome all the propaganda. Especially mothers, who are so overworked and fatigued.At times I have felt overwhelmed by the seeming tidal wave of control that the various institutions in our society seemed to have over the individual day to day lives of men and women. Lining this reality up with the prophecies from the bible - most specifically Isaiah, I wondered how we would get from point A to point B. Meaning, how we would get from this Babylonian nightmare to Isaiahs pictoral of lambs lying down with lions and children living to the age of a tree???I believe the internet and blogging hold the key to the powerstructures crumbling. Let them all come a tumbling down...The only thing we the people have to gain is our health, our financial well being, our freedom, and our ultimate happiness and contentment.Thanks Hugh for being the Sage you are and not only calling it confidently for what it is, but also for recognizing the need for a book to share the good news with anyone smart enough to come take a look.I plan to start my own blog sometime in the next month or so, and have already reserved the name WWW.NaturalFamilyBlog.com to chat about anything and everything that I think is important.Give Blog a read, you will be glad you took the time.Jenny Hatchhttp://WWW.NaturalFamilyCo.com"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"A couple of weeks ago I was browsing through my pastor's library and remarking on the number of people who lay claim to \\"the next Reformation.\\" Over twenty years ago, Robert Schuller told us it would be a Reformation of self-esteem and more recently his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Rick Warren that it will be one of purpose. Other books tell us the next Reformation will involve breaking the church body into small groups, essentially giving the church back to the people in the same way that the first Reformation gave the theology back to the people. And now Hugh Hewitt has entered the fray with his latest book Blog, predicting that the next Reformation will be blogging. The book is subtitled \\"Understanding the information Reformation that's changing your world\\" and the front cover adds, \\"Why you must know how the blogosphere is smashing the old media monopoly and giving individuals power in the marketplace of ideas.\\" This is a book about the power and importance of blogging. If you are looking for a \\"how-to\\" guide to get you started or a book that will explain the pros and cons of commenting or tell you what a trackback ping is, you will have to look elsewhere.Blog is divided into four sections and I will briefly outline each of them. In the first, Hewitt shows the power of \\"blog swarms\\" and provides a historical parallel for this new Reformation. To illustrate the power of blogs, Hewitt traces four of the blogosphere's greatest success stories: the toppling of Trent Lott; Catching the New York Times and reporter Jayson Blair in a lie; John Kerry lying about Christmas in Cambodia; and the Rathergate scandal that toppled Dan Rather. He outlines how these stories broke and how the MSM was usually far behind the blogosphere. In fact, had it not been for bloggers, it is likely that none of these stories would ever have broken in the way they did. And there is no doubt that these are only the first of many similar stories.Following this, Hewitt risks what some Protestants would consider near-blasphemy by drawing direct comparisons between the first and (supposedly) impending Reformations. It is a twelve page \\"Coles Notes\\" summary of the Reformation and critical role played by the newly invented printing press. To summarize, without the movable type printing press, there would have been no Reformation simply because it was a popular movement that was championed by the common man who was provided information via this new medium.In the second part of the book, Hewitt sets out to prove that Mainstream Media (MSM) is facing impending doom and that the blogosphere will be the benefactor in MSM's long-overdue demise. He believes that the overbearing issue in the dissemination of information is trust, and our society is rapidly losing trust in MSM. \\"The key to keep in mind is that trust drives everything. To build and maintain trust is a tremendously difficult thing, requiring patient attention to detail and discipline over long periods of time ... In a world changing as rapidly as ours is, only those who have earned and continue to earn trust will be in a position to influence the choices of third parties. Blogs can earn that most valuable commodity. Which is why you have to get started. Your competitors already have\\" (page 155). The blogosphere offers readers a wide variety of authors to choose from and provides ample opportunity to regain the trust that is so lacking in MSM. This section (and, in fact, the whole book) is firmly slanted to the right (as one might expect if they read Hewitt's blog or listen to his radio program) and Hewitt takes every opportunity to criticize the Democratic Party and every media outlet other than FOX. I suspect this will hinder the potential impact of this book, as it alienates much of its potential audience. If you can see through this slant, you'll find that it is worth your while to keep reading.I understand that the MSM is declining in so far as people no longer watch the nightly news and buy newspapers as they once did. However, what Hewitt does not do, is trace the number of readers at sites such as cnn.com or cbsnews.com. Is it possible that MSM is merely evolving in the media it uses to present its information? I would suggest that as fewer people tune in to CNN on their television, growing numbers are visiting cnn.com. Thus it seems that Hewitt may be missing the point. Could it be that blogging is merely a symptom of the change that we are seeing as people gravitate towards Internet-based media? Blogging is clearly one of the most exciting and most important aspects of this, but I would suggest that it is merely one aspect of a wider change.I also wonder how plausible it is that MSM will die off. After all, bloggers do not usually create the news. Instead, they interpret the news that the MSM has already reported. Without the MSM, what will bloggers use for source material? What upper level organization will gather the news to disseminate it to the blogosphere so that it can be examined by the growing numbers of pundits? These are questions Hewitt does not adequately address.The third section of the book suggests ways that blogging can be beneficial to individuals and organizations. The author suggests that every CEO should begin a blog to champion his company and his employees and that every hobbyist should be blogging about his hobby. Every major organization needs to secure blog-related domain names, so, for example, General Motors needs to acquire gmblog.com and use it to market their products. And on the whole I agree. Blogging has tremendous potential in a wide variety of applications.The book concludes with two lengthy appendices that comprise almost 30 percent of the book. Appendix A is a disjointed collection of some of Hewitt's early writings on blogging and Appendix B is an assortment of emails sent to him from his readers which describe their blog-reading habits. Some of this is interesting, but most adds no significant value to the book.As I read Blog, I was continually struck by how self-serving the book seemed. It struck me as being almost like the biography of a proud, self-made billionaire, except with site traffic and recognition in place of dollars and European models. If you do not know how many visits Hugh has to his blog in an average day, a busy day or an election day, you will before you have finished the book. You will know how many blogs have been started because of his influence and just how useful a link from his blog to yours can be. I came to realize, though, that in a sense the blogosphere is built on just this sort of self-importance. Bloggers succeed by driving visitors to their sites by whatever means possible. The most important person in the blogosphere is the one with the greatest readership, just like the most important person in my hometown is the one with the most money. And lest I sound hypocritical, I will admit that I have a blog of my own and that I have no right to cast the first stone.Another reviewer commented that, \\"The book reads like it was cranked out over a few long weekends.\\" I suspect that may be the case. Reviews of this book were posted on Amazon as early as December 28 of 2004 and some high-traffic bloggers reported receiving copies as early as December 24, yet the book discusses Hewitt's site traffic during the Presidential elections of that same year, which took place on November 2 (only seven weeks earlier). Some have suggested that the frantic pace of the book owes to the frantic pace of technology in general and the blogosphere in particular. I would suggest that the frantic pace comes from a frantic writing and publishing schedule. Several of the chapters, especially near the end of the book, are so short (several are less than two pages) that it almost seems like the author just never got around to finishing them.I have long since grown tired and skeptical of people claiming to have discovered the next Reformation. I don't believe blogging represents the next Reformation any more than did self-esteem. At the same time, there are some interesting and undeniable parallels between the availability of information at the time of the rise of the Reformers and our time where we are witnessing the rise of the bloggers. Blogging is already going mainstream and, especially in a fast-paced society like our own, it is never good to be left behind.This book has much to say that is valuable, especially in regards to the importance of trust and the application of blogging to corporations and organizations. Unfortunately, I found it frantically-written and poorly-organized. I wanted to love it, but in the end just could not. Yet I still do give recommend it, especially to those in positions of leadership. Its alarmist tone may convince some of the value of blogging, but I suspect just as many others will be put-off. I agree with Hewitt that the blogosphere is giving individuals power in the marketplace of ideas and agree that this is generally a good thing. I think there is great future for the blogosphere.In the end, Blog is a 155-page book, padded with appendices to 220 pages, but one that to treat the topic properly needs to be about 300 pages (with no appendices!). It is, no doubt, a valuable contribution to our understanding of the power and importance of blogging, but it is incomplete. I know Hugh Hewitt has the knowledge to do justice to the subject matter - it just seems that perhaps he was not given the time."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"According to the statistics a new blog is launched every 8 seconds. The trick is seeing if anyone will return to read your blog and respond from it. Hugh Hewitt is one of the leaders of this communications revolution.In a highly-readable style, Hewitt explains how people's reading habits have changed to include blogs and the influence these blogs have on traditional news media. The blogosphere (or community of bloggers) has influenced everything from Senator John Kerry to Anchorman Dan Rather. After the bloggers began discussing these issues, the traditional news media picked up on the discussion and carried it forward but it started in blogs, according to Hewitt.Whether you write nonfiction or fiction, anyone can begin a blog. As he writes, \\"What is new about the blogosphere is that there are no barriers to entry to a world offering a nearly limitless audience. Key point: offering, not guaranteeing. Anyone can post, and if it is worth reading, it will be read. There is a vast audience of wisdom/ entertainment seekers. Whether your product is economic analysis, NASCAR boosterism, sexual gossip, or political smack talk, the blogosphere will allow you a chance to peddle your text wares.\\"Many fiction and nonfiction authors are beginning to blog as a means to interact with their audience on a regular basis. Numerous sites offer free blogs and some of the key rules according to Hewitt include: \\"post often, link freely, be generous in praise and attribution, don't be long winded too often, if at all. Brevity is the soul of blogging when you are getting started. Paragraphs are your friend. Profanity loses audiences...Keep the title short and easy too remember.\\"Most of these rules are applicable to a variety of writing. I know many bloggers who use this tool as a means to kickstart their writing day or maybe summarize their writing at the end of their session. Discover what works best for your style. No matter what you write, you can learn from this discipline. You can catch my blog at: [...]Through reading Blog, you can start this journey. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Hugh had a good idea here, but it was idea that was quickly surpassed by tweeting. Blogging had the potential of becoming a bigger deal in our social lives, but it was quickly surpassed by another innovation. Hewitt was at the edge of the innovation in blogging, so far on the edge that he missed the fact that it was open to being challenged by another technology. I give him kudos for being on the edge of things, and writing well. However, this book sadly is too far out of date to be of use any longer."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Don't get me wrong, I think this book is a good primer and a pointed commentary on the growing influence and impact of blogs in the information society.

Better yet, start your own blog and sell ads to others.\\" It's deja vu all over again!Depsite the eeire echos of the 1999 internet hype, this book is worth the read. If nothing else, it will give you ammunition to annoy your liberal acquaintances!"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Even though it often seems that most people don't really know what blogs are, blogs are changing the way we receive information, what information we receive, and who we receive it from. In Blog, Hugh Hewitt puts forward the case that this \\"information reformation\\" will completely change who has power in the \\"marketplace of ideas.\\"In Part One, Mr. Hewitt recounts a few stories of how the blogosphere has impacted our world including the fall of Trent Lott, the exposure Dan Rather's forged memos, and the investigation into John Kerry's \\"Christmas in Cambodia.\\" Without the blogosphere, these stories would never have had the impact they did. This is followed up by a history of the Protestant Reformation and an early history of the blogosphere.Moving on to what's going on now, Mr. Hewitt examines why people are transitioning from television and newspapers (\\"old media\\") to blogs for their information. It mostly has to do with the loss of credibility by folks like Dan Rather and the New York Times. He believes that bloggers blog for two reasons: \\"to persuade, and to leave a record of having been there.\\" (105)The third part of the book deals almost exclusively with blogging for businesses and organizations. Mr. Hewitt offers tips for starting and maintaining blogs on multiple levels especially for internal and external (primarily promotional) uses. The first appendix is an archive of Mr. Hewitt's writings on blogs from articles and chapters of previous books. In the second appendix a series of emails are transcribed from his radio listeners explaining what blogs they read and how often.Hugh Hewitt makes an analogy between this reformation and the Protestant Reformation with Luther and his use of the printing press. While blogs certainly are changing things, which is evident from the impact it's already had, to draw too close a parallel between the reformations seems a bit ridiculous. There's no significant evidence that the blogosphere will change culture and history to the extraordinary extent the printing press did.For someone wanting to understand what a \\"blog\\" is and how blogs have already made an impact in our world, this is a valuable book. It's also good for easily finding out which are the most popular conservative and theological blogs out there. As usual, the writing style is easy to follow and accessible to any reader, however, it's also a bit disjointed and shallow. Particularly in the areas of practical tips for new bloggers and companies it felt as though Mr. Hewitt just wrote from the top of his head without really developing his ideas. Overall this is a useful book for those who don't know much about blogs, however, those who currently blog will not get much out of it."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I received this book for Christmas. I looked forward to reading it since blogging is one of my favorite hobbies. But it was a struggle to finish it. It's written with an arrogant tone. I almost wonder whether Hugh Hewitt actually wrote the book or if some ghost writer did.I don't think I learned very much from reading it. Basically, the message of the book is: You better blog because it's important to your business, your faith, and your political candidate.I didn't bother reading the appendices because the main text was so torturous.I'm grateful for the present because this book is one the things I wanted for Christmas, but personally, you're not missing much if you don't read it. A definite thumbs down.P.S. This is not a very scholarly written review. It's my first review, but I hope to write others that are more serious, especially for books that are worth my time."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"...got it right in their review of this book (a review which Hewitt snidely dismisses on his blog). This is a quickly dashed off screed of partisan hackery designed to make a quick buck for the holiday season.

Being a slow reader, it took me about eight hours over three days to finish it. Mr. Hewitt doesn't wander over his subject, he gets to the point and provides excellent examples to reinforce his argument.He gives a good history of the information age and how it impacted the world from the first pages of Guttenberg's printing press to Instipundits.com's popularity during the last election cycle. The basic theme of the book is how blogging challenges the gatekeepers of information.During the 2004 presidential election, the bloggers forced the mainstream media to recognize stories they tried to ignore and, in the meantime, the bloggers became the story. \\"Blog\\" gives me examples of how people sitting in a the corners of their house, cutting and pasting, linking and emailing, informed the world to the alternative to what the mainstream media wanted me to know.I loved the history of this book and I liked the commentary. I had hoped for more instruction on blogging. Mr. Hewitt gives a general outline to maintaining a blog, but simply refers the reader to a Blog called Evangelicaloutpost.com for instructions on how to start a Blog.Regardless, the word Blog now has meaning so I can include it in my vocabulary of Net, Web, and Link. \\"Blog, Understanding the Information Reformation That's Changing Your World\\" is a must read for anybody wanting to start a blog. So, Blog on."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"The first 2 parts of the book have some excellent scholarship, you just wish Chapter 1 had sister chapters. Hugh starts Chapter 2 (on the Reformation) defensively, probably in opposition to pre-publication counsel to drop the analogy. Borrowing on the life-or-death upheaval of the Protestant Reformation to describe blogging's effect on media makes bloggers sound like glory craving talents claiming lordship over a new faith. Chapter 1 is spectacular and is diluted by the chapter 2 blather. [Confession: while I love my Protestant brethren, they do push my Catholic buttons from time to time.]The subsequent chapters on media trends, blog hits and blog advertising are useful. The mention of the origin of the professorbainbridge.com blog (which is a great blog by the way) is motivating, and the suggestion of blogs for businesses and products is interesting -- you just think there could have been at least one concrete example dissected (maybe a blog on Firestone SUV tires, or on a soon to be good/bad stock pick?).Since Hugh has been blogging for years now, the part on developing a blog, building hits, using web technology to analize hits and links, and booking advertising falls so far short of expectations. All those offerings were apparently sacrificed to get a book to market for the holidays. OK, I accept that and I still recommend the book, but I need 2 hot cups of coffee in the morning, and this book just seems like a half cup."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Hugh is one of the pioneers of blogging. He presents a good summary of what blogging is and how blogging will impact our future."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"This is an excellent new book by law professor, radio talk show host and Hugh Hewitt. Folks who have no idea what blogs are will be provided with an excellent intro to blogs-what they are, who runs them, why they're important. Bloggers and devotees of the blogosphere will gain a better grasp of the significance of the media revolution that blogs have ushered in.Hewitt revisits recent episodes in the young history of blogs-Trent Lott's stupid comments at Strom Thurmond's birthday party, ex-NY Times editor in chief Howell Raines' role in the Jayson Blair scandal/saga, the Swift Boat Vets' exposure of John Kerry's bogus \\"Christmas in Cambodia\\", and Rathergate-the fake memos CBS so boldly proclaimed out of political bias. All of these episodes were carried by blogs, as Old Media/Legacy Media/MSM would have let these go, but for the diligence of bloggers.Hewitt's succinct history of the blogosphere drives home its significance in creating a media reformation. In the same way the Protestant Reformation took place in light of newly-created printing press technology, today's New Media is made possible by the easy access to information and publishing provided by blogs on the internet. The result: information is now directly accessible to people faster and in proportions never imagined--and Old Media authorities will have to accept a new, diminished role in delivering news.This book is the first big book on blogs by a top blogger, and with the recent release of the Whitewash Report over Rathergate, Hewitt's timing could not be better. (Let the Whitewash Report serve as proof that the blogosphere should never rest on its laurels or expect other outlets to carry water for it.) So go get it."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Hugh Hewitt's newest book, \\"Blog: Understanding the Information Reformation That's Changing Your World\\" has a breathless urgency in its message about the current impact and future promise of blogs. Hugh presents practical and innovative approaches to corporate and niche blogging that will appeal to forward-thinking publishers, musicians, sports franchises, and just about any special interest group.Hugh Hewitt is easy to listen to on his daily talk radio show, and he is equally easy to read. His style is briskly conversational, to the point, and always buttressed by meticulous research and presentation of facts.Hugh closes \\"Blog\\" with a clarion call to readers to launch into the rapidly expanding blogosphere. His persuasive argument is so effective that it makes me grateful that my little blog, www.oneclearcall.blogspot.com, has been up and running since August 2004."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"This is an excellent introduction to blogging. It gives a short history of the activity, some great tips on how to do it and some wonderful resources. It explains RSS functions in browsers (which allow an individual to collect blogs for reading much as you would form your own newspaper). All in all, it is a useful tool.At the same time, it hyperventilates at some points and offers opinions about the blogging movement that are a bit over the top.Hewitt is a keen observer and if you want a basic introduction to blogging or if you want to be inspired to start your own blog - this is a great text for that. If you want to think more deeply about the blogging phenomenom or about the implications for all sorts of other things (like the survival of Mainstream Media (MSM), or changes that we will need to think about for all sorts of societal issues - then this is not the book for you.But then if you read the book - and are inspired, as I was, to start a blog - you can opine on all those issues yourself. The real message of Blog - is Si, s&eacute; puede - yes you can!"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"This is an excellent and insightful overview of a growing phenomenon.The current state of the Blogosphere seems to be much the same as the Internet was 8-9 years ago, when it was very broad, but lacked depth, and was still heavily populated by people eager to talk about themselves or their favorite hobby horses. Of course, many of them are still here, but the Internet has deepened and matured as will the Blogosphere. I say that despite all the porn and paranoia that pops up everywhere. Both the Internet and the Blogosphere are powerful tools for research, representation and empowerment.One of the most interesting aspects of the Blogosphere's development has been the similarity to the way in which neural connections form in the brain. And I think it likely that, as in the brain, less useful pathways will be pruned over time.The reviewer who likened the current state of blogging to graffiti is quite right as things stand now. But over time neurological systems tend to be self-regulating, as I suspect, the Blogosphere will be. Indeed, I think that many of the examples in this book point to self-regulation that is already occurring.Be very clear that this is not a \\"How To\\" book, of which there are plenty of good ones. It is instead a cultural and sociological analysis of something new that is evolving extremely rapidly, and is already impacting all our lives.This is arguably the best overview of blogging currently available, but I hope that Hugh Hewitt knows that he's going to have to update the book with monotonous regularity!Highly recommended to anyone who wants to know what blogging is all about, and whether they want to be involved in it."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"It's funny--the author, conservative drum-beater Hugh Hewitt, wrote an entire chapter comparing the internet age to the invention of the printing press and the publishing of the first Bibles, and how it rocked the world of that time. I say it's funny, because I had thought exactly about the comparison before I read \\"Blog\\". And he's exactly right.Face it: the bloggers are here, and here to stay. Like the sixteenth-century Catholic hierarchy fearing the impact of the printing press on their own power, the mainstream media is running scared of the blogs, and takes every opportunity to discredit them whenever they can, often blasting them for writing their blog entries \\"in their pajamas\\" or underwear or whatever.Hewitt documents the history (albeit brief) of the blog craze, and how it was used to bring down reporters and politicians from boths sides of the political spectrum (Dan Rather, Trent Lott).A must-read for all who embrace technology."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"The Internet was once an orderly place where authorities exchanged views with authorities, and you could save time and money by accessing the top people directly.Then, the Internet took off and was soon filled with scams, slams, sham and spam . . . and even less desirable material.Blogs create the potential to regain the best of the Internet's potential. Hugh Hewitt provides a great service for those who are new to blogs and blogging by describing the positive role that blogs can play in balancing the Main Stream Media. He also warns those who are blogless what risks they are running and how to protect themselves.This is a beginner's book, but even with millions of blogs over 98% of people on the Internet don't have one yet.The book is a quick and interesting read, and will send you to the resources you need to find out what you want to know . . . whether it's the inside scoop on the latest news controversy, or just how to find readers for your new blog.Usually the people who write books like this about new media don't have much experience. Hugh Hewitt brings the perspective of being a veteran talk show host, a columnist and one of the world's hottest bloggers. That's a great vantage point for a book on the future of blogging.Unless you've been blogging for two years and read blogs daily, you will find this book to be a revelation."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Okay,I can be a little stubborn. Well, maybe very stubborn. My husband, an avid fan of talk radio who is very aware of my writing addiction, told me a year ago to get a blog. Well, I tried a couple of times, wrote a few posts and returned to the solitary musings I put in my journals.Finally, my husband made me check out Hugh Hewitts blog and get this book. Wow, were my eyes opened! I love blogging and I have the sense that most moms will love blogging as soon as they start doing it.It is wonderful for sometimes stuck-at-home moms to feel more connected to other moms who feel the same. Moms can feel more productive and receive intellectual stimulation from writing and reading other's blogs. Blogging is also a great way for work-from-home moms to offer valuable products and services over the Internet.As a former psychiatrist, I find myself wondering if blogging by new moms might cut down on the isolation that can contribute to postpartum depression.Although Hewitt's book is a good start, I have a feeling we have only scratched the surface of the possible roles of blogs in the future.Anyone who does not want to be in the dark about important developments in contemporary society must read this book. Moms need to know!"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I received my copy of Hugh Hewitt's new book, Blog. It's a book that's having a significant impact in the blogsphere, particularly among Evangelical bloggers. What's the fuss?I'm afraid I don't have a great answer to that question. I liked the book -- I really wanted to like it -- but I didn't love it.Here's what I liked: Hewitt does a good job of demonstrating how the blogsphere has grown to rival, and in some celebrated recent examples such as \\"Rathergate,\\" to supplant or at least upstage, traditional print and broadcast media. And, he makes some cogent, although not revolutionary, observations about how business organizations should utilize blogs and bloggers. He also refers to some useful blogs that newbies in the blogsphere will want to visit, although at times he seems mostly to be shilling for his blogging friends and promoting his own site.Here's what I didn't like. The book reads like it was cranked out over a few long weekends. If you're looking for serious analysis of blogging as a social or political phenomenon, this isn't it. There are many breathless sections about how the blogsphere has \\"shattered\\" the \\"MSM\\" (Main Stream Media), interrupted with long block quotes and padded with filler such as an \\"Appendix\\" comprised of Hewitt's \\"early writings on blogging\\" and a second \\"Appendix\\" comprised of e-mails from visitors to Hewitt's website. Any 220 page book with nearly 70 pages of appendices from old, disjointed writings suggests, to me, that the book's main themes perhaps aren't that well developed. It also lacks an index, which again suggests perhaps some haste in getting to press.The book's brevity might be understandable if it were a monograph on one or two tightly argued points. It isn't. In fact, it's difficult to tease out the book's main focus. Is it primarily a call to arms for conservative bloggers, or more of a business blogger's how-to? Is this book in the tradition of Sean Hannity or Stephen Covey? It seems to want to be both, and as a result does strike oil with either.In addition to problems of style and organization, I think the book includes several important substantive missteps. It seems to me that Hewitt suffers from myopia when he compares blogging to the information revolution that followed Guttenberg's invention of the printing press. Blogging isn't the revolution -- the Internet is the revolution. Blogging is just the latest tool made possible by the Internet. The sorts of discussions now happening in blogs once happened (and still do happen) on bulletin boards and chat rooms. Years ago they happened mostly on the Usenet and on proprietary boards such as The Well and Delphi.I would agree that blogging has accelerated this trend by making this sort of informal information exchange easier. Yet it's important to place blogging in context. Blogging may persist, or it may go the way of the Usenet as new tools arise. The Internet, though, is here to stay. A truly strategic vision for communication will embrace this new tool while recognizing its possibly transitory nature. At the very least, Hewitt should explain why blogging is here to stay.Hewitt also spends little time on the potential dangers of the blogsphere. He does recognize that jihadist groups have taken to the Internet and blogging, which he seems to employ as a call to arms for good people to occupy the space. Yet, he seems so enchanted by the blogsphere's potential to correct perceived bias in the traditional print and broadcast media that he never addresses the way network effects can magnify the impact of false information. A case in point, which Hewitt ignores, is the post-election blogswarm about vote fraud started by a blogger whose statistical analysis of the exit polls was inaccurate. Hewitt even briefly refers to the concept of memes, without acknowledging that memes are often bits of false information that replicate virulently over a network. (I'd give a cite to Hewitt's book where he references memes, but the lack of an index makes the job of searching too difficult).Finally, Hewitt seems too sanguine about the commercialization of blogging. He goes so far as to suggest pricing models for blog banner ads. Call me a purist, but the last thing I want to see is the extensive commoditization of blogs. In fact, there's a real danger that the commercialization of blogs will signal the decline of the blogsphere. Public relations professionals have already recognized the importance of the blogsphere and are becoming adept at \\"seeding\\" stories in influential blogs, just as they seed stories through \\"leaks\\" to the traditional news media. A commercialized, coopted blogsphere will lose its authenticity. Surprisingly, Hewitt doesn't seem concerned about this. In my view, what we need in the blogsphere is writers who say what they think regardless of the consequences. Once you begin eating from the hands of sponsors, advertisers, and public relations flackers, you become the MSM.So, if you're new to blogging or just curious about it and want to learn more, get Biz Stone's Blogging, which contains much more nuts and bolts information about blog culture and tools. If you're an active blogger, read Hewitt's book, but blog about how much more interesting a book it could have been if it had been a more thorough analysis of the blogsphere's place in the Internet and the culture at large."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Why is it that some ideas or behaviors or products start epidemics and others don't? That's the question that Malcom Gladwell attempts to answer in \\"The Tipping Point\\", a fascinating examination of the phenomena of social epidemics. While examining the question Gladwell introduces three types of people -- Mavens, Connectors, and Salesmen -- who play a critical role in dictating trends.Mavens are information brokers who have the knowledge and social skills to start epidemics; connectors are people who know lots of other people; and salesmen are people with the skills to persuade us when we are unconvinced by what we are hearing. While many of us play some of these roles, there are few truly influential mavens, connectors, or salesmen. An even few number of remarkable people are a combination of all three. Hugh Hewitt is one of those people.As a best-selling author, national radio host, and popular blogger, Hewitt is a classic connector. And his willingness to help and encourage others, sparking in them a passion for blogging marks him as a true maven. Now, with the release of his extraordinary new book, Blog: Understanding the Information Reformation, he exhibits his persuasive skills as a salesman. Hewitt is a one-man epidemic, spreading the burgeoning trend of blogging.While many of us might see 5 million blogs as a revolution already well on its way to maturity, Hewiit sees a vast, relatively untapped market. His book is squarely aimed at the large segment of the population who might use email and surf the Internet but still doesn't quite understand the importance of the \\"blog thing.\\" Hewitt explains why blogs are significant, how they are changing the world around us, and - most importantly - how not to get left behind in this phase of the \\"information reformation.\\"With a style reminiscent of management guru Tom Peters, Blog hits the ground running. \\"I know you are busy,\\" Hewitt writes in the opening words of the preface and spends the next 220 pages cutting to the chase. He doesn't waste time trying to explain what isn't necessary. Like a classic maven he convinces the reader to just trust him, he knows what he's talking about and is willing to freely share his valuable knowledge.Blog is divided into three sections, each explaining an essential aspect of blogging. Part one lays out the case for \\"What Happened\\" by describing the \\"blog storms\\" that helped bring down such powerful figures as Trent Lott and Dan Rather. Even mainstream media types will have a hard time scoffing at the power of the blogosphere after the retelling of these seminal \\"opinion storms.\\" And those of us who watched the events unfold in real time will be impressed by Hewitt's post-mortem examination. He clearly did his homework.In explaining the twenty-first century \\"information reformation\\" Hewitt compares it to the sixteenth century's Protestant Reformation. While many others have compared blogging to the invention of the printing press, Hewitt delves into the history of the event and shows how a young monk named Luther used the new technology to transform Western culture. In doing so he revives an often overused metaphor and gives it new life, making a convincing case that 2005 really is \\"1449 and 1517, at the same moment.\\"While the first section of the book will be of special interest to bloggers, Parts II and III lay out the case for why leaders of business, church, government, and media should be paying attention to the new media. Even those of us who spend a considerable amount of time thinking about blogging will be impressed by the creative uses for the medium that Hewitt suggests. His recommendations, if adopted, would benefit both bloggers and the organizations that could use our unique skills to their advantage.Throughout the book, Hewitt exhibits his typically generous \\"linking\\" and praise for blogs and bloggers. Instead of using the book solely as a vehicle for promoting his own \\"brand\\", he shows that blogging truly is an interconnected community. As he readily admits, no blog - no matter how much traffic it receives -- is as important as the blogosphere. The fact that Hewitt \\"gets\\" this and is able to use it to his advantage is one of the primary reasons he has become one of the foremost leaders of the new media.When you order your copy of Blog from Amazon you'll want to get at least two copies -- one to keep and one to give away. No matter whether you are a connector, a maven, or just a wannabe, after reading Hewitt's book you'll become a salesman for blogging.[...]"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"If the blogosphere had a press agent, it would be Hugh Hewitt. He has flogged the potential of the blogosphere for over a year on his website, and \\"Blog\\" attempts to bring the word to people who don't get their news from the Internet.Like his previous work, \\"If It's Not Close, They Can't Cheat,\\" \\"Blog\\" is an eminently readable work you can devour in an afternoon. Hugh's writing style is conversational and transmits information quickly and clearly. This makes \\"Blog\\" a good read regardless of your position on blogs and blogging.Hugh's thesis is simple: blogs are the next wave in the information revolution, as important to the dissemination of information as the printing press was to the Reformation. While Hugh touts a number of blogs (oddly enough missing yours truly, but I'm sure that was an oversight), his discussion isn't about any particular blog, but about how the technology of blogs is changing how information reaches the public. He cites four significant instances of the blogosphere influencing the public discourse: the removal of Trent Lott from his position as Senate Majority Leader, the fall of Jayson Blair and Howell Raines at the New York Times, the takedown of John Kerry by the Swift Boat Veterans for the Truth and Dan Rather's immolation following the 60 Minutes forged National Guard documents scandal. Each case illustrates how the blogosphere was able to keep stories percolating (and even breaking, in the latter two cases) until the national media had no choice to take what the blogosphere was giving them, and in each case the results were markedly different than what would have occurred prior to the rise of the blogosphere.Naysayers will probably ding Hugh for what notes as blogger triumphalism, but I think such readers are missing the point. Hugh is not arguing that any one blogger or group of bloggers is able to have this effect, but that the blogosphere as a whole is distributing the flow of information in such a manner as to make it far more difficult for anyone to control that flow. That will make life far more difficult for people accustomed to keeping tight control over information, but it also represents a great opportunity for people willing to take advantage of this new medium's strengths. And this is what Hugh is trying to sell: those people and businesses that jump into the blogosphere now are going to gain a serious competitive advantage on those who continue to stick to older methods of communicating. While this process in likely to move in fits and starts over the next few years, it is coming nevertheless, and \\"Blog\\" offers some good advice to those people looking to get out ahead of the blogosphere rather than ending up in trouble due to a failure to understand this new technology.The definitive work on the blogosphere is yet to be written, because it's still too early in the development of the system to chronicle it all. But Blog is a good start and a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand more about what the blogosphere is and how it can help or hurt your business."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Some moron, presumably a liberal, misappropriated my identity to post a fictitious review in my name. For what it's worth, he doesn't even know where I live. More important, he completely misrepresented my opinion of Hewitt's excellent book. Here is what I wrote on Power Line: \\"My copy of Hugh's book arrived in the mail today. From a quick skim, it looks great. Hugh documents the rise of the blogosphere, gives a riveting account of the role blogs played in the 2004 election, and offers both theoretical and empirical arguments for the historical importance of the blogosphere....Buy it!\\"Having now had time to finish the book, I can confirm that anyone who is interested in blogs, the media, politics, or just doesn't want to be left behind by the next wave of the communications revolution should read Blog. I was particularly interested in Hugh's observations on the relevance of blogging to the corporate world. So, I repeat: Buy it!"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"The title of this book leads one to believe that it is about the new media outlet called a \\"blog\\" wherein private citizens of all views, backgrounds and ideologies share what they know for view to the general public via websites. On this end, Hugh does a credible job in illuminating how important and trusted these information sources have become in the recent few years.The book is the strongest when Hugh is outlining some of the well documented failing of the tradition media, in particular the sad and unfortunate tarnish to Dan Rather for whom what little objectivity he ever had was destroyed by his foolishly supporting a news story based on forged documents. In this aspect, as well as the failed exit polling in the last Presidential election, the \\"blogs\\" had the accurate data and talk radio personalities like Hugh let the public know about it. It is true that the world has changed and people in general no longer trust the far left leaning main stream media.I also learned about a number of great blog sites, and plan on checking those out. For that alone, the book was also useful.However, I cannot give the book high marks overall because it was not written well. The chapters and themes are disjointed and disconnected, Hugh at times seems to launch into nothing more than personal grandstanding, and his technical data points were a bit weak.This would have been a fabulous article somewhere, but it feels like it got stretched into a book for nothing more than a few more bucks in his pocket. Good points, poor presentation. Overall, there was enough to keep me interested, but I can't give the book a high recommendation, despite more often than not agreeing with his viewpoints."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"In broad strokes, the first 100 pages of BLOG are a rehash of the \\"W\\" - Kerry campaign and how bloggers impacted the election.

These fifty pages are worth the price of the book.The last 75 pages of BLOG are the rants (writings) of the author, Hugh Hewitt. Either you agree with him and thus like him or you don'tAt this time, there is not a lot of material about blogs - other than blogs themselves - available. At least for now, BLOG is the book.Four stars"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Hewitt suggests the blogosphere allows for the organization of dissent, which is focused, credentialed, complete, and--crucially--publicized. In short, he champions blogs as the force providing accountability to \`legacy media'.Any fair-minded observer of \`legacy media' would conclude not all journalism is good journalism. Of course, likewise, not all blogs are good journalism either. However, the point Hewitt makes is that, instead of a one-sided, agenda-driven media, we've been given balance through the quickness and efficiency of the blogsosphere. That is, one of the ways blogs provide benefits is through their timely response to periodic mainstream media error.Hewitt claims the \`old media' is increasingly devoid of serious scholarship, and is slowly being reduced to mere polemic. The irony here is that Hewitt's communicating in one of the oldest media forms - the book. OK, to be fair, Hewitt isn't suggesting all other media forms are 'legacy', rather, he's pointing to the perviously dominate outlets more than the forms. (LA Times beware, and you too Newsweek and CBS.)In short, he suggests the blogs must be taken seriously, and they are rapidly becoming so. There are too many qualified journalists who run blogs for them not to have an enormous impact on our changing world. Finally, Hewitt claims the accountability they provide is long overdue.Has Hewitt been wrong before? Of course he has - he claimed national security was going to be far and away the primary voter issue of 2004. However, is he likely right about the increasing importance of the blogosphere, and why it's growing in influence and power? I believe so."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"As a Hugh Hewitt fan for serveral years now, this book is a really good book that illustrates the phenomenon of blogs. After receiving a limited release for his book, I am very surprise with the accurate detail he describes in the book. This book answers many question people might have been wondering, and one of them is: why so many people are now turning to 'Blogs' as sources of credible information. This book is a great book. I am very happy with Mr. Hewitt because he finally found the time to pen a thoughtful, well-documented look at the rise of the blogosphere. Mr. Hewitt is nothing, if not prolific, and we're fortunate to have a visionary thinker like Hewitt on our side. I would encourage anyone for this book who is interested in the blogosphere, and what it might look like in the future with all the \\"Blogs\\" we have today."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"This is the second Hewitt book I've read. I've found Hewitt's books to be very well-written and informative, but I've also found his writing style to be a little annoying, a little too full of himself. Despite that personality clash, I found \\"Blog\\" to be a very informative book, though a little long.The book seems to spend a good amount of time trying to stress to companies to start blogs of their own. For a while there, I thought I might have picked up a special version of the book, but alas, I had not. The book was for \\"me\\" (a non-corporation), but also had many sections geared for \\"others,\\" people managing corporations. There are, though, many interesting sections in the book.The beginning of the book provides an important and informative look into \\"What Happened\\" and why blogs matter. An interesting history lesson opens the book, showing how this entity had emerged into the mainstream public's consciousness and helped set the facts straight when some of the mainstream media organizations (for example CBS) \\"accidentally\\" found themselves airing or publishing incorrect information (there is also a section going back to the Gutenberg bible).The book was good enough, and inspiring enough, that I actually went out and created my own blog. Unfortunately, I grew tired of being in that long tail (or whatever that phrase Hewitt used), writing for just myself, and now that blog is no more. This is an interesting book about blogs that might be more political than some people are looking for on the subject."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Yes, it's a must-have book on the growth and power of the blogosphere, but I'd be lying if I said there were no flaws.Hugh is, of course, an opinionated guy. And in chapter 1, as he chronicles the impact of blogging on Trent Lott, the New York Times, John Kerry, and Dan Rather, we learn his opinions of CNN, the New York Times' Paul Krugman (he calls him &quot;unbalanced and frothing&quot; even though Krugman quotes a blogger approvingly), the mainstream media and Barbra Streisand. (To his credit, he does try to be fair to the blogsites Atrios and DailyKos.) If you can get past the slant, you'll find he has quite a bit to say.Hugh seems a bit apocalyptic in his view of the MSM, which is perhaps why some of them are dismissive of this book. But at the same time he outlines in plain language some of the reasons why mainstream journalism is in a crisis of confidence, and why the blogosphere aggravates it.Chapter 7 describes strategies for dealing with the blogosphere, intended for businesses that could be potential targets. For the most part it's common sense, but this is one chapter that can and should be longer, particularly in outlining policies on employee blogging.Chapters 8 and 9 deal with starting and maintaining blogs for business, from leaders to managers to subordinates, as well as the use of blogs for gathering corporate intelligence. And Chapter 12 lists typical examples of blogs that types of people could start.There are nice concrete suggestions here, but the chapters could have benefitted from real-world examples. For instance, Hugh could interview TV producer Rhett Reese, who maintained a showblog while his series Joe Schmo 2 was airing on Spike TV.And yet these latter chapters are perhaps the most important contributions Hugh makes to the blog literature, because they attempt to show how the blogosphere can be mined and exploited for better corporate behavior.My recommendation? If you don't know much about blogs but want to use the Net to help your business, you should buy this edition. If you're already a blogger, you might want to wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I borrowed this book with the assumption that it would help me learn about technical aspects of blogging and getting started.

Turn the book over and look at the name of the publisher on the back. If it says Nelson Books, don't buy it, unless you want to be the victim of a fraud.The good folks at Nelson Books are marketing the far right wing rantings of a tiresome blowhard named Hugh Hewitt under the title of Blog: Understanding the Information Reformation That's Changing Your World. This book devotes about 20% of its pages to discussing blogs. The other 80% is a mean-spirited and sustained attack on what Hewitt considers the \\"far left leaning main stream media\\". If you disagree with his assessment of things, you can get bent, according to this sweetheart of a man, who tells you that \\"if you want to argue the point... you don't have a clue, and you won't when the night is over.\\" Later, he rubs your nose in it when he says \\"[If] you want to argue what \\"left-of-center means\\", you have purchased the wrong book.

Had I known the full title of your previous screed I would've side stepped your current dung heap, but the good folks at Nelson Books only saw fit to mention that you'd written a book called If It's Not Close, They Can't Cheat.

But of course, only liberals can be bad guys. The farther to the right one gets, the less accountable one has to be. Consequently, after 150 pages of haranguing readers to use the blogosphere to attack and dismember as many liberals as possible, you blithely warn us that, \\"Demagogues will, no doubt, try to use the blogosphere, even as hate groups have, to identify and motivate their followers.\\"Hmm, that never occurred to me. Thanks for the tip, Hugh. I'll keep my head up.I could go on and on, but responding to this doofus's absurd rantings seems a bit like rising to the bait, which wasn't what I signed on for. I really, genuinely wanted a book about blogs, one targeted to anyone who might want to start one. Yet when this book finally does get around to talking about blogs it's for a very narrow audience indeed, one that doesn't include me. Hewitt is writing strictly for executives with leadership responsibilities, executives of Fortune 500 companies, as it turns out, and only far right wing executives of Fortune 500 companies. Everybody else is not worth addressing, and anybody who doesn't agree with Hewitt is beneath contempt.Obviously, the publishers of this book realized early on that the target audience for their clever boy was somewhat limited, so they did what any good hard right publishing house would do, they set out to trick us. There's not a word on the jacket or fly leaf anywhere to tell you you're in for a tongue lashing about what's right and good and true from a conceited extremist who sincerely believes Rush Limbaugh is a moderate and that every liberal should be scourged to the border and given a sharp kick in the rump.

All he is doing is leveraging his radio show with books and blogging. Blog offers nothing of import other that to inspire others to try their hand at self promotion.

If you can get past the NeoCon slams at Michael Moore and Al Franken, Hewitt makes a couple of good points. Not good enough to overshadow his attitude, but definitely relevant. Too bad he didn't show a little restraint - this might have been a good resource for those seeking to learn about blogs, but as it is, I can't really recommend it.One thing it did confirm for me, which I had long suspected, is that most conservative bloggers are paid writers or professional political operatives.

I feel cheated."},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"Mr. Hewitt, I was at the book store today and happened to pick up your book, BLOG. Although I would be considered young, I'm still not of the mindset that I know everything and anything there is to know, thus, I picked up your book to gain further knowledge.A few things come to mind and the very first is the cover. Interestingly enough how blogging is destroying MSM, as referenced in your book, yet on the cover of your book it states: New York Times Best-Selling Author and the last time I checked the New York Times is MSM. I'm sure that was the publisher's decision though. I do agree with that statement, however, although I found it a tad ironic. Moving on.I'm sure Mr. Hewitt that you have talent and obviously you have a resume somewhere down the line that allows you to teach at a law school and have a show I've read about in this book, although I've never heard of you. Your knowledge of the church and politics seems to be extensive, but unfortunately the title of your book was not Political Blogging, which I guess brings me to my first question; with so much mention of the \\"right\\" and the \\"left\\" or as you so eloquently phrase it \\"the far left,\\" what does any of this have to do with Blogging? Does it matter who I voted for in a Presidential election, or a city election for that matter, as to whether or not I understand, comprehend and participate in the blogging process? I can tell you right now my father is Republican and would never touch the word blog in a million years.I read the book, partly against my will because so much OP-ED was involved that I didn't feel like I was being provided any rational or educational information for me to make my own decisions with, but like someone was jamming a spoon down my throat full of cough syrup. Each chapter is rhetorical in, not only it's references, but context and I'd quite frankly like to know how this would help anyone on the face of this earth better understand blogging and how to properly utilize it - that's my second question.This book is clever none-the-less. I've never seen anyone be able to take one subject, Blogging, three cases, Rather, Kerry and Lott (I'll leave out Raines) and turn it into a 225 page book, throwing in a few history, church and political references to top it off like cherries.This email is neither a slight nor derogatory, but truthful. If I was a politician looking to gain further knowledge about political events and how I could use the power of blogging to support or discredit an individual, that I could fully understand - 220 pages of your book are devoted to that. However, the title of your book, BLOG, insinuates the notion that this will cover a wide spectrum of valuable information, not just politics. Blogs cover the landscape of the internet in many forms and none of that is touched upon on in your book, other than to say, if this is how it applies to politics, this is how it applies to your \\"field.\\" If I was an Executive looking to gain further knowledge about blogging and its useful strategies and I had purchased this book, I'd be infuriated.The title reads: BLOG - Understanding the information reformation that's changing the world. First, the understanding of the reformation is a one chapter subject - at best. Second, this book doesn't even mention the world - it mentions the US and I'm gathering, from your distaste of the left, it's directed to those on the right, segregating your target audience even more. Personally, politics are of no interest to me, but that refers to me as an individual. Even so, I'd like to throw in the suggestion that your next book be titled: Political Blog - The Snow Storm You Can Create With A Mouse and Keyboard.In addition, as you so ingratiatingly phrase numerous times in this book, if you are not of the same opinion as I, this book isn't for you - that was a paraphrase, but I'll take your advice Mr. Hewitt, not only will I be blogging this entry, but I will be returning your book tomorrow.Thank you for your time and pleasant blogging journeys,J WrightPS. To read story telling and proper information gathering/feeding at its best, reference Nina Munk's Fools Rush In, about the debacle between AOL and Time Warner - fantastic book and every executive on the planet should read it !"},{"Title":"Blog: Understanding The Information Reformation","review":"I guess the easiest books to like are those that support the ideas that you already have. Therefore I think this book is great. Specifically, or perhaps I should say superficially, this book is on the development of Blogs that are primarily concerned with current events, particularly on comments about the breaking news.Underneath the Blog, however, there's the bigger picture of the emergence of electronic communications of all type. Mr. Hewitt consentrates on blogs saying that old fashioned static web pages are a thing of the past. There are web pages, see www.newbooksinprint.com for instance that change every day, giving the latest books that are available free on the internet.This kind of communications that is possible now is something new. I think, Mr. Hewitt is right when he compares it to the development of printing by Gutenberg. (Although when I said this at the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz, Germany they didn't agree.) We are at the beginning of a basic fundamental change in how communications are made.

In describing the bloggers ability to bring down Trent Lott, John Kerry and Dan Rather I was disturbed by the lack of recognition that many of the reports given by bloggers were blatantly false (Swift Boat Veterens) but lauded as heroic.

Hewitt uses examples from the political sphere to illustrate the impact of blogs and this will probably irritate leftists, since all but one of his examples have leftist icons like Dan Rather and his forged documents.But Hewitt brilliantly traces the combined ascendancy of Gutenberg's invention and Martin Luther's desire for reformation to illustrate his point. From that perspective, Hewitt's message that blogs are a destroyer of worlds, a creator of worlds is crystal clear and very impressive.Hewitt does not go into the technical details of blogging, a process, which in fact has been made simple, by operations like Blogger and TypePad. Rather he gets to the meat of the matter explaining why every political candidate, business, social cause needs a blog.Like the salesmen of yore who went forth to convince merchants of their need for mechanical cash registers, Hewitt sells the idea of the need for the blogging. And the man is totally dead-on. This is a must read for every one who has a need to communicate with the public. Hewitt is the first so far to sense the ultimate power of blogging.

So persuasive were George's arguments that landed elites, desperate to protect their vested interests in unearned wealth, set out to undermine George's immense popularity.In \\"The Corruption of Economics,\\" the precise manner in which Henry George was neutralized is uncovered by professor Mason Gaffney. That manner -- which later became known as neo-classical economics -- was to corrupt economic science. How? By blurring the traditional distinction between capital and land (and hence between earned and unearned income), by glossing this blurred distinction with jargon and abstract models, and by recasting economics generally to make free-riding by landowners seem just and moral.Unable or unwilling to address Gaffney's arguments head-on, some economists are fond of dismissing this book out of hand as nothing more than a \\"conspiracy theory.\\" In reality, it's a scholarly analysis of the anti-Georgist origins of the neo-classical school of economics, and how this school made an artform out of justifying landed privilege. Every single one of its claims in that regard are supported by credible references.\\"The Corruption of Economics\\" is a must-read for anyone who suspects there is something inherently flawed with \\"mainstream\\" economic theory -- particularly when it comes to reconciling the seeming conflict between economic liberty and social justice -- but is unsure as to what that flaw is."},{"Title":"The Corruption of Economics (Georgist Paradigm Series)","review":"Anyone who has ever spent a half a day in a university getting lectured on economics should read this book.

This book explains neatly what happened to the once grand sience of political economy and the real effects on todays world."},{"Title":"The Corruption of Economics (Georgist Paradigm Series)","review":"Mr. Gintis is schooled in contemporary neoclassical economics that trivializes and sometimes even denies the existence of Ricardian rent, and naturally has difficulty separating and identifying natural resource rents from other components of the economy. This is most disappointing, as substantial strides have been made in showing the amount and significance of rents since the advent of computer power and data can be tapped. Australian economist Terry Dwyer, himself Harvard educated, shows that just the ground rent from earthly locations is about a third of GDP. And Professor Gaffney's most recent article in the International Journal of Social Economics shows the numerous ways in which rent has been under-estimated. Professor Gintis gets a number of his facts wrong in this review: Henry George's Progress and Poverty was first published in 1879 and not 1987, and by 1906 had been translated into fourteen languages and sold more copies than any book published except the Bible. Contemporaries of the era were intellectual luminaries and statesmen, among them Bernard Shaw, Winston Churchill, Sun Yat Sen, Leo Tolstoi, and Alfred Russell Wallace. More recently, Illinois economics professor and later Paul Douglas was a strong supporter of these ideas, as was Albert Einstein. John Dewey wrote an introduction to one edition of Progress and Poverty, saying \\"It would require less than the fingers of the two hands to enumerate those who, from Plato down, rank with Henry George among the world's social philosophers. No man, no graduate of a higher institution, has a right to regard himself as an educated man in social thought unless he has some first-hand acquaintance with the theoretical contribution of this great American thinker.\\" Later, at the depth of the depression, Dewey gave a radio broadcast in homage to George. More recently still some eight Nobel laureates in economics have endorsed taxing economic rents, and Columbia University Professor Bill Vickrey was on his way to a Georgist convention when he died.Professor Gaffney's collected work spans seven decades, and he continues to be active -- his most recent book, After the Crash, is printed by Wiley Blackwell. As evidence mounts in recognition of the importance of economic rent in our contemporary economy, only those who wear blinders will continue to deny its significance. He continues to inspire many young scholars. It is fortunate that we have the benefit of Mason Gaffney's enormous corpus of articles, www.masongaffney.org, for it is now, as neoclassical economics is collapsing of its own contradictions, that the tradition of classical economics is being looked to once more. One could do far worse than to start by exploring the many Georgist websites that continue to explore and amplify this venerable tradition. Links can be found readily on Professor Gaffney's site."},{"Title":"The Corruption of Economics (Georgist Paradigm Series)","review":"The basics of Classical economics is:.LAND - the result is confusingly called \\"economic rent\\".CAPITAL - man made things, the result is \\"profit or interest\\".LABOR - the result is \\"wages\\"..Neoclassical economics, formed 100 years ago, has moved LAND into CAPITAL. This distorts, and since we have had two world-wide economic crashes, which were both fulled by rising LAND prices as debt and after debt was poured into non-taxed LAND. In between the major crashes there has been minor boom and busts in many countries..I buy a new car and the value drops. I buy an old house and it rises in value - well the LAND rises in value. Why?.The value of the land was created by community activity, such as spending on infrastructure like, metro rail networks, roads, schools, hospitals, etc, with their tax money. This creates economic growth. The economic growth of Community activity soaks into the land crystallizing as LAND VALUES. This is why house/land values rise - LAND is immovable. In short, the value of the land belongs to the Community as their activity and money created it, not the occupier of the LAND, who did nothing to increase that value. The value of the bricks on the land, the building, belongs to the occupier of the land..Currently there is no mechanism to feed the LAND VALUES back into the economic cycle to maintain, improve and extend vital infrastructure. The LAND VALUES are creamed off as windfalls by landowners. The Land/house market is a giant sluice to the communities money. The land/house market is easy money for doing little more than nothing - merely occupying LAND. Amongst the riches people in most countries, own LAND..The mechanism to complete the economic cycle reclaiming the Communities values soaked into the LAND is called Land Value Tax (LVT) - a tax on all land and its \\"values\\" only, not the bricks on the land, the building. However, a great plus point of LVT is that there is no Income Tax. This stabilizing of the LAND market creates a level, stable, free-market playing field. Not taxing people's energies and enterprise by taking their wages in Income Tax, creates a more enterprise environment playing on the stable free-market playing field..These were the teachings of Adman Smith and Henry George. Mason Gaffney puts this across very well in the modern sense. He highlights where the economic system was hijacked by self-interest to remove land from economics 100 years ago, which as we all know gives us a highly unstable economic system, leading to misery for millions. Using LVT and removing Income Tax gives a largely self regulating economic system, eliminating boom and busts. LVT also keep house prices to acceptable levels with no housing/land bubbles..This is a very good book from a very bright and down to earth man. This book proves that LVT is now of age as the Credit Crunch has nastily demonstrated to us all.."},{"Title":"The Corruption of Economics (Georgist Paradigm Series)","review":"Classical economics was a science, and with Henry George's proper recognition of Land (ALL the world's resources) as one of the three components of production - the other two being Labor and Capital - testable predictions of the causes of booms and busts were finally possible. As Gaffney points out, this was deeply threatening to the Landowning interests, and they spent decades, and vast sums of money, to discredit George. These interests, with the help of now-enshrined neo-classical economists like J.B. Clark, have now nearly succeeded in conflating Land with Capital. But they can't change Natural Law. And, as Gaffney - today's leading Georgist and Land Values economist - has pointed out in many articles and books, and taking up where Hoyt left off, the so-called business cycle is really a Land Cycle. Until the public learns this lesson, we will continue to see Land-based speculation, leading to catastrophic economic busts like the one we are currently struggling through.As for conspiracies, is it any wonder that the universities supporting neo-classical economics, which downplay, or virtually ignore, the role of Land, have themselves ample Land grants? As Gaffney makes clear, economists who didn't tow the line were systematically marginalized or dismissed. There are too many examples to go into here, but you'll have to read the book to find out!Not only is this book a worthy read for everyone, it is the textbook for the \\"History of Capital\\" course at the New York Henry George School of Social Science, where I am a second year student."},{"Title":"The Corruption of Economics (Georgist Paradigm Series)","review":"Henry George was a late-nineteenth century politician and economic theorist who believed, with John Locke, that people own what they produce or create, as well as what they acquire in exchange, but that \\"natural\\" contributions to production, especially land, belong equally to all members of society. He argued in Progress and Poverty (1987) that the only just tax is on land, and that a single land value tax would be extremely egalitarian. There are not many Georgians around these days, but I suppose they would extend the land tax to gas, oil, and other natural resources. With this extension, there are some contemporary \\"oil economies\\" that come close to the Georgist ideal, but the idea is rarely suggested in the advanced industrial societies.If one could separate the primordial value of natural resources from their value after people have invested in their improvement, the single land tax would have the attractive feature of being non-distortionary. However, this separation cannot easily be made, any more than an individual worker's productivity can be divided between innate ability and the results of human capital investment. Moreover, there are strong ethical grounds for taxing individuals at least proportional to their income or wealth, independently of the source of the income or wealth. For these and other reasons, the single land tax is of marginal relevance in contemporary economic policy.This is not judgment of the authors, who claim that Henry George was right, and powerful landed interests paid a generation of scholars to confuse the masses by inventing neoclassical economics, which makes the elementary mistake of conflating land with capital. \\"Those who opposed Henry George's vision of The Good Society\\" we are informed (p. 8), \\"paid money to by scholars to bend the truth - to prevent people from insisting on their democratic rights.\\" Gaffney faults professional economists for spurning their duty as scientists in order to reap the profits of toadying to the landed interests. \\"Systematic, universal brainwashing is the crime,\\" he asserts, \\"tendentious mental conditioning calculated to mislead students, to impoverish their mental ability, to bend their minds to the service of a system that funnels power and wealth to a parasitic minority.\\" (p. 15) Most of the rest of the book is a description of a series of encounters of late-nineteenth century economists with Henry George and his proposals.I did not find the book's arguments very plausible. A century of neoclassical economics has passed since Henry George was active, the neoclassical doctrine is the standard theory taught around the world, and most modern economists have no idea who Henry George is or what he stood for. It is not plausible that the neoclassical dog is wagged by the Georgian stump of a tail. Moreover, neoclassical economics does not conflate land with capital, and at any rate is value-neutral on issues of the proper distribution of income and taxes. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics, any distribution of welfare society deems just can be achieved through the appropriate system of lump-sum taxes. If anything, this theorem is simply Henry George writ large, and has all the defects of the Georgian land value tax. Once and for all lump sum taxes are non-distortionary but are completely infeasible in practice and do not meet the cannons of justice, either.The explanation of the demise of George's political economy ideas is that rich men paid smart men to confuse the masses, and this hoodwinking of the public continues today. The idea is really quite ludicrous, and reminiscent of the religious fundamentalist Creationists who believe all evolutionary biologists are atheists in the pay of the devil.I feel in reading and reporting on this book that I have done a public service.

I used it for two classes - one that covered Equal Protection and one over the structure of government. The section of the book on Equal Protection isn't too bad. It has some nice historical material, and most people are already somewhat familiar with the cases anyway. However, the section of the book on government structure and the commerce clause is truly attrocious. The cases aren't well edited. Sometimes the result of a case will turn on a statute and the text and even title of that statute will have been edited out. Its hard to tell what is important from the cases consequently. There are long strings of cites in cases and the notes after the cases are cramped with no real headings and hard to make heads or tales of. Half the time you can't tell why you are reading a case - what your supposed to be getting out of it and how it relates to the other cases you've read."},{"Title":"Constitutional law (Gilbert law summaries)","review":"It's a casebook, so it's not supposed to be great reading, but this one is by far the worst casebook I've ever had. The only thing a casebook needs to do to achieve mediocrity is contain cases. This doesn't, not really. It gives you the cliff's notes of important cases. One sentence blurbs about others. And pages and pages of rambling, aimless, academic debate. It may be a good book for Con Law professors and others who have already read all of the cases discussed. For someone trying to learn con law, it is useless. It is also organized very poorly. Any class organized around this book is doomed from the start. If your professor uses this book, take another class. If you can't take another class, buy the Chemerinsky treatise and rely on that instead.

The paper is too thin, print shows through not only from the other side of the page, but from other pages below. The paper is an icky off white. The font is funky with awkward leading and hard to read. The margins are non-existent. Forget about writing in the book.

First, read wikipedia, then use what ever supplement is assigned or that you like (I liked Understanding Constitution Law from Lexis, but most students in my class liked the assigned Constitutional Law by Chemerinsky). If need be, you can look up a case on Lexis or Westlaw, and with the headnotes, jump to the relevant portion of the case.

The content is too hard to follow because the editing is way over the top. The Notes sections, in particular, are the worst I have ever seen in a law school casebook (especially if your professor actually goes over each case mentioned that spans all of 2 lines). The editing makes simple concepts seem way too complicated as it constantly presents circular arguments that lead to nowhere.

Crucial facts surrounding key cases like Marbery were not included. The omission makes it easier to read through the voluminous pages, but it's not enough. The reader will *have* to supplement the text with strong in-class notes or a commercial text/outline. There are some key cases simply 'missing' and the coverage of prominent cases like &quot;Brown&quot; is simply insufficient. Comparison and analysis of how one case indirectly may overrule another is also lacking. Overall, it is not a BAD book, the authors probably need to cut some dead weight so they have room to include the missing pieces.

Reading the \\"Notes\\" is generally a waste of time--the author brings up many theories but skims them all, rather than explaining anything in depth, and is a little too fond of asking questions rather than providing answers about the concepts.

For Con Law I, the book was absolutely TERRIBLE. The cases are edited down so much that they are borderline incoherent, such as in Marbury v. Madison and McCullough v. Maryland. There is a great deal of &quot;commentary&quot; in between cases from the authors regarding the information they edited out within the cases, but the structure of learning what was in the case AFTER reading through the case is confusing and time consuming, forcing you to retrace a lot of your steps needlessly. The bottom line on this book for Con Law I is to buy the Legalines supplement for this book, and read it religiously after every case. Chemerinsky's supplement is a great deal of assistance as well, because Con Law I is much more confusing for students using this book (from inquiring through other classmates using different texts). For Con Law II, the subject matter gets 100 times more interesting, but the content of the book remains the same. As a reviewer previously stated, the editing of Brown v. Board of Education is absolutely unacceptable. Such a landmark case fit into four pages? Ridiculous! However, there will be a lot of stimulating class discussion to supplement the extremely edited-down cases presented in Con Law II. My best advice? Buy supplements and keep yourself on top of what you're reading before you get too lost, and make notecards to keep the tests for different circumstances (like justiciability, commerce clause, dormant commerce clause, etc.) straight."},{"Title":"Constitutional law (Gilbert law summaries)","review":"You gotta love Con Law!

Admittedly these are con law opinions that require heavy editing, but this book's critical flaw for the student is its inability to elucidate to the reader what they are about to read and how the case fits into the big picture. Many casebooks give an entree into what you will read and how it is apart of the big picture. This definitely not the case for this book. I was relying on my professor to point out the important opinions from the duds. This book also is terrible in explaining the commerce clause.

The changes from this edition to the newer one were minor. In Con Law 1, I had to pull two new cases off FindLaw and only had to pull one new case for Con Law 2. Other than that the books were similar and most assigned readings were word for word the same between editions.An added bonus was that the professors for both classes have been teaching the subject for years, and in the three sections that were significantly different both tended to teach focused on the older edition. In one class, the previous edition had an older case which had been replaced by the Gore Bush election recount case (an added case). The older case had been shortened to a note, but the professor elaborated on it. Not only was I not lost for using the older book - I had an edge.I highly recommend economizing by buying the older book in this case.

The idea is to help students understand how the Supreme Court came to its current role in U.S. governmental structure. Specific details on cases, if students are interested in additional case text, are always available online.

Numerous research institutes have published repeatedly the scientific fact that there is a disparate impact in the U.S. courts and the number of Caucasians on death row have climbed proportionate to their minority counterparts even as the percentage of Caucasians has grown. Additionally, the percentage of blacks in American society is growing, while the proportion of blacks on death row has been declining. While not yet statistically appropriate, the system has been slowly correcting itself since this case, due to media coverage, pressure from NGOs and the decision of state legislatures to mandate automatic review of death row sentences.1995 Adarand Constructors, Inc. v Pena, pp. 581-589 - Lowest bid on a government contract looses due to the idea that another contractor who subcontracted to minorities would be more likely to contribute to employment of historically poor and disadvantaged groups.

We hold today that all racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state or local government actor must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny. Such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further a compelling governmental interest.

Those old boys were tough and could endure difficulties that ensured their greatness.As a big game hunter myself, some of Teddy's comments struck home. One point was the \\"flock shooting\\" of the Spanish forces; one of the first things you learn when hunting is that even when there is a tight group of game, unless you aim at a specific target, it is unlikely that you will hit anything. Another item is the tactical advantage of smokeless powder; we take that for granted today, but in the fight, it was a big advantage for the Spanish forces. And you cannot help but be impressed by the courage! ...Okay, boys, we're going to run as fast as we can up this steep hill without much cover where there are 500 enemy troops firing down on us.

They were Ivy Leaguers, Cowboys, Indians, Sheriffs, Outlaws, Civil War veterans, Indian fighters, businessmen. Men like Allyn Capron, Buckey O'Neill, (future Secretary of the Navy) Frank Knox, Hamilton Fish, the famed Indian fighter Leonard Wood, and of course the bespectacled Assistant Secretary of the Navy, former New York Police Commissioner and sometime cowboy named Theodore Roosevelt.The \\"Rough Riders\\" is Roosevelt's classic story of these highly motivated volunteers who eagerly volunteered to fight in the Spanish-American war, and whom many, including the regular army officer Capron, the Arizona sheriff O'Neill, Fish and others paid the ultimate price. And not all of the nearly 1000 men who volunteered ever made it over to Cuba. Several troops, to their everlasting sorrow, and nearly all of the horses had to stay in Tampa, the port of embarkation, because of a lack of troopships.Roosevelt tells the entire story, which helped catapult him to the Presidency, of the feisty former Confederate Cavalry commander Joseph Wheeler, who commanded all of the volunteer cavalry, and who, to the amusement of his men, blurted out at Las Guismas, \\"We've got the damn Yankees on the run\\" - momentarily lapsing into Chickamauga, not Cuba!, and of how San Juan Hill was stormed and captured under intense fire from Spanish rifles, gatling guns, and cannon, and giving praise not just to his own men, but to the accompanying Black Cavalrymen of the 9th and 10th cavalry, and of the regular infantry units that were involved in the operation.The colorful and fact-based story of brave American men who fought for the freedom of others, now sadly under totalitarian rule.

But his description of the way the military operated before the turn of the century is very insightful into a time long gone which will never return. Today, there is no way the US Military would accept civilian volunteers with only 30 days training to fight on the front lines against battle hardened soldiers from Spain or anywhere else. To fully appreciate this book, you need to read it in context of that changing time between the Civil War and WW-I. Indeed, the way the US Military accepted back into its ranks former Confederate Officers was almost a shock to read, but understandable given the desire for the nation to heal its wounds after the Civil War.

I happen to like all three."},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"This is a very interesting about a war that is not really well known. This a good read about a time in our countries history where the men did what needed to be done voluntarily.This is the story of the First United States Voluntary Cavalry, known as the Rough Riders, in the Spanish American War of 1898. I had heard of the Rough Riders, but did not appreciate what a diverse and extremely talented collection of men were in the group. Roosevelt started off as LtCol , second in command to Col Leonard Wood, who had been regular army. When Wood got promoted later in Cuba, Roosevelt took over the Rough Riders. The book brings to life many people, cowboys, indians, collage men, miners, lawmen, ranchers etc., who were all part of the Rough Riders.I had not appreciated all of the problems that they had with logistics, starting with getting the basic equipment, rifles, tents, saddles, horses, wagons, rations, transportation, etc. The armed services had not solved the logistics problems, of getting material and providing it to the troops. Transportation to Cuba was so sparse, that the regiment could not take its horses, nor all of its men, nor its wagons and mules for transportation, etc.. The US Navy could not provide enough shipping to move everyone, with all of the equipment. The armed services did a much better job with logistics during the Civil War, in 1861-65. Perhaps one reason was that the war was so short in comparison to the Civil War, and they could not get organized in the short time available.Another interesting point is that the armed services still used black powder for artillery, and for some older model rifles still in use. Smokeless powder made it harder to find the shooter, where as black powder instantly show the location of firing units. The Spanish had converted to all smokeless powder which was a definite combat advantage. One thing that the army did right was the introduction of machine guns, a Colt machine gun using the same Mauser cartridge used by the Spanish, and the Gatling gun, using the same rifle cartridge used by the Krag rifles used by the US troops. The small number were mentioned several times as being useful to the attacking US troops.The one other issue that should have been addressed much better was medical care. Medical care was a terrible during the Civil War, but the armed services should have learned from that, and reformed the medical establishment during the intervening decades. Infections disease, specifically malaria was rampant in Cuba. Virtually everyone other than Roosevelt caught malaria, and then had periodic bouts of high fever, etc. Malaria absolutely debilitated that army in Cuba. The medical establishment and the army command did not have a plan of what to do about the inevitable malaria that struck almost all of the troops with time. It is a good thing that the battles occurred soon after landing in Cuba, and before all of the troops were debilitated by malaria. Unfortunately, after the combat was over, and malaria really began to wreck havoc, the army did not immediately pull out the affected troops. It is fortunate that Roosevelt was there, and not regular army, and willing to agitate and write a letter to army command about the terrible conditions. The senior officers then got together an complained which resulted in all of the troops being rapidly moved back to the"},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"As with anything writen by Mr. Roosevelt, this book is enjoyable to read.

He also knows his way around the English language so this book does not disappoint in the delivery. I have read his gripping account of an ill-fated Amazonian adventure which was gritty, exciting, and well worthy of a book. This really is none of these.What we basically have here is a personal TR reminiscence of a minor war fought in Cuba where much of the text is devoted to blatantly glorifying what he considered the superb quality of his hand-selected forces, at the same time elevating a couple of routine battles, which constituted the whole war, into rousing, full-blooded, heavy military engagements. I would estimate the losses on both sides probably numbered in the hundreds, rather than thousands.It's a short book where all his recruits are described constantly as either gallant, zealous or valiant. The Spanish never stood a chance. The last quarter of the book consists of a number of whinging, complaining, letters that Roosevelt sent to the authorities afterwards complaining, rightfully, of the almost complete lack of logistical support provided for the troops engaged in this endeavour. He also takes time out to eloquently put right what he considered an inaccurate battle accounts from other sources that did not coincide with his own version. He is a terrible nit-picker.Another disappointment for me were a number of jibes at the inferiority of the coloured troops encountered by the \\"Rough Riders.\\" Example: \\".. coloured troops were peculiarly dependant on their white officers.... occasionally they produce an NCO who can take the initiative... exactly like the best class of whites, but this cannot be expected normally, nor is it fair to expect it.\\" Really! He even describes how he single-handedly prevented some coloured troops from leaving the front line and threatened to personally shoot any offenders who moved to the rear. Have to say though that some other \\"coloured\\" troops do receive praise from TR.For me, there isn't enough here for a book and some of Teddy's biases, both for his own Rough Riders and against other parties concerned, I found pompous and irritating.

The book's title comes from the nickname earned by the unit. The copyright page notes that the text was originally published in 1899. TR tells about the recruitment and training of the Rough Riders, their voyage to Cuba, their battles, and their return home.Much of the book concerns what, in TR's opinion, makes for good soldiers and good leaders. Although the book first appeared over a century ago, I found many of TR's observations startlingly relevant to contemporary warfare; he discusses wartime refugees, guerrilla warfare, wartime atrocities, and battlefield news correspondents. Other topics covered include illness among the troops and the impact of weather and terrain on warfare. He also discusses occasional humorous material, such as the nicknames some soldiers earned.Roosevelt includes fascinating technical details about the weapons of this era. Although he frankly discusses the violence, wounds, and deaths of the battlefield, overall I got a sense that TR saw the war as a grand adventure-even fun on a certain level. The writing style is very engaging and has a clear, matter-of-fact quality. TR's admiration and love for his troops ultimately gives the book a real warmth and humanity. This is truly a landmark in the rich canon of American military memoirs."},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"This was Teddy Roosevelt's account of his beloved Rough Riders and how they and him, virtually won the war in Cuba single-handed during the Spanish American War. I personally thought the book was well written, very informative about the character of the war, problems and individuals that make up the Rough Riders and Roosevelt's own take on the war. I am pretty sure that Teddy didn't write this book just for history. He had politics in mind when he wrote it and he made sure that he was at the center of the universe in his own book. Actually, there isn't nothing wrong with that since the book reads well and Roosevelt was generous with his praises toward many people. Teddy was also quite insightful in his observations of the way our military campaign in Cuba was being handled. It was clear that he did care a lot about his men and took his responsiblity seriously. A good reading material on the Spanish American War even with the pro-Teddy bias, you can't help but to be entertained by it."},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"My comments are based on the 1997 hardback version of this book.The following may have been corrected in the 2000 paperback.Richard Bak collected many photographs of the Rough Riders to illustrate Roosevelt's text, and this is good. However, he wasn't very careful with his captions.For example, the photograph leading off Chapter One &quot;Raising the Regiment&quot; is captioned &quot;Colonel Wood and Roosevelt in Texas. Roosevelt's paunch would disappear in Cuba after he lost twenty pounds in the tropical heat.&quot; However, other photographs of Roosevelt at this time do not show a paunchy man. Also, both he and Wood seem younger than the men in this photo.Later in this chapter, there is a photograph again showing the an identified as Wood, captioned &quot;Colonel Leonard Wood (second from right)...&quot;In the background of this photograph, there is an automobile (looking closer in style to a Model A than a Model T), and the other three men in the photograph are dressed in Army uniforms from the 1920s.The conclusion is that these men are NOT Roosevelt and Wood, but the actors who played them in the 1927 silent movie about the Rough Riders that was filmed in San Antonio with the assistance of the US Army's Second Division stationed at Fort Sam Houston.In the section &quot;The Mystery of the Maine,&quot; the photograph identified as the Maine is not the Maine that blew up in Havana Harbor, which only had two smoke stacks. This is probably the later World War I Maine.So, Roosevelt's text is good. The collection of photographs are good. But verify those captions and the conslusions based upon them."},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"This book tells the tale of the ten-week Spanish American War of 1898 from the perspective of one of its heroes. Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919) wanted to intervene in Cuba and drive the Spanish out of the \\"western world.\\" When the American ship Maine was bombed (we don't know by whom, and Roosevelt does not discuss the issue), America had the excuse it was seeking. It went to war, won, and Spain lost its hold in the American area and disintegrated into a weak nation. Roosevelt writes modestly. He doesn't exalt himself in his book. He repeatedly extols his Rough Riders, about a thousand volunteers, half of whom fought in Cuba with him alongside the US regular army, as a separate regiment. Many of these volunteers were cowboys, hunters, marshals, sheriffs, and some college graduates.Roosevelt, later president of the US, was at the time, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. He was offered the position of colonel of the Rough Riders, but suggested that his friend Leonard Wood, who had past military experience, be given the job. Wood later became a general and is remembered today by having an army fort named for him. Roosevelt was the lieutenant colonel and later colonel when Wood was promoted. Roosevelt tells how he trained the Rough Riders, many of whom were accustomed to fighting in the wild west, to fight as a unified team. They trained in San Antonio, the home of the famed Alamo.He tells of the confusions and lack of communications as only half of his unit was able to sail to Cuba. He states that it took six days to cruise from Florida to Cuba. He describes the problems of insufficient boats and of getting his men ashore. He speaks of the courage of his men, how they endured near starvation, and how they acted with dignity. He describes the confusions of the battles, the inability to tell enemy from friend. He tells of the heroism of the black unit, a unit that was segregated from whites, but performed at least as well.He speaks about the most famous of the ten-day battles, the battle of San Juan Hill. There were 6,600 Americans against 4,500 Spanish. The Americans killed or wounded totaled 1,071. Roosevelt became famous for leading the charge up this hill. He was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Many of the Americans became sick in the Cuban climate. The US government didn't bring their soldiers home after the war until Roosevelt and others sent strong objections. Many soldiers returned finding no job. This book was written over a century ago, but it is important history and should be read."},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"What impresses me about this book is how it differs from most any other narrative of any war I have read before or since. The battlefields of Cuba take on Homerian proportions in this book. Roosevelt sings the praises of the brave soldiers of his regiment (not least of all, himself) and paints a vivid picture of the harsh (yet glorious) realities of war. Rough Riders is valuable as, more than anything, an example of historical paradigm. It is a perspective on the values of a people and a living example of the way in which war has been viewed as a part of the American experience."},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"American history has been a favorite of mine. This one was informative & well written. As much as I read getting it free was a great bonus."},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"Teddy Roosevelt was one of the most inspiring men in American history for a variety of reasons---and this book captures them all, from politician and military leader to writer and conservationalist.This is a book all schoolchidren should read...so don't expect public education to do so.Anyway, the quotes, stories and background information really open the reader's eyes to what an incredible life -- in so many areas -- this man lived. There are too few like him these days (in any area).I would have given the book five stars, but since it was written recently, there seems to be some \\"updates\\" (or revisionism), which do not always portray America or Teddy in as positive a light as he and WE deserve. Nothing major, but still noticeable."},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"My expectations were high but this is just a poorly written book. About half the narrative is about the characters who joined the Rough Riders. Very little of the book deals with the battles in Cuba and the sections that do make the exploits of the Rough Riders seem grossly over rated. Roosevelt seems to write withh the intent on securing his place in history. And, if that wasn't enough, he includes self-serving appendices that laud his conduct on the battlefield and support his yearning for the medal of honor. I found his writing style tedious and often repetitious--you'll encounter countless references to the smokeless ammunition used by the Spanish. Enough already!"},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"Great book. Greater man - Teddy Roosevelt! I'm sure men like this exist today - but where are they? I've read about 10 books recently about and by this man.

The references to the heroic people such as Teddy Roosevelt, Clara Barton, President Wilson were fantastic. I didn't like the repetition of the various characters..for example the characters are always descriptively titled and this is unnecessary."},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"Theodore Roosevelt spends to much of the book in praise of his men, the actual battles are done very well. An editor would have been good."},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"WOW... A great american story and extremely well written. This book has changed my life by motivating me to be a better person and citizen. I only wish we had men in elected positions that were half as intelligent and half as concerned for the average american as Teddy. Rough Riders is a must read for any young man trying to find his calling."},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"I had read much about Teddy Roosevelt over the years, he is one of my favorite presidents, but I had never read any thing written by him. This is a well written memoir of his time leading the Rough Riders Brigade during the Spanish-American War. One forgets that he had earned a living earlier in life as an author."},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"Given what I had read about Theodore Roosevelt's tendency to overplay the value of war and turn it into a great adventure, I was pleasantly surprised with the tone of this book. While Roosevelt does occasionally venture into the territory of describing the actions of the regiment known as \\"The Rough Riders\\" in the Spanish-American War as a romantic great adventure, in general he is factual. He is repeatedly critical of the governmental management of the war, which was abysmal. The troops often went without supplies, at several points; Roosevelt describes how he used his own money to buy food stocks for the men in his regiment.Disease and other deprivations were also common; there were no shelters, few blankets and the travel accommodations were awful. There was little in the way of hospital facilities, the sick and wounded received almost no treatment.In spite of all this, there is no question that the men of the Rough Riders regiment acted very bravely, almost foolishly so. Roosevelt talks about how the men often walked out in full view of the enemy, taking a very nonchalant attitude regarding the likelihood of the Spanish troops shooting them. Some paid for their foolishness with their lives. Roosevelt describes how he ordered them to create a vast series of trenches and other fortifications, so that the soldiers could rest easy. In many ways, it was a preview of the more extensive structures created in the Great War that was to engulf Europe less than two decades later.This is not a history of the Spanish-American war and there is nothing about the reasons or justifications for it. It is simply a recapitulation of the actions of the regiment that Roosevelt commanded during that brief war that made the United States a colonial and world power."},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"I guess I'm about average when it comes to a knowledge of Theodore Roosevelt, and I feel like I ought to know more. This book helps a little, but not much. I was disappointed that there is little here about\\"the Battle for San Juan Hill\\" which is TR's most famous exploit of that war. It is mostly a swell 19th century recounting of the valor of his troops, and a detailed explanation of troop movements and the difficulties of getting his men into battle and maneuvering them when fighting. The prose is flat and, I guess, a measure of TR's modesty at that point in his life. As a first-person account it is must reading for anyone interested in the life of TR, and of the Spanish American War. It's an easy read, best accomplished with a glass of brandy before a fire in an easy chair. Anybody got a suggestion for a good biography of Theodore Roosevelt?-p. weselboston, masachusetts"},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"People might want to study Teddy Roosevelt prior to reading this book. It's a lot shorter than I thought it would be. There are very few photographs, no maps or graphics to support Teddy's report of his Rough Rider Volunteers attack on Cuba in 1898. Fast read...three days if you have some time."},{"Title":"The Rough Riders,","review":"If you liked the movie the ROUGH RIDERS starring Tom Berringer at \\"TR\\", you will enjoy this book. It was apparent that Berringer and crew did their homework as many parts of the movie are found in the book almost word-for-word.

I hope his next book will be better."},{"Title":"Ticket Home","review":"This book had all the ingredients of a good story well told. I found it to be neither. The writing is clumbsy and the characters are cliche's, and so is the plot. The &quot;BIG Secret&quot; isn't at all hard to figure out. Let's see we have identical twins in love with the same girl who go off to war and only one comes home...I bet you can figure out the big secret just from that syopsis."},{"Title":"Ticket Home","review":"THIS WAS SO UNLIKE HIS OTHER BOOKS. VERY LITTLE ROMANCE, LOTS OF WAR. I PERSONALLY DO NOT LIKE WAR BOOKS, AND I SKIPPED THROUGH THE WHOLE MIDDLE (I DIDN'T MISS MUCH). I HOPE HIS NEXT BOOK IS BETTER."},{"Title":"Ticket Home","review":"Ticket Home is one of the best books that I have read. The author, James Pratt, plots out the story extremely well. This book is a mixture of romance and action. The book takes place during the rise of World War Two in the fight against Hitler and the Japanese. The main characters are two twin brothers who are very alike in appearance but even more different in personalities. They both work with their father at their family owned train station.One of the most important events in this book is when these two brothers fall in love with the same woman. When one of the boys actually takes the girl's hand in marriage the other feels betrayed and torn because his love for the girl was immense. Right after the wedding the boys (who have joined the Mexican National Guard) are sent away to the Philippines. It is while they are there that America joins into the war because of Pearl Harbor. The brothers are thrown into a fight that will change their lives forever.Although the war helps the broken hearted brother get rid of his anger it also takes away his innocence and it eats away at his naturally kind heart. The war does however bring the brothers close together and many times they save each others lives. For the first time in their lives they see what war actually is and they suffer together as they strive to survive.This book is a book of sadness. It uncovers the pain of war and also the pain of losing someone that you love. It covers things that all mankind suffers with. We have all been betrayed at one time or other by someone we think we can trust. We have all gone through the trials of love. Most importantly though we must all realize that in these dark times are lessons of life that we must learn. Learn from the mistakes of the past. Learn to forgive and not to fight. These are the things that war tends to teach.This book is excellent and very thought provoking. I hope that I have inspired someone to read it. The lessons packed inside of it are something that nobody should want to miss."},{"Title":"Ticket Home","review":"I have read the other books by James Michael Pratt, &quot;The Last Valentine&quot; and &quot;The Lighthouse Keeper&quot; and really enjoyed them. I should have known that &quot;Ticket Home&quot; would bring me to tears since the others did, but somehow I was not prepared for them at all.Although this is a work of fiction, it is a great story of WWII, and the Bataan Death March. Mr. Pratt has done a great job with his research on this book (as well as his others) and the story was very credible because of it.There is so much I could say about this book, but I don't want to give it away. It is a wonderful story of love and deception that had me not wanting to put the book down!"},{"Title":"Ticket Home","review":"I was browsing in a small book shop, looking for something by a gifted storyteller. Ticket Home fulfilled my wish. Pratt is a skillful writer who lets the story develop his characters. All of the characters were just right. In the end, I found myself caring about these people.Ticket Home is a novel that should be read in the light of a warm fire with classical music playing and a kitten sleeping on your lap. It's a romance written for men who are not afraid of their emotions."},{"Title":"Ticket Home","review":"Ticket Home is a wonderfully written book. James Pratt's talent for drawing his readers into the story is remarkable.

I have given the book to people who have just lost a loved one, but I've given it also to those who are dealing with other losses. And it works. Father Joe's words are far-reaching, and he writes with such warmth and obvious love-both for God and for the rest of us-that he touches the heart. Although he centers on death as being the most devastating and universal experience, he does touch on other losses.Father Joe writes that we-who we are, how we live-are totally intertwined with God. He relates our reactions to His love-that what we do is always a reaction to how we perceive God's love. We each will grieve, no one in the same way as another, and Father Joe teaches us that our grieving is our response.The book is also practical. Father Joe not only gives us a lot to think about, he lays out concrete rituals that can help both individuals and groups, whether children, young adults or adults. In teaching, I've learned that ritual is important, as it physically ties us to our spiritual journey. I've used several of these rituals in my classes, and the response from the children is often relief, because the prayer services give them a context to voice their feelings, as well as permission to cry out, to ask why, and just to cry."},{"Title":"No One Cries the Wrong Way: Seeing God Through Tears","review":"Father Joe Kempft writes beautifully! He has a very unique and deep understanding of human suffering. His book helped me tremendously when my mother died. During those dark days, this book answered my questions and helped me to develop a better relationship with God. The pain did not go away, but this book gave me a new perspective. It helped me to see God's light in the middle of my darkess hours. I had given many copies of this book to many of my friends (and High School students) who have lost loved ones. This book has a very special place in my heart."},{"Title":"No One Cries the Wrong Way: Seeing God Through Tears","review":"Fr. Joe Kempf offers a very complete guide to understanding how we can cope with grief after a loss. I especially appreciate the chapter on suffering. He says, God's will is for us to be like him. And living loving lives is how we do that. God does not will us to suffer. The suffering we experience is caused by human choices and when it's a case of natural disaster God does not interfere because he has chosen to allow us the free will in all things. You will have to read the book to find out more. He communicates in simple and accessible language. Fr. Joe Kempf is excellent with teaching children about faith. His other books of prayers for children (My Sister is Annoying and You Want Me to Be Good All Day) are funny and made for kids."},{"Title":"No One Cries the Wrong Way: Seeing God Through Tears","review":"Father Joe Kempf's book NO ONE CRIES THRE WRONG WAY was the inspiration and the basic text for beginning our parish bereavement group.

This book is a valuable resoure for any bereavement program."},{"Title":"Job (Tyndale Old Testament Commentary Series)","review":"This commentary is not the best for a verse-by-verse analysis of the text (it's not that long) but Anderson provides an excellent overview of the Book of Job that does a good job of appreciating the unmatched nature of this monumental work. The overview also deals concisely with most of the critical controversies that have arisen. The commentary frankly acknowledges a Christian woldview, but still argues from a standard, scholarly perspective. Anderson writes well, but the writing is at a scholarly level and uses quite a few two-dollar words, so I had to make a few runs to the dictionary (not a bad thing, really). For me, this commentary has enhanced my understanding of the Book of Job as a magnificent literary achievement, while also encouraging my faith.

But after reading other tomes on the subject, I can tell you that this little gem has more insight than all the rest combined.Anderson knows Job personally. He probes with insight into Job's suffering, but also Job's feeling as he suffers. The author carefully and beautifully traces Job's deepest grief throughout the trial--his estrangement from His dearest Friend--God.I have found myself quoting Anderson often in teaching this book. The beautiful and masterful way the author picks up on the keenest of insights leaves the reader sure--this man understands this book....well.If you can only use one book to study Job, you found it."},{"Title":"Job (Tyndale Old Testament Commentary Series)","review":"My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful.

I was impressed by how fast he got his ducks in a row to dissolve the fictitious life his former mistress was made to believe was hers. When he went against the doctor's recommendation and made love to the heroine, all memories came painfully flooding back.

Anyway, I took out .25 star because I felt the hero got off a little too lightly considering the heroine was totally blameless and she suffered a lot. Grrrr...

Starting out at the Beggar's Bush Restaurant above Campuhan Bridge (home of Mason's Bali Bird Club), he hikes with you through the cultivated rice fields to see otters, civets, macaques, egrets, kingfishers, lychee and tamarind trees, white Brahmin cattle in Taro, giant banyan trees, butterflies, and clove and vanilla plantations. Mason gives you a friendly, conversational, step-by-step tour-from ravine to ridge to individual hibiscus blossom-complete with historical and cultural commentary on the terrain, temples, monuments, and countryside that he knows so well and loves so much.Having spent the last twenty-six years on Bali, Victor Mason meticulously covers every cart and goat track within an eight-kilometer radius of foliage-rich Ubud. He will lead you down rocky steps to spring-fed watering places, secret gardens, Gunung Agung (\\"soaring to the ether and wreathed in vaporous wisps\\"), groves of sago palms, swimming in the Ayung River, and into the sacred simian stronghold of the Sangeh monkey forest. He lays out a variety of itineraries, graded according to difficulty, and offers timely tips (travel light, bring a sarong and a sash for entering temples--plus bathers for your swim-and beware the armies of stinging red tree ants!). Bali Bird Walks is designed as a practical, how-to, destination companion: long, thin, and light (8 \\" by 5\\"), the book is shaped for easy insertion into purse or backpack. Lavishly and colorfully illustrated-and buttressed throughout with detailed maps-you cannot lose your way. Most of the self-guided walking tours are circular and will return you to Campuhan Bridge-happy, inspired, and full of Mason's entertaining, old-school British, anecdotal bird stories.For those of you lucky enough to find Victor Mason in residence on the island and available to lead you on one of his tours in person, you can book his \\"Bali Bird Walk\\" through Sobek Tours at 975009 or 287059 (or directly through the staff at the Beggar's Bush Restaurant). The four-hour tours begin at 8:45 A.M. and cost $47 per person including a fresh coconut break and a delicious lunch: intrepid trail guests/budding ornithologists will also be provided with a bird-spotting list and binoculars. For armchair nature enthusiasts who would prefer not to brave bamboo bridges, rushing white waters, and scrambling monkeys face to face, Bali Bird Walks takes your imagination where your feet are not yet willing to tread. The book is a total delight-it puts you right outside in the warm sunshine and brilliant, lime-green young \\"sawah\\" with invaluable Victor Mason right by your side!"},{"Title":"Insight Pocket Guides Bali Bird Walks (1994)","review":"This is a great guide for anyone who had been to Bali years ago and is looking to have an experience that takes you away from the tourist traffic.

In Ringworld, Larry Niven introduced us to the concept of a world made in the shape of an extraordinarily large ring encircling a star. In this book he gives us answers to questions we might not have even asked about the Ringworld, but that others apparently did. After the publication of Ringworld, Niven received numerous pieces of correspondence from people offering helpful information about the details of how the Ringworld would actually function. Niven took inspiration from the enthusiasm of those people and created the Ringworld Engineers in part to publish the answers to important questions about the structure. Around those answers he has created a thoughtful and engaging story that adds in a positive way to the Ringworld legacy.The basic premise behind the Ringworld Engineers is that twenty or so years have passed since Louis Wu and Speaker To Animals returned from the Ringworld. Since then, Louis has withdrawn into a life of ascetic practices livened up by his addiction to current stimulation. Speaker to Animals (who has earned his full name of Chmeee for the treasure he brought back from the original Ringworld adventure) lives a prosperous life on Kzin having earned high status from his Ringworld discoveries. The circumstance that brings Louis and Chmeee back to the Ringworld is one quite familiar to them, but the situation they face upon arriving on the Ringworld is quite different than when they left. The Ringworld is moving out of position around the sun and the only way for Louis and Chmeee to find out how to fix it lies with the origins of the Ringworld Engineers.I found the Ringworld Engineers to be engaging and interesting wholely apart from the original Ringworld. While certainly the references to parts of the original book are made more clear having read that novel, this book is very readable even having read Ringworld many years before. Having said that, I would advise that it is a good idea to read Ringworld first as there are certainly items of that book which are spoiled herein.The way that Niven engages parts of his other novels of Known Space and entertwines them with this book made me want to go give some of those a shot as well. He truly is a master storyteller and this is one of his best novels on his own. Niven's collaborations with author Jerry Pournelle are also highly recommended. The classic The Mote In God's Eye as well as Footfall and Lucifer's Hammer are all very well done and certainly are must read novels for any Niven fan."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"What most people seem to have forgotten is that the Ringworld books (Ringworld, R.E., R.Thr.) aren't the only books in the series. ALL of the Known Space books must be taken as a whole. For instance, it's impossible to fully comprhend Ringworld E. without having read &quot;Protector.&quot; All the known space books link together, PLUA the short stories. I suggest reading them all in chronological order and putting the pieces together yourselves. Sure, it will require more trips to the library, but, hey, whoever said life was easy?"},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"I read this in a couple of days just because I had nothing else to do. I enjoyed it, but I enjoyed Ringworld more. The ending was wrapped up pretty quickly, like Niven was tired of writing about the Ringworld and just wanted to get it over with. That's not necessarily a bad thing, because I was tired of reading about the Ringworld at this point. I should have put a buffer between Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers by reading another book, perhaps something from the Ender Wiggin series. I still recommend Ringworld Engineers if you enjoyed Ringworld as it answers numerous questions you may or may not have had. After reading Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers, I think I'm going to pick up a few more novels by Niven."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"Ringworld Engineers is one of the best Sci Fi books I've ever read. It greatly expands on its predecessor, filling in gaps and solving the mysteries of the first book. 23 years after escaping the Ringworld, Louis and Speaker-to-Animals are kidnapped and brought back. Their captor--a deposed Pupeteer leader--is searching for vital technology and secrets that will impress his people and reinstate himself. However, the Ring is falling towards its sun and will soon be destroyed. Thus, Louis and Speaker (now called Chmeee) must find a way to free themselves before the inevitable collision.As the two travel across the Ring they uncover secrets and origins that could possibly save them--or destroy them. The story is a race against time to uncover the ultimate secrets never revealed in the first book. Despite the protests of a few hardcore Niven fans, most Sci Fi readers I have talked with highly recommend this book, as do I. Together with the original, Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers comprise one of the most compelling, original works of fiction that I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"This is money well spent. I enjoyed this novel and spent nearly a whole night reading it in one sitting. I will never tire of Larry Niven when he sticks to Known Space, the best of his fiction areas. I like the Pupperteers, the Kzin, and Pac. Larry delivers a nearly perfect end to the Ringworld series. I have had personal conversations with him back in 1983 and he never intended to make more Known Space books. Note, you should read this novel before reading &quot;Ringworld's Children&quot;, due out in Summer of 2004. Enjoy it, I did!"},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"Ringworld is a fantastic work, which unfortunately ended with many questions unanswered.Although this work does answer many questions, such as who created the ringworld, their intentions, and how the world was created, unfortunately I was disappointed with the methods used to arrive at the conclusions.The brings back Luis Wu and Speaker to Animals (renamed Chmee), while Nefus is replaced by his mate the Hindmost. There aren't any other major characters. The book concentrates on the travels of Wu and Chmee as they hope to unlock the secrets of the ringworld. And this is where the book falls apart.Please refer to the review of Culver. I'm not as familiar with the series as Culver having only read the first book. I'm not a die hard fan. I just wanted a fun read. That's the problem, the book just isn't fun. There aren't any new characters. There really isn't much of a plot.Wu travels from one village to the next. Nivan spends a lot of time discussing the people Wu encounters, but who cares, they ultimately do nothing, and the people don't contribute to the plot.What got on my nerves the most was the ways the mysteries are solved, without really any clues. Wu and Chmee, neither of whom have a background in physics, are suddenly mathematical wizards capable of performing the most complex computations without the aid of a computer. Nivan goes on and on about the mathematics, yet anyone who has any knowledge of astronomy or physics, knows that the plan would never work in real life. So these diatribes of how these silly plans would work are pointless. And guess what? Since's it's Nivan's work, Wu and Chmee are always right!The origin of the Ringworld engineers is arrived at without any evidence. An obvious guess. Yet Wu and Chmee are 100% sure. That got on my nerves. The book was so bad, that I was hoping that the main characters would be eliminated.Since Nivan says in the introduction he never intended to write this sequal, my advice is don't read it. However if you're tying to find out what happens read the first 50 pages. Skip to page 300 and find out how the book finishes. If you don't understand how Wu and Chmee figured things out or can't follow the logic. Don't worry. There is no logic. Answers are derived w/o evidence. The ending is terrible. I felt like slamming the book in the trash after I finished. And even with an hour long train commute to work it took me over a month to finish the book.Ok here's a summary of why this book fails;1. No new characters; existing characters all have the same personality; and are legendary physcists.2. Countless boring sex scenes.3. Lack of a well defined plot.4. A bland boring ending which goes completely against the plot.5. Overall; boring read. Story goes nowhere.Grade: F."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"I have rarely come across a sequel that continues a story as well as this. It's advisable to read &quot;Ringworld&quot; first, otherwise this won't make all that much sense. Once you've done that and want more, read this. You'll probably have a difficult time discerning between the two books afterwards, because they complement each other very well. The story revolves around Louis Wu and his alien friend (or foe?), the kzin formerly known as Speaker-To-Animals. The Puppeteers (an extremely paranoid alien species) manage to get the two on board a spaceship heading for a second rendezvous with the mysterious Ringworld, a huge habitable &quot;circular ribbon in space&quot;.

In it, Larry Niven succeeds in reconcilling some of the apparent inconsistencies between the Ringworld books and his other Known Space novels (by demonstrating that the Ringworld was built by the Pak protectors), and incorporates the ideas and questions of his fans (spillpipes, attitude jets, and defense system) into the operation of the Ringworld, while at the same time telling an exciting, and fast moving story. That he manages all three so flawlessly is surely a sign of his genius as a writer.Louis Wu and Speaker to Animals (now known as Chmee) are kidnapped by the Hindmost (puppeteer mate of Nessus from the preious book) and brought to the Ringworld again to steal a technology from it that will ensure the security of Hindmost's political faction on the puppeteer world. Louis Wu, however, ends up stranded alone with little but his wits in the middle of the Ringworld, with no-one but the Ringworld natives to turn to for help.

Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but only a slight one. There is a plot, but it's strung together and ultimately overshadowed by Louis running from place to place in order to have sex with aliens.Disappointing and somewhat sad to see an author run his most well-known creation into the ground like this, presumably just to make a few extra bucks. This is one of those cases where it would have been better to just leave the original to stand alone."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"The first novel was fun - the exploration of a new world, an introduction to new characters in Niven's 'Known Universe'. But this time around, it's a whole lot of two-dimensional characters sitting around discussing theoretical science and (like another customer review pointed out ) leaping to astounding conclusions. Armchair science in the form of an uninvolving novel. And if I never read about 'risathra' again, it'll be too soon..."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"Exellent follow up to Ringworld.

The Characters are _STILL_ inanimate, the dialogue _STILL_ horrible and plot developments _STILL_ mysterious.While reading Ringworld Engineers I felt left out of the story, quite an odd experience while reading a book. Louis Wu and his 'pals' would constanly leap to conclusions (which were invariably correct) based on literally, almost nothing. I almost feel that Niven knew the story but didnt want to tell it, he'd rather us read 200 pages of bad interaction then suddenly spring a left-field 'conclusion' on us.The 'aliens' were nothing more then oddly shaped/colored humans, bad ones at that, and the 'technical' details on ringworld he added seemed out-of-place, almost as if someone gave him a scientific fact-sheet and he incorperated those facts just to validate himself..I still wonder what I'm missing, why are these niven books such classics? There are other storys (written in the same era) that blow ringworld away technically and through sheer originality. maybe I've been spoiled by such stories.Anyway I've said it before, and I'll say it again, Read John Varley's Titan Trilogy (Titan, Wizard, Demon) for what ringworld COULD'VE been.email comments appreciated."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"This the second on a series of three books.

I read it. It was OK. It was not very good. It, also, is not, totally, consistent with \\"Ringworld\\". It gets boring, very boring. It, also, has much too much sex and the main characters are less than admirable. However, Niven is a good SF writer and there are some good spots.I think my three stars are a gift for this book. However, Larry Niven may be the best SF writer who is still contributing to SF.So, go to your library and try to find this book and read it. I still have my copy. So, I guess I felt it was worth buying. But, read before buying."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"Should you read The Ringworld Engineers? Absolutely. But I caution to put some distance between Ringworld and it's sequel. The latter book was written a decade after Ringworld, and Niven backpeddled on some of his best concepts and characters. Why the book is fascinating, and a good sequel, a little time to appreciate the first book in innocence is a good thing!"},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"Larry Niven never intended to write a sequel to his 1970 Hugo and Nebula award-winning novel RINGWORLD, but science fiction fans were so enthralled by the Niven's concept of a ring-shaped world 93 million times the size of the Earth that Niven felt compelled to give the fans more. Unfortunately, THE RINGWORLD ENGINEERS is one of Niven's poorest works, and it is bad enough to tarnish the excellent first book.THE RINGWORLD ENGINEERS opens 23 years after the end of RINGWORLD. Louis Wu has become a wirehead, an addict to current fed directly into the pleasure center of the brain, and is living a pathetic life in the frontier world Canyon. He is kidnapped by The Hindmost, the deposed puppeteer supreme leader, along with Speaker-to-Animals, who is now a noble called Chmee. The Hindmost takes them back to the Ringworld, hoping to find the transmutation device that was spoken of during the first time on the Ringworld and so impress the Fleet of Worlds that they will accept him as ruler again. When they arrive, however, they discover that the Ringworld is unstable and will impact the sun in a year's time...Larry Niven spends a lot of time detailing the various species of hominids on the Ringworld, and this is where the book falls apart. The hominids cannot reproduce except within their own species, and rishathra, or risk-free sex between species but within the hominids, is used to seal contracts and express friendly intentions.Niven is so obsessed with this concept that the introduction of every new town is an excuse for Louis Wu to engage in graphic sex. The plot of THE RINGWORLD ENGINEERS exists essentially to string sex scenes together.THE RINGWORLD ENGINEERS also fails because it contradicts much of Niven's previous Known Space work, especially the novels RINGWORLD and PROTECTOR. In the initial part of the book Niven, wanting to settle the issue, just says \\"Well, the Pak created the Ringworld\\" even though this goes against the Known Space setup that Niven spent fifteen years building.Finally, a great deal of the novel simple isn't Niven's work. In the introduction he states that most of the ideas were contributed by readers. As a result, he has cobbled together some truly terrible ideas sent in by fans that don't bear much resemblance to the quality Known Space works of the late 1960's.THE RINGWORLD ENGINEERS is a terrible book.While not as bad as the execrable third volume in the Ringworld series, THE RINGWORLD THRONE, it is bad enough to taint one's memories of the first book, which was well-written and introduced some fascinating concepts. Unfortunately, readers who read the RINGWORLD often feel compelled to move on to the sequels. Take my advice, however, and avoid THE RINGWORLD ENGINEERS."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"Luis Wu, 20 years from his glorious exploration of the ringworld, is a recovering wire head. He is kidnapped along with Speaker-To-Animals (now known as Chmee) the Kzin, enslaved to help search the ringworld for riches and technology. When they arrive, they find that the ringworld is off-balance and falling toward its sun. They embark on a journey to satiate the avarice of another puppeteer, and also attempt to save/repair the ringworld in the process. But neither humans nor kzin make good slaves.This was a great sequel to Ringworld! With more fun technology mixed with fantastic evolutionary possibilities. They meet giants, sea people, vampires, ghouls, and many variations of hominid types. I love the way Niven allows for a large mix of anything between extremely intelligent to mostly instinctive species."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"Larry Niven's Ringworld is certainly a classic of sci-fi (as is most of the early Known Space material) by virtually anyone's definition. Louis Wu and his companions return to the Ringworld in this sequel. Compared to the original, this followup novel can only be regarded as a disappointment. Louis Wu has become an addict. Specifically, he is addicted to a machine that stimulates the pleasure centers of his brain and spend days/weeks/months continuously under its influence. He is not a happy camper when he and Speaker to Animals is kidnapped and taken to the Ringworld by a Pierson's puppeteer. The puppeteer wishes to acquire some valuable technology from the Ringworld and wants to use Wu's and his companion's knowledge to find it. Upon arrival at the Ringworld, they realize that it is no longer stable and that if something isn't done it will crash into the star that it orbits within a few years.There's certainly a lot to like about this novel. Niven certainly knows a fair bit of physics, and he seamlessly weaves this knowledge into his story to give the whole Ringworld an aura of plausibility and level of detail unmatched by anyone not named Arthur C. Clarke. Louis Wu has his share of human weaknesses and is, in some ways, not a very likable main character. Niven also creates an interesting dynamic between the three main characters during the first half or so of the novel. None of the three trust each other, but they all need each other if they are going to get what they want (which is largely mutually exclusive of the others!) and survive. There is also the mystery of Ringworld hanging over the whole story: who built the Ringworld? Why? Can it be saved? Should it be saved?There are several serious weaknesses in this novel that prevent it from rising to more than a middlin' work in my view. First, and most importantly, the justification for large parts of the story is weakly wound together at best. The characters easily transition from deeply mistrusting each other to working together for the common good at the drop of a hat. Louis Wu rapidly transitions from junkie to worldsaver. I get the sense that Niven had a plan for the story in his mind and tried to shoe-horn everything into this idea. He really needed to step back a bit and put the big picture into perspective. Second, I have to agree with some of the other negative reviews about \`risathra'. Niven seems obsessed with the idea of sex between infertile hominid species and spends large tracts of the text on this. I don't see how this advances the story in any way. I'm not interested in speculations as to how to different hominid species might have sex. Third, there really isn't a log \`new' in this novel, it really ties together the previous Ringworld novel and several of the other Known Space tales. It is \`more of the same'. Each of the early Known Space works was uniquely interesting and different, even if they were tied together with a common thread. The Ringworld Engineers has more of the common thread and less of the uniquely interesting and different.Bottom line - this is a decent novel, but probably a worthwhile read only for serious LN/Known Space fans. A step below his earlier works."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"Granted, I couldn't put it down, but that's just how I am when I want to know the answer to something.

Its hard to explain why but its not a good idea to read this directly after the first book. That aside it is fantastic and expands on the first book dramatically, although it is a little confusing."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"Now that the 'Ringworld' series has been completed (unless it is one day expanded beyond the current tetralogy -who knows?), one of the most commonly accepted views among critics is that all three sequels to the original novel totally failed to capitalise on the most enticing premise of the original.In the first novel, the dazzlingly seductive artefact that is the Ringworld was billed, more or less, as 'big enough for anything to happen' within its enormous cast.But...what exactly does happen? In this first sequel, not that much -and what does occur does so in fits and starts.The characters are presented with two objectives: nobly, they must prevent a catastrophe that threatens to destroy the Ringworld itself; less nobly, they have to pinch an item of unique technology that may salvage the career of their alien paymaster.Admittedly, boxes are duly checked: much is revealed about the Ringworld design (there is even a sort of generic diagram at the beginning), its structure and ecology; its creators are identified, and dastardly deeds by 'allies' revealed. The first objective is also achieved, albeit at enormous environmental cost to the Ring's native inhabitants.However, the narrative that links these events is peculiarly reminiscent of the trials faced by the hapless King Arthur in the Monty Python imagining of the quest for the Holy Grail. Fortunately, we are spared encounters with 'hominids who say...NI!!!' -but not by much. Even native sub-groups who are helpful to the adventurers exist only to point out more improbable difficulties in their path.On the whole, it is easily readable and a decent story, but no more. Given the possibilities implied by first novel, and the scale of its conception, it seems decidedly parochial.The Ringworld is a beautiful (if flawed) idea: a despoiled yet beckoning alien world that haunts you long after reading the original story. It deserves a better future!"},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"I went to the library looking for Niven's Ringworld book and was disappointed to find that they didn't have it.

It was amazing and I couldn't put it down! It makes me wish I'd heard about the Ringworld books earlier, and the rest of this series by Larry Niven.If you are reading this review, then it means you are at least interested.

This book tells to story of the return of Henry Wu and an alien party to that awesome structure, the artificial ring that encircles a sun, not too far away from Sol.Niven tells a classic scifi story here, the story of a mystery, a quest and a great danger to untold number of beings. Slowly but surely, the pieces of the mystery start falling into place and does a solution to the probelm facing Wu, a solution that may be more horrendous than the problem itself.I don't want to give the plot away so I'll just concentrate on some of the elements I liked the most. First of all, the quest. Taking a starship, crewing it with human and alien crew members who don't always get along - the stuff of legends. The few battles are intersting and well thought off. And of course, the whole idea of luck as a trait that can be increased by selective breeding is facinating.This is a great book to read, just in the right order after Ringworld."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"This book was written a decade after the original Ringworld.

The size of the Ringworld and the lack of hostile environments allow this to take place. What's more, Louis has been humbled by his addiction and is no longer arrogant and condescending. He now takes honor and ethics seriously and is open to what the Ringworld has to teach him.If Niven had rewritten RINGWORLD and put these ideas in it, he would have had a masterpiece. Instead we have two books which are both flawed but are quite impressive when you put them together.The flaws in RINGWORLD ENGINEERS?The Hindmost is nowhere near as interesting as Nessus was; he's just a paranoid villain with no likeable touches.Chmeee/Speaker-to-Animals regresses from the nobility he showed at the end of Ringworld, dumping Louis in a desert after a minor disagreement. After that he basically disappears from the story, and good riddance.Niven never explains how the \\"lucky\\" Teela from RINGWORLD came to a tragic end (he sort of explains it two novels later).As in RINGWORLD, Niven loses interest just when you expect him to spring a fascinating solution. The heroes travel through the alien headquarters, full of advanced technology, and we are told nothing about what they saw, even though it's been their target for most of the novel. Sir Arthur Clarke wrote a whole novel on this situation!I think the vignettes of the various human species are fascinating (and much better than the stereotypical \\"natives\\" in RINGWORLD) but they impede the forward drive of the novel. Likewise the tiresome sex scenes -- I just skipped over them, but that meant losing connection with the story.So basically for these two novels, the pair is greater than the sum of the parts."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"As a followup to Ringworld, which I enjoyed, this book was disappointing.While he discusses at length descriptions of futuristic technology, Niven cleverly obscures any working detail about the technologies which help make it appear as \\"timeless\\", but the age of the story still seems obvious.Sort of like watching old StarTrek episodes.I had a difficult time buying into the character development in the first book and this book is even more bizarre.I enjoy science fiction but this story just wasn't fun for me."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"Having loved Ringworld, and also read Engineers, Throne, and Children, I believe this is the only one that is worthy of being associated with the original. It expands on the original story and helps answer questions left in the original without too much filler material (see Throne for copious amounts).I would recommend reading Ringworld, Engineers, then stopping. Look for Protector if you'd like to get more information about the Pak."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"I have always liked Larry Niven, and find a lot of his work fun and entertaining to read. This book was no exception as the ring world is something that would be personally fun to explore, much like finding a dyson sphere to go along with it, but if there is not enough material to make one, then a ring world is your next best thing, and this book does not disappoint from any viewpoint. This was one of those stay up all night reading books.The book moves the two main characters 20 years into the future from the original book, ring world, where Louis Wu has become an addict to an electrical stimulation system, and Speaker to Animals has prospered and earned his full kazin name. What is cool about the book is not just how both the main characters revert back to how they acted in ring world to a great extent, but how the story spends more time describing the characters, peoples and customs of the folks who live on ring world. Even the puppeteer is authentic in how he acts/reacts to the events happening in the story line. You also find out what happened to Teela Brown in this story, and not to do a spoiler, it is interesting to find out how niven ties all these elements together into a very fascinating book.Rated this book five of five stars, because the story was compelling, it was entertaining, and it was interesting to go back and revisit the characters 20 \\"book years\\" after the original ring world."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"The original and informal trilogy that began with Protector ends here. There's a fair bit more character development here than in Ringworld. I remember not liking this book as much as Ringworld, and now the tables are turned, which does I guess reflect that change in reading tastes. The whole trilogy is worth reading for scifi fans, as some pretty interesting ideas are present (evolution, life cycles, stellar engineering, superconductivity...just to name a few), and it is easy reading as well."},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"This the second on a series of three books. I do recommend you read Ringworld first. The main Character, Louis Wu, has been located and dissuaded by the ancient race of Piersons Puppeteers into returning to the Ringworld. But when they do, they discover someone has been altering the ancient order of things.Ringworld was basically a cliffhanger. Ringworld Engineers is an excellent continuation of this story!"},{"Title":"The Ringworld Engineers","review":"Ringworld Engineers sees Louis Wu and his motley crew going back to the ringworld once more, this time with Nessus' mate, the former Hindmost, and Chmeee; formerly Speaker-To-Animals who now owns a full name. Most of the book is devoted to the excellently crafted subspecies of mankind that have developed over the years to fill in biological niches left unoccupied in the Ringworld biosphere. The myriad cultures and technology descriptions are a delight, and though the book ends on a depressing note, it is still a great story."},{"Title":"101 Best Ways to Be Your Best","review":"I picked this book up and literally could not put it down. Michael Angier has a unique perspective and a storyteller's style to make powerful concepts seem basic and unthreatening. In his approach he creates a road anyone can travel to enhance their life. Each chapter is compact with a significant take-away. 101 is powerful and pithy wisdom you can immediately apply to your life. I highly recommend this book for yourself and for anyone you care about."},{"Title":"101 Best Ways to Be Your Best","review":"At last! You have reached the pinnacle of your life. With a bit of luck and a lot of hard work, you have achieved all you set out to do. Now, with a feeling of self contentment, you can comfortably switch to Cruise Control. Congratulations!Should this apply to you, then please, whatever you do, don't read Michael Angier's book. You will find it too disturbing, too challenging and too thought provoking. It's definitely not everyones' cup of tea.Disturbing? Yes - it could well shake you out of any feelings of complancency you may have. In a firm but gentle way at times. Then again, it can also give you a kick in the backside - but only when and if you think you need it.Challenging? Yes - it can make you question some of your long held beliefs and attitudes. It has the power to shatter myths. Every now and then an idea or quote will jump out of the page and hit you between the eyes. \\"Hey, he's writing about me!\\" It has the power to provoke you into taking a course of action - which you perhaps should have done years ago.Thought provoking? Yes - there is more food for thought in this book than you can absorb in one reading. You'll find yourself often going back to the many pages which you've bookmarked. They contain numerous little gems - the ones which you wish you'd read in the early formative years of your life. Not only gems from Michael, who has a wealth of them, but from some of the world's most respected writers, thinkers and achievers. And a few from people who you'd least expect.Michael Angier has three \\"I\\"s - let's look into them:Integrity: You won't find pages of meaningless platitudes or frenzied hype. This book is written from the heart, with a genuine desire to help those who seek to better themselves.Insights: Just one of Michael's observations can set off a whole chain reaction of your own lateral thoughts and create your own valuable insights.Information: Numerous very practical and useable ideas, plus links to many other sources. You may not use or absorb it all, but you can sure take as much as you need of whatever you personally need.Cruise Control? Who, me? Heck no! I was struggling up my self made mountain, stalled and running out of fuel. Have you been there by any chance, along that narrow, bumpy, winding road? Who knows what unseen hand guided me and inspired me to firstly find, then to order Michael's book. Sometimes, what you really need finds you...For me, this book has been a jump-start for both the mind and the soul. Now,I have both the impetus and the fuel to continue my life's journey. Now,I can also enjoy the scenery along the way - with a new, fresh, positive outlook.For me, the greatest value of this book is in the stimulus it can give to anyone who genuinely seeks to be their best. Look at it as a very real, worthwhile and lasting investment in your own future, as it has become in mine."},{"Title":"101 Best Ways to Be Your Best","review":"This is a remarkable compendium of short essays to inspire and motivate you, filled with practical wisdom to make every day more productive. Most of the essays are less than two pages long and after reading the book straight through, I've been re-reading it, one essay every morning. I find Angier's writing casual and very, very practical. His style is up-lifting and exciting. Starting my day with ten minutes to remind myself of my goals, my priorities and my values has at least doubled my productivity.In a world surrounded with \\"bad news\\" in the morning paper and on the television, these little essays remind me of who I really am and what I truly want. His focus on practical steps to build my business, improve my relationships, take care of myself and use my potential have been invaluable. I've bought copies for many of my friends and clients to remind them of what's possible.This is not traditional \\"psych-em-up rah-rah\\" material. Angier writes about doing ordinary things in extraordinary ways to achieve unexpected results every day. I find that extremely helpful. This is one of those little books that truly might change your life. I can easily imagine looking back a year from now and being astonished by what I've accomplished and Angier's daily insights will get much of the credit.Buy and read this little book!"},{"Title":"The Flaming Luau of Death: A Madeline Bean Novel (Madeline Bean Mysteries)","review":"I have enjoyed all of the books in this series, but \\"Flaming Luau\\" was a disappointment. It started out with a great premise - a trip to an exotic locale, a mystery husband - but then it just fizzled. The elements of the mystery did not tie together well, and there were just too many sidelines. The plot reminded me of a hyperactive child, bouncing from one thought to another but not making connections between them.Perhaps the book was just too overloaded with characters and it was difficult to concentrate on what was happening to each one of them. And, in my opinion, there was just too much information about Hawaii. It was a distraction, rather than an addition.It's still a fairly fun read, which is why I gave it three stars. However, my advice is to borrow it from a friend, the library, or wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"The Flaming Luau of Death: A Madeline Bean Novel (Madeline Bean Mysteries)","review":"Madeline and Wes are planning a special party. Their assistant and friend Holly is getting married in two weeks, so they're taking her, her sisters, and her best friend on a surprise bachelorette destination party to the big island of Hawaii. And the best part is, Madeline, Wes, and Holly will finally get to be guests at one of their own parties.But the trouble starts before the plane leaves the ground. Holly just got a threatening e-mail demanding to know the whereabouts of her husband. Seems she's not as single as she said she was, and her high school prom date might be her husband as well. It's a bit hazy. Even so, she has no idea where this guy might be now.Thinking they'll put this tiny problem behind them for the weekend, they board their plane. But when they arrive, they find a man waiting in Holly's room. When the man later turns up dead, Madeline can't help but investigate. After all, she's never been too good at relaxing. Can she solve this mystery before they return to the mainland? Will these events ruin the party?It's no secret that I look forward to each book in this fun series. But when I saw the title, I was extra excited. How could a book with a title like that be anything but fantastic? And it didn't let me down. Even with the change of location, on-going storylines are advanced, just a little slower then normal. As always, the plot is inventive and fun. I dare you to guess where this one leads before the end. And party planner Madeline is a great host, narrating the tale with a breezy style that keeps your attention throughout.A small word of warning. Because of on going storylines, the last couple books are spoiled. This series is best read in order. Believe me, that will be no chore at all.I've already booked my next Mad Bean Event. It can't get here fast enough to make me happy."},{"Title":"The Flaming Luau of Death: A Madeline Bean Novel (Madeline Bean Mysteries)","review":"this series is remarkable for the consistent quality of each book. the plots, the characters, the humor, the clear-eyed observation of life in los angeles (it was never this much fun when i lived there), the cooking, all are first rate. and i really admire them--once i can stop laughing long enough.in this entry, the madness is transported to hawaii. the parties are still over-the-top, the mystery is still unguessable, the plot twists are even twistier and funnier.if you haven't read any of the preceeding novels, i'd say read at least one before this one--a certain amount of familiarity with the characters is assumed. also, having read any of the other novels will make humor even better."},{"Title":"The Flaming Luau of Death: A Madeline Bean Novel (Madeline Bean Mysteries)","review":"Sometimes a book just works, and this is one of them. I can't put my finger on a particular element that dazzled me, but it was simply well-crafted. The characters clearly served narrative purposes, but not annoyingly so. The subject of the mystery wasn't of great interest to me, but Farmer still made it work. And the ending, where all of the characters were gathered in one place and they all went off into the sunset with their own happy endings? Well, yes, that was a bit contrived, but it actually worked for me and gave me that satisfied feeling as I closed the book. My only question, and perhaps it will be answered more explicity as I read the others in the series, (this is my first Jerrilyn Farmer book, but I plan to read more) is when is Wes going to find a nice guy and pair off?"},{"Title":"The Flaming Luau of Death: A Madeline Bean Novel (Madeline Bean Mysteries)","review":"Holly is getting married in two weeks.

Since this one was set in Hawaii, a place I've never visited, I found it to be even more interesting.

Give it a try, I doubt you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Flaming Luau of Death: A Madeline Bean Novel (Madeline Bean Mysteries)","review":"Madeleine Bean and her partner, Wesley Wescott, are professional party planners in L.A. When their friend and employee Holly Nichols becomes engaged, they decide that it's time to use their own expertise (along with insider connections and freebies) to make Holly's bridal shower fabulous. Along with her sisters and best girlfriend, Mad and Wes sweep Holly away to a posh Hawaiian hotel on the most beautiful beach on earth.Unfortunately there's a slight \\"hitch\\" involved. Holly receives an email from an unknown source that instructs her to give them Marvin - or else. Holly has a cloudy, boozy, unclear memory of her high school prom with Marvin Dubinsky ending in Las Vegas, but she isn't certain the ceremony she went through was real. After all, Marvin never contacted her after that night so Holly just assumed she wasn't really married. But now she's getting frightening email about Marvin. What is the threat about? Also, if she really is married to Marvin, that kind if puts a crimp on her upcoming nuptuals. What is she to do?Maddie instructs everyone to enjoy the weekend long party and that she'll look into it - later. But when they get to Hawaii and Holly defends herself from a strange man in her room, and that man is later found dead, Mattie calls upon her investigative wiles to get to the truth behind the mystery.As usual this Madeline Bean book combines a great party with some unexpected twists and this time it includes advising fairies, lovesick dolphins, hot tips on fresh wasabi, half dressed male hula dancers, a gorgeous and interested bronzed major hunk named Cake and a marvelous recipe for a Hawaiian dish that combines all the tastes of the islands.The murder and dangers are just contrivances for Maddie fans to get together to read the next installment of her fabulous and fun escapades. It's really simply another fantastic excuse for her adoring readers to get together with some best girlfriends who happen to reside within the pages of the Madeleine Bean series.The Flaming Luau Of Death is great summer beach reading, especial with a Blue Hawaii in a cool glass at your side. If you're a Maddie Bean fan don't miss it. If you're new to the series you'll relish this book. There's nothing to take too seriously, no high tension, meaness and no mutilated bodies dropping right and left. Just good-natured high-jinks and another entertaining novel in a fun series."},{"Title":"The Flaming Luau of Death: A Madeline Bean Novel (Madeline Bean Mysteries)","review":"Thanks to a generous offer from a friend, event planner Madeline Bean has planned the perfect bachelorette party for her friend and employee Holly. The only problem is, Holly admits she just might be already married. Still, an 'event' waits no woman and Madeline (Mad), Holly, Holly's many sisters and best friend, along with Mad's event-planning partner jet off to the big island of Hawaii. There, however, they discover all is not well. A man ambushes Holly when she walks into her supposedly vacant room and Holly receives threatening messages. When a local man washes up on the beach, Mad realizes that she needs to get to the bottom of the mystery--even if it might mean missing a massage or even a theraptic wrap.Mad's investigation takes her to the secret meeting of the Bamboo Four, to a swim with dolphins, to multiple Luau's, and expose her to the charms of ultra-handsome and rich 'Cake.' But the charm of the island and the ultimate resort is marred by tough gunmen who are convinced that Holly, or Mad, can lead them to the reclusive man who just might be Holly's husband.Author Jerrilyn Farmer spins a charming beach-read tale. Her descriptions of Hawaii ring true and could (despite the occasional murder) be used as tourist advertising. Mad makes a charming character and Farmer's writing made this book a hard one to put down.Sign me up for the next Madeline Bean party (but don't make me the one who dies first). I am happy to recommend THE FLAMING LUAU OF DEATH."},{"Title":"The Flaming Luau of Death: A Madeline Bean Novel (Madeline Bean Mysteries)","review":"The latest Madeline Bean novel arrived this week, and I've already finished it... The Flaming Luau of Death by Jerrilyn Farmer. Another outstanding installment in the amateur sleuth series...Madeline Bean, a professional caterer, decides to throw a major party for her assistant who is getting married. So she books a party of eight over to Hawaii to put on a \\"killer\\" bachlorette weekend. But things start going downhill before they even leave. The assistant, Holly Nichols, tells Bean that she apparently is already married due to a prom night Las Vegas quickie that was never annulled. Furthermore, the husband disappeared to college almost immediately and hasn't been seen since. Now Holly is getting threatening emails from someone wanting to know where he is, and isn't content to take \\"I don't know\\" for an answer. Once over on the island, the threats don't go away, a dead body shows up on the beach of their private luau, and Bean is mistaken for Holly, placing her in a life-threatening situation. Add in a couple of major plot twists, shake well, and see what you get...Farmer is not as popular or well-known as someone like Evanovich or Grafton, but in my opinion she should be. She does a great job with the female amateur sleuth genre, and Madeline Bean is a very likable and believable character. The plotlines and pacing are perfect, and you're never quite sure what the next twist is going to be. Add in her own \\"on-again, off-again\\" love interest, and Bean is an actual personality who continues to grow and evolve with each new novel.If you haven't tried out any of the books in the series, you're in for a treat. Go back, start at the beginning, and enjoy. I promise you you'll still be interested when you get to this one. And if you're an on-going fan of Mad, you won't be disappointed. Farmer's still at the top of her game here."},{"Title":"The Flaming Luau of Death: A Madeline Bean Novel (Madeline Bean Mysteries)","review":"LA-party planner Madeline Bean and her partner Wes Westcott have outdone themselves planning the ultimate bachelorette party weekend for their employee Holly Nichols. Maddie and Wes have planned a surprise weekend getaway to the Big Island of Hawaii for themselves, Holly, Holly's best friend Liz, and Holly's four gorgeous blonde sisters. The trouble begins, though, on the day the group is planning to leave, when Holly confides to Maddie that she was secretly married in Las Vegas on her prom night and, although she hasn't seen her husband during the eight years since then, she is apparently still married to one Marvin Dubinsky. To make matters even worse, Holly has started to receive anonymous threatening e-mails demanding to know Marvin's location.Undaunted by these little problems, the group takes off for Hawaii and starts enjoying their stay at the posh Four Heavens resort. Another strange happening, though, is that Holly finds an unknown man lurking in her room when she checks in, and she promptly conks him over the head with a lamp in the room. That evening, the group enjoys what sounds like the best luau ever. The next morning, however, while the group is enjoying their luxury spa treatments, Maddie learns that a body was discovered right at the same beach where the group had their luau the night before. When Maddie discovers that the dead man is the same man who scared Holly in her room, she puts on her detecting hat to try to figure out who the man was and his connection to Holly.I absolutely loved the Hawaiian atmosphere and setting of this book. The mystery presented here is one of the best-plotted story lines in all of the Madeline Bean stories. I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this book. Even if you haven't read the other entries in this series, you'll enjoy this story.

Now how can I work it into the book?\\" It just didn't seem to have the strong plot that some of her other books have had.That said, Jerrilyn Farmer is a talented writer. Her books are enjoyable.

It was a good mystery, and of course I enjoy the recurring characters, but the writing was really laden down with drawn out descriptions of Hawaii culture, traditions, history, etc. Seriously, you could have taken all of that out and had an entirely separate book. I found myself skimming across a lot of that to get back to the main plot. This definitely took away from my enjoyment of this book."},{"Title":"The Flaming Luau of Death: A Madeline Bean Novel (Madeline Bean Mysteries)","review":"Event planner Madeline Bean and her partner Wes are planning a very special desitantion bachlorette party for their friend and co-worker Holly. This book is set in Hawaii where the party is to be held. As much as Madeline wants to just relax and enjoy her weekend, murder and mayhem seem to have a way of following her even to the beautiful island. Ms. Farmer's descriptions of the beautiful Hawaii are right on too. The book is told in its usually breezy style, and Madeline and her friends are like a breath of fresh air. This is a wonderful, light series (not lightweight though), but as suggested by others is best read in order.

She demonstrates extensive knowledge of every aspect of her characters - over-the-top party planning, catering (great recipe!) and the intricacies of murder mystery. Well-developed plot with great twists and turns. I can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"The Flaming Luau of Death: A Madeline Bean Novel (Madeline Bean Mysteries)","review":"I really enjoy this series, but this installment wasn't as good as usual.First off, there were way too many characters, which made things get confusing -- especially in the case of Holly's sisters. None of them added anything to the story, but the author seemed determined to not let them just fade into the background by giving them a line here or a word there. It would've been better to just not even have had them in the book. Then you add in all the Hawaiian characters and it was hard to keep track of so many people.One of the things I enjoy most about this series is the entire cast -- Maddie, Wes and Holly. So it was disappointing to see Maddie go off on her own to solve this case that involved Holly without any assistance at all from her and Wes.I also hate the \\"round up everyone mentioned in the book and stick 'em in the same place\\" kind of endings. Not only was everyone in the book at the final location, but suddenly you have all these characters back home who'd been mentioned showing up too. It was overkill. And it was an especially annoying way to end the book since we don't know how the current story ended. Does Holly get back together with Marvin? Does she stay in Hawaii or return to LA? I would've been more interested in finding that out and dealing with everyone else back in LA in the next installment.Parts of the book read like a history lesson on Hawaii, but nevertheless, if you're a Maddie Bean fan, you'll enjoy spending a few hours with the gang."},{"Title":"Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions","review":"To the person who wrote \\"don't confuse AA with religion,\\" I think it is you who should reread the book. The book would never call someone \\"ignorant\\" who thinks AA is religion. It goes on and on about how DIFFICULT IT IS to accept that you are powerless over alcohol and that only by giving yourself over to a \\"higher power\\" will you get better. It's hardly \\"ignorant\\" to feel that way, such people simply are not \\"ready\\" for the AA \\"message.\\"And by the way, the whole system is \\"religious\\" in the extreme. I'm not saying that is a bad thing; AA really might be the _only_ way for an alcoholic to get better. But quibbling over the word \\"spiritual\\" vs. \\"religious\\" doesn't change the fact that the book is entirely about the \\"path to salvation\\" through \\"accepting this 'higher power' into your life.\\"The logic of AA is indisputable.

It is pretty dry and is, at times, confusing.First, a lot of people misunderstand the purpose of this book. This is NOT supposed to be an \\"instruction manual\\" on how to work the AA program (to get that, you need to read the \\"Big Book,\\" which is intended as the \\"basic text\\" on how to work the AA steps). You can't work the Steps out of the 12 & 12.The original purpose of the 12 & 12 was to \\"sell\\" people on the Traditions. It also provides supplemental information for the Big Book; it isn't supposed to replace it.This book does a decent job fulfilling that purpose, especially as it relates to the Traditions. It gives good explanations of how they work in the group, their rationale, etc.With that said, the writing's nothing to brag about and this book is honestly downright boring at times. It can also be confusing at times; for example, it describes the so-called \\"allergy\\" alcoholics have to alcohol with absolutely no explanation of what this means. (He's using a very non-standard definition of the word; this is unfortunate because it leads to a lot of confusion).I wish certain parts had been given more attention, especially the explanation of the first step. Not sure if Bill W. anticipated it being read at newcomer's meetings, but this chapter in particular could've used a lot more work. It honestly feels like Bill just forgot to finish writing it.Overall, I recommend this book, but please don't use it as replacement for the Big Book."},{"Title":"Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions","review":"Product was delivered on time and in condition stated on site.

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) began in 1935. It used ideas from religious and medicine in fighting alcoholism. AA began in Akron, followed by groups in New York and Cleveland. It was discovered that alcoholism is difficult to overcome. It took AA three years to develop the tenets is believes work best. The book \\"Alcoholics Anonymous\\" was published in 1939. This book helps readers understand alcoholism as expressed by alcoholics and the spiritual nature of AA.The author declared that only God can remove alcoholism from an alcoholic. An alcoholic needs to feel total humiliation for one's alcoholic behavior and to admit the alcoholic is unable to overcome alcoholism. Those who won't admit to this hopelessness will fail, the book argues.AA members confess their alcoholic deeds to each other, make amends, and pray and meditate to God or a Higher Power. AA recommends 12 steps, yet it does not insist everyone believe in each step. AA asks for members to openly consider each step. The author argues it is the person refusing to consider the 12 steps who has a closed mine. The author advises that converting one's willpower into the will of God will overcome a dependence on alcohol. The book notes that admitting one's defects is the most difficult step. When one becomes conscious of God, one will be guided in removing character defects."},{"Title":"Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions","review":"We recently started a New 12 and 12 Meeting and needed additional books for the newcomers.

But Bill W. and Dr. Bob did and, some 70 years later, literally millions of sufferers worldwide have taken to \\"the program\\" heart and soul and have found the simple serenity of sobriety. Affectionately called The Big Book by \\"members\\" of the AA fellowship and those in other self-help programs inspired by the AA prototype, anything and everything that the addict who's become sick and tired of being sick and tired is here, and recovery is for the taking. With a spiritual (not religious) cornerstone as the foundation, we come to understand why we must put ourselves in the hands of the god of our understanding, why contact with Him daily is an essential lifeline and how we keep the privilege of sobriety by going into service for the addict who stills suffer. AA's 12 steps don't demand a recovery program as prescribed by someone else and recognizes that what works in recovery for one person may not work for another. Thus, the miracle! The diligent program of recovery - and it's wise to practice the 12 steps daily - is backed by the 12 \\"traditions\\" of the fellowship that explain why each of the 12 steps is mandatory for survival itself. In a press interview shortly before his death, Bill W. was asked how AA works. \\"Pretty good. Thanks for asking,\\" was his answer. And that's the miracle and grace of the program and its fellowship. The individual's recovery program is unique to him and of his own making. To those still suffering with active addiction, their families, children and others impacted by the addict's sickness, this book is the lifeline.

This is somewhat obvious by noting the tense change in his story in the original book--at the time of its writing he did not claim to have made amends--only that he was \\"supposed to set right the wrongs\\". He never achieved \\"the promises\\", or any regular peace of mind, and spent the remainder of his life chasing many other solutions, including LSD therapy, to battle the terrible depressions he suffered. It's interesting that, in this book, Bill claims that the 6th step \\"separates the men from the boys\\", when it is almost always the 9th step that takes that something extra to accomplish (apparently, it was too much for him). Further, note the copyright--the year after Bob died. It is likely that Bill didn't dare print this nonsense while Bob was around. This book is just Bill's thinking, and is not the consensus of the folks that really worked the program, as the original text is. He was a great salesman, but a very poor example of how to live--his sobriety was as a result of essentially living in the meetings, rather than that of leading a spiritual existence. This book is just his neurotic ramblings, and was written for the sole purpose of generating income for him. Too bad it has distracted so many from the original message."},{"Title":"Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions","review":"...used to refer to this book as the \\"Twelve Swedish Traditions\\".

It is an interpretive commentary on the steps and traditions. Unfortunately, it is given to people as a textbook. There are no directions given in this book. If you want to get sober and happy, read the book Alcoholics Anonyous - it has all the directions you need."},{"Title":"Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions","review":"The book was older than I expected and had an odor. Otherwise it was okay."},{"Title":"Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions","review":"The truth is that a newly-sober alcoholic named William Griffith Wilson -- a down-on-his-luck former Wall Street hustler who put on airs of having once been a prosperous stock broker -- just sat down, in December of 1938, and wrote up twelve commandments for the new religious group that he and fellow alcoholic Doctor Robert Smith had started. Those commandments were simply a repackaged version of the practices of a cult religion that was popular at that time, something called \\"The Oxford Group\\", or \\"The Oxford Group Movement\\", and later, \\"Moral Re-Armament\\" -- a religious cult that was created by a deceitful fascist renegade Lutheran minister named Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman -- a nut-case who actually praised Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler.Bill Wilson described the writing of the Twelve Steps this way:Well, we finally got to the point where we really had to say what this book was all about and how this deal works. As I told you this had been a six-step program then.The idea came to me, well, we need a definite statement of concrete principles that these drunks can't wiggle out of. There can't be any wiggling out of this deal at all and this six-step program had two big gaps which people wiggled out of.Notice how Bill Wilson considered his fellow alcoholics to be a bunch of cheaters who will \\"wiggle out of this deal\\" if they can get away with it -- which Bill won't allow.And note how Bill Wilson made himself the leader who was entitled to dictate the concrete terms of other people's recovery programs.Also notice how Bill Wilson considered 'spiritual development' to be a business deal, with a contract that you can't wiggle out of, something like selling your soul in trade for sobriety.Nowhere in the Twelve Steps does it say that you should quit drinking, or help anyone else to quit drinking, either. Nowhere do the words \\"sobriety\\", \\"recovery\\", \\"abstinence\\", \\"health\\", \\"happiness\\", \\"joy\\", \\"love\\", or \\"love\\", appear in the Twelve Steps. The word \\"alcohol\\" was only mentioned once, where it was patched into the first step as a substitute for the word \\"sin\\" -- Bill Wilson wrote,\\"we are powerless over alcohol and our lives have become unmanageable\\",instead of the Oxford Group slogan,\\"we are powerless over sin and have been defeated by it\\".And then the phrase \\"especially alcoholics\\" was patched into the 12th step as a suggested target for further recruiting efforts:\\"...we tried to carry this message to others, especially alcoholics\\"...(But regular non-alcoholic people were still fair game for recruiting into Bill's \\"spiritual fellowship\\"...)The Twelve Steps are not a formula for curing or treating alcoholism, and they never were.The Twelve Steps are not \\"spiritual principles\\" and they never were.The Twelve Steps are cult practices that work to convert people into confirmed true believers in a proselytizing cult religion, just like Frank Buchman's so-called \\"spiritual principles\\" did.1. The Twelve Steps do not work as a program of recovery from drug or alcohol problems.The A.A. failure rate ranges from 95% to 100%. Sometimes, the A.A. success rate is actually less than zero, which means that A.A. indoctrination is positively harmful to people, and prevents recovery. Some tests have shown that even receiving no treatment at all for alcoholism is much better than receiving A.A. treatment:One of the most enthusiastic boosters of Alcoholics Anonymous, Professor George Vaillant of Harvard University, who is also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS), showed by his own 8 years of testing of A.A. that A.A. was worse than useless -- that it didn't help the alcoholics any more than no treatment at all, and it had the highest death rate of any treatment program tested -- a death rate that Professor Vaillant himself described as \\"appalling\\". While trying to prove that A.A. treatment works, Professor Vaillant actually proved that A.A. kills. After 8 years of A.A. treatment, the score with Dr. Vaillant's first 100 alcoholic patients was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.(Nevertheless, Vaillant is still a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous, and he still wants to send all alcoholics to A.A. anyway, to \\"get an attitude change by confessing their sins to a high-status healer.\\" That is cult religion, not a treatment program for alcoholism.)The A.A. dropout rate is terrible. Most people who come to A.A. looking for help in quitting drinking are appalled by the narrow-minded atmosphere of fundamentalist religion and faith-healing. The A.A. meeting room has a revolving door. The therapists, judges, and parole officers (many of whom are themselves hidden members of A.A. or N.A.) continually send new people to A.A., but those newcomers vote with their feet once they see what A.A. really is. Even A.A.'s own triennial surveys, conducted by the A.A. headquarters (the GSO), say that:81% of the newcomers are gone within 30 days,90% are gone in 3 months, and95% are gone at the end of a year.That automatically gives A.A. a failure rate of at least 95%. But the GSO does not count all of those people who only attend a few meetings before quitting -- they don't qualify as \\"members\\". (That amounts to \\"cherry-picking\\".) If we included them, then the numbers would be much worse.First there is the propaganda technique of \\"everybody's doing it\\": \\"AA or a similar Twelve-Step program is an integral part of almost all successful recoveries\\".That is a complete falsehood. The vast majority of the successful people recover without A.A. or any \\"support group\\". It's what \\"everybody\\" is doing.Then they use the propaganda techniques of use of the passive voice and vague suggestions: \\"It is widely believed that not including a Twelve-Step program in a treatment plan can put a recovering addict on the road to relapse.\\"It is widely believed by whom? And what do those unnamed people know? What are their qualifications? Are they doctors? Medical school professors? Or salesmen for a 12-Step treatment center? Why should we care what some unnamed invisible fools allegedly believe, anyway?The authors also use the propaganda technique of fear-mongering: you will be \\"on the road to relapse\\" -- you will probably die -- unless you practice Bill Wilson's Twelve Step cult religion.And then the fluff-headed Pollyanna attitude is outrageous: Just going to the wonderful A.A. meetings is supposedly all that is needed to fix some alcoholics.But since A.A. has a zero-percent success rate above and beyond the normal rate of spontaneous remission, that cannot possibly be true."},{"Title":"Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions","review":"I suppose thinking of oneself as insane and defective, and getting humble may be good advice for someone with an overblown ego -- someone who is a pompous megalomaniac. But what about those alcoholics who feel lower than pondscum and need to be uplifted? The 12 steps do a good job of deflating a persons sense of self worth, and instilling feelings of guilt, shame and inadequacy. (certainly good treatment for self-absorbed guiltless sociopaths, but that's not everyone!) The steps instruct the alcoholic to correct all past actions and harms that were done TO others, but what about those things which were done TO the alcoholic? Well, those are never addressed. The alcoholic should just &quot;let it go&quot;, not feel anger and forgive. Great! Let's let remorseless child abusers receive our prayers while their victims are further punished in 12 step groups! The 12 steps clearly contribute to low-self esteem and a lifetime of eternal nitpicking over one's personality. As if problem drinkers are so different from the average person that they somehow need a lifetime of guilt and shame inducing listmaking and daily moral invetory just to live a normal life. Thank goodness there is a growing public awareness about the harm caused by the 12 step ideology... There are a lot of good, deserving people in the rooms of AA... I hope they leave soon."},{"Title":"Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions","review":"This infamous book sells snake oil. The first of the six 12 steps originated with the OxFord Group, fundamentalists led by Frank Buchman, a man that wished to befriend Heinrich Himmler and referred to him as a \\"marvelous lad\\". AA captured Buchman's philosphy of groveling your sins before others/GOD. The OxFord Group was very heavily dependent on recruiting the well-to-do, thus its name. So, Wilson thought it would be great to organize a religion that does the complete opposite, down-and-out drunks. Yet, Wilson's GOD induced hallicinogens documented in this literature were induced by a narcotic, bella donna, an herb at the time used for drying out drunks, probably similar to what Meth was originally intended for heroin addicts. Doesn't seem very genuine, does it? His spiritual basis is rather false. And that is the hidden purveying theme of AA. AA is a joke, and if you buy into the propoganda, you've become part of it.The first 164 pages of the Big Book weren't authored by Wilson, it was a group effort. Wilson was inept and could not write and claims to have merely been a \\"referee\\". Wilson was a businessman (rather inept), except when it came to stealing the copywrite of the Big Book under his own personal name. Thus, legally controlling it's profits.Wilson demands that one become rigourously honest, yet he did not practice what he preached and was quite the alley-cat, hitting on helpless newcoming women to the point where someone was assigned by Wilson's side to curtail this practice. Eventually AA managed to give Wilson a secretary, so that he could still practice this lifestyle. Wilson did not have to work a day of his life, off of the efforts of other contributors to the Big Book, and Wilson did not give them $ for their contribuitions. So the 12 Step Program is based on a huge fallacy.Getting back to Buchman, he was on the cover of TIME magazine on Hitler's B-day labeled Cultist Buchman (do Amazon search). This is the real bedrock foundation of AA, not the propoganda of honestly recovering drunks mending simply their ways with the Lord. Oh yes, the 12 Step advocate Wilson demands rigourous honesty and finds himself \\"experimenting\\" with LSD (as documented in AA literature or just do a google search) 20 years into sobriety. This \\"experiment\\" went on/off for over 2 1/2 years. Some program Wilson invented for himself. AA's spiritual foundation is similar to the prisoners running the prison.So, if you want to go off the deep end and repeat cult induced mantras for years; and practice self induced guilt by confessing your sins to unqualified strangers practicing theology and psychology without a license, GO FOR IT! I did it, or at least signed-off on it for over 15 years.But you may think, what harm is it? A six billion $ industry profits off of the snake oil. Judges, social workers all enable it to grow. Betty Ford demands that you read the Big Book from cover-to-cover. No other option. The Big Book figures every angle for a fellow to fall into it's cult propoganda. Eventually the majority figure this out and leave. But the rest, many whom are still my friends today, are lost (some more than others) and are selling themselves short when they could be doing something more beneficial with their time, IMO.One problem that any Christian will have with Alcoholics Anonymous is the organization's abandoning of the Bible. The Big Book, Alcoholics Anonymous, is their new Bible. Some members claim to still use the Bible; I sometimes hear a bit of lip service to the Bible like, \\"Keep the Big Book next to the Good Book,\\" but you won't see a Bible at a meeting, and you won't hear it quoted. Everybody is carrying the Big Book, and all readings come from it, or from a similar book of daily meditations, also written by Bill Wilson and other members of A.A..In fact, reading aloud from the Bible at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings is usually forbidden. The Bible is considered \\"outside literature\\". Reading aloud at meetings from anything but A.A. \\"Council Approved\\" (and A.A.-published) literature is forbidden.In addition, A.A. has essentially abandoned Jesus Christ. The A.A. faithful believe that Bill Wilson is superior to Jesus Christ when it comes to dealing with alcoholism, and you will hear Bill Wilson quoted a hundred times more often than Jesus Christ. (As a matter of fact, I can't really remember the last time I heard Jesus Christ quoted in an A.A. or N.A. meeting...)The third edition of the A.A. Big Book does not contain the word \\"Jesus\\" anywhere, not even once. Bill Wilson raved constantly about \\"God\\", but didn't talk about Jesus Christ at all. There is one and only one mention of \\"Christ\\" in the entire book, and it is Bill Wilson's statement that before his hallucinatory experience on belladonna, his so-called \\"spiritual experience,\\" he didn't have much use for Christ:With ministers, and the world's religions, I parted right there. When they talked of a God personal to me, who was love, superhuman strength and direction, I became irritated and my mind snapped shut against such a theory. To Christ I conceded the certainty of a great man, not too closely followed by those who claimed Him. His moral teaching -- most excellent. For myself, I had adopted those parts which seemed convenient and not too difficult; the rest I disregarded.The Big Book, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, chapter 1, Bill's Story, pages 10-11.Apparently, Bill continued to disregard a lot of that stuff even after he \\"saw the light,\\" or saw \\"the God of the preachers\\", because Bill never mentioned Jesus or Christ again, not anywhere in the Big Book, not ever.The first edition of the Big Book contained one story, \\"My Wife and I,\\" that contained a line mentioning Jesus Christ:Here were these men who visited me and they, like myself, had tried everything else and although it was plain to be seen none of them were perfect, they were living proof that the sincere attempt to follow the cardinal teaching of Jesus Christ was keeping them sober.That story was dropped from the second, third, and fourth editions.The word \\"God\\" appears in the first 164 pages of the Big Book (which William G. Wilson either wrote, co-authored, or edited) 106 times,the word \\"Power\\", as in \\"Higher Power\\" or \\"that Power, which is God\\" appears 22 times,the divine \\"Him\\" appears 26 times,and the divine \\"His\\" is used 15 times,but there is no mention of \\"Jesus Christ\\", not one single mention.Alcoholics Anonymous is not a Christian religion, no matter what some members like to say. It is a religion all right, in spite of the denials of the members who claim that it is only a \\"spiritual program.\\" Alcoholics Anonymous is a Buchmanite religion. Alcoholics Anonymous is just Frank Buchman's crazy \\"Oxford Group / Moral Re-Armament\\" religion, only slightly edited by William G. Wilson and Dr. Robert H. Smith.Basically, Alcoholics Anonymous believes in and practices the teachings of Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman, another man who had little use for Jesus Christ, because he preferred his own beliefs and teachings to those of Jesus. Bill Wilson did not invent the theology of A.A. -- he merely copied it from Frank Buchman.In spite of that fact that Bill Wilson tried to hide the strong connections between Frank Buchman and A.A., Buchman's Oxford Group got three mentions in the third edition of the Big Book, while Christ got only one. (The first two mentions of the Oxford Group are in the Forward to the Second Edition, and the third is on page 218 of the third edition, in the story \\"He Thought He Could Drink Like A Gentleman\\".)For that matter, when you consider the fact that Jesus' first miracle was changing water into wine at a wedding party, there might be a real problem with Jesus being a member of Alcoholics Anonymous... (John 2:1 to 2:11.)I am reminded of a contemporary critic of Frank Buchman's Oxford Group, Pastor H. A. Ironside, who criticized Buchmanism by saying that it was not a Christian religion, in spite of Buchman's claims that it was, because everything in Buchmanism would still be possible even if Jesus Christ had never been born. The same thing is true of Alcoholics Anonymous. A.A. would not have to change one word of the official church dogma even if Jesus Christ had never been born. The sacred Twelve Steps of Bill Wilson do not mention Jesus Christ, and do not require Jesus Christ in order to work, and the Twelve Steps don't even require Jesus Christ to have ever existed.Neither are the Twelve Steps based on any of the teachings of Jesus Christ. (They are based on the teachings of Dr. Frank Buchman.)Alcoholics Anonymous simply has no need for, and no use for, Jesus Christ. A.A. worships Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob, not Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions","review":"More religious nonsense.

AA, for example, proves to be no less and NO MORE effective than any other type of treatment, including psychological counseling.To invest in this fundamentalist \\"sin and salvation\\" thinking is easy, I guess, because there are lots of other converts out there, but at least take the time to read about the Brandsma study, the Ditman study, the work of Peele, Vaillant, Rand..."},{"Title":"Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions","review":"This book and its contents, its principles and concepts has been useful to me in more than one way.

It's thought-provoking & helpful for anyone in recovery.At heart, some may come to realize that they're confronting as much a living problem as an alcohol problem & that the Steps (11 of which do not mention booze) offer a better way of life.AA is not the only way to recover, but it has proven effective for millions around the world facing a problem with a high relapse rate & lousy prognosis. Anyone who's reached their wit's end with alcohol will find help in AA. The program has no religious requirement, & its members do not tell anyone what to believe. They only suggest a person be willing to believe in a power greater than themself, a god of their understanding. For all anyone cares, this could be a pet dog, as long as it's something to remove the notion that the person is at the center of the universe.AA has been successful for decades, it is the model for all other 12 Step programs & it is the foundation of much recovery. The program helps members who follow the 12 Steps to restore their self-worth through practicing integrity. It encourages members to let go of self-pity about perceived wrongs done them, accept responsibility for their own lives, acknowledge their pasts & (& this is key) move on. Above all, it encourages living in the present rather than in the past or the future ... thus increasing the odds that one will actually live.This book is one outstanding part of an arsenal available to alcoholics who want to see their disease go into remission. For anyone who finds the program not to their taste, a return to drinking is always an option."},{"Title":"Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions","review":"This is a real must for anyone in any of the of the 12 step programs who is wishing to understand the traditions and steps more completly. The vinyettes are heartfelt and identifyable."},{"Title":"Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions","review":"I have tried to follow the 12 steps and 12 traditions for many years, but haven't really known what they are before I began working them with a sponsor. He keeps me honest -- and honesty is a necessity in any program designed to change lives. Without honesty, we refuse to accept the need for improvement or change -- and thus we don't change -- we stay in the \\"bad old place\\" which has become our virtual prison -- and condedmns us to a life of living hell.Anyone who knows the misery of being trapped in a compulsive lifestyle which guarantees pain and often leads to death -- will find that honesty and perserverance in following the steps leads to a miracle of transformation. Transformation into a life of freedom from addiction through a life changing spiritual experience.The AA 12 and 12 are the first in a number of incarnations of these steps focused on various addictions. Alcoholism, gambling addiction, drug addiction, compulsive over eating and many other addictive diseases are addressed and arrested by these steps as they are applied in particular ways for individual types of addiction.This book is worth following, adjusting the language to fit the particular disease confrunted by the reader. It is, however not a self-help book. It does not work as only an educational tool -- if it did we would not need others' help. No, each person's transformation is definately associated with systematic group participation and one-on-one support with a sponsor. The relationship dimension of this process is accentuated by the descreption of the process by one of the co-founders of AA. Bill W. writes of this spiritual program in practical terms -- as this is the way it works -- it has worked for me and others. Try the process and see if it works for you.Yes, read and study the book -- but join with others in the process of working the steps if you expect the process to be continuously beneficial to you. One of the secrets of success of those who follow the steps is the concept -- we are helped by helping others. The only way to avoid addictive behavior is by helping others onto the spiritual wagon with the destination of traveling the road to recovery, helping others on the way.Bill H."},{"Title":"Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions","review":"The negative comments left by a few are fairly ignorant, in that Al-anon is NOT a religion NOR does it EVER suggest that a person BE religous in order for the program to work.

All of the information necessary to work the steps is in the Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous), but you may find some helpful ideas and things to discuss here. Finally, the Traditions didn't exist when the Big Book was written, so a good discussion of each one is available here.

Of course, the Big Book (\\"Alcoholics Anonymous\\") is the place to start and it contains the program of action required to attain and maintain sobriety. What I have found to be an effective way to work the Steps is to use the 12&12 as a reference as I go along, with the Big Book as my primary text, and discussing all of this with a sponsor (an alcoholic who has made some progress working the Steps who shares his/her experience, strength, and hope with a newcomer on an ongoing basis). Some have found it possible to get sober using just the book(s) and/or meetings, but my observation is that most of these people end up working the Steps in a confused way, or worse, don't really work them at all. Sobriety is about a new way of life free of alcohol, and this life is meant to be happy, joyous and free, not merely \\"dry\\" and miserable. The best way to achieve this is to get a sponsor and make use of that sponsor, which will likely involve reading these books and considerable other action as well.

Well for those of you who hate reading case after case, then this is the book for you.On average there is only 1 case per chapter, with the remainder of the chapter devoted to ABA opinions and or Law review articles. While the articles are insightful, they really don't give you any more of an understanding of the ABA Rules, than just reading the rules with the commentary. What is good about this text, however, are the discussion problems at the beginning of the chapter and the multiple choice problems at the end of each chapter. These problems will help you better understand and think about the ABA Model rules.Overall the book isn't too bad, but you if you have a copy of the ABA rules along with the commentary then this book becomes worthless for the most part."},{"Title":"Problems in Legal Ethics","review":"This is a better than average casebook, with multiple choice questions and answers, on point cases, good commentary and a writing style that can be approached by the layperson.

What's astonishing, though, is the way he has applied his sensibility to the least-liked spaces that increasingly dominate America and the globe: the &quot;edge cities&quot; of prefab warehouses for outsourced products, of instant townhouse communities (really trailer courts stacked upright) of malls and corporate &quot;campuses.&quot; Most writing about this new American landscape excoriates it or, more rarely, argues that it's the landscape we want (ignoring that &quot;we&quot; aren't the architects, the patrons, or the developers). Thall seeks simply to look, to see what's remarkable, and then to communicate it, in pictures that embody the complex history of our newly decentralized human habitations. On the cover is a picture of two shocking office towers shot from a parking garage. Only one car is there: a beat-up Toyota station wagon perched impudently at off-angle to the resolute order of the rest of the space. That must be Thall's car; certainly it's the embodiment of the position he takes when he makes these pictures."},{"Title":"The New American Village (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"Schaumburg, Illinois (incorporated 1956) is now on the map thanks to Bob Thall's excellent photos taken during the growth of the town in the Nineties. Divided into four chapters dealing with the landscape: corporate; commercial; domestic and natural, the photos carry on the flat format of Adams, Baltz, Gohlke and others associated with the New Topographics style.Despite appearing rather anonymous because there are no people in the photos Schaumburg does look a very reasonable place to live and Thall mentions in his short opening essay that many of the houses and corporate offices overlook small lakes and ponds, created by the developers to control flooding, this water obviously encourages wildlife. As is usual with suburbs/edge cities/New Villages, critics will assume that the inhabitants can't possibly be happy living in such an environment but I bet they are. Probably the best folks-at-home-in-the-suburbs book is Bill Owens stunningSuburbia, photographed in Livermore, San Francisco.The sixty-five photos in 'The New American Village' are well presented (in 250sreen) in the standard art-photo landscape format though there is the usual photobook annoyance of having to turn to a page in the back to read each photo's caption. Unfortunately the captions say no more than place and date yet the images frequently, it seems to me, deserve more of an explanation than just resting on the page.Incidentally, it is worth looking down at Schaumburg on Google Earth or Street View, you will see a place that has matured over the years since Thall took his photos and especially look at the space between houses, the curved streets, the position of corporate and retail units in relation to domestic housing. A pretty good place to live!***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover."},{"Title":"The New American Village (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"In the 20 page written intro to Bob Thall's book of photographs, the author discusses the introduction of the new suburban areas surrounding large cities, specifically the ones surrounding Chicago, and even more specifically Schaumburg, Illinois. His description is admittedly subjective, but that doesn't make it negative. He addresses the pros and cons of both city life and suburban life, and details the way that his photographs will illutrate his points.The photographs themselves are stunning simply because they are of such typical subruban non-descript businesses, streets, homes, and parks. What is interesting is how new everything looks, and yet 8 years later, I wonder what it looks like. Thall considers what these neighborhoods will look like 20 years from their construction dates, considering they are built with such cheap material, and almost a decade later, we're close to finding out. It would be interesting to see a follow-up book about the same area, just to see how much can change in such a short amount of time in a rapidly growing suburban area.For anyone interested in the suburbs and the small cities full of strip-malls and housing developments that arise around major cities, this book is an excellent reference point."},{"Title":"Ambicin Sin Limites","review":"Although not as good as Great Sky River, I consider this to be the second best of the Galactic Center novels.

Recommend highly."},{"Title":"English grammar (College outline series)","review":"When I was a teenage word nerd, reading every linguistics article in the Britannica and scouring the bookstores for volumes such as \\"Teach Yourself Welsh,\\" a friendly English teacher passed Curme's ENGLISH GRAMMAR on to me, beginning a lifelong love affair with this delightful tome. It elucidated the history and underlying logic of my mother tongue to a degree unmatched by any other popular guide I've come across, and with a genial curiosity about the ways by which we manage to express ourselves that I've always found impressive. But I can really do no better conveying its virtues than by quoting the description on its back cover:This book, by a noted educator and linguist, is an illuminating and practical guide to English grammar and usage. The treatment of the subject is concise but thorough, covering important and distinctive features of the language that are overlooked by many texts.Controversial and difficult points are clarified by a lucid discussion of meaning. For instance, the author supports judicious use of the split infinitive because, he says: \\"Older usage with the adverb before 'to' is often ambiguous. 'He failed entirely to comprehend it.' This sentence is ambiguous since we do not know whether 'entirely' modifies 'failed' or 'comprehend.' Thus the much censured split infinitive is an improvement of English expression.... At present it is widely used by our best writers, who feel its advantages. It is avoided by many, especially our minor writers, who here follow the instructions of their schoolteachers.\\"English grammar is here presented, not as a fixed body of rules, but as part of an evolutionary process. Numerous examples of literary usage show how the language has developed through centuries. As all materials are methodically arranged, fully indexed, and provided with cross references, the volume is suited for either reference use or systematic study. It is an ideal text for an intensive course in grammar. (end quote)And so indeed I have always found it to be.

That Man Is You is a worthy addition to any high-caliber personal library."},{"Title":"Harriette Wilson's Memoirs: The Greatest Courtesan of Her Age","review":"Harriette Wilson thought herself genteel. Indeed, she was educated as such, having the usual accomplishments as well as a great command of the French language. Furthermore, she displays some taste in her living arrangements, her likes, her preferences, even, for men. Additionally, her memoirs are full of shrewd descriptions and peeks into daily life that are very well-written, if at times cryptic. But she was also perhaps the \\"Greatest Courtesan of her Age,\\" as the title of the book asserts. One of the main problems in life for Harriette, then, is that her way of life (living under the protection of a man without the benefit of marriage to him) was simply not, in any way, considered \\"genteel\\" to those living about her.I take issue with the claim of her being the \\"greatest courtesan,\\" unless one understands it to mean only the most popular; most notorious; most famous in her day. She lacks the claim to greatness, in my opinion, because of her failure to do better for herself, despite having had many of the day's brightest stars as her \\"protectors\\" at various times in her life.There are so many angles a large work like this could be approached from, that I am uncertain which to address. What, really, constitutes gentlemanly behavior, for example? It is gentlemen of the highest rank who profess to love Harriette and then later treat her the shabbiest.Or, should we discuss the evident double-standard that enabled said \\"gentlemen\\" to avail themselves of Harriette's bedroom (if she allowed), and then go dine with the Regent; while Harriette was of course never invited to or would have been allowed to attend, gatherings of the ton because of her \\"profession.\\" In other words, a man could be as profligate as he chose, and still retain the esteem and respect of the world, while a woman had to bear the shame. (Not that I am a proponent of Harriette's chosen lifestyle; far from it. But the double-standard is often what kept these ladies from becoming respectable, forcing them to maintain the status quo if they wanted their next meal.)One flaw in the book is that we have no way of knowing how it was edited, whether for content, verity, or otherwise (perhaps unavoidable in a memoir). The author never states a single date, not even the year in question, which the editor might have pressed her for. This was irritating. In addition, we find out in the introduction by Lesley Blanch that Harriette offered to keep the names of gentlemen out of the book if they paid her a reasonable sum; so there's no way to know who is missing from the account. (However, those who do appear are quite enough for any woman, one thinks!)Finally, there are practically no details about events of the day, unless it were a fete, or a ball, or something which occurred at the opera. Nevertheless, if you are a fan of history, of the Regency, of social manners, or memoirs; if you are a Regency romance reader, historical fiction reader, or student of the times, then you will enjoy what the book does have to offer. Which is, an account of one woman's life, written without a great deal of introspection and very little second-guessing.There are times when Harriette Wilson was impossibly mean, \\"outrageous\\" you might say; She will both delight and horrify you with her behaviour. But you will be the richer for having read of it. Her frank discussions with men were probably one of the things that kept them coming back to her, and it is precisely this frankness that makes the book so enjoyable. It's a sad commentary that properly bred young women were not supposed to engage in such frank \\"vulgar\\" talk, but that of course the men they married hungered for the honesty and transparency that Harriette seldom withheld. As Prince Esterhazy tellingly exclaims to her: 'Oh, Harriette! a wife is altogether so very different from what is desirable, no sort of comparison can be made with them.\\" \\"They\\" are the young innocents he wished to seduce, seeking help from Harriette, which she firmly refused to supply.I underlined a great deal of the text in this book, always seeking new little tidbits and facts of the day, or even common expressions, for my own Regency writing. No matter whether you are new to the period or an old familiar friend, you will find much here to fascinate. Insights to all the famous men she had dealings with, is just the start.

I certainly am grateful to have done so.Linore Rose Burkardwww.LinoreRoseBurkard.comInspirational Regency Romance"},{"Title":"The Kiki Chronicles: An Equispecial Journey","review":"Great book for kids and adults who love horses.

(1943)This is a composite review of the books above - the first, credited on the title page as having been co-authored by Skinner & Kimbrough; the second, a solo effort by Kimbrough.*****The strangest thing happened in 1941: A book that should have become a best-seller actually DID become a best-seller!\\"Low Man On A Totem Pole,\\" by the sly rogue humorist/newspaper columnist H. Allen Smith (Doubleday, Doran & Co., Inc.), hit the best seller lists. And stayed there, too, for quite a while.In what rates right up there with the inexplicable events of the Bermuda Triangle, the same exact thing happened about twelve months later when \\"Our Hearts,\\" I am told, sold over two million copies.\\"Our Hearts...\\" (1942) is a memoir of the two girls' first trip to Europe in the early 1920s, which ended in Paris:Original. Brilliant. Subtle wit (lightly misrepresented in other accounts as \\"comedy\\") is found on almost every page. Edited perfectly (not an unnecessary word exists).It embarrasses the authors & editors of many other books that have arrived with great expectations, were read & then reluctantly retained (more likely, pulped), with the author's former reputation now resentfully lowered (books cost money)... or altogether in tatters.*****\\"We Followed...\\" (1943): \\"Sequels are not equals.\\" I can't credit the author of that observation; his name escapes me. It comes to mind whenever insufferable egotists create a remake of an original film (not necessarily worth creating to begin with, either, rendering the later effort even more of an insult).I can't use it here, either - although I thought that I might have to, expecting an anticlimactic experience when I opened \\"We Followed.\\"It's Kimbrough's account of how the two ladies, two decades after their pilgrimage to post-World War I France, travelled from the East Coast of the U.S. to Hollywood, after having been hired by Paramount Studio to assist the creation of the dialogue for the film being made - as it turned out, \\"profusely loosely\\" based on the memoir, \\"Our Hearts.\\"\\"Our Hearts\\" approaches the zenith of perfection. What sequel book could top that? But \\"OH\\" was also a gold mine. We all know that this has motivated many a later mistake.As it turned out, \\"Our Hearts\\" couldn't be topped by \\"We Followed.\\"But Kimbrough, undaunted by Skinner's achievement & aided by her own sense of humor, did write her own legitimate account (the candor of both authors about their irreparable comic navet&eacute; & moments of losing their equilibrium is appreciated).\\"We Followed\\" gains traction after an unperky start. Its integrity (authenticity) & extended good-will remains intact to the end. And I didn't anticipate that some of her writing would be as accomplished as anything else that I've read. The conclusion to Chapter Ten will impress you (today's boilerplate political liberalism, in 1943, could get you in some very serious trouble in Kimbrough's professional & social circles).I only regret three minor things: That Kimbrough wasn't more observant about life in the U.S. during WWII, which wasn't Hollywood-oriented;That I am never going to be able to believe that Cornelia Skinner saved the life of a \\"child\\" about to be run over by an automobile - only to discover that she had impulsively rescued a middle-aged & profoundly ungrateful male midget (at the time, employed by a WWII bomber assembly plant);And that artist Helen Hokinson's illustrations are inferior to those of Alajalov seen in Skinner's \\"Our Hearts\\" - & also compare poorly to the renowned covers that she had created for The New Yorker magazine.(Post note 02/05/13: Constantin Alajalov [1900-1987] also drew covers for the New Yorker magazine, & good ones, at that. Examples can be found respectively for TNY issues of Hokinson - November 27, 1937 - and Alajalov, March 11, 1939.)*****Also enthusiastically recommended (see reviews under their own titles, on \\"Amazon Books\\"):Cornelia's \\"Elegant Wits & Grand Horizontals\\" (Houghton Mifflin Co. 1962); & by the same author, \\"Madame Sarah,\\" a biography of the French actress (& national heroine) Sarah Bernhardt (Houghton Mifflin Company 1967).Finally, Cornelia was a guest on an entertaining episode of \\"What's My Line,\\" a 1950s game show.

Almost everything posted on You Tube is never credited with the date the show was filmed, the historical event occurred, etc. Only the date that they were posted on the Internet matters.

Kimbrough and Skinner had kept diaries during their coming out days (in the 1920s) and did a grand tour of Europe and had many other high bourgeois adventures and years later, they wrote up an account of their trip and audiences lapped it up.More to the point, Hollywood bought it and asked the authors to come to the studios and write a screenplay version of it. Kimbrough alone wrote this book, which follows Cornelia and herself struggling to understand the studio system of the classic Hollywood era, and trying to adapt their writing for the needs of a screenplay, very different animal. It is mildly amusing, and the book comes with illustrations by the New York's Helen Hokinson, whose line drawings of fat clubwomen were all the rage back then. In fact the book is almost unreadable today, for her attempts at humor make your face hurt from wincing, but I give it three stars for its \\"nonfiction novel\\" glimpse into Hollywood at war. Kimbrough was a shrewd observer of what makes an industry tick, and she's very good at capturing famous personalities close-up. Cornelia and Emily are invited to observe Ginger Rogers on the set of Mitchell Leisen's LADY IN THE DARK, and Kimbrough is easily as good as the later, more celebrated Lillian Ross book PICTURE, which details the filming of John Huston's RED BADGE OF COURAGE. We get detailed and incisive portraits of Rogers and Leisen, and many more, including Nigel Bruce, Bob Hope, Marian Anderson, Paul Robeson, Charles Brackett, and S.N. Behrman. All of Hollywood's product, she argues, was about winning the war--a totalizing propaganda system--not only were most of the movies about war, but even the ones set on the domestic front were really about the war and what it did to women.She has another argument too, that in 1943 and 1944 there was much less racism in Hollywood than in any other American city. It's interesting and provocative, but could it have been true? I wonder!"},{"Title":"We Followed Our Hearts To Hollywood","review":"Emily Kimbrough is probably one of the funniest female writers from the 50's that I've ever read.This book is an \\"autobiography\\", the story of what happened to the author in her trip to Hollywood to co-write with friend and actress Cornelia Otis Skinner the script based in their first bookOur Hearts Were Young and Gay, written some odd years ago when both women were still teenagers.A very very funny book, a great source to know how Hollywood worked at the time."},{"Title":"The Virginia housewife,: Or, Methodical cook","review":"Tjis is an excellent addition to any cookbook rack.There are very easy to use recipes in this book,even for today.it writes in 1800's grammar,but is still an easy read.It has already helped me make pear preserves,and Im sure it will help me more in the future!"},{"Title":"The Virginia housewife,: Or, Methodical cook","review":"I bought this cook book for one recipe...the oldest known fried chicken recipe in the U.S. Upon reading the other recipes I am quite entertained by the writing and explanation of the recipes.

In 1700 he arrived in Charleston and travelled in a small company including various Indian guides up the coast to Bull's Bay and then inland through the various Indian Nations ending in coastal NE North Carolina. He describes the customs and living style of the Indians and is clearly in awe at the beauty of the landscape (once out of the coastal swamps). The first part of the volume is a brief diary of his travels. The second part is a description of NC with sections on edible plants trees and other aspects of natural history. The third part is his observations of the Indians of NC. He later became the State Surveyor for NC and met an untimely death by the Indians who had become much less friendly to the European intruders. A verbatim copy of the 1663 visit of Long, Hill, and Fabian to the Cape Fear Estuary is included. The writing in the 1952 edition is easy to read with a minimum of difficult archaic words. Recommended reading for those wishing a view of the Carolinas before colonization disrupted the beneficial Indian/English relationships."},{"Title":"Cutting Corporate Welfare (The Open Media Pamphlet Ser., No. 18)","review":"Ralph Nader (born 1934) is of course a famous consumer activist and progressive political activist (including six runs for President), as well as an author, lecturer, and attorney; he has written numerous books, such asGetting Steamed to Overcome Corporatism: Build It Together to Win,Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us!,The Good Fight : Declare Your Independence and Close the Democracy Gap, etc.He wrote in the Introduction to this 2000 book, \\"Corporate welfare---the enormous and myriad subsidies, bailouts, giveaways, tax loopholes, debt revocations, loan guarantees, discounted insurance and other benfits conferred by government on business---is a function of political corruption. Corporate welfare programs siphon funds from appropriate public investments, subsidize companies ripping minerals from federal lands, enable pharmaceutical companies to gouge consumers, perpetuate anti-competitive oligopolistic markets, injure our national security, and weaken our democracy... Patching the corporate drain on public resources will require an informed and mobilized citizenry that both forces changes in our systems... and demands careful and critical scrutiny by ... the citizens who lose out from government transfers of resources, privileges, and immunities to corporations. This pamphlet is part of such an effort to inform, arouse, and mobilize to change the corporate welfare state.\\"He observes that \\"No government agency is cozier with industry than the Department of Defense, and corporate welfare is pervasive at the agency famous for cost-overruns, waste, fraud, and abuse.\\" (Pg. 21) He charges that while Clinton and Congress \\"gutted the welfare system for poor people... no such top-down agenda has emerged for corporate welfare recipients.\\" (Pg. 23)He is particularly incensed with professional sports teams owned by \\"megamillionaires\\" who threaten to move \\"unless the city bestows a glamorous, and extraordinarily expensive, publicly financed new stadium\\"; ironically, these new stadiums inevitably contain so many luxury boxes and high-priced seats that they \\"put watching the local team out of reach for significant portions of the town's population.\\" He notes sadly, that most cities \\"choose subsidize the team, even in the many cases where scholastic athletics, not to mention the schools themselves, are massively underfunded.\\" (Pg. 40)He is critical of government bailouts (remember that this book was written well before the massive bailouts of 2008-2009!), observing, \\"These bailouts... are generally doled out to large corporations and industries. When a family-owned restaurant fails, no government intervenes to stop it from going belly up. If a small factory can't pay its bills, it goes out of business.\\" (Pg. 69)Nader's book, as with all of his writings, is very thought-provoking, and heartfelt; and is well worth reading, for any progressive thinkers out there."},{"Title":"Drummond \\"Greyhounds\\" of the L.S.W.R.

It is excellently illustrated with many contemporary photographs.From the Preface -\\"This book recounts the long and enthralling history of 66 excellent 4-4-0s which from1900 until the grouping of railways in 1923 formed the mainstay of London & South Western Railway express services. The brainchild of their eminent and adventurous Scottish locomotive engineer, Dugald Drummond, they were officially classified T9, but on account of their marked propensity for speed, were more generally known as the Greyhounds, a sobriquet they held with honour for no less than 60 years.\\"\\"Painted an eye-catching apple green, with chocolate, black and white lining, their design was neat and attractive, yet at the same time displaying a quiet air of authority and optimism. In regular service this was fully justified, for they proved the finest express locomotives yet to work on South Western metals. Time and mechanical advancement, however, take but scant account of prowess, no matter how well gained, and by 1922 events had overtaken the class. Fortunately, superheating was to hand, and by skilful application a new and invigorated lease of life was injected which endured throughout Southern Railways days into Nationalisation. At long last the end came in 1961, although one representative evaded the breaker's torches and today proudly awaits restoration to working order to take its place among the many other active preserved steam locomotives working on privately-run tourist lines or BR specials.\\"\\"To set the story of the T9 in perspective, the passenger locomotives Drummond designed earlier for the North British and Caledonian Railways cannot be neglected, while coverage is also given to other London & South western four- and six-coupled express classes - though references to these other classes must be subordinate to the T9s themselves.\\"The Contents are -P05: PrefaceP07: Dugald DrummondP09: The Scottish PreludeP15: Nine Elms - 1895-1901P31: The Greyhounds at Work - The Early YearsP41: The Drummond FinaleP50: The Greyhounds at Work - The Middle YearsP57: The Coming of SuperheatingP63: Grouping - The Early YearsP75: Grouping - Bulleid and the War YearsP81: Nationalisation and FinaleP90: Accidents and Other Kindred MishapsP94: AppendicesP95: BibliographyP96: Index"},{"Title":"Vikings in Britain (Historical Association Studies)","review":"The student of the history of Anglo Saxon England who ignores a study of the effect of the Scandinavian invasions does so at their own peril. In much the same way, the student who chooses not to read at least one work by the well-respected Anglo Saxon scholar Henry Loyn does so at the risk of severely limiting their historiographical knowledge of this period. The late Professor Loyn was a consummate historian whose work serves, itself, as a textbook on the way in which historical research should be conducted.In a time in which historical study is more and more reflective of the political and personal biases of the historian, Loyn's treatise on the impact of the Scandinavian Age on the peoples and history of Britain is, by contrast, a balanced, methodical and reasonably well-argued case. Indeed, the organization of the chapters of the book itself is built around such a balance. Rather than providing a continuous narrative from the earliest Viking expeditions in 793 to the latter part of the 11th century, Loyn finds it more useful to discuss the Scandinavian and British worlds separately and further subdivides his study into two time periods, providing the break at 954 A.D.The author begins his work by relating current historical knowledge of the state of affairs of the three main players from Scandinavia: Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Bringing the reader up to the commencement of the Viking raids on Britain in the late 8th century, Loyn provides the possible motivation for such raids, including such factors as climactic change, overpopulation and political instability at home. Loyn follows this with a discussion of the conditions in all of the British Isles, briefly acquainting the unfamiliar reader with the histories of the four main divisions of Britain to 800 A.D. . Notably refreshing is Loyn's apparent disregard for contemporary political sensitivities by including the whole of Ireland as one of the British Isles to be discussed, avoiding a separate treatment of the island as many modern historians tend to do.Having the foundation laid, Loyn then launches into a discussion of the Viking sorties and eventual settlement of Scotland, Ireland, Wales and England in that order. From this point onward, Loyn's text is a narration of events, sprinkled with commentary by the author. Loyn relates the settlements of Dublin and Waterford, the conquest of the western isles in Scotland and the western coastal defenses of Wales, all of which, while important in the development of these regions, did little to affect the political, social and economic histories of the modern nations of Ireland, Scotland and Wales. They did, however, provide a base for attacks on what is now England and a base for the extensive discussion of English history by the author. We follow the settlement of the Danes in East Anglia, the retreat of Alfred to the southern reaches of Wessex and the eventual agreement arranged between Alfred and Guthrum over the partition and ruling of England under the Danelaw. At this point, Loyn provides a good example of the balance he has brought to this study. Where most authors have treated this agreement as a victory for the English, Loyn shows us how this also strengthened the Danes, providing them with a sense of pride and, more importantly, a legitimization of their presence in England and a chance to consolidate their power.From here Loyn takes us through the reconquest of the Danelaw by the Anglo-Saxon kings down to the peaceful reign of Edgar, the great-grandson of Alfred the Great. The author then returns the reader to Scandinavia, bringing them up-to-date on the political manouverings in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, laying the groundwork for an understanding of the turmoil to follow in the history of England in the following century. We see the consolidation of power in the developing monarchies of these countries, leading to the eventual return of invasions to England at the close of the 10th century and the parallel consolidation of power under Cnut in the early part of the 11th century. To the nave reader not acquainted with these histories, the Norman Conquest may come as a surprise in 1066. When one considers the larger arena containing the events in these northern countries, it is clear that the Norman invasion was not a surprise but rather one more in a series of attempts by the Scandinavians to rule the rich, enticing lands of the British Isles.At this point, after a brief discussion of the waning years of Norwegian influence in Scotland, Ireland and Wales, Loyn attempts to provide the reader with something of a summary and understanding of the impact of the Scandinavian invasions on Britain. Here the author begins a long, detailed synopsis of the evidence available illustrating the Scandinavian contributions to the political, cultural, social and institutional fabrics of British history. For each of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England, Loyn relates artistic achievements, results of place name studies, linguistic clues and legal practices. The author simultaneously provides the reader not only examples of Scandinavian influence on succeeding generations but also evidence for the narrative that precedes this discussion.It is the placement of this information that provides the only flaw in this book. The book in some ways is a synthesis of the narrative history of this fascinating time period and a summary of current historical research on the topic. The book could easily stand on its own as an undergraduate textbook without the inclusion of this final chapter. In the same way, it could provide the advanced student and researcher with a good start on the research on this field if this information was placed in the text itself where it is needed for support. The work requires that the researcher take the first six chapters on face value until the evidence can be presented in the end.This one flaw, however, is not fatal and should not deter the serious scholar from reading this work. In all other aspects it is well organized and well presented and provides the reader with a concise and complete summary of the Viking Age."},{"Title":"Vikings in Britain (Historical Association Studies)","review":"The student of the history of Anglo Saxon England who ignores a study of the effect of the Scandinavian invasions does so at their own peril.

I like the way the book is laid out--it basically divides the Viking era into two blocks of time--the first from the beginning of the Viking period until roughly 950, and the second from 950 until 1100--then goes through each area of the British Isles, including not only Anglo-Saxon England but also Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and the northern islands, and talks about how they were affected by the Vikings during the period. There's also a very interesting chapter near the end about the various languages spoken in the British Isles during the Viking era. This is an overview type of study, so the degree of detail is somewhat limited, but still I'd definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Arguing With Scripture: The Rhetoric of Quotations in the Letters of Paul","review":"The Blurb...So why do I give a book 5-stars when the review to follow seems not-too-positive? Because it is hard to write a book as thought-provoking as Stanley does in Arguing with Scripture...Stanley, Christopher D. Arguing With Scripture: The Rhetoric of Quotations in the Letters of Paul. 1st ed. New York; London: T&T; Clark, 2004. $40. Pp. 196.In Arguing with Scripture, Chris Stanley studies a select few of Paul's explicit quotations from a rhetorical critical method, informed by reader-response criticism. The question that governs this study is, \\"Was Paul's method of quoting scripture effective in his argumentation?\\" Stanley asks this question from the perspective of the original audience and the effect of Paul rhetoric would have had upon this group. Stanley evaluates Paul's argumentation by asking a clarifying question to the above governing question, \\"How well does Paul's strategy of biblical argumentation cohere with what we can surmise about the capabilities and inclinations of his audiences?\\"In order to test his theory and investigate Paul's use of Scripture in his argumentation, Chris Stanley interacts with only explicit OT citations in this book from Paul's letters to the Romans, Corinthians (1 and 2) and Galatians. Stanley notes that \\"The only quotations that Paul's first-century audience definitely would have recognized are those marked as such within the text,\\" such as: \\"Those introduced by an explicit quotation formula, such as \`as it is written'; \\"those accompanied by a clear interpretive gloss\\"; and \\"those that stand in demonstrable syntactical tension with their present Pauline surroundings (Rom. 9:7; 10:18; Gal. 3:12).\\" Stanley opines that, \\"we should not assume that the original recipients of [Paul's] letters would have recognized even a verbatim quotation from Scripture unless it was marked within the text\\" (47). Besides the quotations coming from the Pauline Hauptbriefe, Stanley's method for selection of quotations to study in this monograph is unclear, but those chosen are some of the more difficult and enigmatic quotations in Pauline interpretation. I will suggest a couple other quotations that would have been helpful to cover below.The next part of Stanley's method is the imaginative one. Here Stanley imagines more diversity among Paul's audience than normally observed by, I think, traditional historical-critical exegetes. Stanley creates three audience types hearing Paul's rhetorical use of the Old Testament. First, \\"the informed audience,\\" who consist of those that would have known the original context of each of Paul's quotations and would have interacted critically with Paul's scriptural argumentations. Second, \\"the competent audience,\\" who consist of those that would have known just enough about the Jewish Scriptures to understand and grapple with Paul's quotations in the rhetorical context in which Paul placed them in his letter. Third, and finally, \\"the minimal audience,\\" who, according to Stanley, would have been characterized as those who had little knowledge of the Jewish Scriptures. Stanley notes, that in his method, the \\"minimal audience\\" would have been made up of \\"illiterate Gentiles, though literate recent converts might also be found here\\" (69). But, since all in this final category were \\"in Christian circles,\\" according to Stanley, \\"[they would have been] aware of the high degree of respect given to the Scriptures\\" (69). This part of Stanley's methodology is greatly influenced by the \\"questionable assumptions that scholars have traditionally made\\" concerning Paul's authorial intentions and the reader's reception of such rhetoric Stanley notes in his introduction (cf. Stanley's 8 assumptions, which are too lengthy to summarize here. Numbers 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 apply most relevantly to the diversity of Paul's audience).An analysis of one chapter will unfold Stanley's method best. In 1 Corinthians we see our best example of difficult citations selected by Stanley, and their mixed reactions by Stanley's imagined audiences. Three citations are covered in 1 Corinthians, and they can be broadly summarized thus (citations/overall response/description of response, per Stanley's judgment):1 Cor. 1:19 = Isa.29:14 - Negative. The citation is vague in Paul's rhetorical context and how it was lifted from its original, OT, context, and thus would have not made much sense in the flow of Paul's argument to any competency level.1 Cor. 10:7 = Ex.32:6 - Positive. The citation would have been persuasive to Paul's Corinthian audience at all competency levels because Paul \\"knitted his own voice so closely with the voice of Scripture\\". (90)1 Cor. 14:21 = Isa. 28:11 - Mixed. The \\"literate\\" (informed) audience would have had serious questions about how Paul cited this verse and its correlation to the original OT context; thus a negative response would have been likely from this audience. However, the \\"competent\\" and \\"minimal\\" audiences would have accepted Paul's arguments, since within Paul's broader 1 Corinthians 12-14 discussion of charismata, the citation fits the context. The \\"competent\\" and \\"minimal\\" audiences would have been unaware that Paul \\"had to ignore both the original sense and original language of Isa 28:11-12 in order to apply the passage to the Corinthians\\" (94).It would not be helpful to go into discussion of each verse covered above in any more depth than already reported. In each case, Stanley pursues a method that simply gives reasons why an audience would or would not accept Paul's argument based upon what seems to be his best judgment of the text. The exegesis is regretfully very thin in the main body of the text. Much of the textual interaction at times can be found in the footnotes, or assumed found in Stanley's previous work (Paul and the Language of Scripture). The lack of exegesis leads this reviewer to have to say that Stanley's conclusions seem largely based upon \\"his best judgment[s] of the text,\\" simply due to the aforementioned problem.Stanley concludes his 1 Corinthians chapter noting that Paul would have had an overall convincing argument, because \\"Even if we ignore his claims to apostolic authority, the fact that Paul was both literate and conversant with sacred texts guaranteed him a measure of respect among the less educated members in his congregations, and Paul did not hesitate to play on that respect in order to advance his arguments.\\" Therefore, according to Stanley, Paul may not have been quoting Scripture correctly, but he made sure it looked like he was. Let the reader decide how convincing this case may be.As mentioned earlier, Stanley's quotations selection is unclear. Two quotations come to mind within Stanley's Pauline pericope that I wonder why he did not cover. First, I wonder why he would not select other verses such as Habakkuk 2:4 in Romans 1:17, which is so hotly debated within literary investigations of Pauline interpretations of Scripture (though this citation is briefly covered in the Galatians chapter where Stanley concludes that nothing in the immediate context of that verse supports Paul's Gal. 3:6-14 case, cf. pp.124-125). In Romans, Habakkuk 2:4 fits his criteria since it is introduced by \\"just as it is written,\\" and would have been a clear quotation to Paul's audience. The analysis of such a quotation would possibly have demonstrated the advantage of a rhetorical reader-centered method against a primarily author-centered literary method; and possibly cleared up the continued opaqueness of this quotation in Paul. Second, Gen 2:24 in 1 Corinthians 6:16 is a verbatim quotation that Paul would have known (and likely his readers would have been aware of) and ostensibly uses in relation to its original, OT, context to make his argument in 1 Corinthians. Paul's metaphorical use of Genesis 2 within this pericope is an interesting analogy to the creation story. I would have been interested to know what Stanley's three focus groups would have felt about such an analogy.To Stanley's credit, he does spot a problem with many who have proceeded in the interpretation of Paul's use of Scripture, namely the audience. Who is Paul's audience? What is their make-up? How diverse are they? How would they respond to scriptural argumentation? But Stanley's method seems to also raise many questions too. I would like to hear better definition on Stanley's view of the three audiences with varying levels of \\"literacy.\\" It first seems that Stanley assumes that biblical literacy equals functional, that is reading and compositional, literacy. Rainer Riesner's work (Jesus als Lehrer, 1981) on teaching in an oral culture according to a rabbinical model of elementary education, also could inform what an audience may and may not have known about scriptural context. Studies like Riesner's may have even further implication for Stanley's study since even allusions to biblical texts would have been recognized by a highly oral culture that the first-century milieu. Secondly, the three audiences varying levels of \\"literacy\\" also seems to directly correspond to their levels of critical thinking skills as well. In Stanley's estimation, their ability to critically think is in quasi-direct correlation to their \\"literacy.\\" I wonder how true of an assessment this may be.Overall, this study has some major positives, but also some unfortunate drawbacks that give great pause to one who may want to recommend such a work. First on the positive. Stanley's method is enlightening and can be built upon for further insight into the Pauline use of scripture. Note especially the section on \\"assumptions\\" as noted above as a helpful \\"shot over the bow,\\" per se, to those unwilling to progress in biblical exegesis and interpretation. Stanley's study gives the NT, and specifically Pauline community, much to consider. Many positive insights can come out of Stanley's method. On the side that creates pause, first, Stanley all too often operates in the hypothetical to be helpful to any specific passages that are in specific focus. Also, I am not sure if Stanley was limited on pages or words, but the book could have beefed up on exegesis and backgrounds to better flesh out Stanley's test cases. Finally, it is a disappointment, though understandable provided the circumstances and the rate of publishing today, that Stanley did not get to interact with Francis Watson's magnum opus, Paul and the Hermeneutics of Faith, published in the same year (by the same publisher, T&T; Clark). One wonders what the interaction between such important works may have looked like.So, \\"Was Paul's method of quoting scripture effective in his argumentation?\\" We are still waiting to hear conclusive evidence, which I think Stanley's method can aide us in discovering. Two-thousand years later as an evangelical-believer, I think I have come to one type of conclusion."},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","review":"First off, to clear things up, this page contains a few reviews of other editions of Pinocchio, which should be seperated out by their proper ISBN numbers. This review refers to the 2005 hardcover from Creative Editions. This is a revised version, first published in 1998, this edition features a new translation of the full, unabridged text, more lyrical than some older translations, and quite faithful to the original Italian text. Also, this edition has several additional illustrations, and has been handsomely re-designed. Altogether, I find this to be my absolute favorite edition of Pinnocchio, and I even bought it again, to replace my much-loved earlier edition. I prefer the new translation to the older translation used before, and the addition of more illustrations and the re-design make this a superior edition.I first found this book in a thrift store, and the inscription indicated it was a misguided gift to a young child from his grand-parents... Don't make this mistake, this version of Pinocchio is definitely not intended for young children. Parents may want to look elsewhere if they are expecting a tame children's book. This is a sophisticated and somewhat graphically illustrated edition, and it is not the Disney-fied version of Pinocchio that many people expect. If you are unfamiliar with the differences between the original story, and the popular sanitized versions, you might be shocked at first. The story is actually very dark, brutal, & surreal, and the illustrations of, say, Pinocchio getting hung in a tree, are really too dark for very young children.That being said, I still whole-heartedly recommend this edition for older readers wanting an artistic and unexpurgated version of this incredible tale. This is one of the best modern translations of the text I've read, so I would recommend it to literature students and people interested in Italian folklore over most of the other versions available.The artwork is what drew me to this book when I first saw it. You simply must see these illustrations to appreciate them. The detailed, large-scale, and subtlely colored drawings are a moody and perfect accompaniment to this version of the text. I pick this book up often, just to look at the amazing pictures and re-read some of my favorite parts.Overall, I am thrilled with this revised edition of a book I already considered a classic among illustrated books. I recommend it to scholars of folklore, lovers of sophisticated illustrated books, and curious readers looking for a dark, surreal and wondrous book."},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","review":"I grew up in Italy and this is the real Macoy. Every Italian grows up reading Collodi's masterpiece while looking at Attilio Mussino's illustrations. This is the Pinocchio we imagine. When I first saw Disney's Pinocchio, I was shocked! So cute and kind... there is nothing to learn from the Disney video. Collodi's Pinocchio, on the other hand, is a child who lacks every sense of altruism, who needs to be educated. Collodi wrote various children's books, always with a pedagogical intent.This is a book for parents to read with their children. It helps remind parents that an apple needn't be peeled, and it helps kids eat the apple with the peel. If you're having problems with your first grader, this is a pedagogical and fun book for all the family."},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","review":"I own several copies of Pinocchio both English and Italian texts, and this is one of my favorite translations as Ms. Lucas takes great care with conveying the original intent of Collodi's story and characters -- (even down to the translated names used for the characters). I'm not sure what the previous reviewer was referencing, (it may be the review from the library school journal--which may have been an abridgement for grade-schoolers, no longer in print)(???). If you find a copy of this book, I'd recommend buying it. It has the full 36 chapters, the original illustrations by Mazzanti, and extensive notes at the end. A lot of care went into this project, better than most other unabridged translations currnently available."},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","review":"Carolo Colloid is the pseudonym of Carlo Lorenzini (1826-1890), an Italian journalist whose translations of French fairy tales in the late 1870s became so popular that he wrote his own, \\"Le Avventure di Pinocchio\\" (The Adventures of Pinocchio) in 1881 which went on to become a children's classic around the world and in 1940 was the basis for the animated film by Walt Disney. Now a new edition of this magnificent and imaginative fairy tale has been superbly illustrated by Roberto Innocenti with intricate artwork of museum gallery quality. This is the original story that includes all of Pinocchio's travels including getting ambushed by vile assassins, strung up in a tree, drowned in the sea, nursed back to health by a beautiful blue-haired fairy, slaying a large serpent through laughter, chained up as a dog to catch thieving weasels, arrested for fighting with classmates, almost eaten by a ravenous fisherman, saving a great mastiff and being saved by the mastiff in return, morphing into a performing donkey, flying on the back of a pigeon, getting swallowed by a gigantic shark, saving Geppetto's life, and so much more that most readers will be completely unaware of if the only contact they've had with this sophisticated story is the Disney movie and the abbreviated children's picture book versions. This simply outstanding and enthusiastically recommended edition of The Adventures Of Pinocchio does full and complete justice to the wonder and storytelling skills that originally made the life and travails of a wooden puppet brought to life so universally beloved."},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","review":"My children and I have just completed this book, with beautiful illustrations by Innocenti, as a read-aloud. I have never been acquainted with any Pinocchio other than the anemic, sanitized Disney versions reflected also in the Little Golden Books. The cautions by others to be careful with young children are worthy of consideration, for this book has terrors aplenty, both in words and illustrations, but I find both words and illustrations to be marvelous.I am beginning to \\"open the door\\" to the difficult realities of the world for my children, and find beautiful allegorical literature to be just the ticket. The illustrations are beautifully rendered, but some are also quite scarey. Frequently, a following page will have a small cameo of a detail from the full illustration of a preceding page which draws the attention to that moral heart of a complex picture. I prefer this introduction to the reality of wickedness in the world (in words and illustrations) to the soul-numbing introductions to wickedness rampant in television and movies which give no time for concern for reflection.Some of my favorite themes are emphasized also - the redeeming power of love and forgiveness, the association of both forgiveness AND repentance prior to the resolution of relationship, the surpassing value of wisdom and the often difficult trials that must come before the heart is ready to embrace it.I am especially struck by Pinocchio's occasional recounting of his adventures as the tale unfolds. In the beginning of the tale, his recounting is filled with blaring examples of falsehood and complete lack of self-examination or evaluation. Everything that happens to him is someone else's fault and there is little association of cause and event. As the tale unfolds, however, Pinocchio's self-examination increases in accuracy, and his self-examination also becomes more accurate.I think this allegorical tale has much value for young children, as does Hinds' Feet on High Places and The Pilgrim's Progress."},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","review":"Collodi knew how mischievous children can be.He was one himself when he went to school in Flroence.In his later years,he was a school reforms official,and wrote many textbooks.He believed the best way to teach is by entertaining as well.This certainly shows in Pinocchio.The little Blockhead gets into all kinds of scrapes because he rushes into things with little consideration.Pinocchio is tricked by the Fox&amp;Cat, advised by the Talking-Cricket,helped by the Fairy with Blue Hair-and ultimately realizes that if he wants to become a real boy,his inner self must be transformed first.The final chapter is a true indication of how Pinocchio has fully become a son to Gepetto.Collodi's story has many film-television-stage versions,but the original is a true classic."},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","review":"!!WOW!! Was that book great! !!WOW!! It deserves 5+ stars! !!WOW!!Most of the story took place in the woods. It was also on different islands. A little bit was in Pinnochio's house. There was a little bit in a fairy's house too.The main characters were Pinnochio, Geppeto, a beautiful fairy (who becomes Pinnochio's mother,) and Jimmeny Cricket. In the middle of the story there was an evil Cat and an evil Fox.The climax of this story is when Pinnochio saw a grave for the beautiful Fairy. Later Pinnochio found out that the fairy was still alive.If you want to find out what else happened, and the end, you must read the book. It's a real page turner.

I can still remember how convoluted the whole thing seemed to me when I was a child. This is the original Pinnochio story, upon which Disney based it's movie. In the book, Jimminy doesn't get past Chapter 3 as anything other than a ghost. The stories of Pinnochio turning into a donkey were very dark, and still leave me wondering about all the symbolism. If you think the story of Pinnochio can be summed up into a morality story about the perils of lying, you only know Disney. This is a book which is suitable for (my opinion) 12 through adult."},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","review":"Amazon! Particularly with children's books and translated books, editions matter! In this case, the reviews are about very different editions. In particular, I recommend Roberto Innocenti's amazing illustrated version, but it may be hard to find. But steer clear of the Dover Classic edition, which is the one pictured above--this is not the full text."},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","review":"Pinocchio is a classic story, and a very different one than the saccharine Disney version most Americans are familiar with. Carlo Collodi's 1882 book lays out the story of a wooden puppet come to awkward life, who proceeds to act out on every selfish, crude and obnoxious impulse ever known to childhood. Each bad decision brings sorrow to his \\"father\\" Gepetto and his \\"mother\\" the Blue Fairy, and brings a terrifying consequence to the puppet -- in the course of the book his feet are burned off, he nearly starves, he is attacked by robbers, he is sent to prison, he's nearly fried as a fish, and he's transformed into a donkey to be sold for money.With each consequence, his penitence for foolish behavior is more real. At the beginning of the book he's the kind of child who sells his schoolbook, purchased by his father's sacrifice of his winter coat, to go to a marionette show. By the end of the story, Pinocchio is the kind of boy who leaps into the sea, risking his life to save his father from a monstrous fish. This gradual transformation culminates in Pinocchio dreaming one night that the Blue Fairy comes to him saying,In return for your good heart, I forgive you all your past misdeeds. Children who love their parents, and help them when they are sick and poor, are worthy of praise and love, even if they are not models of obedience and good behavior. Be good in future, and you will be happy.He wakes in the morning to find that he has become a real boy, with the old wooden puppet limp in the corner.This wasn't originally a children's story, but it is a story about childhood and the taming of childish, reckless impulses. It's a deeply moral tale, often reiterating the importance of working hard, being responsible, and telling the truth. It may open up a discussion about what it means to be a slave to sinful impulses (Romans 6:16-18; Romans 7:21-24), and it confirms the Biblical teaching that \\"folly is bound up in the heart of a child\\" (Proverbs 22:15).It isn't, however, a Christian story, and it lacks the Christian quality of grace which transforms undeserving sinners. The moralism is sometimes quite heavy-handed, and penalties for disobedience are often gruesome. Pinocchio's redemption ultimately comes, not from a power outside himself, but from his own resolve to change when he sees the consequences of his behavior for himself and others. Because of this moral self-reliance, this story may not be a good match for children who are prone to self-righteousness.If you do decide to go with Pinocchio, please avoid the many uninteresting illustrated versions available, and check out Roberto Innocenti's rendition. His surreal, dramatic, and often funny pictures perfectly complement Collodi's vivid style."},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","review":"I had this same book as a child and am so happy to have my childhood memories back again. A few pages were damaged but I replaced them by finding a download of each page of this classic online. This is the real deal Pinocchio, not Walt Disney's version. It's worth every penny spent, to me. The illustrations are priceless!"},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","review":"Most everyone is generally familiar with the story of Pinocchio, although this familiarity is usually the result of the Walt Disney animated film. Actually, the movie does a reasonably good job of following the book, although it leaves a lot out and makes quite a few changes. A master carpenter named Anthony, whom everyone calls Maestro Cherry, comes across a piece of magic wood. He gives it to his friend Geppetto, a puppeteer who fashions a puppet whom he names Pinocchio. The puppet immediately runs off. Geppetto chases him and is put in jail when he tries to punish his wayward puppet. When Pinocchio returns home, the Talking Cricket tries to warn him about the error of his ways, but he kills it with a hammer, though it reappears two or three times later as a ghost.Geppetto gets out of jail, but instead of going to school Pinocchio wanders off again to see a puppet show and is taken by the puppeteer Swallowfire who eventually releases him and sends him back to Geppetto with five coins. However, Pinocchio meets the Fox and the Cat, who talk him into going to the Field of Miracles in the land of Boobies where they tell him he can plant his five coins and they will grow into thousands. The two swindle him out of one coin for dinner and then leave him at an inn. When Pinocchio goes out to find them, they disguise themselves, try to rob him, and eventually hang him. He is saved by a little girl who turns out to be \\"the fairy with the blue hair.\\" She invites him to live with her and even sends for Geppetto, but he follows the Fox and Cat again and loses his coins to them. Later, after several other adventures, he returns to find that the little girl has died and shortly after that learns that Geppetto went to sea in search of him and was lost, perhaps swallowed by the great shark (not Monstro the whale) swimming in that area. He even ends up with his friend Candle-Wick in \\"The Land of Toys\\" and turns into a donkey. Will Pinocchio ever make it home? Will he find his Papa? Will he see the Blue Fairy again?It appears that Collodi, penname for Carlo Lorenzini, originally had not intended the novel as children's literature. However, the first fifteen chapters, at the unhappy ending of which Pinocchio dies a gruesome death by hanging, were serialized in a children's magazine between 1881 and 1883. At the request of his editor, Collodi added chapters 16-36, in which the Fairy rescues Pinocchio and eventually transforms him into a real boy. The entire story then was published as a book for children in February, 1883. Thus, it allegorically deals with some serious themes but in the end Pinocchio acquires a deeper understanding of himself, making the story suitable for children. The original English translation was made in 1892 by Mary E. Murray and is used in the Penguin Classics edition (2002). The Puffin Classics edition (1996) uses a translation by E. Harden. New York Review Books published a new translation in 2008 by Geoffrey Brock. The Oxford University Press edition that I bought has \\"an authoritative new translation\\" by Ann Lawson Lucas. I suppose that Lucas's translation is all right, but instead of leaving Gepetto's name as it is, she translates it as \\"Old Joe.\\" Personally, I think that I would have rather read Murray's translation. All in all, I enjoyed reading the book. Though a little grim at times, it does teach some important lessons."},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","review":"This is a classic and deserves to be on everyone's book shelf, young and old. Carlo Collodi wrote the Pinnochio story in 1881 and in book form in 1883. Over the 127 years since then there have been many versions published with several different illustrators but to me the best is the original, illustrated by Attilo Mussino. His 300 color illustrations are wonderful depictions of Italy of that time. He goes beyond mere illustrations. It's art! The Adventures of Pinnochio was published in the U.S. in 1925. There have been several reissues since. I missed out on a 1928 copy of this book at an auction but was so impressed with the contents I looked for it on Amazon and was fortunate to find a seller offering a 1989 hardcover at a good price and in like new condition!

Murray and illustrated by Fritz Kredel, and published by Grosset and Dunlap. Since Amazon elects to combine the reviews of several different versions of 'Pinocchio' under each of the product pages, it is sometimes difficult to tell exactly which version goes with which review. To the best of my knowledge, this version is not abridged nor edited, and was first published in 1946.Well, here's another read-aloud-before-bedtime book, though truth be told, it didn't rise to the same level as some of our other attempts. I enjoyed reading it, with its variety of characters, which gives me an opportunity to indulge in some limited stagecraft, but I think my daughter was only semi-enthusiastic. She seemed to respond well to some passages, though some others were surely a little beyond her.(She's almost nine)'Pinocchio', as translated here, should not glibly be assumed to be suitable for all ages - some children may be bothered by its images, such as when Pinnocchio is hanged by the Fox and Cat, or when the puppets friend, Candlewick, after being transformed into a donkey, is literally worked to death. Other times, the writing is geared more toward an adult's understanding, and the humor is a trifle more complex than what I would assume most young children are capable of - several scenes were clearly over my daughter's head. I don't want to scare anyone away - I never thought there was anything inappropriate in the book for us, but everyone has different opinions on that matter. If you feel your children are especially sensitive, you may want to preview beforehand, and then make your own judgment.Still, 'Pinocchio' has many things going for it. The movie follows the high points of storyline fairly well - if you've seen it then you know the basic plot here as well - but the difference is how it reflects its times as opposed to the sanitized film sixty years later. Carlo Collodi's version may be a little too gritty for some parents - unless they are ready to explore more textured worlds with their kids - but it still toes a moral line. And I believe the exposure to the oddness of Pinocchio's world - which would have been fantastic, but not odd in Collodi's time - is enriching in our too-homogeneous world.Well worthwhile, but like many classics, it is a product of its time. Some respond better than others to that - for my daughter, it ended up as an 'I like it' rather than 'I love it'.A quick note on the edition: This is a very nice book for a youngster, sturdy, and with slightly larger print than usual. That last fact is also nice for an oldster like me. The illustrations by Kredel are mostly black-and-white, studded throughout the text, with a few full color plates taking up an entire page. Without other translations to compare it to, I can only say that I didn't notice anything that sounded too peculiar, other than a decision to translate the puppet theater owner's name from Mangiafuoco to the literal Fire Eater. Altogether an attractive addition for a child's bookshelf."},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","review":"Pinocchio is one of the most beloved and recognizable of all children stories characters. The story of Pinocchio, written by Carol Collodi and originally published in 1881, has been published, republished, retold, and adapted countless times over the last 130 years.

It is an excellent opportunity for anyone to get reacquainted with this talking marionette, and an even better chance for all those who have never read or seen the story in the first place.

Its aim is to teach children (and especially boys) some of the basic character-building lessons: it's important to obey your parents or other authority figures, it's important to study and work hard, chasing after easy life and cheap thrills inevitably ends in a disaster.

This is the French fairytale that I read first, the book that was handed down to me from my Grandparents and given as a gift to them by a family friend; the illustrator Charles Mozley- who knew my Grandparents intimately. The personal description from (as my mother called him \`Uncle Charles') was touching, and the stunning hand drawn illustrations, add that real special element that makes this book so unique.*unlike the first edition that is listed on Amazon, the copy that I own is the first one made and hand-illustrated by the artist before being put into print*The tale is about love, friendship, loyalty and honesty and which certainly is memorable as to remain with you throughout childhood and into adulthood with its clear message. Heartwarming, affecting and so powerful this emotive narrative will have you in tears, as you experience such a rollercoaster of events within this compelling read. The love between flesh and blood, father and son is quite remarkable and like most family's it is something that can never be quite equaled to. Nor is the value of knowing right from wrong and understanding the importance of selflessness, thoughtfulness and how in life one should put others first. At times this book I found scary as a young child (around 5 yrs old when my mother first read it to me at bedtime), especially when the young boys who were corrupted were transformed into Donkey's! It is a journey of a lifetime, a character-driven tale with some distinctive characters (i.e. Cricket), dramatic and full of intensity that has you glued to the pages - this is something truly astonishing and heartwarming.Pinocchio is a young boy and whose egotistical mannerisms and lying, has the most severe consequences; such as being turned into wood and his nose growing longer and longer... His father loves his son so much and only wishes that he could become flesh and blood again, but for this to transpire Pinocchio must learn to be a good boy. As he leaves home and embarks on the most extraordinary, horrendous and unexpected of adventures where he almost looses his life this young boy takes note of the depths of his father's kind heart and the power of love.This particular edition, 1959, is so special and which is something that shall remain within my family for generations to come. Complete with such stunning illustrations by an artist who was a close friend of my Grandparents (who were also well-known artists themselves), this is something to treasure and which one cannot compare to the printed, contemporary editions of today. The story is something quite unforgettable and outstanding, that which is loved by generations both young and old and which reminds all of us the important things in life. I would recommend this as a first book to read to your children, to your nieces and nephews and for your own personal pleasure...For when you wish upon a star, dreams really DO come true!"},{"Title":"ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO","review":"No other Pinocchio would do for my six year-old grandson, who hung on the conclusion of each chapter like his life depended on it.

It has action, adventure, romance, intrigue and of course style which is something Sindey Sheldon's books never lack."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"This really does read like a super opulent soapie...perhaps it has been put on film and, if it was, it must have looked gorgeous. In the turbulent days of the seventies following Franco's death and the return to the throne of the Spanish royal house, bitter fighting still continued between the members of the Basque underground, ETA, and the Spanish army. Killings occurred on both sides with reprisals being swift and horrifying, especially the manner of execution by the Government...the garrotte, a brutal, slow and inhumane method of death. Under the command of Colonel Ramon Acoca, the Spanish army is searching for the leader of the resitance, Jaime Miro, and in his determination to capture Jaime, Acoca orders the search and desecration of a convent. Some nuns are killed, others raped and four of the nuns escape the slaughter under the protection of Jaime. The nuns are hoping to reach the sanctuary of another convent some distance away, with the exception of one of them, who is the daughter of an Italian Mafiosa, who has been hiding from the police in the convent, biding her time to escape to Switzerland. Romances flourish, traitors are exposed and lots happen on their trek through the hills of the Spanish countryside. Perhaps it's predictable fiction but it was a fun read in vivid Technicolour !"},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"This book is entertaining. It is not as enthralling like other books Sheldon has written such as The Conspiracy Theory, The Stars Shine Down or Nothing Lasts Forever. I found myself bored at times when reading this and then in a &quot;can't put it down&quot; mode at other times. If you are a Sheldon fan, it is worth reading, but if you are new to this author try a different title first. He is an exceptional story teller."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"Wonderfully written, this book portraits you to a world unlike any other. That was the first book by Sidney Sheldon I read, a long time ago, and it's still my all time favorite.The story, full of twists make you seat on the edge of the chair the whole time. You suffer, laugh, run and have fun with the characters. It's the kind of book that Mr. Sheldon seem to have forgotten how to write. The adorable scenarios in Spain are only a little thing of the whole that the book shows. Believe me, reading this book it's like watching a movie, like the ones we watch and never forget and want everyone we know to watch it too. That's the way I feel about that book and I guarantee you that's the way you will feel after taking this piece with you to bed.Marco Aurelio."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"I have read and loved every book Sidney Sheldon has ever written. But this is by far his best, I have read it 3 times!! This is a story that stays with you, you have to read it again and again."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"This book was for sure, one of his best. It had everything, and his writing was so well done you would believe you were there. You can almost feel the emotion come off the page, with each turn. This is an astonishing book that did get the recognition it deserved."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"Sidney Sheldon's potboiler dwells on a compelling subject matter: the turmoil of a nation embroiled in a bloody civil war. Set against the timeless and haunting landscape of Spain, Sheldon weaves intricate strands of Spanish history and politics into a tangled tapestry of adventure and romance. By depicting the enigmatic and rugged Spanish terrain with broad but deft strokes of colours, Spain comes across as a colourful juxtaposition of the past and present, a land of eternal passion and unceasing bloodshed. He is adept at capturing a historical ambience and the nuances of affinities between people thrown together by circumstances....The Sands of Time has a dramatic poignancy that demonstrates Sheldon's measured writing style, which through sheer imagination succeeds in creating a drama of political intrigue. There was no dearth of dramatic punctuation and the narrative was not bloated with extraneous dialogue; his dialogue is irrefragably excellent for the revelation of characters and his command of the idioms of ordinary speech permits him to achieve a fine naturalness.The Sands of Time deals with the tragedy of a land torn by strife, unfolded with an insight into the characters that people the vast Spanish landscape. It pricks and provokes...a people and their ideals, beliefs and freedom, and at the same time delves into the subtle territory of forbidden love. Much of the novel is a joy to read and it may linger in our minds long after other easily assimilated pulp of the same genre have passed beyond our memory. This is also Sheldon's last well-written novel; his more recent flaccid potboilers have somehow become a reviewer's nightmare."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"This was a good reading experience. Sheldon had me flipping page after page, and I devoured this book in no time. I loved the flashback style and riviting story line. I thank the author for introducing the readers to the fact/history behind the story. In all, it was great entertainment."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"This was the first book of Sidney Sheldon's I read, about fifteen or so years ago. I was looking for something at a bookstore to take on a trip with me, it was sitting there, 7.99, and I said what the heck. It looked good, it looked readable. When I started reading it, I couldn't believe that I hadn't heard of Sidney Sheldon before. This story follows multiple characters, all of which are nuns who are forced out of their convent. This a globetrotting story from a master storyteller for whom we should all feel sorry that has passed away.This book is a romance novel of top order. It's a brilliant action adventure that enraptures you in the story and even though you tell yourself that you're only going to read one more chapter, you're saying that ten chapters after the last time you've said it. It keeps you away, it keeps you at the edge of your seat, it keeps you entertained, laughing, crying, swooning, and more. This book is brilliant. It is top of the line fiction from a top of the line suspense storyteller.I heard it was turned into a TV mini-series at one point, God how I wish I could find it.I warn you, if you read this book, be prepared to want to read every other book that Sideny Sheldon had ever written, it's going to set you back some, but, it'll be worth it, trust me."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"This author & this book are just too good. He's right up there with James A Michener as one of my all time favourite authors. Coming from Brisbane I've always hated Sydney but boy do I love Sidney LOL. This book has it all; action, romance, pacing & it's even informative."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"The story is set on the backdrop of the Basque revolutionaries and four nuns who escape from a convent under attack. At first I didn't think I would be able to keep all the information in order as there were many variations of Spanish names and settings, however, it didn't take long to get completely absorbed in the story as Sheldon began to \\"spin the tale\\" based on true-life controversy. Sister Gracieala (introduced to the reality of a crude world through the many \\"uncles\\" brought home by her mother), Sister Lucia (Mafia princess), Sister Megan (forgotten orphan) and Sister Theresa (oldest of the four escaped nuns who had grown up in the shadow of a beautiful sister and although she had the voice of a song bird, she never could quite meet her family's high expectations). The Sisters are introduced to us and their stories are flashbacks in the book with each one defining the reasons for their commitment to the Cistercian convent in &Aacute;vila, Spain. As hero to the Basque people and an abomination to the Spanish government, Jamie Mir&oacute; meets up with the sisters when the convent is attacked by a ruthless Colonel Acoca and the Spanish army, out to teach a lesson to the people of the Catholic Church. Once Jamie and his men take the good Sisters under their wing, with his group of men and one woman, the story moves in many very interesting directions. So as not to give anything away, I will stop here and say \\"The Sands of Time\\" is another Sheldon work of art. In my opinion, not as good as \\"The Other Side of Midnight\\" or \\"Master of the Game,\\" the book is definitely a very well written story with extremely unique, captivating and interesting characters."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"It's unbelievable how Sidney Sheldon draws his characters, I could almost see them and hear them talking. I have read many other novels for Sheldon, this is still my favourite. If u don't have it, u miss A LOT"},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"This novel is Outstanding. It reads like a 3-D movie. This story takes you on a journey through Spain and into the lives of four nuns. Each one hides their very own secrets which are all exposed--some of them are quite naughty! With equal parts of pain, suspense, romance and danger, THE SANDS OF TIME will become one of your favorite Sheldon novels of all time. Get it today, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"As other Sheldon's books, you can't put it down. The story is simple but well developed: he knows how to keep you interested along the 400 pages.It's about the terrorist group ETA (Spain's most terrible threat nowadays) and his leader, Jaime Mir&oacute; (Sheldon should have been more careful when he chose a Catalan surname for the leader of the Basque Nationalist Group). In their terror raid they end up with some nuns that become their companions.You'll surely like it unless you're looking for a book that makes you think."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"I loved this book by Sydney Sheldon...it was an emotional rollercoaster, and I could relate to the storyline of why someone would want to escape the perils of their young life. An excellent read, and I would suggest it to people who can easily decipher the unique manner in which Mr. Sheldon wrote the timelines of the story. A great book!"},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"I'm a major fan of Mr. Sheldon and buy everything he writes. I've read everyone, some are great while others are disappointing ... but this book was too hard to get into. Was not an &quot;easy&quot; read like his others, and was difficult to keep track of the storyline...I kept having to read things over and finally said..WHERE IS A STUART WOODS books!"},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"I liked this book, but being the Sheldon fan I am, I do not recommend it as 1st reading. The fellow reader may feel a bit confused. Nonetheless, regardless of that, an enjoyable book!"},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"I found this book a good read, but occasionally a little lost as it moves very quickly and sometimes seems to loose itself. Great if you are already a Sheldon fan, but not so good if you are not used to his work."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"Sidney Sheldon's adventure is set amid the Basque rebellion in Spain in the 70s. Sadistic Colonel Acoca raids a convent, searching for the famous rebel leader, Jaime Miro. Four nuns, each with shocking past lives, escape and find themselves traveling the countryside with Miro's band of partisans. It is a cat and mouse game of chase between the ruthless Acoca and charismatic Miro, who suspects one of his friends is an informant.The action speeds along at a frantic, life-or-death pace, as in typical Sheldon style, there are endless close-calls and a conclusion that will leave you breathless and satisfied. This is one of the author's best, combining thrills, romance, politics, and ultimate justice. Fans of Sidney Sheldon's novels will definitely enjoy \\"The Sands of Time.\\"Kona"},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"This book is a page turner, but I have a question: who are the good guys? The answer as it says in the book: &quot;The difference between patriot and the rebel it depends on who is in charge of the people&quot;.The interesting of this book is that at the end everybody gets what he or she (almost) deserves.The book has everything, romance, religion, action, etc. if you have a long flight maybe you will read all the book on one sitting."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"You can't beat a good Sidney Sheldon book on a rainy day!

It must of took him forever to research all the Spanish culture in this book. I thought it was very well written. My favorite thing about reading this book, was reading about the stories of the nun's. They all had some awsome past, and you had to keep reading to find out about them. I loved that. I also loved the way it ended. It was just a really great book."},{"Title":"The Sands of Time","review":"JUST LOVE IT IT WAS A GIFT FOR A CO-WORKER THAT LOVES AND AS FOR HER BIRTHDAY I ORDER AND SHE TOTALY LOVED IT.

I have read many of Sidney Sheldon's book and I feel he is a very good writer. He always has some sort of suspense and drama in every story."},{"Title":"The Arya Samaj: Hindu without Hinduism","review":"The thesis of this book is basically that the Arya Samaj is not Hindu by religion, but only by culture, and therefore should be legally protected as a religious minority in India. However, the book jumps around a lot and mentions all sorts of things which have no relation whatsoever to the thesis but simply go to show how partial the author is to this movement. The book serves to prove the thesis listed in a single sentence above, and it does so at great length... for those interested in the proof, the book can be interesting; for all others, just read the first sentence of my review and that should be enough!"},{"Title":"The Hope Within (Heirs of Montana #4)","review":"Once again a very well written book.

Wanted the story to go on and on. The Hope Within was a great ending however."},{"Title":"The Hope Within (Heirs of Montana #4)","review":"I picked up the first book in this series a week ago and literally devoured each of them. Each is full of unexpected twists and heartache, but this fourth book literally had me sitting up into the wee morning hours, tears streaming down my face and a heavy feeling in my chest, as I read of each characters' struggles to honor God (or in the case of some characters, themselves!) I found so many ways to relate to Dianne - headstrong and decisive and often not understanding the effect that her words had on her husband. In particular, I appreciated Ardith's struggle with loss after loss and how that scarred her - but eventually made her strong. This series has left me with much to ponder, as my own family has struggled through the past several years and is trying to focus upon the hope within (of course, that Hope is found only in our Lord, Jesus Christ.)"},{"Title":"The Hope Within (Heirs of Montana #4)","review":"This was an excellent story as were all in this series. The book held my attention to the very end. The only criticisim I would have, there is so much tragedy throughout the book that it made my own heart feel very heavy until the very end when the \\"hope within\\" was realized. Tracy Peterson is an excellent author giving a lot of attention to detail. I can easily see another sequel to this book as several of the characters lives had unfinished endings."},{"Title":"The Hope Within (Heirs of Montana #4)","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Literally. I ignored my children (and my chores!) and read it in one day (which is an extreme rarity for me). Maybe it's because I'm the same age as Dianne in this book, but I WAY identified with her struggles, especially the conflict with the in-laws (which hit a little close to home) and subsequent estrangement with Cole. I cried when Dianne lost the baby (what can I say - I'm a mother!) and I struggled with her seemingly \\"easy\\" re-acceptance of Cole. There is so much heartbreak in each of these books - I was relieved that it ended on a positive note.

Their ranch has burned and they are \\"temporarily\\" living in town which she hates..in fact, she fears Cole is going to force her to stay there and she starts turning bitter against him....and their marriage falters...then word comes of the impending death of Cole's father in Kansas.Cole wants to share his wife and children with his family for the first time ever, but when they arrive in Kansas, Diane and the children are treated worse than garbage. Dianne really tries, pulls more than her weight, but finally her strength is gone...and she is pregnant, unknown yet to Cole.Cole has been harboring a secret fear of restarting the ranch back in Montana and feels it never really was his but Dianne's and more truly, Koko's and her children's.In his tender moments, he tries to please all the women in his life and finds this is impossible and he loses the most important one. The reader is on their seat's edge for several pages.So many things are drawn together in this book, we again see Trenton, Ardyth the pianist, the mean and cheating greedy neighbor rancher, the honor driven Indian who really loves Dianne but puts integrity over all...it is he and Koko who nurse Dianne through a near death experience... it seems the author is wrapping up this series.Please, Tracie, don't leave us hanging."},{"Title":"The Hope Within (Heirs of Montana #4)","review":"I love this series! \\"To Dream Anew\\" is perhaps the best book in the series, but this fourth book is just as enjoyable to read. I hope there will be more to come!The only aspect of this book that bothered me was the situation between Cole, his mother and sisters, and Diane. While Cole struggles to take care of his mother and be loyal to his wife at the same time, he really chooses his mother over his own family by making the decision to stay with his mother.Diane is the one who lead Cole to Christ. He has known her and her faith for years; yet while they are living with Cole's mother, Cole seems to believe his mother, who curses God, over his own wife. The fact that he didn't see Diane hit his mother yet believes she actually could have seems a bit out of character.Also, Diane later apologies to Cole for leaving his side, stating that a good Christian wife doesn't leave her husband's side, \\"no matter how ugly the situation.\\" Cole's mother was abusing Cole and Diane's children! To allow that to continue in the name of being a \\"good Christian wife\\" is absurd. To not protect your children is not being a good Christian parent!Other than this character flaw, the book is remarkable!"},{"Title":"The Hope Within (Heirs of Montana #4)","review":"Having read the entire 'Heirs of Montana' collection, this was one of my favorites out of the four books. Although the plot twists of book 3 were amazing, this book took on a different tone.For most of the book I was crying right along with Dianne, angry at the treatment by her husband, Cole (no matter how honorable his intentions). However, the plot twists were still present with Mayra's unbelievable faith and outspokeness in her 'pursuit' of Zane. Peterson also left what seemed like an unlikely coupling from the beginning in the characters of Joshua and Ardith alone without any pressure. I went on to recommend this book to my mother, as she often encounters in-law 'issues' so to speak, so now she can compare the fictional in-laws to her own experiences.I highly recommend this to anyone who has read the series, and for those that haven't, start at book 1 (from having started at book 3, trust me, you'll get more fun out of it!) but be sure to finish it out with this book! This is one of those classic books when you need a good cry."},{"Title":"The Hope Within (Heirs of Montana #4)","review":"1886 fire burns down the Diamond V ranch house and several other facilities forcing the Selby family to relocate to nearby Virginia City, Montana Territory. Dianne Selby hates living in town, but her spouse Cole keeps delaying their return with one pretext after another.Cole learns that his father Hallam is dying so he, Dianne and their children travel to Kansas to say their last respects starting with his dad meeting his wife and grandchildren for the first time and helping his mother Mary cope with her loss and work the farm. Upon completing the trek, Mary sets the tone greeting Dianne about never visiting when her spouse was healthy. After Hallam dies, Mary pressures Cole to run the family farm he inherited while remaining nasty towards his wife and children; Dianne decides to end her cruelty to her grandchildren by taking them with her and going home though it means deserting her husband.The final inspirational historical novel in the Heirs of Montana quartet, THE HOPE WITHIN, is a terrific family drama that vividly portrays late nineteenth century life on the Great Prairie especially in Montana and Kansas. The story line is character and geographical-climatic driven as the audience obtains a taste of the era through simple interwoven into the plot nuances; for instance Cole's parents and his wife and children never met before implies distance (communication and transportation). Fans will cherish the finale as the extended cast provides depth and Dianne sees hope that her husband will come back to her and their children as THE HOPE WITHIN her remains strong because of her belief in God.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Hope Within (Heirs of Montana #4)","review":"I loved Tracie Peterson's Hope Within!

Great read!"},{"Title":"Nature Heals: The Psychological Essays of Paul Goodman","review":"This volume collects two dozen essays by the brilliant anarchist critic Paul Goodman. The introduction by Goodman's disciple Taylor Stoehr presents a cogent and intimate portrait of Goodman's contribution to pyschology, providing useful context for his wide ranging selections of Goodman's psychological writings: his engagements with Freud and Reich, and his psychological approaches to literature, sociology, and self-knowledge.As always, Goodman thrills with his agile, vivid, humane prose, and the book is chock full of penetrating aphorisms.As the collection is largely of short works written for periodicals, it can sometimes feel a little breezy; those looking for a more comprehensive picture of Goodman's psychology would do well to seek out his \\"Gestalt Therapy.\\""},{"Title":"HOME AGAIN","review":"From the back cover:Jody Calhoun and Chase Spence were at odds even before they met. She was an antiques lover who wanted to restore the Victorian mansion known as Spence House to its former glory. He was a wealthy developer who was about to tear it down. But when Jody put herself in front of the wrecking ball, she never dreamed she'd be sent back in time, on a mission to right a wrong for a restless ghost--or that the infuriating Chase would soon be right by her side.Thrust in the middle of the War Between the States, forced to play the parts of long-lost lovers, Jody and Chase were pulled together by the same forces that had pitted them against each other. As the line between dream and reality faded, each had the feeling that they had met before, that they were destined for each other. And these sworn adversaries would be forced to recognize the timeless power of their blossoming love before the spirits could be at peace, before they could return to their own time, before they could ever truly be home again.And my review:I love time-travel stories, but this one wasn't up to snuff. The first major problem is that you have to read over 1/3 of the book before the time-travel part of it even happens. I mean, that's what I want to read the story for. I shouldn't have to slog through 100 pages of silly bickering to get there.That was my other major complaint. I felt that the conflict between the hero and heroine was a little weak. Jody had gotten fixated on his ancestral home, and wanted to save it no matter what. After a while, she started to sound like a whining child. I mean, come on, that is not your house! You have no say in what Chase, who is the OWNER, does with it! Just because you have some weird disordered attachment to it doesn't mean you have the right to keep pestering the guy.Another complaint was that Jody and Chase were not well-rounded characters. They were just there, like a pair of cardboard cutouts. This was especially the case with Chase's character. I couldn't see any reason why Jody should fall in love with Chase, apart from the fact that he was gorgeous. Yeah, as if good looks are enough. I also couldn't really see why Chase should fall in love with Jody, since she came across as a spoiled brat. Maybe she improved by the end of the book, but to tell you the truth, I couldn't make it that far.Not many authors can handle time-travel romance very well. For a good time-travel romance, I recommend REMEMBER LOVE by Susan Plunkett or A TIME TO DREAM by Sherry Lewis."},{"Title":"Opening to Inner Light: The Transformation of Human Nature and Consciousness","review":"Extraordinary book. Not a long book, but very rich and deep. Synthesizes many philosophical texts and ideas in conjunction with an examination of metaphors and analogies used to describe breakthroughs, awakenings, cosmic realizations and the like. A pleasure to read, with many valuable and leading footnotes. I could often anticipate his lines of thought, but they were so well-stated that they served to bring me further illumination, as well as affirmation of thoughts I already had. It's hard to convey how good this book is. Metzner very closely associated with Leary, but this work deals very little with drugs."},{"Title":"Opening to Inner Light: The Transformation of Human Nature and Consciousness","review":"This book is an earlier edition of The Unfolding Self: Varieties of Transformative Experience, which has additional chapters. Provides an organized inventory of the various metaphors that have been used to describe the phenomena encountered in the mystic dissociative state.Dissociative psychoactives are mentioned in an integrated manner throughout the book. Benny Shanon's book Antipodes of the Mind is a good companion volume similarly explaining dissociative-state cognitive phenomenology as the origin of mythic metaphor."},{"Title":"Opening to Inner Light: The Transformation of Human Nature and Consciousness","review":"I recommend this book for anyone who explore the inner path and need a roadmap to understand what happens on the way."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Open and Closed: A Don Packham and Frank Mitchell Mystery","review":"Though only a few years old, the relatively popular North London's Bath Street Library is closing because the party in power changed and wants to eradicate any progressive traces initiated by their predecessors. The Libraries Open for Everyone protests the closing with a sit-in. However, someone murders one of the eight protestors, popular activist octogenarian Bert \\"Bolshi\\" Rosen, who was carrying a handgun as if he expected trouble, but obviously never used it when he was strangled to death with a ligature by someone who knew him; one of the magnificent seven protesters.Cowden CID DC Frank Mitchell and his superior DI Don Packham head the investigation into the locked door mystery. They struggle with why Bert the Bolshi was packing a gun, but hope to eliminate suspects by accounting for their time even bathroom breaks. They interrogate the seven suspects beginning with the branch librarian Dot Estevez, but finding the guilty party remains difficult to find as no one has the opportunity and the motive is even murkier.Though the who-done-it never takes center stage, the cast make for an amusing tale. Readers will appreciate the sardonic wit of the DI and the wary acceptance by his direct employee. The seven suspects are an eccentric lot while the victim adds to the overall feel of a zany group starring ironically in a cozy. Mat Coward writes a fun British police procedural.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Pegnitz junction; a novella and five short stories","review":"This volume starts with a novella-length story which might be read as a metaphor for the way a writer like Gallant perceives other people. The story's protagonist 'hears' the personal narratives of her fellow travelers inside her head, and one might guess that a writer like Gallant (or Chekov, or V.S. Pritchett) could likewise 'hear' detailed stories in their imaginations as they observed the people around them. But of course that's only my take on the story, not necessarily the author's intent.The other stories in the book are shorter and often sharper. &#34;The Old Friends&#34; illuminates the relationship between an aging German police official and a Jewish-German actress, with a striking shift in viewpoint from one character to the other. In &#34;An Autobiography&#34; a woman tells how she abandoned a careless and dangerous young love for a safe but solitary life; the final lines reveal the emotion flowing beneath her logically arranged existence.Gallant is the rare author who creates characters who seem capable of independent thought, of misunderstanding and surprising themselves. In &#34;O Lasting Peace&#34; the protagonist, stuck in an apartment with relatives she cordially despises and having just rejected a suitor she describes as &#34;a peasant who sits with one foot on the other&#34;, says she wanted to run on to the balcony and scream for him to come back &#34;but I was afraid of knocking the flowerpots over.&#34; She appears not to understand her own desperation, adding only that &#34;I've forgotten why I wanted to mention this.&#34;These stories are European and cosmopolitan. The characters are often expatriates or in transit. Gallant's people are submerged in a peculiar everyday life, absorbed in routine but at the same time uneasy. They seem to suspect it can't last. Yet they persist. &#34;Ernst's duffelbag is packed. He has nothing to do... But Ernst, who has been in uniform since he was seven, and defeated in every war, has never been prepared.&#34;The volume pictured here was published by Random House in 1984; it appears that Emblem Editions republished the book with a different cover in 2002. I'm glad to see it re-issued; two of the stories here (&#34;An Autobiography&#34; and &#34;The Old Friends&#34;) are not included in Gallant's &#34;Collected Stories&#34; and it would be a shame to see them go out of print."},{"Title":"The Pegnitz junction; a novella and five short stories","review":"It's strange that, as someone who loves contemporary literature and has become a devotee of the short story form, I had never heard of Mavis Gallant until the summer of 2012 when The New Yorker magazine published excerpts of her European diaries from the 1950s. Mavis Gallant, I thought, who the deuce is she?? Odd too that Gallant is originally from Canada, as is Alice Munroe, a fellow artist and equally accomplished master of the short story, although Monroe is a generation younger than Gallant who is now ninety. It turns out that Gallant has been publishing her stories in The New Yorker for many decades, and as I avidly read her diary excerpts last summer, I also began to order some of her books. \\"The Pegnitz Junction\\" was one of them--some reviewer had listed the title piece--a novella actually--as one of her best stories.It seems to me that to be a writer of depth and far-ranging resonance, a writer has to become possessed by the spirits of their creations. That each character, to be believed, has to have his or her own voice and distinct rationale for being. Gallant, from the beginning of her writing career, seems not to have missed a beat when it comes to inhabiting her characters and having them speak through her supreme grasp of language, psychology, and the particular zeitgeist of an era. If I were to pinpoint one major influence that Gallant explores endlessly in her work, it would be the Second World War and its aftermath. As the defining moment of the twentieth century, Gallant began to take the pulse of the European society into which she segued when she moved to Europe in 1950 to pursue her destiny as a writer. That she mastered the art of listening is beyond question, and her ability to parse the afterimages of the war and their magnetic pull on individual psyches is the tale that she tells over and over as if through the lens of a kaleidoscope. The same pieces of the tragedy, the endless permutations of affect.I have read three books of her stories so far beginning with her first one \\"The Other Paris\\", followed by \\"Paris Stories\\" (edited by Michael Ondaatje), and then \\"The Pegnitz Junction\\", and they represent a kind of Tarot deck of the twentieth-century mind trying to rebirth itself after the devastation of an unbelievable horror. Gallant probes with a surgeon's scalpel our collective mind as it continually questions itself about whether anyone still has the capacity to love and genuinely connect. That Gallant is a genius of the written word, there is no doubt; and she fills one with hope that art is at very least a matter of the quest for meaning and that the writing of fiction is a grappling with the disparate counterpoint in the voices of a generation that speak and then responds to its own echoes--sighing, laughing, crying, praying, cursing, and singing into a darkness whose only redemption is the act of creation in the mind of a great artist."},{"Title":"Becoming German: The 1709 Palatine Migration to New York","review":"In 1709, thousands of Germans fled the hard times of Southwestern Germany and made their way down the Rhine to Rotterdam, where they were transported to London. There Queen Anne took pity on them and eventually provided transportation to New York, arriving in the winter of 1710/11, where they were supposed to work in a naval stores business making pine tar and pitch for use in British ships. They settled in the upper Hudson River Valley in East Camp and West Camp in Columbia and Ulster Counties, NY. Although some Germans have apparently been in North American from the very beginning, this was the first large scale migration of Germans to the New World (about 3000 people in 11 ships). Most with German names whose ancestry traces to 18th century New York prove to be part of this great Palatine migration.Otterness is the third recounting of the Palatines' story. Others include Walter Alan Knittle, \\"The Early Eighteenth Century Palatine Emigration: A British Government Redemptioners Project to Manufacture Naval Stores,\\" Genealogical Publishing Co., Baltimore, MD, 1937, 1965 and Sanford H. Cobb, \\"The Story of the Palatines: An Episode in Colonial History,\\" GP Putnam's Sons, NY, 1897. Reprinted by Heritage Books, Bowie, MD, 1988. Cobb is the original focusing on the stories told by the Palatines themselves. Knittle is the more professional treatment which compares the stories with the written records. Otterness now adds the extensive genealogical information obtained by Henry Z. Jones in the preparation of his three books (The Palatine Families of New York, 1985; More Palatine Families, 1991; and Even More Palatine Families, 2002). Jones researched the old church books of Germany where he was able to identify records of hundreds of Palatines who made the voyage to New York. Hence, Otterness is able to expand the story to include information on the distribution of the Germans.The naval stores business soon failed. The Germans felt mistreated and wanted the better lands in the Schoharie Valley, they felt they had been promised. But they were held by contract to the Queen to work in the naval stores business in return for their transportation. After the failure of the business, they faced starvation once rations were cut off. Some scattered to New York City, to New Jersey, and to work for nearby farmers, but many settled in the Schoharie against the advice of Gov. Hunter. There they were unable to get clear title to their lands due to conflicting claims. Eventually some had to buy the land they had already cleared. Others scattered. This time some settled in Pennsylvania in Tupplehocken, in what later became the center of the Pennsylvania Dutch. Others settled in the Mohawk Valley, where they did very well, but they encountered Indian attacks.Otterness retells the famous story from the Schoharie. In those sexist times, women were thought less responsible for their crimes due to their emotional state. Hence, they were not punished as severely when convicted. After repeated efforts to evict the squatters, the sheriff from Albany arrived to arrest leader Johann Weiser. The women of the settlement attacked him with their brooms. He was tied to a rail, dragged through the mud, and carried four miles to be tossed off a bridge. Then he was attacked with stakes breaking several ribs and poking out an eye. The women pissed in his face. He survived and made his way home, but his pride was damaged. This is typical of the mischief the Germans carried out to express their displeasure with broken promises and their circumstances.Otterness covers the story in concise professional language, but seemingly only the parts of the story he personally has researched. This is not the comprehensive presentation it could have been. His language is almost terse. Numerous details are omitted. He does not explain his reasons for revisions from what was previously published. Hence, previously, Rev. Kocherthal, the Lutheran minister who accompanied the Palatines is identified as the leader of the group. Otterness hardly mentions Kocherthal. Instead he notes that Johann Friederich Haeger was the German Reformed minister who accompanied the largely protestant, mixed Lutheran and Reformed group. The Palatines were attracted by tracts, especially the \\"Golden Book\\" that circulated in the area advising that Queen Anne was offering free transportation and free land to settlers in the New World. Those claims were made more credible by reports of an earlier group of 43 pioneers led by Rev. Kocherthal to Newburg, NY, in 1708. They were given 40 acres of land, tools, and provisions until they could produce their own, plus a glebe (landgrant) to support a pastor. Otterness does not fully tell the story of this group. (The Germans found the soil inferior and relocated to Pennsylvania, after which their church and glebe became Anglican.) He references Knittle.Otterness discounts the claim that the Palatines were refugees fleeing the repeated destruction of religious wars exacerbated by an especially cold, damaging winter. Instead, he feels this was window dressing applied to gain support for relocation funding in Parliament by Daniel Defoe, who was a Whig politician. Instead the Palatines were poor, who came looking for the better life promised in the Golden book.The book does include details of the naval stores business and how those products were made. He completely omits earlier reports that the pine trees of New York are not of the correct species to make naval stores. Only Southern pines have been processed successfully. He includes better details of Tuplehocken in Pennsylvania, and relates part of the story of Ephrata, a religious commune that formed around a charismatic leader nearby. Apparently some Palatines were members of Ephrata. He does not tell the story of the collapse of Ephrata. (A costly bell was purchased for the bell tower without the approval of the membership causing many to leave the commune.)He includes several nicely done maps that clarify where settlements were, but he provides little information on the Palatine colonies of New Jersey. Others have said that the poor treatment the Palatines received in New York contrasted sharply with their acceptance by the peace loving Quakers of Pennsylvania. Hence, after 1720, most Germans preferred to settle in Pennsylvania-building the Pennsylvania Dutch tradition. Some have said Germans would not even step foot off a ship in New York City on their way to Philadelphia. Otterness completely omits this aspect of the story. Otterness manages to project the \\"stubborn German\\" stereotype for the Palatines. They could be very unco-operative, and stubbornly stuck to their goals-good farm land-in spite of numerous adversities.This is a useful addition to the body of knowledge of the Palatines. It is not comprehensive. Students will want to review all three books for details. Extensive references and end notes. Index (though somewhat meager). Maps. Illustrations."},{"Title":"Becoming German: The 1709 Palatine Migration to New York","review":"Dr Otterness has done a wonderful job of tracing the exploits of Western European immigrants to the New World. I had a chance to meet the author at a book signing and was facinated by his detective work in German libraries, tracking down the details of the Palatine Migration. I am not the only one impressed by his work. In a recent television airing of \\"The History Detectives\\" I noticed Dr Otterness' name in the credits as having contributed facts on a Lutheran minister's role in leading colonials during the Revolutionary War.

Unfortunately, the history books I read as a child did not paint a realistic picture of what really took place.

This is one of the better histories I've come across; easy to read but extremely well-researched and well-documented. Otterness turns to the records of the Palatines' sponsors, the British authorities, for most of his information so the story of the migration comes mainly from their perspective. There is very little first-hand information from the immigrants themselves but the author does a more than commendable job with what he has to work with. At only 170 pages, you'll finish this delightful book in two sittings.

This book really helped me to realize the importance of purity in your Christian life. It also helps those who have experienced sexual trauma and need healing. I recommend this book to people of all ages. It's scriptually based and refreshing."},{"Title":"Purity Under Pressure","review":"There is something disturbing about reading certain Christian books about dealing with sexuality. While the premise is somewhat sound, it seems that some authors aren't putting very much thought into what they're saying. This is especially true for Purity Under Pressure.I found the book at the thrift store. It should have stayed there. Every time the guy diverges from explaining the basics about sin and salvation, he starts saying complete crap. I didn't get the book to learn about Jesus, I got the book to learn how a Christian is supposed to deal with sexual issues. I already have read tons of books about Jesus, so I found this book redundant when it wasn't being weird.Honestly, I don't know what audience this guy was trying to address. If it's teenager, then I think he doesn't understand his audience. For one thing, the book is full of cartoon illustrations. Think about it. If you want to be mature and speak about mature subjects, why would you put these dumb little pictures that look like they belong in a children's book? If you want to speak to teenagers about adult subjects, why quote a passage from the Velveteen Rabbit or the Chronicles of Narnia? Neither of the two would I even remotely associate with sex, nor would I ever want to. Is this author assuming that because teens are children of God, they like to think childishly?Secondly, Neil doesn't seem to understand how inherently suggestive some of his phrasings are. He often repeats the phrase sexual bondage. Hmm...couldn't you phrase it some other way that, well, doesn't imply whips and leather outfits? (How about saying entrapment or imprisonment instead? I think those sound properly limiting, unpleasant, and not very fun).Third, Neil doesn't seem to understand how extremely weird and embarassing he sounds when he talks about certain subjects. The whole section on masturbation was just plain disturbing.\\"Before I could answer, the young man announced proudly so everyone could hear, \`Well, I masturbate every day!' The room fell silent as the other students anticipated my response. \`Congratulations!' I said. \`But can you stop masturbating(113)?'\\"Congratulations? What the hell? If I heard some guy telling me crap like that, my first reaction would be ridicule. I would either laugh and shake my head, ignoring him, or I would say, \\"I believe that is called an overshare.\\" Or, \\"Now that was a bit of information I never wanted to hear about.\\"\\"Do you sense the Holy Spirit's conviction when you masturbate(86)?\\" Egads. What was he thinking when he wrote that? I mean, what's he saying? That the Holy Spirit actually leads you to...? Does the Holy Spirit lead two married people to sleep together, for that matter? It's not generally something I'd associate with either. I mean, sexual stuff generally doesn't involve the brain that much anyway. I admit that God created sex, and that He blesses the union of two married people, but to say that the Holy Spirit leads people to do sexual things just sounds disturbingly weird to me.Fourth, Neil does a complete turnaround in one of the chapters (probably due to sloppy writing) so that suddenly he's saying that sex is completely evil.\\"Why? Because a spiritual and emotional bond has been formed. They have become one flesh. Such bonds must be broken. That's one reason God instructs us not to become entangled in sexual activities and relationships in the first place(179).\\"While it was supposed to be a paragraph about date rape, the author slopped through it, so it sounds like a statement against human reproduction.\\"That's one reason God instructs us not to become entangled in sexual activities and relationships in the first place\\"? What, is he some kind of aesexual Martian? Is he arguing a vow of chastity? Where in the bible does it say that we shouldn't become entangled in the sexual activities and the relationship of marriage?Obviously, if you have been date raped, you have to get away from the guy (or girl - I suppose that happens in Denmark). But I personally think, if it's fornication instead of rape, a marriage should happen instead of breaking it off. It seems like the responsible thing to do, even if if you've only slept together once. None of that birth control stuff works half the time anyway. The only effective birth control device is a wedding ring.Fifth, he has a very poor understanding about the nature of fiction. How can you have a adultery in your heart with a fictional character who has absolutely no existence in reality? This is a major contradiction in terms.In actuality, what he should have said is the following: While novels contain fictional characters that do not really exist, it is possible for your mind to imagine a real person in the situation, therefore that is when you commit adultery in your heart. In addition to this, absorbing and imagining these sexual situations you see in your novel, while seemingly harmless on its own, may very well weaken your resistance to that very sort of situation if it happened in reality. It gets you comfortable with something you shouldn't be comfortable with. And that is what's wrong with it. You can't commit mental adultery with someone that doesn't exist.Finally, Dave Park. This guy is probably directly responsible for turning this book into a steaming pile of crap. One whole chapter is devoted to bad conversations between Neil and Dave, which have only succeeded in informing me that Dave is new to the faith, and probably shouldn't be running Freedom in Christ Youth Ministries.Is making crappy books like this a trend with Harvest House? If this is so, maybe I should stick with Concordia and Zondervan."},{"Title":"Purity Under Pressure","review":"As far as one of the reviews. Wrong headed to say the least. Not wanting to change.

If not. It will only give a person more material to misunderstand, and twist to mean something it was not, and does not intend to say."},{"Title":"The Peking papers: leaves from the notebook of a China correspondent","review":"The 1960's were a time of huge social change. One of the most interesting sectors for viewing that is the relationship between the radical left in the U.S. and Europe and Maoist China. The left deeply loved Mao, and China was held up as a model for socialist utopia. The left didn't actually know anything about what was going on in China, but that didn't stop them from falling in love.It is within that context that a worldly old Belgian newspaper reporter named Jacques Marcuse wrote a brilliant work on what he saw when he traveled through China during that period. The result is a gutsy piece of integrity. Marcuse dared to question orthodoxy, and debunked the propaganda. He knew the truth about the past and dared to say it. The result, sadly was much ignored in the U.S., in no small measure because it called into question the deeply held beliefs of leftist professors in Econ and Poly Sci departments. Worse, the book was ignored in Journalism departments, despite being an exciting piece of reporting. Marcuse beats Tom Wolfe to 'New Journalism' by nearly a decade. Be among the few in this country (U.S.) who have read it, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Texas Sinners & Revolutionaries: Jane Long and Her Fellow Conspirators","review":"I have read and enjoyed Jack Ramsay's Texas Sinners and Revolutionaries in which he uses the interactions of Jane Long, Sam Houston and Mirabeau Lamar to introduce scores more of early Texans. I was extremely pleased to find the story of my Great Grandfather, Don Erasmo Seguin, included as one of the Tejano's who have so often been left out of the telling of early Texas history. The three people he uses as main characters, Jane Long (a woman who has often been ignored maybe because she was a woman), Sam Houston (the first President of the Republic of Texas, well known as perhaps one of the most famous of all Texans) and Mirabeau Lamar (second President of the Republic of Texas and sometimes known for little more than that) are three people who make me wonder why they left other parts of the United States to enter the conflicts of nineteenth-century Texas. Jane Long who was in her early twenties when she first entered the province could have had an easier life and was before her time by assuming the leadership she took. The story of why Sam Houston, former congressman and ex-governor of Tennessee, left his home state offers an explanation of his well-known personality. Mirabeau Lamar, Georgia ex-senator and son of a wealthy plantation owner, at times must have longed for Georgia. Their ability to unite despite diverse backgrounds provided me an explanation of what it took to create the Republic of Texas when Spain, Mexico and the United States all wanted to claim the land. While each was misunderstood and sometimes maligned by contemporaries, their rebellious conspiracy against Mexico who had a centuries-old claim to Texas is a fascinating story.Dr. Ramsay's book gave me a unique look at the dynamics of the interplay between Spain, Mexico, the United States, and the Republic of Texas governments. The Index of the book which is illustrated with maps, flags, portraits and political cartoons from national newspapers of that day, makes it an easy and quick reference book to briefly identify many people and events in early Texas.The book helped me understand Jane Long, an indomitable woman who holds a prominent though little known place in Texas history. The involvement and contributions to the development of Texas by fellow conspirators Jane Long, Sam Houston and Mirabeau Lamar, though early Texas history, is a very modern story.\\"I highly recommend Texas Sinners and Revolutionaries, Jane Long and Her Fellow Conspirators to anyone wanting to learn about early Texas and how it came to be the state it is\\".Albert Seguin Gonzales[URL]"},{"Title":"Basic Digital Photography: A Comprehensive Step-by-Step Guide to Selecting and Using Digital Cameras, Scanners and Software","review":"This book provides a general description of the history of photography and then goes into devices used in digital photography along with definitions of terminology that may be educational to the the total novice.

But surely the bad reputation is unjustified, for whether one approves of Mencken's conclusions or not, it would seem hard to deny the nobility of the his intentions in publishing them. He simply wished to help us rid ourselves of some harmful and incorrect stereotypes. To wit: men think they are intelligent and clear-headed while women are emotional and sentimental. But in reality, Mencken explains, it is men who are prone to sentiment and women who are intelligent and clear-headed. Of course many things follow from both the misconception and the \\"truth.\\" Although it may be useful to some people to know Mencken's ideas about the sexes (I find this knowledge useful), perhaps the best reason to read \\"In Defense of Women\\" is that it is incredibly entertaining. If you are not amused by Mencken's style, or if you are afraid that you might encounter an uncomfortable truth or two, then by all means keep safely away."},{"Title":"In Defense of Women (Transaction Large Print)","review":"This is not a book for faint of heart. No one was better at invective than Mencken, and his defense of women is far more of an attack on men than a defense of the &quot;unfair&quot; sex, as Ambrose Bierce signified our better half. Mencken's basic argument goes something like this: women are pretty bad; men are worse; therefore, women are better than men. This is, to be sure, a gross over-simplification. Mencken's argument is really much more sophisticated and ingenious. He picked it up, he tells us elsewhere, from a madame of a bordello. It contains a great deal more truth than most people would be willing to admit. Mencken's hillarious presentation is recommended only to hardened cynics (which is to say, hardened realists). Sensitive people with &quot;beautiful&quot; souls are well advised to avoid this brilliant book."},{"Title":"In Defense of Women (Transaction Large Print)","review":"Reading this book made me wonder &quot;where are the men of today who are writing like this on these topics?&quot; -- things like soul mates, monogamy/polygamy, affairs, prostitution, romance novels, Darwin's theory of sexual selection, the double standard, the &quot;Madonna/whore complex&quot; (not called that then), sexual harassment, employment discrimination, abolishing marriage, and declining marriage and birth rates all make an appearance in the book. And much of it retains its essential truth. The more things change...It's especially interesting to see where HLM was right and where he turned out to be wrong. For instance: the book was written just before men gave women the vote (i.e., during World War I, when Mencken was in his mid-to-upper thirties and still a bachelor); Mencken thought women voting would cure politics of rampant corruption -- because women wouldn't allow such shenanigans. This is not to say that he had any kind things to say about the suffragettes. He didn't, and some of what he wrote was outrageously funny. One can extrapolate in a straight line to some of today's feminists.His basic thesis -- which may or may not have been meant to be taken seriously -- is that women are more intelligent than men, the proof being the ease with which they typically defeat men in the war between the sexes:&quot;I am convinced that the average woman, whatever her deficiencies, is greatly superior to the average man. The very ease with which she defies and swindles him in several capital situations of life is the clearest of proofs of her general superiority. She did not obtain her present high immunities as a gift from the gods, but only after a long and often bitter fight, and in that fight she exhibited forensic and tactical talents of a truly admirable order. There was no weakness of man that she did not penetrate and take advantage of. There was no trick that she did not put to effective use. There was no device so bold and inordinate that it daunted her.&quot;It would be fifty years before Esther Vilar's &quot;The Manipulated Man&quot; continued with many of the same themes. But Mencken was quite prescient in the section on women's martyrdom, which today we'd call their claim to victimhood or being &quot;oppressed&quot;. I could go on at some length about how close his description of marriage is to what prevails today (based on reports which come to my attention), but I'll spare you.I'm sorry I waited so long to get around to this book, as it's truly a classic written by a great mind -- a highly recommended trip above the stratosphere for all men and, especially, bachelors."},{"Title":"In Defense of Women (Transaction Large Print)","review":"Undoubtedly, HL Mencken was the greatest American mind of the 20th century.

By contrast, in the past \\"even marriage with a fifth-rate man was better than no marriage at all.\\"Mencken also correctly predicted that even after the influx of women into the workplace, women will still lag behind men economically: he writes that \\"it is impossible to imagine a genuinely intelligent human being becoming a competent trial lawyer, or buttonhole worker, or newspaper sub-editor, or piano tuner, or house painter. Women, to get upon all fours with men in such stupid occupations, will have to commit spiritual suicide, which is much further than they will ever actually go. Thus a shade of their present superiority to men will always remaijn, and with it a shade of their relative inefficiency, so marriage will remain attractive\\".Mencken also predicts loosened sexual mores: \\"With the decay of the ancient concept of women as property there must come inevitability a reconsideration of the whole sex question.\\"And of course all these things have come to pass, both in America and in Europe: well-employed women marry later or not at all and get divorced more quickly, and low-income women have virtually abandoned marriage altogether.Mencken only runs aground when he looks at war and peace. He correctly predicted World War II (in particular predicting wars between France and Germany, and between Japan and America) but thought that it would be so devastating, and wipe out so many of the world's men, that women would vastly outnumber men, which in turn would radically modify marriage- perhaps by causing the reinstitution of polygamy. Had WW 2, like WW 1, killed only soliders, Mencken might have been right. Instead, of course, millions of civilians were killed- including many women, thus limiting the male/female imbalance."},{"Title":"In Defense of Women (Transaction Large Print)","review":"I have read numerous accounts (most notably in the journal of the Mencken Society) that assume that Mencken was being ironic in the pages of this book, but I am gladdened and relieved to see that the other reviewers here got it right. The omniscient Mr. Mencken simply observes that men are forever being bamboozled by women.But there's a great variety of Mencken's wisdom on tap in this slim volume -- such as,\\"The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.\\" (Page 53 of the 1926 edition)"},{"Title":"In Defense of Women (Transaction Large Print)","review":"H.L. Mencken has done us all a favor here with his remarkably eloquent and well-mannered discussion of one of the most polarizing issues out there. Mencken proves his ability to think outside the masses with this pithy manifesto on the nature of man and woman's dynamic. The writing is just plain entertaining. He writes what he thinks, which is something almost unheard of in this day and age. We are now tasked to write what we can support with \\"stats and hard evidence,\\" rather than what we observe in the real world.Male readers will be surprised by his disgust with their small mindedness and wayward industriousness. Female readers will be similarly off put with his casual unearthing of their deviousness, and remarks on their capacity for male production. I will resist giving away too much of his argument because this piece could be read almost entirely on a lazy Sunday.This book will leave you much more informed when encountering the modern male/female books which resoundingly declare females as the future of our species. What we will find is that the situation is much more complex, as we may not all be reduced to workers competing for financial success.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"In Defense of Women (Transaction Large Print)","review":"In his inimitable style the Sage of Baltimore trenchantly analyzes the relationship between the sexes and concludes that women are the superior gender. Before feminists get too excited, it should be noted that most people would probably regard Mencken's analysis as a backhanded compliment, for he doesn't praise women for some preternatural goodness or nobility, but for their Nietzschean Will to Power, clear eyed realism, Machiavellian calculation, lack of sentimentality, and ethical apathy. Men may regard themselves as superior because they've mastered one of the various idiotic trades, like business or politics- to which the women of Mencken's time rarely lowered themselves- but in the battle where it counts, women almost invariably end up the victor over a defeated and enslaved man. Although surely ironic, the book contains much truth, however bitter it may be to face it."},{"Title":"In Defense of Women (Transaction Large Print)","review":"I love H.L.

The book is just plain FUN to read.However ... and this is a BIG flaw ... this entire Kindle edition is filled with the most absurd and aggravating typographical errors.

Minor, because there is more going on in this story, between the characters, both within the current time and through flashbacks. Thomas is aging and while not doing too badly physically, mentally he is not coping all that well with the engaging qualities of the symptoms of aging: arthritis and other aches and pains, odd feelings, and the panorama of one's past in general. This is the core of the story and how Thomas eventually reconciles his current existence with both his past, his parents past and maybe his view of Wellington's place in history for that matter, is what sustains the reader to the end. I didn't think the author maintained the momentum at an even pace to the end, which became vague in the last 10 or 20 pages, but that is a personal criticism. That part portrays Thomas' crisis and maybe I missed the point, it just struck me as a little overdone. On the other hand, I wasn't dissatisfied with the resolution in the last 2 or 3 page. The writing is pleasant to read, the descriptions of France are attractive, and some of the incidents are very believable, even vivid. While not a compelling book, it is a long way short of being disappointing. Great for a plane trip and certainly won't be discouraging on a holiday. Give it a go."},{"Title":"Seven Wild Sisters","review":"de Lint remains an author capable of producing wonders in the short form. His ability to create memorable characters with only a few deft strokes turns a sweet and simple tale into something that works better, in many ways, than a novel at evoking a mood and feeling. Only hinting at the larger world and broader concerns of the Newford novels and story sequences, SEVEN WILD SISTERS opens itself within, drawing us deeper into a contained physical space and setting that proves to hold all we could care to fill it with.

It was full of fantasy, suspenseful and some of the characters were funny. It was hard to put the book down."},{"Title":"Seven Wild Sisters","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It had the perfect blend of charm, wit and common sense that i find lacking in alot of young adult reading materials. The tale can be described as provinchal, with basic morals albeit tacked onto a larger frame work of fantasy and lore. I appreciated the authors inclusion of ritual to show ones respect for nature. It seemed at times a parable about nature, and certainly after reading the book i find myself that much more enraptured by the natural world and all it contains. Some of the more prevelant themes in the books had to do with knowledge, doing the right thing, and history. Each strand interweaving; building a whole tappestry of feelings and thoughts, with the sole purpose to enrapture the audience.I always try to look at the heart of any story and this one was about not looking at the surface of things, not being fooled by the glomer of the world nor its strict adherience to rigidity either. I think it is a story worth sharing with an audience as young as 7-10 years old.

Marco Polo, was the Italian merchant who went to China in 1271, and returned with new discoveries including gunpowder, pasta, paper, silks, etc. Dalrymple creates an interest in his trip because he combines human characteristics with geographic and historic significance, so that the reader feels personally involved in the trip.In addition to being a superb adventure travelogue, Dalrymple has infused historical details in \\"In Xanadu\\". He is a scholar of ancient history, and punctuates his observations with historical facts and anecdotal quips. It is amazing how he notes in great detail conversations, descriptions and moods that transcend the pages to allow the reader to experience first hand the locations he describes. Contrary to Paul Theroux, however, Dalrymple gives the impression that he actually enjoys the people he meets, even though sometimes you could imagine that he has a smirk on his face as he talks to them. He is non-judgmental about their lives or surroundings, be they Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish, or Christian.The most striking features of his trip are the risks he seems to take in meeting with people who do not speak his language, eating foods he does not recognize, staying in inns that feel more like latrines, riding in buses that do not have luxuries like seats, and most importantly, venturing into China without a permit (which he is unable to get due to the confusion between the different Chinese authorities he contacts in the countries he visits).Dalrymple is a most interesting author of historical travel books, and I can't wait to see what he is going to choose for his next adventure."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"Of the three William Dalrymple books I've read this one is the least satisfying. Its a fun read but ultimately not a very substantial one. City of Djinns & Age of Kali are both excellent books on India and highly recommended. In Xanadu is one of those travel books that is dominated by its itinerary. You hear lots of exotic sounding words and place-names but are not left with much more than a glimpse of each place passed through. Each country just feels like a check point as the border crossings are what give the book what drama and humor it has. For example in Iran he is detained by a policeman at a remote checkpoint but when he produces his Cambridge library card the officer exclaims, \\"Oh, Agah, by the great Ali! This is the most famous university in the world.\\" And then the officer not only lets him go but offers his services as a tour guide. It is a funny story but as a reader you begin asking yourself what the point of the journey is if all Dalrymple is really concerned with is crossing borders and finding the next mode of transport to get him to the next town. The journey at times feels more like an endurance challenge than anything else. Dalrymple does quote from a number of great travel writers at timely moments along the way but in doing so he simply makes you wish you were reading their books instead of his. There are a number of books about the Silk Road or Persia in particular(Robert Byron's In Oxonia) that may be worth considering as an alternative to this book. Dalrymples expertise is architecture and he spends time speculating about the medieval churches and crusader fortifications which he encounters. The few architectural passages are interesting and informative but there are only a few of them. Later he will put his architectural expertise to much greater use in Delhi for his book City of Djinns. There is an admirable amount of information in the book but there are a few moments when he suggests that he is perhaps the first person since Alexander the Great or Marco Polo to see certain sights at which time you become very aware of the authors age. By the time he arrives at the ruins of Xanadu you feel Dalrymple has conned you into believing he has actually achieved something. And when he quotes the poem by Coleridge with his girlfriend I was kind of embarrased for the author. After leaving Xanadu and seeing that his journey has come to a close he feels depressed and then quotes Sir Richard Burton who after reaching Mecca wrote about experiencing a depression. But no reader of travel books will mistake Dalrymple for Burton. After all the Silk Road is now for the most part a paved highway and the most formidable foe most ravelers are likely to encounter is the drinking water. Dalrymples later books are much better. He wrote City of Djinns after living in Delhi for five years and the book is a well organized telling of that citys long and diverse history with portraits of its most famous inhabitants. And Age of Kali full of excellent reportage and gives you detailed glimpses of the different regions of India."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"Praise has been heaped upon this book, and deservedly so. As a first book by a young author it is an astounding achievement. It is captivating, well-informed, witty and warm. He moves skillfully from historical accounts to present-day portrayals of people and places, from anecdotes to lessons in art history. Almost anyone can travel, even to remote and dangerous places, and many can write about it, but few can match William Dalrymple in giving an evocative and intelligent account and in taking the reader on a wonderful journey."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"Well not quite, but sort of.At least this is what I kept thinking of as the author (referred to as Fatso by Mick, an expatriate hippie in Kashgar) and his travel companion Laura (she's the one clad in black) head out across Iran.They are on a madcap quest, ostensibly to retrace the tracks of Marco Polo in his journey from Jerusalem to the seat of power of Kublai Khan in Xanadu, bearing oil from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.Dalrymple, a student at Cambridge, came up with this idea to kill time between college terms. Presumably the quasi academic cover was in some way necessary, and the intermittent references to Polo and his voyage are mildly interesting. But really this is a chronicle of a road trip plain and simple - a 1980's kind of On the Road.The Silk Road, that is.Anyway, all this makes for idle but entertaining reading, filled with intelligent observations and humorous snippets.Here, for example, is the English menu from a restaurant in Turkey:Kujuk Ayas Family RestrantIngliz MenuyuSoapAyas soapTurkish tripte soapSheeps footMacarontWater piesEats From MeatDeuner kepab with piKebap with green peKebap in paperMeat pideKebap with mas patatoSamall bits of meat grilledAlmb chopsVegetablesMeat in eathernware stev potStfue goreen pepperStuffed squashStuffed tomatoes zStuffed cabbages leaLeek with finced meatClerySaladBrain saladCacik - a drink made ay ayAnd cucumberFrying PansFried aggsScram fried aggsScurum fried omlatOmlat with brainSweets and RfuitsStewed atrawberryNightingales nestsVirgin lipsA sweet dish of thinish batter with butterBananeMeonLeechesRecommended reading if ever you find yourself on an over civilized vacation."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"This a travelogue of Dalrymple's voyage along the ancient Silk Road. It is absolutely fascinating. He goes places that are not going to be open to Americans for a very long time, and to all of the places that we hear about on the news every day: Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan. There is also a lot of stuff that I didn't know about the Palistinian existance in Israel.Dalrymple comes across as an insufferable prick, but a very ammusing insufferable prick. After all, who amongst us didn't think that we were the height of intellectual maturity as college students? The only really annoying bit his how he doesn't realize, though we do, how wonderful his first traveling companion is. Instead, he spends his time mooning over his ex-girlfriend, who the reader can tell is a complete flake.This isn't a great book, but it's a very interesting book, and very fun. It offers great background reading on the recent history of the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Anyone who is interested in what's going on there now (and I hope that everyone is interested as there is a war on) should read this book."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"Even if you did not know that this was one of Dalrymple's earlier works, there is quite a bit in the narrative to suggest this. That is not to say that book is not really worth your time - it definitely is - but what is even more interesting is to see & observe the elements of erudition & wonder, & story-telling, that have always been so compelling about WD.But this is also personal story of a twenty-two year old - complete with a heartbreak - dashing across two continents. WD has certainly tried to talk about many personal episodes - & some of these are as hilarious as they're self-deprecating - but there are definitely pieces, thoughts, & events that probably would not be part of a more mature WD work.This book is the story of WD & his companions chasing down of Xanadu in Mongolia with a phial of oil from the Holy Sepulcher & all that happens in between.Informed, eccentric, & never dull."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"I very much enjoyed William Dalrymple's \\"From the Holy Mountain,\\" but this book was a disappointment. It was Dalrymple's first book, and if you consider it as a novice's starting effort and read it with an appropriately moderate level of expectations, you probably won't be disappointed. But the book was overpraised by the British press, and the effusive blurbs on the cover and inside led me to expect something significantly better than what Dalrymple actually produced.\\"In Xanadu\\" recounts a 12,000-mile journey, four-month journey from Jerusalem to Beijing that Dalrymple took in the summer of 1986. That bare description of the trip should alert you to one of the book's main problems. To cover 12,000 miles in the something less than four months of his summer vacation from Cambridge University, Dalrymple had to keep moving at an average clip of 100 miles per day. That wouldn't leave a great deal of time for sight-seeing under any circumstances, but it leaves even less when you're traveling by bus and train in Third World countries where departure schedules are unpredictable and unexpected delays frequent. Indeed, after he crosses the Iranian border on his way east, Dalrymple's account suggests that he spent as much time waiting fruitlessly for transport as he did actually seeing anything of substance in the countries he was passing through.The first half of the book, which takes you from Jerusalem to central Iran, is far and away the best part, because during this leg of the trip Dalrymple gave himself time to see some things along the way. In particular, he takes the time to relate what he was seeing with what Marco Polo might have seen seven hundred years earlier, which was ostensibly the point of the whole journey.Then, alas, on page 149, Dalrymple is awoken one morning in Saveh, Iran by his travelling companion Laura, who brusquely informs him that \\"We're barely halfway to Lahore and I've got to be back in Delhi within the week.\\" This makes it necessary to cover almost 2,500 miles across Iran and Pakistan at a pace of 300+ miles a day. At around this point Marco Polo largely disappears from Dalrymple's account, hardly to return until the very end of the book. On the western China leg of the trip, Dalrymple is foolishly determined to travel through a forbidden zone near the Chinese nuclear testing facility at Lop Nor - supposedly for the sake of following Polo's route - but his passage through this region has to be so rushed and furtive as he attempts to avoid security personnel that it is essentially pointless. In the end, the last two-thirds of Dalrymple's trip sounds like it was an utterly miserable experience, raising the question of why anyone would want to spend 150 pages reliving the experience with him.It is true (as various of the review blurbs indicate) that Dalrymple is sometimes very funny. But he isn't as consistently funny as is Paul Theroux, for example, and he is whiny and self-pitying at least as often as he is funny. Moreover, over time I got really tired of his disparagement and mocking of many of the locals: he christens one young Pakistani who agreed to drive him and his traveling companion from Quetta to Lahore \\"Psycho,\\" for example, for no other reason than his breakneck driving habits - but these were apparently necessary to meet the deadlines that Dalrymple's demanding traveling companion had imposed on them.If you want to read about a cross-Asia trip that followed in the footsteps of Marco Polo, I would instead recommend \\"Danziger's Travels,\\" by Nicholas Danziger. Danziger did a similar trip a year or two earlier in the mid-1980's, but he took more than a year to do it, and he didn't shy away from traveling through Afghanistan, as Dalyrmple did (albeit understandably). (Danziger's account of the fighting in the ancient caravan city of Herat is particularly vivid.) Or read Dalrymple's account of the Middle East's last Christians in \\"From the Holy Mountain.\\" Either of those would be a better investment of your reading time than this volume."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"Dalrymple's account of how he duplicated the journey of Marco Polo from Jerusalem to Mongolia is amusingly familiar to anyone who has travelled cross-culturally into Asia. The dramas and the dangers of backpacking haven't changed much since he made his trek in the 1980s, so it remains a relevant read. The historical background is well-researched and fascinating - so little has been written in English that draws comparisons between Western, Greco-Roman history and that of ancient Asian history. This book would be a gem if only for its historical content. As it is also entertaining, it's priceless!"},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"In the mid 1980s, William Dalrymple (then in his early 20s) made a journey retracing the steps of Marco Polo's famous journey during the 1200s, from the church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem to the site of Shangdu (or Xanadu, as is better known in literature), the summer palace of Kublai Khan, in Outer Mongolia, China. In reality, though, since Soviet Central Asia was then barred to western travel, he deviated in part from Marco Polo's route, going through the Baluchi desert, in southern Iran and Pakistan, and then up the Indus river, and through the then newly opened Karakoram highway to western China, instead of traveling to China through Samarkand and other cities in Central Asia. The book itself is a mixed bag, there is some interesting things in it (at least he did some homework in terms of research) but there are far too many of the sort of banal, smug and self-centered comments and experiences you see in much of the travel writing of westerners as they go through the third world."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"I read this book on an airplane journey, and laughed so hard at some entries that I cried.And then I got depressed, because I realized that at the author's age, I would have been incapable of the deft writing and erudition he displayed."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"The idea of following Marco Polo is a provocative one. I enjoy Dalrymple's accounts of the journey. However, I did not anticipate the amount of the text that would be devoted to elaborate descriptions of architecture. It seems as though every time the action lags, (for whatever reasons) the author resorts to some sort of florid default. I do not know if the author was schooled in architecture, but it sure seems so from the persistent convention of architectural description. I have nothing against this discipline, but I specifically chose this book because I thought that it would NOT be like a thousand textbooks I have seen on similar subjects. Happily, the \\"traveller on-the-go\\" sections were remarkably funny and entertaining."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"Simply put, I think Dalrymple is the best travel writer out there today. He has the unique ability to blend informative passages with wit, so that the reader can truly appreciate the places he is reading about. He is simply a virtuoso with the pen. This is his first novel, and is an account of his travels from Jerusalem to the court of Kublai Khan in Mongolia to spread a bit of holy oil at the site of Kublai's court. It is a fascinating read, and there's quite a lot of info in the book about Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. I exhort all to read it."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"I purchased this book after reading City of Djins.

It is definitely a good read, if not the best."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"A very impressive travel book that mixes humor, history and travel anecdotes into a delectable concoction that'll hold you in rapt attention and inspire you to plan something similar on your own.A history undergraduate from Cambridge University, William Dalrymple embarks on a 12000 mile long journey that retraces Marco Polo's epic 13th century journey along the Silk Route (from Jerusalem to Xanadu). His journey takes him through the glorious Mongol empire (founded by the very enigmatic Genghis Khan). However, now the Silk Route passes through Israel, Syria, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and China. An overland passage through these closed countries is an incredible travel feat.William writes very witty humor and there were many occasions when I was almost rolling on the floor clenching my stomach. I am impressed by William's rich & deep insight into the history of the region; the book can very well double up as a history textbook. The writing gets progressively better as William treads into deeper territory.I have done a fair bit of traveling in the last few years. There is something intoxicating about traveling on a whim, taking unplanned detours, confronting tough immigration and above all doing it all on a shoestring budget."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I have read several of William's books before and I finally got round to reading this as I'm off to Xanadu later this year.The author describes his journey from the Middle East to China overland and the book is already one of my favourite travel books - he has a great style and William's historical knowledge meant that I also learnt a lot. Not bad for a book published by a 22-year-old!"},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"After reading a number of travel books this year in my travel-seminar, I found Dalrymple's journey to be refreshing in that there was more action, more to follow, more to experience. As you travel through the Middle East and into the Orient, Dalrymple goes into great detail about local architecture, history lessons of Kublai Khan and the great sultans, the smells of the food, the warmth of the cay tea...the descriptions paint a very clear pciture in your head. Dalrymple's adventure is even more entertaining due to the risk implied in traveling through countries like China and Iran during the 1980's. A myriad of interesting events and hold-ups do a good job of holding your attention, but beware of the multiple foreign words, there is some glossary-diving involved."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"William Dalrymple travelled 12,000 miles overland from Jerusalem to Xanadu in order to retrace the journey of Marco Polo, and I think the Venetian probably had the easier trip--- in 1271 Marco Polo didn't have to smuggle himself along the Silk Route by burrowing into the back of a coal truck.The author calls his journey a 'quest' rather than a 'vacation,' since it involved not only a goal, but also a great deal of hardship and suffering. However &quot;In Xanadu&quot; is an excellent book to take on vacation. It is a lucid and sometimes hilarious account of a very low-budget journey through Asia ($1100 financed the entire trip through Israel, Cyprus, Turkey, Syria, Iran, Pakistan, and the breadth of China.) And best of all, no matter how badly your own vacation turns out, you can always pick this book up and find Dalrymple in a more miserable spot than you are.There is also beauty and moments of scholarly excitement when the author identifies some feature of the landscape with a passage from Marco Polo's journal. I particularly liked his description of a nocturnal train trip through Turkey. He sees dry flatlands transformed into lush pasturage and wonders at the source of water. Then the train comes upon a river, and Dalrymple unfolds his map:&quot;Its Turkish name, the Firat Nehri, meant nothing to me. Only when I followed the thin blue line down through Syria and out towards Baghdad, did I see the river's more familiar name --- the Euphrates....Is there another river which carries with it so many associations?...The river which ran through the Garden of Eden, one of the five rivers of the Apocalypse! Following its course on the map, its banks are littered with the names of the ancient cities it once gave life to: Mari, Nippur, Uruk, Larsa, Erdu, Kish.&quot;The above paragraph is a rare flight of fancy for Dalrymple. His normal style is less flamboyant, laced with dry British humor where he tends to be the butt of his own jokes. Sometimes the reader is left to discover the humor of the situation through one of his dialogues. Here is Dalrymple in Kashgar, a Chinese city populated by the Muslim Uigurs. He is trying to explain through an interpreter, the lifestyle of the British 'Chairman' Elizabeth II to an old mullah:&quot;Salindi [the interpreter] frowned. 'He wants to know how many sheep, donkeys and camels your chairman owns.'&quot;'Tell him she owns no camels, but has very many horses and a great number of corgi dogs.'&quot;The information was passed on. The old man nodded his head as he listened.&quot;'Sir, this man is now asking about the dog which is called 'khor-qi'. He asks whether these 'khor-qi' are good to eat.'&quot;'Tell the old man that they are delicious.'&quot;&quot;In Xanadu&quot; is travel writing in the grandly eccentric British tradition: a horrid climate and high adventure, laced throughout with dry wit. Be sure to get a copy for your next vacation. I'm going to loan mine to a friend who thinks she wants to visit Iran and Afghanistan (last year she trekked through Outer Mongolia). Either &quot;In Xanadu&quot; will dissuade her from her planned adventure, or else she is as bonkers as Dalrymple."},{"Title":"In Xanadu - Quest (CSA Travelling Companion)","review":"I really enjoyed this book!

And there is a resemblance. But the difference is vital - the dog. This strip is first and foremost about the relationship between a boy and his dog. Anyone who loved a dog as a child, or wanted to, will be drawn into this charming strip.And just as Rover is a real dog, Red is a real boy. He has an obnoxious big brother, wants to be an astronaut, and has a crush on Marcia Brady.After a while you'll realize that Red and Rover live in the past - somewhere in the seventies if fashion is any indication.

Rover is a cross between lassie, snoopy, and rin-tin-tin. If you are a reader of the series you should get this book. If you have not read the series you will start reading it after reading this book and become a fan. This book provides the first meeting betweed Red and Rover.

Even on my worst day, just reading Red and Rover would put a smile on my face. When I learned there was a book about Red and Rover, I ordered it right away. When I received the book, I could not put it down! It makes me laugh out loud and makes me happy. Brian Basset should be congratulated on creating Red and Rover and showing us that this world can be a happier place just by the simple things in life...like a boy and his dog and their wonderful adventures together.

It begins with Red the boy walking across the street with his head in a comic book. Rover the homeless dog races over and pushes Red out of the way of a truck, knocking him flat, woozy and out of his sneakers. This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship, as Rover now becomes Red's constant companion with a mysterious mind link between them. Rover understands Red's speech and Red understands Rover's thoughts.The action is typical of a boy in elementary school with a teenage brother with braces, pimples and a need to punish his kid brother. Red and Rover get in trouble, play together, stick up for each other and generally live their lives to the fullest. One excellent recurring theme is that Red has a deep affection for space travel; his ambition is to become an astronaut so that he and Rover can visit the moon. The time frame is after the moon landings, for they are referenced in the text.I really enjoyed this book, we had a dog when I was young and I grew up worshipping the American space program. Therefore, I lived through some of these events, often looking up into the sky and imagining myself on my way to visit the heavenly objects."},{"Title":"Red and Rover: A Boy, A Dog, A Time, A Feeling","review":"Before we get things started, I am a proud reader of the newspaper cartoons. I read the comic section daily, and I have my favorites. However, unfortunately, this is not on that list.Before everyone starts to negatively rate my review, please just give me a chance, okay? I just have an opinion that I want to share.I despise this comic strip for one primary reason; the jokes suck pumpkin guts. Half of the time I barely understand them, and the question of \\"holy crap! This is supposed to be FUNNY?!!\\" pops into my head the moment I stumble upon a particularly corny strip. I don't get the joke sometimes. It is a classic, slightly overdone concept of a boy and his dog and their relationship. Everybody loves heartwarming strips, right? That may be so, but I loathe HOKEY strips. Some of these strips in this series are just too amazingly SAPPY to entertain. It is dreadfully over-sentimental, and it's just a bit groan-worthy to see virtually nothing more than the loving relationship shared by a boy and his pet dog day after day. Do not get me wrong; a \\"boy-and-his-dog\\" premise is a classic concept. Not all such works are bad. But I just dislike this one. And the jokes intended to make readers laugh are too cheesy for words, half of the time, or not amusing at all. The proof is in the funny pages. It is just plain BORING."},{"Title":"What You Need to Know About Spiritual Warfare in 12 Lessons: The What You Need to Know Study Guide Series","review":"I have enjoyed many of Max Anders Books. His easily digestible lesson format carries over well to this book as well. The book deals with issues of conscience and repelling evil impulse. I personally found this book an excellent source of reinforcement and spiritual replenishment. This book is designed for the Christian who seeks to verbalize and rationalize his/her resolve to maintain the path to the light. A book which is very relevant and necessary in these times. Its a no nonsense, tell it like it is tome."},{"Title":"What You Need to Know About Spiritual Warfare in 12 Lessons: The What You Need to Know Study Guide Series","review":"What every Christian should and must know about Spiritual Warfare is found in the pages of this book.

It is written in way that can be taught in a Bible Study."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented ActionScript For Flash 8","review":"I finally decided to take the plunge into OOP after I realized that is where Flash is headed. With the advent of ActionScript 3.0 around the corner (or out now if you're already dabbling in it), you just know that everything is soon going to be class based. This book is a great start to your journey, as someone who originally started to read Colin Moock's Essential ActionScript 2.0 will tell you. It is a LOT easier to read than EA2.0 as I'm not well versed on theory nor do I, at least at this point, really care that much about it. I'm one of those people who want to dive in and learn the syntax/usage, and then I'd like to figure out where it all stems from, not the other way around as it just makes it harder for me to learn that way.The beginning chapters are great and teach you very much about the basics of OOP. If you're an experienced programmer, you honestly probably won't get much out of this book as this would all be stuff you already know. If you're a beginner, however, this is perfect for you. As a pro (and a con on some level) of this book, some of the pages explain how to set up the document before you work on it. This is good for people who are new to Flash, but in my eyes if you're new to Flash you shouldn't be reading an OOP book to start you into programming as this won't help you really learn the syntax. If you're using this book, it should be assumed you already know the basic Flash syntax and won't need to be told how to set the document size (pages 84-92 are basically wasted on setting up a document for coding one of the examples).There is a chapter on design patterns that is really good and explains their functionality pretty well. One thing to note in this chapter is that it comes kind of early in the book and sometimes (at least for me) it was hard to grasp the whole concept of what the Model View Controller, for instance, was doing because I'm still not thinking in terms of OOP, rather procedural, so I had to go back and re-read some of the design pattern stuff a couple of times to fully understand it (and I'm not sure that I do still to this point, but that's outside of the scope of this book).The one knock I have on the book, which really is a non-issue to be honest, but it's a bit funny to see all the editorial errors through these technical books. It makes you wonder if the editors really read the whole thing or just skim it.I feel this book definitely gets me ready to move on to greener pastures, a la Essential ActionScript 2.0, which I should now be ready to dive into. I don't feel like I'm an OOP expert after reading this, but I don't think that was the main point of the book. Of course, I learn a lot slower than others because I have a design background and no programming background whatsoever, but the book was painless to read and I enjoyed it greatly.Don't get me wrong if this review is sounding half negative, the book is essential to anyone getting started with OOP (as I am), and I highly recommend it. I just tend to point out everything I notice and sometimes I don't always write down all the positives so my reviews seem to lean towards the negative a bit more. In no way does this mean this book is bad, because it really isn't; it's a great book."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented ActionScript For Flash 8","review":"There have been several OOP books as it relates to Flash development. There is the Moock AS2DG (a chapter or two if I remember), the Branden Hall/Sam Wann book, a few others, and then this one.What makes this book really interesting is that its a wonderful read. There is a sincere sense of flow. It isn't a section followed by another, without glue to hold them together. Each part of the book works you through principles and concepts - with straightforward code examples - in a language most will understand.It covers some great topics, like design patterns (not simply mvc), UML diagrams, manager classes, some cool ways of using new Flash 8 capabilities using OOP constructs, etc.Yes, it does start out a little basic. But to those of us without CS degrees, we have probably picked up our knowledge through books, online articles, etc. Perhaps there was a detail here or there to pick up in those sections for everyone.This is a GREAT book - pick it up even if you have other OOP/Flash books you have purchased. This will be a great addition to your tech library - trust me. Its one of the best books on the subject (without being overly technical) that I have seen. Its actually readable (you don't necessarily only want to use it for reference like other books)."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented ActionScript For Flash 8","review":"Before reading this book I thought that OOP meant writing a class and applying it to as many objects as I wanted. Was I ever wrong! This book not only gives you thorough explanations of what OOP is, it also provides detailed explanations on why you should use it. It's hard to explain the misconceptions that many people can pick up by trying to learn OOP by reading random articles around the web. This gently leads you through all the elements of OOP and clears up any of the misconceptions you may have previously had. It even teaches you programming techniques and design patterns such as how to separate the data and control from the style as well as how to manage multiple styles, colors, sounds, etc. with one class and dynamically apply them to whatever objects you want.Elst and Yard develop a good foundation of planning, workflow, and best practices without preaching their way as the only way. It is nice to see them agree that there is more than one way to write code and whichever way works best for you is the best way. Once they dive in to teaching encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance through examples you will have a clear understanding of what these terms are and why they are so important. In fact, what I loved the most about this book is that it clearly teaches all the benefits of OOP instead of just teaching how to use OOP.You will honestly come away from reading this book eager to create your own OOP packages or even components and you will have the knowledge and confidence to put them together. If you are looking to start developing Flash applications or advanced interactive websites, this book is worth every penny."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented ActionScript For Flash 8","review":"I think this is a beginner friendly book to learning and developing Flash 8 Object Oriented code. The book is an easy read and has a pretty good introduction to Flash. It even goes into like 4 design patterns which if you are an OOP developer is generally the next step in design and architecture.A few things I don't like about the book is a couple of the chapters are very thin. Like the chapter on interfaces is very minimal. Also, their case study project at the end of the book is very weak. It's a Time-Sheet application and it's a little dry in terms of the power of OOP.Overall I recommend this book for any beginner looking to get into OOP with Flash. Just keep in mind though that Colin Moock's books are much more thorough and look for his latest book on ActionScript 3."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented ActionScript For Flash 8","review":"Object-Oriented Actionscript for Flash 8Introduction:Object-Oriented Actionscript for Flash 8 from Friends of ED (Apress) is a great book for intermediate and advanced Flash Developers who want to learn more about OOP and AS 2.0. This books is definitely not intended for Flash Designers or those with limited experience in Actionscript. This book would be a great introduction to Actionscript 2.0 for any traditional computer programmer with experience in Object-Oriented programming techniques who is looking to start developing Rich Internet Applications with Flash.First the bad news:While the majority of this book was full of useful information, I believe their are a few chapters that are completely out of place and should have been removed from the book. The Planning and Project Workflow chapters should have been combined into a one or two page reference located in the back of the book. Since the intended audience is someone that should be familiar with advanced web development, there is no need to include any information about CVS. This could have been written in one sentence... \\"Any good programmer will utilize some type of file storage and source control application, and I recommend using blah blah blah software.\\" I almost stopped reading the book at this point and had to force my way through the text.Now for the good news:The writing style, or \\"voice\\" as some people call it, was excellent. It did not feel like I was trying to read a programming book, and instead felt like a colleague or personal friend was giving you a training on the subject matter. I also thought the the Design Patterns information was very informative and I felted like I could immediately change some of the programming techniques in my current projects to have them run more smoothly.The Media Player Case Study was spot on! How many clients have asked for a media player as part of the requirements of an application? This is a \\"real world\\" example that I will study and use hundreds of times, unlike some so-called \\"real world\\" examples like XYZ Corp needs a web site to view their magazine subscriptions. I have read a few other books on this subject, and most of them use way too generic examples that will never be applicable unless you actually land that Bank Client who needs a home loan calculator! Although, there was a semi-useless timesheet example at the very end of the book :)I also enjoyed reading about the tweening techniques used in the OOP Animation and Effects chapter, along with the much needed explainations of how Flash components can be used with OOP in Rich Internet Applications.Conclusion:While there is room for improvement, I would highly recommend this book to any advanced programmer or an intermediate Flash Developer looking to better their already established Actionscript 2.0 skills. The Media Player example is enough to make this book worth the money.Book Rating: 9 / 10"},{"Title":"Object-Oriented ActionScript For Flash 8","review":"So this was the third book I read on Object-Oriented Programming for ActionScript 2. So my thoughts are in context of having already been through Moock's excellentEssential ActionScript 2.0(which did wonders for solidifying my OOP knowledge), and then the dismal New RidersObject-Oriented Programming with ActionScript 2.0 (VOICES)(which was disappointing at best). So, by the time I read Elst and Yard's Object-Oriented ActionScript for Flash 8 -- hereafter referred to as OOA4F8 -- I was already well-versed in the ways of OOP (and for the record, I'm a full-time ActionScripter). I was actually reading the book for the purposes of evaluating the book as a potential text book for a class I taught. So, my opinions are coming from someone who already knew most of the material.Friends of Ed books are generally pretty good at taking things slow and not assuming too much; this is a great feature in technical books, and OOA4F8 manages to follow suit for the most part. In fact, the first section of the book that introduced general OOP concepts, without getting too much into actual AS, was probably the best such introduction I've seen, heard, or read. It pretty much sold me on the book as a usable text book.But then I read the rest of the book. Now, for the most part, the explanation of concepts and techniques was adequate to good. However, the further along in various techniques the book took me, the more I disagreed with the approach taken by the authors. One standout example for me is the \\"IntervalManager\\" (or perhaps it had a different name, but it was the class that managed your setIntervals). At first I thought, oh, that's a cool idea. It might make the whole making-sure-you-clear-before-you-set thing a little easier. Or maybe it would automatically control the number of repetitions for you. Or something more robust like the Timer class in AS3.Unfortunately, I saw no value in the IntervalManager. It did not allow you to write less code, and it did not add any functionality beyond what was already available. I may be remembering it wrong now, but you still had to manually clear intervals before setting them, and the code to set up an interval with the new class was virtually the same as what I would normally do, except with a different API.My recommendation depends on how programmatically-minded you are. If you're a decent ActionScripter already and just need to make the transition from procedural AS to OOP AS, the go with Colin Moock'sEssential ActionScript 2.0. It's detailed, technical, and assumes a certain level of knowledge going into it. I found it extremely well-written and made several advanced OOP concepts clear to me. However, if you're a little more left-brained and need a gentler introduction to all things OOP, I would recommend this book, and ideally, then follow it up with Moock's book to iron out some of the disagreeable practices from OOA4F8."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented ActionScript For Flash 8","review":"In the last 7 years, I've bought over 30 books on Flash and Actionscript. Usually I'll get through the first 20 pages, get bored, and skim through the rest. This book is hands-down the best book on Actionscript programming ever written to date. It's excellent for three reasons: 1, it teaches you to code with object-oriented standards, 2, it teaches you to code with object-oriented standards, and 3, it teaches you to code with object-oriented standards. Furthermore, it's written in a very easy-to-understand format that could take anyone off the street and turn them into an Actionscript professional.A MUST-read for any Flash developer that doesn't already live, breathe and die object-oriented practices."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented ActionScript For Flash 8","review":"Ce livre est fantastique.

But from chapter 13 there is a big jump into very difficult matters which I had a lot of trouble to understand (I had to skip many pages). Generally, in the book there are either very easy or very difficult things (beginning from chapter 13), and some examples on intermediate level are missing - as well as some exercises for the readers who could try to do some work on their own (under the author's guidence).Anyway, a good book, anybody who has read it and understood everything, can be proud of himself as a great professional. Unfortunately, I am not one of those..."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented ActionScript For Flash 8","review":"Overall a disappointing, confused book without much of an audience. This book assumes advanced actionscript skills, the most advanced skills I've seen in books teaching flash/actionscript.

This book has helped make me a much better AS coder. I couldn't have completed my last big project at work w/out it!My only nitpick is that it talks way too much about AS1 at the beginning when it's bringing those who've never coded and those who've only coded in AS1 up to speed.

If you are a hardcore programmer then you'll be a bit bored, but for the rest of us who \\"kind-of\\" get it, this is the book for you.The concepts are good and the application of those concepts are solid. The test code works great. I would reccomend this book to anyone who wants to do more OOP work in flash and is more of an artist than a programmer."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented ActionScript For Flash 8","review":"Before you read this book you should already know Actionscript and Flash. The point of the book is to teach you object-oriented concepts along with more advanced ActionScript concepts, so it does not include a tutorial on ActionScript basics, though it does have a brief section at the beginning of the book on object-oriented concepts separate from ActionScript. Other reviewers have described this book as \\"painful\\". Since I already knew object-oriented concepts before I sat down to read this book, perhaps that is the reason that the whole thing made perfect sense to me. The following is a brief description of the content in the context of the table of contents:PART ONE: OOP AND ACTIONSCRIPTChapter 1: Introduction to OOP - The basics of OOP including classes, objects, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.Chapter 2: Programming Concepts - Programming constructs in an OO context.Chapter 3: ActionScript 2.0 Programming - A quick overview of ActionScriptPART TWO: FLASH OOP GUIDELINESChapter 4: Planning - How to plan your OO structures, analyzing a Flash ActionScript project, modeling with UMLChapter 5: Project Workflow - version control, rapid application development, extreme programming, usability testingChapter 6: Best Practices - proper formatting, naming conventions for variables, commenting your code, alternative programming stylesPART THREE: CORE OOP CONCEPTSChapter 7: Encapsulation - Encapsulation via a moving ball in timeline codeChapter 8: Classes - Practical implementation of classes via the Mover class for the Ball of the previous chapter.Chapter 9: Inheritance - Implementing inheritance via the Bouncer and Gravity classesChapter 10: Polymorphism - Polymorphism in practiceChapter 11: Interfaces - Practical examples of interfacesChapter 12: Design Patterns - What they are and what is good about them. Introduces the Observer, Singleton, Decorator, and MVC patterns.Chapter 13: Case Study: An OOP Media Player - brings together OOP concepts learned so far in a single ActionScript example.PART FOUR: BUILDING AND EXTENDING A DYNAMIC FRAMEWORKChapter 14: Framework Overview - outlines the core classes of the MX Framework, specifically MovieClip, UIObject, UIComponent and ViewChapter 15: Manager Classes - How to build your own manager classes for a Flash component framework.Chapter 16: UI Widgets - Building visual components that handle standard UI functionality that leverages the work done in chapter 15.Chapter 17: OOP Animation and Effects - Explores classes that alter video clips using ActionScript effects available in Flash 8.PART FIVE: DATA INTEGRATIONChapter 18: Interrelationships and Interactions Between Components - Data binding as a means of sharing content between components.Chapter 19: Communication Between Flash and the Browser - how Flash movies communicate with their container.Chapter 20: Server Communication (XML and Web Services) - Two efficient means of how Flash communicates with data sources across server connections.Chapter 21: Case Study: Time Sheet Application - A capstone application that brings together everything introduced in this book.I thought the book was very well laid out and clear. It does not go on for pages with nothing but text and theory and then do a code dump on you. It discusses each concept and then has a short code snippet to illustrate the point. If there is confusion about where to store a file or where to find one, the book gives detailed instructions and even screenshots. Even though this book is using the out-moded ActionScript 2, it does concentrate on object-oriented design and good design in general, so it is probably still a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented ActionScript For Flash 8","review":"If you have a programming bkg this book might not be directly relevant to you since the first 170 pages or so are dedicated to the explanation of basic OOP concepts.It does a great job in explaining those basics of oop, and smoothly introduces and explores design patterns and further.I found that the Moock book had more depth in its exploration of oop with actionscript(also its scope is different since it aims at programmers with a different background as to novices), but the Elst/Yard book has a different approach in its explanation of concepts.It's more hands-on, the code-examples are really relevant and the build up of the book and concepts is very fluid. It reads well, it's enjoyable and is very clear.I feel that a lot of people, just like I did will draw comparaisons in betweeen this book and the Moock one, and to be honest I would say that having both doesnt make any of the two redundant, far from it, they are very complementary.I would recommand to read this book before reading the Moock one though, yet both are a must if you seriously want to use oop in flash."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented ActionScript For Flash 8","review":"This has to be one of the \\"must-buy\\" titles for any flash developer wishing to use OOP in his programming tool kit. This book gently guides the reader through all the key concepts of OOP and more importantly backs them up with simple but concrete examples. Please don't underestimate the importance of 'simple and concrete,' because when it comes to explaining, 'Design Patterns,' try and read just about any other book out there including Colin Mook's very excellent, \\"Essential Actionscript 2\\", and you'll soon learn how the theory and the complexity can have your head swimming. This book, on the other hand, makes learning fun and the authors deserve some kind of accolade for so succinctly rendering the concepts in well chosen but accessible terms."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented ActionScript For Flash 8","review":"It's one of the more painful book I've came across.Poorly edited,and poor accuracy.

The Seven Crystal Balls is the one Tintin book I didn't read before bedtime, for the simple reason that it was too scary! Herge was masterful at creating any scenario and eliciting any reaction from his readers that he wished. In this book he created a spine-tingling supernatural thriller, concluded in the second part of this adventure, Prisoners of the Sun.Seven Crystal Balls has it's share of laughs as well, provided in particular by Captain Haddock. At the start of the adventure, Haddock desperately trys to relinquish his gruff old sea-dog ways by sporting a monocle and speaking in a very diginified manner. As you can imagine, the results are slightly less than successful.This adventure seems to focus around darkly lit and heavily furnished rooms, places of scholars and thought that can not combat the evil terrorizing Tintin's world. Prisoners of the Sun takes Tintin to the beautiful countryside of Peru. The contrast is remarkable, the result is beautiful. This two-part adventure is fantastic."},{"Title":"Adventures of Tintin the Seven Crystal Balls (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"The dialogue in the story, handwritten in the original English versions, has all been replaced with a digital font. This completely changes the character of the story. Basically, 62 pages of calligraphy have been replaced with a typeset font. The font size is irregular, which is distracting, and there is a lot of empty white space in the dialogue bubbles.I would recommend purchasing the little 3-story hardbacks (about 6.5\\" x 9.5\\"), which seem to still have the original writing, or if you like the original large format (about 8.5\\" x 11.5\\"), look for an old edition from a used book store.I uploaded a customer image of the digital font to the Amazon \\"Look Inside\\" feature for Tintin Land of Black Gold.Note that the Amazon \\"Look Inside\\" images are not from the current edition. You can tell by looking at the back cover.

What makes the Tintin books so good is they seem to have everything in it that make up a good comicbook,originality, interesting characters,adventure,suspense,great humor and well thought out storys. If I had to chose only one Tintin book to take to a desert island I think the seven crystal balls would be it. The book is masterfully drawn like of course all the Tintin books and the story is not just an adventures thriller but it has a mysterious atmosphere to it which i really like."},{"Title":"Adventures of Tintin the Seven Crystal Balls (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"As a prequel to 'Prisoners of the Sun', this adventure has it all. Bianca Castiafore, General Alcazar and the long suffering Nestor play second fiddle to Haddock and Tintin as they attempt to rescue Professor Calculus from kidnappers.

This book is excellent; car chases, gun fights, suspense and Captain Haddock to ensure that everything goes far from smoothly! Buy 'Prisoners of the Sun' at the same time, you will not want to wait around to discover where Calculus has gone!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Tintin the Seven Crystal Balls (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"There's the temptation to regard the first parts of all the Tintin two-part adventures as lesser scene-setting setting works for the main course - Destination Moon surpassed by the exploits of Explorers on the Moon, The Secret of the Unicorn establishing the adventure in Red Rackham's Treasure, and here with The Seven Crystal Balls clearly being \\"eclipsed\\" by the Inca adventures of Prisoners of the Sun. In many ways however there is just as much if not more interest in the earlier parts of these stories, which tend to have a rather more serious tone than is usual in Tintin books whereas their second-halves fall back on the usual exotic adventuring.This is particularly the case with The Seven Crystal Balls. On the surface, it would seem to be little more than a mature version of the Egyptological themes of one of Herg&eacute;'s earliest (and consequently most underrated) solo adventures, the hugely entertaining Cigars of the Pharaoh. Once again, the curse of Tutankhamun is evoked in the story of seven scientists who fall into mysterious comas soon after their return from Peru, where they have discovered and unearthed tomb of the legendary Inca King Rascar Capac, removing the mummy from its ancient resting place to take across the ocean for investigation and display in Europe.The Seven Crystal Balls would seem to be better balanced than the earlier Tintin work in its treatment of the subject of mystic ancient curses, but that doesn't mean that it's necessarily more soberly realistic or any less entertaining as an adventure. If anything, the mystical elements are taken to even greater lengths in The Seven Crystal Balls (the title says it all - the mystic number seven, the telling of dark fortunes), with a tone of dread that is even darker. With greater length to elaborate the story, Herg&eacute; masterfully sets up dark premonitions right from the start, as Tintin reads an article about the archaeological discovery in a newspaper on his way to visit the newly aristocratic Captain Haddock in Marlinspike, but it's with a fantastically staged theatre act of audience participation in a mystic seer that raises the tensions considerably as the news of the first victim is dramatically announced.Not so clearly the victims of a poisonous dart seen in Cigars of the Pharaoh, there are however traces of shattered crystal found at the side of each of the seven victims, which suggests that an earthly hand is involved, but Herg&eacute; keeps this wonderfully ambiguous with lightning bolts and dream-like states that bring visions of Rascar Capac coming to life and exacting terrible vengeance. It evokes a potent and palpable atmosphere that carries out throughout the book, the usual slapstick much toned-down here, relating only to an incident between Snowy, a cat and Nestor with a tray of drinks. Even there however, if so inclined, you could associate Snowy's pragmatic headlong attack and ignominious defeat at the claws of rather more mystical feline forces of Haddock's pet cat as a further commentary on what is to come.Regardless, the tone established by Herg&eacute; is consistent and masterful throughout The Seven Crystal Balls, and although that tone changes considerably with the journey to South America in Prisoners of the Sun, the two halves are perfectly complementary, creating a whole that is unquestionably one of Herg&eacute;'s greatest and most accomplished achievements."},{"Title":"Adventures of Tintin the Seven Crystal Balls (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"On a train to Marlinspike, Tintin is reading an article about the Sanders-Hardiman expedition which has spent two years excavating Inca tombs.A gentleman on the train warns that a nasty end will await those \\"busybodies violating the Inca's burial chamber\\", comparing their predicted fate to that of the archaeologists, involved in the Tut-Ankh-Kamen affair.On his visit to Marlinspike, Tintin is re-united with Captain Haddock, who is playing the role of the country lord of the manor in his newly inherited mansion of Marlinspike.Tintin and the Captain go see a show at the Hippodrome, of magic and mystery, where the psychic Madame Yamilah has a vision of the serious illness of the husband of one of the audience, who hapens to be the photographer of the Sanders-Hardiman expedition.The psychic revelation proves to be correct.One after the other each of the men involved with the Sanders-Hardiman expedition falls into a coma, with fragmented crystal shards next to them, in each case.Tintint and the Captain then accompany Professor Calaculus to his friend Professor Tarragon, and in a strange occurance the Rascar Capac mumy on Tarragon's posession mysteriously disappears, and each of the guests is visited by a frightening dream of Rascar Capac entering their guest rooms and smashing down a crystal ball on the ground.Professor Tarragon soon also falls into the mysterious coma, and then Professor Calculus disappears, leadin Tintin and Haddock's investigations to lead them to plan a trip to Peru, which sets the stage for the sequel to this comic,Prisoners of the Sun (The Adventures of Tintin).The Tintin adventures are amazingly detailed and intricate for a graphic novel, and this one is filled with much intrigue, suspense and action failing to disappoint, and reminding us why Tintin remains popular after nearly 8 decades."},{"Title":"Adventures of Tintin the Seven Crystal Balls (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"Being the first part of an excellent diptych involving the Inca civilization, and which one could call the \\"Temple of the Sun\\" saga, this Herge comic book is a classic that assembles numerous key-elements that explain the success of this album. First, a very calm introduction - with comedic situations in which we find Captain's Haddock's misadventures as he adjusts himself to his new Dandy life - until an unexpected incident happens as, during a music-hall show, a medium gives to a spectator the unpleasant prediction that her husband, a renowned filmmaker, will be the victim of a dramatic incident, which will be confirmed to her a few instants later. By this scene, Herge immerses us into the suspense of this story as Tintin and his friends try to make sure that the friends of this filmmaker do not become the victims of a strange curse, linked to their recent archeological trip.Revealing more details would ruin the reader's pleasure to read this story who inspired, along with its second part, films and a musical. But the more you read this album, the more you find out why \\"The Seven Crystal Balls\\" is a classic in Franco-Belgian comic books. Indeed, with its dramatic scenes present as much as in page 4 as in the pages 30 to 35, Herge reveals himself a talented storyteller in the art of narrating mysterious and dramatic scenes as well as terrifying nightmares, which became major references in the Tintin universe and in Francophone comic books."},{"Title":"Adventures of Tintin the Seven Crystal Balls (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"The \\"Seven Crystal Balls\\" is No. 1 in the Tintin series for an aura of fearful mystery: This is the one for those who like potions, witchcraft, curses, fireballs, and yes, mental tortures.Attending a variety performance at a theater, Tintin and a newly countrified Captain Haddock watch a clairvoyant Indian women performing under a trance. She suddenly describes a vision of horror that has diverted her from her performance. What is going on with those seven explorers, including Tintin's old friend Professor Cantonneau, who have returned to Europe after exploring Inca tombs? They begin to fall into comas and experience visions of being tortured. Modern Europe, with its police and medical science, is incapable of dealing with the powers of a more primitive time. It takes someone greater, but Tintin is always around.Professor Calculus is kidnapped after his friend Professor Tarragon, the last unaffected explorer, goes into a coma. This ensures that Captain Haddock and Tintin will be involved to the fullest. Also worked into the plot is General Alcazar, Tintin's old friend from San Theodoros, who he had stumbled on when trying to unravel a different mystery in \\"The Broken Ear.\\" (But the reader wonders why he greets Tintin as a friend, for their previous encounter had ended in the General's men chasing after Tintin because someone had falsely told Alcazar that Tintin was a spy.) Alcazar goes by the name \\"Ramon Zarate\\" as a knife thrower who was a performer at the theater event referred to above. But his inclusion has a much more important element.\\"The Seven Crystal Balls\\" has the single-most embarrassing moment for Captain Haddock resulting from a klutzy act, as well as the usual goofery of Thomson and Thompson. But the main plot far dominates. \\"Prisoners of the Sun,\\" the sequel set in Peru, is my sentimental favorite in the series, and I recommend it with five stars along with this excellent first entry."},{"Title":"Adventures of Tintin the Seven Crystal Balls (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"The book was brand new, and the price was below face value.

Near each lies a shattered crystal ball...For some comic relief here Captain Haddock tries hard to be oh so proper (he has recently aquired his ancestral estate and title). He is fixated on wearing a monocle at all times. This is an involved mystery with many clever bits of detective work and technology used by the characters. This particular book is definitely the first of two parts and doesn't stand alone. At the end of this one Tintin and the Captain are off in pursuit of a potential villain.

The mystery picks up slowly, with scenes of life in Marlinspike, and Captain Haddock working hard at transitioning from salty sea dog to sophisticated landowner. At the theatre, Tintin and Haddock run into old friends like General Alcazar and Bianca Castafiore (both making their second appearances in the world of Tintin; there will be two more appearances for each of them). The detectives re-enter the picture as they are investigating mysterious attacks on a group of explorers who have returned from South America with an Inca mummy and a collection of artifacts. One by one, these explorers pass into a coma, and it appears that the expedition is cursed. Tintin becomes involved with saving the last of them, an old friend of Cuthbert Calculus'. Once again there's an episode of St Elmo's Fire, or ball lightning, coming down the chimney to inject the situation with action (it happened once before in Tintin In America). There's a chase as Cuthbert Calculus is kidnapped, and off our heroes go to find him in South America."},{"Title":"Adventures of Tintin the Seven Crystal Balls (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"In the opening sequence of \\"The Seven Crystal Balls\\", Tintin travels by train to visit Captain Haddock at his new home of Marlinspike. An item in the paper notes the return from Peru of an archeological expedition, bearing the mummy of a Royal Inca. A fellow passenger remarks the likely existance of a deadly curse on those who disturb the mummy. Thus is the tone set for a chilling adventure.Since this is a two-part adventure concluded in \\"Prisoners of the Sun\\", artist and author Herge takes his time setting up the story. We are treated to some humor as Captain Haddock plays the country squire, and more humor as he and Tintin visit the local music hall. The story properly gets underway when Tintin is consulted by the bumbling detectives Thompson and Thomson, who are investigating a series of mysterious attacks on the members of the Peru expedition.Tintin and the detectives are unable to stop the attacks, which place the men in a coma. Tintin, the Captain, Professor Calculus, and the police all assemble at the home of the last healthy archeologist, there to guard him during a suitably dark and stormy night. They fail; an unknown assailant kidnaps Calculus into the bargain. Tintin and the Captain set out in pursuit, on a trail that leads back to Peru.\\"The Seven Crystal Balls\\" is a classic Tintin adventure; the story and artwork hold up extremely well. It is highly recommended to fans of Tintin of all ages."},{"Title":"Adventures of Tintin the Seven Crystal Balls (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"This was, I think, the first Tintin book published after World War II (Herge was briefly imprisoned after the liberation of Belgium, since he has contributed as an artist to a pro-axis newspaper). It's the first of a two volume adventure (the second part being Prisoners of the Sun) but the book is good on its own. It starts amusingly, as Tintin arrives in Marlinspike (he still does not live there) and sees Haddock turned into a country lord (with the fortune of the Unicorn treasure, I suppose). The action unfolds slowly: the seven members of a scientific expedition to Peru start to get mysteriously attacked one by one, falling into a coma, with fragments of a shattered crystal ball next to them. As Calculus is a friend of the last remaining scientist, they paid him a visit to his house. During the night, unfortunately, they cannot prevent an attack on him. Worse for them, Calculus unwittingly takes a gold bracelet, and he is kidnapped by the attackers (which as it turns out, turns to be, some Peruvians connected with the Inca empire, who see the scientists as looters of sacred artifacts). Tintin and Haddock has no choice but to go to Peru to rescue Calculus (this is further developed in Sun, an even better album). Overall, a great album, which has stand the test of time after almost 60 years."},{"Title":"Adventures of Tintin the Seven Crystal Balls (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"Herge, The Seven Crystal Balls (Methuen, 1948)Another of the series' setup volumes (this one for Prisoners of the Sun), but as usual, that doesn't stop Herge from having all sorts of wild and wonderful things go on. An expedition comes back from South America, having discovered the tomb of Rascar Capac and brought the mummy back for study. Soon, one by one, the members of the expedition lapse into a coma. Needless to say, One of them is a friend of Calculus' (and one thing I found a minor annoyance throughout the rest of the series-- the hearing aid Calculus procured during Explorers on the Moon was never seen again. It was a good joke for the first few volumes, but it got old pretty quick.), of course, and so Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock find themselves involved, however unwittingly, after Calculus is kidnapped. This is the only one of the setup volumes that actually feels like a setup volume, but it's still better than average, and also features the return (in a minor role) of Tintin's old friend General Alcazar, who would play an increasingly important role as the series went on. ***"},{"Title":"Adventures of Tintin the Seven Crystal Balls (The Adventures of Tintin)","review":"The Seven Crystal Balls begins where its predecessor, Red Rackham's Treasure, left off, with Captain Haddock settling into his family estate, Marlinspike Hall, and enjoying his newfound lord-of-the-manor role perhaps just a tad too much. The mystery begins at a variety show which Tintin and the Captain attend that evening. One of the performers, a clairvoyante, is suddenly seized with a vision that an audience member's husband is in great danger. Shortly afterwards, it is announced that the woman's husband has indeed been taken seriously ill.The woman's husband, as it happens, was one of seven explorers recently returned from a voyage to South America to study the Incan mummy, Rascar Capac. As the story unfolds, the six other explorers - including Professor Calculus' ebullient friend, Professor Tarragon - are also rendered comatose by what appears to be the curse of the mummy. (\\"This will lead to trouble,\\" a stranger prophetically warns Tintin at the beginning of the book, as they are travelling on a train and Tintin is reading about the explorers' expedition. \\"You see if it doesn't!\\")The plot thickens even further, however, when Calculus, taking a stroll around Professor Tarragon's house, discovers a striking gold bracelet, puts it on (remarking on how nicely it goes with his coat), and then mysteriously disappears. It is up to Tintin and the Captain to find him -- but the mystery is left up in the air until the next Tintin volume, Prisoners of the Sun.One final note: Also vitally important to this story is the return of Tintin's old friend General Alcazar, now performing as a music-hall knife thrower under the pseudonym Ramon Zarate. His knife-throwing partner, Chiquito, proves to be a prominent character in this mystery."},{"Title":"Cross a Dark Bridge: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed this book very much; the characters are well-fleshed (and very disturbing in some cases - the sister, Missy, for example) and not terribly stereotyped.

As a student of his, seeing some of the insights that have been shared within the dojo delights me to no end. To then be offered up additional anecdotes that have been equally beneficial to my training as well as mind. I have yet to understand the depth of Sensei's knowledge until completion of this book. Sensei Shea shows a deep understanding of the alternate, yet equally important, side of karate that is less obvious than the fighting prowess. His reflection of events and knack for engaging the reader in the occurrences of his life has addressed a predominantly over looked portion of the martial arts in beginners: the soft side. It is a great companion for any karate student seeking a path towards understanding.Sensei Shea does not stop with lessons for only those who have experienced training but translates his experiences into support for any reader who seeks philosophical outlooks to improve his or her life style.The author has compiled a wonderful collection of anecdotes and lessons that can be applied to all ages and experiences.

In eight highly readable chapters he presents clear discussions of several areas of Colonial America, among them: the explosion in population, the diverse ethnicity, the world of white indentured servents, black slavery and its trade, along with a discussion of the predominant middle class life many enjoyed, and finishes with three fine chapters on Colonial religion and the Great Awakening. His mastery of his subject matter and the clarity of his writing is a joy. The Scotch-Irish, the German religious sects who were excellent farmers, the terrified blacks kidnapped and marched 550 miles to the coast and into slavery, the desperate white indentured servents selling themselves into virtual slavery for a time, the always extremely dangerous ocean crossings, the greedy-yet terrified slaveholders and the cruel slave codes they wrote, the relatively prosperous Americans, the coming of G! ! eorge Whitefield--America's most spectacular preacher, the religious schisms that the Great Awakening brought: all these stories are here. And all packed into a highly readable book. A pleasure to read. Thank you Professor Hofstadter."},{"Title":"America at 1750: A Social Portrait","review":"This is a magnificent work of historical imagination. Hofstadter's last book, it was what was to begin a much larger, possibly three volume epic on the social conditions of America at distinctive periods in our history. And while this book is missing the fuller vision of a more articulated society, the chapters that are present are truly alive with insight and understanding of the way things probably were. Here we see the slave trade not just from a one-sided arcadia, but from every side, from the profiteers and the oppressed, from the African kings selling their nation to the early-day abolitionists mildly arguing their case. We see the white slaves too, the pains and humiliations of indentured servitude to the hearts and minds of men believing themselves at the very least a step up from inhumanity.Then there is the middle class of the pre-revolutionary colonies, filled with religious fanatics and patriotic zealots, all of them looking to make a buck. We see that this class formed the basic foundations of the nation to come and how the politicians of the day catered mostly to this hardly regal, far-reaching group of normal, everyday folks. This chapter, perhaps, gives the fullest picture of the society that was that went on to create the society we are today.And then there is a long discussion of the church and the 'Great Awakening' that plundered through the minds of so many post-witch hunting citizens. These chapters explain the foundations that led not just to a seperation of church and state, but to the required need for religious diversity and how this principle, above all else, came to found our subsequent ideas on American freedom.A glorious, neccessary book, it makes one mourn for this already celebrated historian and wonder what might have been (and regardless of that annoying cliche, one can't help but think in such basic praise dialect when finishing)."},{"Title":"America at 1750: A Social Portrait","review":"I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy, boring and a waste of time. Hofstader, a brilliant and yet very human scholar, has offered us a wonderfully concise, compelling and illuminating read - a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation. He has done all the work, not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon-feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion, but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy, very readable manner. The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review.Bravo Professor Hofstader. I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece."},{"Title":"America at 1750: A Social Portrait","review":"One of History's saddest events, I mean in the discipline of History, was the premature death of Richard Hofstader.With this book, the last he wrote, not finishing it, he also was making a turn in his writing career. Most of his previous work was analytic social history, more like sociology than what the popular mind may consider as history. Although that work was excellent and he proved himself an accomplished essayist, with this one he proves he has an excellent touch with narrative history. He can still singe right through to the heart of what makes the period studied a period that, whatever our superficial technological guises, we still live in.We have moved past slavery, which was so entrenched in American social structure in 1750. But the persistence with which Americans pursued slavery, as if they perceived it was the only way to build a nation and a new kind of nation, one built purely on self-interest, brings the reader to realize that the nation we live in now remains built on slavery. The vast semi-middle classes and lower classes remain slaves to their debased tastes, their lives must remain empty and out of their will's control so that their master's, the tiny set of property and power holders, may prosper and keep building, all for their own prospering only. At the same time, the masters tell these slaves it is all done for the glory of--back then it was \\"God,\\" now it is sometimes \\"God\\" and sometimes everyday mammon.Hofstadter also lets us see the centrality of religion in everyday American life at the same, another factor which has altered only superficially. If America continues to punish the flesh and look to some vague point in the future when God will make everything right, the precedence was there at 1750. If now we seem to live for today, it is not in terms of fully enriching ourselves within the potentials of this world below, but only in terms of momentary indulgences to keep us preoccupied until some dim future when all will be resolved and explained. Candy and candy music are the so-called indulgences, much as prayers and verse-reading were the momentary indulgences to keep the body bearing through this world until the next appeared.Always, Hosftadter reveals, without preaching. The reader can draw the conclusions, even if Hofstadter's brilliant supply of facts leads the careful reader to see the connections between yesterday and today. Considering this book came out four decades ago, it teaches a hard lesson, that the more America thinks it progresses, the more it becomes its same old self."},{"Title":"America at 1750: A Social Portrait","review":"AMERICA AT 1750: A Social Portrait, by Richard Hofstadter. 293 pages. Knopf.This is a good time to read (or re-read) the histories of Richard Hofstadter, who explained the background of McCarthyism. McCarthyism is back, big time. The foreground is different. The background is the same.Hofstadter's writing career, 1944-1970, was almost exactly congruent with the first McCarthyism, and his gracefully written books were bestsellers among lovers of American liberty.The titles of the best-known reveal his thrust: \\"Anti-intellectualism in American Life\\": \\"The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays\\"; \\"Social Darwinism in American Thought\\"; \\"The Development of Academic Freedom in the United States.\\"When he passed the age of 50, Hofstadter projected a massive social history of America, which would require 18 years to write. He died after completing only eight chapters of a scene-setting volume, which were published as \\"America at 1750\\" in 1971.So this little volume is a good place to start before returning to his earlier volumes. It was Hofstadter's opinion that by 1750, peculiarly American attitudes, customs, institutions and morals had formed after six or seven generations away from Europe, and that these were so powerful they still controlled much that we did two centuries later.He was certainly a believer in American exceptionalism, but unlike the antidemocratic, antiliberal ranters about American exceptionalism today, he did not think that everything America did and stood for was wise or benevolent; nor that anyone who dared to criticize our failings was a less than 100 percent American.The chapter headings reveal that. After an opening review of demographics, his first three substantive chapters are on forced labor, white and black; and the capitalist slave trade.Only after reminding us that America was a deeply flawed place does he begin writing about its attractive aspects in \\"The Middle Class World.\\"One aspect of American exceptionalism is that it was history's first majority middle class community.Hofstadter died too soon to remonstrate against the destruction of the middle class in favor of finance capitalism, but he was aware of the threat.His final three chapters are about religion, particularly the Great Awakening in the 1740s.Until then, Americans were unchurched, in the main, although there were established churches in many colonies that taxed everybody.But believers and unbelievers who disdained to pay for someone else's church were free to move, and did.Americans evolved a wholly secular idea of government, not because they were irreligious (which they weren't even if unchurched) but because no sect (after the early days in New England) could command the adherence of a large enough majority to persecute the rest. Thus, the idea of toleration, which was, for most, limited to toleration of Protestants.But it was a good start."},{"Title":"America at 1750: A Social Portrait","review":"To give you a little insight on my opinion, I was assigned to do an \\"outside reading\\" for my U.S. History class and I picked this out of the list of acceptable books.

The first chapter present why examples are so importants by showing how to test definitions, how to construct good and bad examples and how to test the validity of a theorem by the mean of extreme example. The material in this chapter is basic and easy to follow. The second chapter is about the infirmal language and some technics of proof. First, it presents the logic behind the proofs. Also, this chapter presents technics such as induction, proof by case, differents forms of proof based on implication. The third chapter is about the use of quantifier in the proof. It shows how to use and when to use quantifier. Also how to find the structure of a proof. Why I find this book interresting ? First the book is full of exercises of different kind (set, function, analysis, ...and the forth chapter contain laboratories that give you again plenty of exercises), It is written clearly, the author give a lot of advice about proofs, I find the book very suitable to undergraduted, I find the style of writting of the book very motivating. This book is definitely a good one but it is not perfect. I found some of the exercises too easy (about 30 % of the exercises), I don't think that this book is suitable for graduate student but it may help in the way you work proofs and problems.

Overall, the book seems to be extremely appreciated by students transitioning from calculus to upper-level mathematics."},{"Title":"Castles In The Air","review":"This is a well-written work of historical fiction. It opens on the heels of the end of the Civil War. The South is vanquished, while the North is reaping the benefits of being the victor. After all, it is to the victor to whom the spoils must go.The author tells the story of beautiful and headstrong young woman, Devon Marshall, a southern miss from Richmond, Virginia, whose father, a newspaper publisher, has just killed himself, leaving her orphaned. Wanting to be a journalist during a time when it was almost unheard of for a woman to desire such an occupation, she knows that she must leave the pillaged South and head North to New York.Her passage North is made possible when she meets handsome and dashing Keith Curtis, a married multi-millionaire and financier from New York and, initially, becomes his reluctant mistress. Once in New York, however, and despite resistance to the idea by Keith, Devon slowly begins her quest to fulfill her dream of a career in journalism. Her dream eventually comes into conflict with her sweeping romance with Keith, who fails to understand her dream.As Devon begins to move among the power brokers of New York, from those in the financial district to those of Tammany Hall, where greed and corruption are the bywords of the day, she begins to make a name for herself among the journalistic glitterati. Finding herself enmeshed with the feminist vanguard of the day, she also finds herself straddling two worlds, that of her journalistic dream and that of her illicit, back door liaison with Keith. It is little wonder that she one day finds her worlds colliding.This is romantic historical fiction at its best, infused with actual, well-known personages of the day, historical events, and the social mores of nineteenth century America. It is rich in the profundities of human nature and gripping in its storytelling. It tells a tale about life among the rich and famous in nineteenth century New York and Washington, D.C. and of one woman's search to achieve the American dream."},{"Title":"Castles In The Air","review":"This is a great book. the reviewer before me has explained the story line so I won't go into that but this book is worth reading, I bought all 3 of the books in this series and the story line was very good in all 3 of the books."},{"Title":"Castles In The Air","review":"**Review is slightly spoilerish***Castles in the Air begins at the end of the Civil War as Devon Marshall's father commits suicide after the building containing his newspaper business burns to ashes. Devon realizes that the only way to continue a career as a journalist is to strike out for New York, so she breaks off her engagement to an injured war veteran and finagles her way onto the private rail car of banking tycoon Keith Curtis who makes her an offer she can't refuse. Once in New York and not wanting to depend on Curtis for support, Devon strikes out on her own, but she soon finds that obtaining employment as a female journalist is virtually impossible without connections and takes other jobs instead -- jobs that end up with unforeseen complications.Married Curtis can't forget Devon and rescues her from her latest job as one of the \\"birds\\" in a cage at a notorious saloon and unwilling to fight him any longer Devon agrees to become Curtis' mistress (his wife is an invalid, or is she just pretending to be paralyzed?) and as much as he'd like to he cannot marry Devon. The book continues with the ups and downs of their relationship and Devon's involvement in different circles of New York society, dirty politics, emancipation for women, and more. Eventually Devon does obtain a job as a journalist reporting for the women's section of a local paper and she is able to take further that job as she is assigned as one of the many female reporters following the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant from the viewpoint of Mrs. Grant and the social whirl of Washington DC.Although the basic premise of the storyline sounds like your basic historical romance, and at times it did seem to take on a soap opera/TV mini series type of quality, I have to give the author credit for including a great deal of historical facts and characters. In addition to being entertained with a good story, I obtained a wonderful inside peek at the people and history of late 19C politics with it's dirty politicians, social scandals, railroad barons, the social mores of the day and more as Devon must ultimately decide between her love for Keith or her independence to strike out on a new life that she can live without secrecy or fear of discovery and scandal. The ending definitely left an opening for more of Devon's story and I'd dearly like to know if she continued this in her other books.

I always thought so too, until I actually lived in England and married a Brit. America is such a big country, but we have so few accents... unlike England where a native can tell what street in which city you grew up on just by hearing your voice! The system is so concrete that it is impossible to fake out anyone who \\"knows.\\"This is a sort of difficult book for Americans to read, because we don't really understand just how important language is as a social and class divide in England. It is still the case, but when Ms. Mitford's essay was first published it was even more concrete. At times, I grew a little bored of the book because even though I understand that it is a big deal over there, the democratic American spirit in me doesn't particularly like or appreciate it.The book consists of Ms. Mitford's essay, and several supplemental and follow-up essays and letters about it. It is worth a read if you are interested in class in England, or in linguistics (though keep in mind that it's best described as \\"anecdotal linguistics\\" and not as a real academic study).

It is a lively exploration of the quaint turns of phrase, social peculiarities, and other habits that identify the British upper-classes (charmingly referred to as U), as distinguished from the lower-classes (non-U).As the title suggests, what makes an aristocrat is a sense of Noblesse Oblige, or the obligation of the nobility to put his high position at the service of those beneath him, and at the service of the common good. That being said, there is always a je ne sais quoi about the fictional and non-fictional characters of the Aristocracy that make them sometimes irresistible and other times loathsome, but always fascinating, and often extremely funny.If you simply want to know for the sake of idle curiosity--or if you want to avoid the blunders (beginning with audible self-promotion and ending with obnoxious table manners) that might make the occasional aristocrat you run into at a dinner party either enjoy your conversation (think of Elizabeth Bennet) or avoid you like the plague, (think of Mr. Collins) you will enjoy this book.If you are a sociologist studying the nature of class-distinctions which the human race routinely creates (in spite of every attempt to prevent it) than you will REALLY enjoy this book.If, on the other hand, the very thought of social class gives you hives, avoid this book at all costs."},{"Title":"Noblesse Oblige: an Inquiry into the Identifiable Characteristics of the English Aristocracy","review":"It was not as interesting as I thought it would be.

However, this book has absolutely nothing to do with either Sand or Chopin. This book is entirely made up of George Sand describing the scenery, people, and foods of Majorca, and just complaining about how she hated it there. And to make it worse, there are footnotes on every page saying that Sand was totally wrong about everything she was saying. I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless they wanted to read up on what Majorca was like during the 1800's."},{"Title":"WINTER IN MAJORCA","review":"Sand's chronicle of a wretched season spent on the Balearic island of Mallorca is the archetype for the &quot;bad-trip&quot; school of travel writing. Caustic, spiteful and utterly devoid of sentimentality or remorse, Sand (who was visiting with her beastly young daughter, Solange, and an ailing Frederic Chopin) trashes everything Mallorcan, from the olive oil, to the weather, to the landscape, to the moral character of the islanders. (If only the British and German package tourists who have colonized and defaced Mallorca in the 20th century had read Sand beforehand!)An added pleasure in this edition is the sniping and meticulous footnoting by Mallorcan expat Robert Graves. He gainsays and qualifies nearly every contentious little gripe of Sand's, providing the reader with an interesting cross-generational literary (and personal) cat/dog-fight.My guess is, if you enjoy the withering observations of Paul Theroux and his disciples, you will enjoy Sand's nasty little book. If, however, you like your travel books in soft-focus and heavy on the ambience and schmaltz, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"WINTER IN MAJORCA","review":"The product has followed my requirements, shipping was in time.

I might describe the book as a literary memoir, and it is amazingly engaging. Lawrence Velvel is an extraordinary man in many ways, and his years of experience in the legal profession come through resoundingly in the text of this book. Among other things, Velvel is the dean of the Massachusetts School of Law (which he helped found) - a law school committed to providing a legal education to minorities, working class individuals, and others traditionally excluded from studying law. You might wonder just how engaging a story a legal scholar can tell - but Misfits in America is anything but dull, boring prose. Velvel may be an academic, but he is also a born story-teller who kept me fascinated from start to finish. Even as he uses the story to voice his own social criticism of modern American life and justice, making a few points that I don't personally agree with, I never bristled a single bit.This book, the first in Velvel's Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam quartet, basically tells us the story of Harry Brohnz, a brilliant thinker with an amazing ability to go right to the heart of every problem, a man who should have had an incredibly successful legal career. Harry, though, was handicapped by a seemingly unconquerable commitment to social justice and a belief that good always prevails through hard work and dedication, that one should work for the benefit of others, and that honesty is always the best policy. These are all wonderful character traits, but they are liabilities for anyone wanting to be truly successful in the perverted legal system of post-World War II America. Things should not be this way, and that is what Velvel's story is really all about. He gives us an incredibly refreshing look at our modern legal system, decrying the elitism of the whole culture (especially law schools), and condemning the outright greed and selfishness that is ingrained into and drives far too many lawyers and judges today.Misfits in America is also a look at growing up Jewish in mid-twentieth-century America, as the narrator, Harry Brohnz, Lionel Wolfe (who becomes the focus of Trail of Tears, the second book in the quartet), and their fraternity brothers at Michigan all come from Jewish households. The college stories are fascinating, not least because, for this class of extraordinary young men, academic success paled in comparison to winning the inter-fraternity sports championship, and the days were filled more with pranks than learning. Velvel criticizes the university system as a whole for, to some degree, wasting four good years of its students' lives; not only did universities seem not to care about academics, they turned a blind eye to cheating. Much more pointed criticism is directed at the law schools, however, where elitism ran rampant. Every school (except Yale) wanted to be Harvard, and Harvard grads (unless they were Jewish) got all the best jobs. Law school itself did little to prepare its students for actual legal work, instead concentrating on demoralizing students and wringing every remaining drop of social justice and ethics out of their systems. Since Jews were unable to land jobs at major law firms (even if they had a Harvard degree, as Brohnz did), both Brohnz and Wolfe go to work for the Department of Justice - where both idealistic young men are further appalled by the attitude of the government, which was just as likely to trod on individual rights as not.Brohnz is even further disillusioned after his move to the academic world. Unable to get the job he wanted and impatient to move in the direction of constitutional law, Brohnz joins the faculty at a small, Midwestern law school, hoping to make a difference in the lives of at least some law school students. While there, he becomes increasingly disillusioned with the ongoing war in Vietnam. Believing that Johnson's war was unconstitutional (since Congress alone was given the right to declare war), he begins bringing suits against the government arguing this very point. No matter how brilliant his work, though, he draws little attention - he's battling both the elitism that says professors at small Midwestern law schools don't merit attention and a government that has long ago abandoned the principles it was founded upon. Velvel believes that federal judges ignored their constitutional duty during the Vietnam conflict, and that argument forms the crux of this book.This is both a tragic and hopeful book. Velvel makes no secret of the fact that he believes federal judges continue to ignore their constitutional duties, that the whole legal system is afflicted with elitism of the worst sort, and that America as a society has lost its way over the course of the last half-century. Harry Brohnz, never able to shake his belief in social justice, ultimately comes to believe that most people can always be counted upon to do the wrong thing. Still, he never gives up his ideals, never sells his soul, never stops trying to do the right thing himself. Velvel himself basically calls out those who have perverted the ideals of the American Dream - judges, politicians, academics - and shows how their betrayal of ethics has spread to society itself in the form of business scandals, a loss of faith and trust in the government, etc. Misfits in America is a truly powerful book that challenges all of us, especially those in law and politics, to do whatever we can to insure that the American Dream is not lost to us forever. You will find much more than an inside look at the legal profession in these pages; you will gain insight into the very fabric of modern American society."},{"Title":"Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam: A Story of the Last Half of the Twentieth Century, Vol 1: Misfits in America","review":"When I was in high school it was clearly stated in the West Mesa student handbook that a student's participation in activities (not to be confused with sports) was to be limited to a set number of activities that could not exceed a certain number of points. The idea was clearly to distribute opportunities to students at what was then the largest high school in the state of New Mexico (so large in fact the school was on split session, with juniors and seniors attending from 7 to noon before the afternoon shift showed up). Under these rules a student would not be able to be student body president, co-editor of the newspaper, a member of the national honor society, compete in speech and debate, and so plays. But nobody stopped me even though the points associated with these activities (and others) were worth three times the proscribed limit of points.From this experience I learned that I could do what I wanted despite the rules. This is a rather dangerous thing for a teenager to learn, but when I went to college I used these guiding principle to take upper division classes my first semester of college. I was able to do this for two reasons. First, I entered college as a sophomore, having taken the general College Level Examination Placement test and having received thirty college credits. Basically you took a test and they compared your scores to the average college sophomore, and if you did above average you got credit. At the first college I attended they would give me credit for specific courses, such as Introduction to Physics, because of my score. This astounded me because I had never even taken high school biology, had not taken a math course since my freshman year (you needed one credit of math to graduate) and could not remember how you multiplied fractions (I must have figured it out). Apparently the average college student was something of an idiot if I could get credit for physics. I took three more specific CLEP tests and had 39 credits without setting foot in a college classroom. The second thing I did was to never see a college advisor. After all, they were the ones who knew the rules and would tell me I could not take the courses I wanted to take (i.e., an early variation on the don't ask/don't tell approach to conflict resolution).This extended journey down memory lane represents my personal reaction to reading \\"Misfits in America,\\" which is Lawrence R. Level's first volume in his series, \\"Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam: A Story of the Last Half of the Twentieth Century.\\" The thesis of the book and the subject of its final chapters has to do with the illegality of the Vietnam War, specifically in terms of constitutionality issues regarding the failure of Congress to declare war and abrogating its detailed responsibilities to the president. However, in a larger sense Velvel is not only explaining why the country is the way that it is and why Vietnam became all that it became, but why his main protagonist, Harry Brontz, is the man the Velvel writes about. It is that last part that inspired deep thoughts regarding my past and I think this volume will inspire others to do the same, especially if they did not go on to law school. I was the only member of my college debating team not to become a lawyer, although I did toy with the notion of going for fun (I was trying to get a teaching job of a university that would allow its professors to attend the law school for free) to study constitutional law. Clearly I ascribed to Oscar Wilde's witticism that, \\"The study of law is sublime, and its practice vulgar.\\" However, after reading the manifesto of reforms that Dean Velvel enumerates in his message to students at the Massachusetts School of Law, I am willing to rethink my position, although probably not my vocation.\\"Misfits in America\\" constitutes an argument, more than a narrative. Although arranged chronologically overall, Velvel will jump back and forth in time to make a point, rather than to simply tell a story. His personal experiences serve as both the evidence and the rational for his scathing critique on what is wrong with the American legal system, from the hallowed halls of \\"elite\\" law schools to the failure of the United States Supreme Court. The latter is particularly damning because Velvel is able to castigate the court from both the liberal and conservative perspectives (former debaters particularly enjoy arguments where you win either way). The evidence for these arguments comes from both the real world and the world of academe, with the personal experiences of the protagonists in the book, Harry Brontz and Lionel Wolfe, who are presented as law school classmates and fraternity brothers at Michigan.The term \\"protagonists,\\" used to describe Harry Brontz, Lionel Wolfe and other characters in this book, is important because although this is a memoir you can forget about spending your title Googling their names to find out what these former graduates of the Michigan Law School are up to today (Velvel cites Abraham Lincoln early on as a key role model, but his approach here brings to mind Silence Dogood). Those who are so inclined and who are in a position to do so can do their own annotations as to which school is Midwest State, unmask the various characters, and settle the argument as to who had the highest GPA in the history of Harvard Law School. Such points are moot for me because I am more concerned with what is \\"real\\" than what is \\"true,\\" and Velvel's book rings \\"real\\" (perception is key, a point made implicitly but repeatedly in this book). Ultimately I see his position as being more anti-conservative than liberal, a natural consequence of the political system being inherently conservative. That all three branches of government are currently controlled by political conservatives only strengthens the point, although it also means incumbents get to bear the brunt of these attacks. But Velvel had harsh words for just about everybody in Washington, D.C., with the notable exception of William O. Douglas, so I see a plague being called down on all of their branches.I freely admit that I am focusing more on what Velvel has to say about the causes behind the problems that exist today, and clearly I am playing it out in my own mind on much more of a personal level than on the social. After all, there are two books to go in this series and I expect my thinking to progress to dealing more with effects and solutions as I continue to read. Because of my occupational psychosis I will be thinking more in terms of academia than of legal issues, but dealing with students who act more like consumers and who demand to be entertained as a prerequisite to being educated pretty much forces such issues upon me (fortunately the latter plays to me strength almost as much as the former offends me heart and soul). I know that the Rosie the Riveter experiences of World War II and the creation of the birth control pill were the key causal elements in liberating women in our culture, and Velvel comes up with something equally as important as a paradigm shift in the G.I. Bill. That the legislation was intended to have a big impact on housing for veterans but ended up transforming colleges because of the educational provisions seems obvious, and the fact that such profound changes were unintentional another one of those ironies that confronts you with a choice between deep laughter and bitter tears. The impact of sports and the self-perpetuating machine that are the nation's law schools come into play as well.Until I reached the final set of chapters, which on balance are considerably shorter than the early ones, I was reading this book a chapter at a time before going to sleep. The reasoning behind this approach was that after reading each chapter I needed to go through a personal dialectic, critiquing Velvel's claims in terms of my own knowledge and experience to come up with how it all makes sense to me. The fact that Velvel refers to Professor Kingsfield from \\"The Paper Chase\\" as Professor Kingsbury may well be a pun rather than a typographical error or mistake of recall, but Velvel also quotes one of the most significant philosophers of the 20th century, Lawrence Peter Berra, THREE times in the book, so he comes out ahead in my ledger. Obviously I personalized reading this book more than others, but doing so does not preempt your ability to apply the lessons of \\"Misfits in America\\" to current constitutional crises or undeclared wars. It was just how I worked through the arguments and I think there is value for everybody in knowing how they were shaped and molded. Do I still do what I want? Count the number of words in this review (or the number and types of reviews I have posted) and see if that gives it away. Meanwhile, Dean Velvel's latest blog has to do with the current events topic of electronic surveillance, and I bet if you read this book you can hazard a guess as to what he is arguing with regards to that particular issue."},{"Title":"Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam: A Story of the Last Half of the Twentieth Century, Vol 1: Misfits in America","review":"This is an important and also a very enjoyable book. That in itself is a rare combination, and worthy of attention.As a UK reader with no legal background I was afraid that much of the material might be mysterious or irrelevant to me, but I could not have been more wrong.Misfits in America is volume 1 of a quartet, but it can be happily read alone. The author has a sharp and amusing style, and never pulls his punches. His take on events of the mid twentieth century is refreshing, absorbing and relevant to modern events, and the language is pitched at the intelligent lay reader, not solely at fellow lawyers. The book deals with subjects important to the conduct of a free democracy - the conduct of law schools abd the legal system, the relations of the legal system and the political system, and especially the legality of wars declared by the President rather than by Congress. This might sound dry (and I am making it sound pompous, when it certainly isn't), but it comes vividly to life and sheds light on subsequent events. The author's reflections on Vietnam have led me to consider and partly revise my views on the Iraq war and Britain's involvement in it, no mean feat!"},{"Title":"Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam: A Story of the Last Half of the Twentieth Century, Vol 1: Misfits in America","review":"As I have been reading through 'Misfits in America', I am reminded in certain respects of Amoz Os, the modern Israeli writer, who, upon being criticised for some of the political stances of his characters, pled the defense of the characters being fiction - and therefore, by implication, that the stances would likewise be fictional, not necessarily his own. I get the same sense when reading this, that Velvel is using this fictional tale, drawn from his own experience, his own profession and his own time to critically examine the state of affairs both current and recent past, both in society generally and in the legal/judicial profession specifically.Velvel's idealism is apparent from the very first page. Drawing from Abraham Lincoln's idea that it isn't good enough to do well for oneself, but rather one must also help fellow humankind, and exploring the less materialistic aspects of what the American Dream should incorporate, Velvel proceeds down a path that really would lead to the proverbial 'city on a hill', with alabaster towers that gleam in the distance. Alas, Velvel is not writing that kind of fiction. His fiction remains close the corridor of the progress of history, and so we see in compelling and interesting situations how the idea of America falls short in different ways, while still maintain the ideal.Velvel's text in this first volume (originally conceived as part of a trilogy, and later growing to become part of a quartet) starts with the natural genius Harry Brohnz, the kind of guy many students hate to have in a class that is graded on a curve, as he sets the bar too high. Even from this start, we see Velvel's idealism, as it clashes with the idea of standardised tests being used as a label and measure of a person. Brohnz went to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the 'Harvard of the Midwest', where he met Lionel Wolfe (who will figure more prominently later in the series), and later went to Harvard for law school, while Wolfe would remain at Ann Arbor. Brohnz walks between the privilege his genius gives him and the discrimination his Jewish identity causes, particularly in the 1950s American culture (perhaps best exemplified by the number of Hollywood personalities who had to change their 'too Jewish' names to more mainstream names to maintain popularity).Velvel explores different incidents in college, in law school, and in teaching that, while fictional, it is almost certain that the incidents described are true (some read such that one simply can't make this up - Dr. Spiderman, for example, has to based on some true event and/or character) - perhaps simply the names have been changed to protect the innocent (or the not-yet-proven-guilty). Perhaps the heart of this volume of the quartet occurs rather more near the end, as he explores some fundamental inadequacies of the judicial branch of the time. While applauding such actions as Brown vs. Board of Education and other rulings that made the Supreme Court 'a liberal bastion, sometimes the liberal bastion, among the three branches of the federal government,' he still takes the judiciary to task for not stepping up to the responsibilities of being an adequate check/balance to the other branches, particularly the presidency as it embroiled the country ever more thoroughly in the Vietnam conflict. He also is critical in other, lesser known cases - United States v. Kras, for example, which turned on issues of equal access to the federal courts in spite of lack of monetary resources. It is clear the Velvel (through Brohnz) found the ruling abhorrent that Kras did not have a right of access because he lacked the $50 filing fee.Lawrence Velvel is a great storyteller. Perhaps this is unexpected from an academic in the legal profession (Velvel is Dean and professor of law at the Massachusetts School of Law). This is the kind of book which compels the reader to keep reading; even though the general ebb and flow of history are fairly well known, the details that are presented keep the reader looking for more, and the personalities presented are also very interesting - perhaps even more so at the moment, as the country watches the retirement of and selection of a Supreme Court justice.Five stars!"},{"Title":"Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam: A Story of the Last Half of the Twentieth Century, Vol 1: Misfits in America","review":"Misfits In America is the first volume of a planned trilogy titled \\"Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam\\" and authored by journal editor, lawer, academician, and host of \\"Books of our Time\\" (an hour-long television book review show seen throughout New England). The focus is the lives of two men who grew up in the 1950s. They are indoctrinated into the virtues extolled by the American Dream - honesty, hard work, competence, social justice, and modesty. At the same time, they see their generation misled, and that those who do seize success for their own are the ones who embody the opposite of the American dream - the liars, the lazy, the sycophants, the unjust. Embodying an era of the author's own life, during which he has labored as a pioneering lawyer who fought tooth and nail against the presidental war-mongering power that brought the Vietnam and Iraq wars, Misfits In America is a bold, involving portrait of society itself, and the failings it needs to overcome to move into a future that can in any way aspires to the noble ideals of its foundation."},{"Title":"Peaceful Piggy Meditation","review":"By realistic I mean kids CAN find a quiet spot somewhere to chill out and take a deep breath.

The assumption seems to be that kids are not smart enough and/or not be interested enough to hear about how humans use and find peace through meditative techniques.The text also over-generalizes the ideas and although there are slighly more lengthy explanation pages at the end of the book, there is still a tone of being talked down to which is a real turn-off.Peaceful Piggy Meditation may have its place within a larger teaching unit on prayer, meditation, and self-awareness but the book does not, unfortunately, stand alone as instruction for what meditation is and how to use it, nor is it a stand alone \\"storybook.\\""},{"Title":"Peaceful Piggy Meditation","review":"\\"Peaceful Piggy Meditation\\" is another great meditation guide for kids by the author of \\"Moody Cow Meditates\\". While there is no underlying plot to the book, it is much more of a learning book than a story.Kerry introduces children to meditation practice in a manner that is understandable and enjoyable. The book is more than likely geared toward children from the ages of 3-8, I thinok older children may think the illustrations are to young for them. Not that it is a bad thing, because I think if this book is introduced at the earlier age, the kids won't need it later as the will have the experience of meditation already.The great thing is, you and your kids do not have to be a Buddhist to read and implement the meditations in this book. Minus the dedication of the book, there is no mention of Buddha, Buddhism or religion at all.We are re-introduced to the jar mediation we learned in \\"Moody Cow..\\" and are also given instruction on how to implement a new one. It is more of a \\"mindful of breath\\" meditation, which most of us are familiar with already, but it is simplified in a way that will make it understandable to those children that fit into the age group I already mentioned.The book is beautifully illustrated. As I was reading it to do this review my kids were hovering over me, asking me to read it and asking what the piggies were doing. I can't wait to get into this some more with them.

The theme of the book was just about right for kids aged 4-9. I did not find the material \\"dumbed down\\" for this age group as a previous reviewer suggested, but perhaps older children might find it to be so. The piggies are cute and kind of cool (I liked them!).The book guides children through the reasons why meditation is necessary, and believe me when I say it is the best book on the market for doing so (I looked around extensively). Especially good is the \\"mind-in-a-jar\\" experiment at the end of the book which gives a concrete, hands-on demonstration of why meditation is necessary. We placed dirt into a jar, spun it around, and the kids noticed how the sediment settled to the bottom after they meditated. A note, however: a little dirt goes a long way - don't put too much in or the experiment won't be as successful.Some practical notes: it is best if this book is taught by someone who is experienced in meditation, as is the case with all meditative traditions. Furthermore, most children can't really meditate effectively for more than five or ten minutes due to modern attention spans. Just like adults, some children can meditate in full-lotus, some in half-lotus, and some can't do either. Especially if teaching in a group, care needs to be given to all three groups and children should be allowed to do what is comfortable. Finally, instruction is needed on the importance of giving ourselves some time to \\"switch modes\\" from meditation-mode to running-around-and-playing-mode in order to adjust. If children just get up and run around one second after meditating, the sudden switch between sympathetic and parasympathetic systems may cause some discomfort.Overall, I believe this is a \\"must-have\\" book for anyone who wants to teach meditation to children aged 4-9, but as with any meditation book, this is best taught by an experienced meditator."},{"Title":"Peaceful Piggy Meditation","review":"This book was a useful step in introducing my two year old to pairing meditation with awareness of breath. She and I have been cultivating the ability to sit still and be aware of our breathing for a while. This book helped her to see that she can use breath awareness to calm herself in a stressful situation (hearing the vacuum cleaner, having to do something she doesn't want to do, etc.).I did not give the book 5 stars because it lacks the substance to interest older readers, yet some of the concepts are a bit advanced for younger readers. By the time my daughter is old enough to be concerned about enemies, standing up to others, and accepting things as they are, she will probably be too old to relate to personified pigs."},{"Title":"Peaceful Piggy Meditation","review":"While the story is not actually a meditation it is a great introduction for children to understand why....they should meditate. Simple text and adorable illustrations explain and show that \\"When you're peaceful, you can be truly fearless!\\" This book can definitely motivate young children to want to try and meditate. I also recommend the \\"Indigo Dreams Series\\" to move your children into meditation after being motivated by the peaceful piggies to try it. Great way to introduce a complicated concept."},{"Title":"Peaceful Piggy Meditation","review":"Don't be put off by the \\"piggies\\" (I was, initially). This is actually a really good book on meditation. If you want to teach your young (under 8) child/ren to meditate (or understand the idea behind meditation) this is absolutely perfect.

The peaceful piggy in this book offers my child a lot more than a few moments of reading time. My daughter especially loves the meditation directions in the back and she had even made a meditation corner in her room. This book has been a wonderful introduction at a child's level. She doesn't want to meditate daily because of the book, BUT she is aware of her breathing when she gets upset and I applaud the author. I imagine children ages 4-8 could appreciate this book.

I have to say that, despite my reservations about fantasy, I enjoyed it throughly.&quot;Legends&quot; worked for me especially because I enjoyed the author's voice. While reading, I got a sense of J.C.Hall watching her characters' lives unfold with fond bemusement. When you know that the author loves her characters, it's hard not to join in.The other thing I really enjoyed was how the relationships between Cara, Karvel, and Jai were portrayed-- with subtlety. The author doesn't whack you over the head with the dreaded &quot;this is EXACTLY what's happening here, this is EXACTLY what (s)he feels&quot; two-by-four of character development...."},{"Title":"Legends of the Serai","review":"J.C. Hall is an international figure, having been born in Hong Kong; educated in London; and currently divides her time between Vancouver, British Columbia and Hong Kong. Legends Of The Serai is her first published novel, although she is currently working on The House of Orveen, and prequel to Legends of the Serai and has completed Lady of the Lakes.As all great fantasy novels, Legends Of The Serai begins with the rough sketch of the world of the Serai. Goddesses who play in the mountains create the perfect backdrop for a goddess/human coupling. The offspring form the chosen, whether it be from the moon goddess, the sun goddess, or the goddess of the dark. Cara'sen is the Moon-Chosen, a Lead Officer in the Guild of the Overseers. Estranged from her father, and heartsick over her brother who left under mysterious circumstances fifteen years before, Cara and her spar Jai find themselves taking on a special mission, one that will have far-reaching consequences for the future of the Western lands. But not before stones of the goddesses wreak havoc in their lives:&quot;Cara cursed his lack of attention to the classic legend of his childhood. Lorra had turned her attention back to the luminary pair of stones and was admiring them, patiently waiting for Karvel'len's death. Any moment now, she would tug at the strings and find that she could not open the pouches. And Tal was still imprisoned within the shield with Lorn standing impassively over her.&quot;Legends Of The Serai is a finely wrought piece of work that grips the reader from the first page. Cara is a brave and talented heroine, torn for her love of the men around her, including the father who she felt disavowed her. Cara's world is full of danger, and she leads the reader through a virtual labyrinth of sorcery, adventure, and fantasy. J.C. Hall is careful not to give too much away, thus opening the way for a series, much to the delight of the reader.As is the case with several &quot;publish on demand&quot; books, Legends Of The Serai is a gem that deserves a wide readership. J.C. Hall is a gifted writer with a strong vision. Her characters are complicated, and at the same time exude the luminous quality of fantasy. A real find.Shelley GlodowskiReviewer"},{"Title":"Legends of the Serai","review":"This is a stunning first novel. The author has an incredible knack of taking the generic fantasy battle of good versus evil, populating it with characters and issues entirely unique to the genre, and breathing life into it.

What, I hear you cry, do I mean by this? Well, it's the way things / events / relationship were presented to the reader. Things were never over, there was a lot left unsaid &amp; unspoken, a lot of reading between the lines, yet I was never left in any doubt as to the depth of feelings, for instance, between various characters. (I particularly found the relationship between Cara &amp; her half-brother, Holden, very moving.) The author manages to avoid sentimentality throughout a novel replete with emotional scenes (a feat in itself). My one complaint is to do with the ending. The anticlimax was so abrupt it took me by complete surprise. Let us hope the sequel delivers (&amp; delivers in style &amp; content) what is as yet only a promise of better things to come."},{"Title":"Legends of the Serai","review":"For a start, I have to say I'm biased. As a devout fan of fantasy, I pretty much devour anything in the genre. Me, I'm not particular: Dungeons and Dragons give me as much satisfaction as Lord of the Rings. Recent faves include Robin Hobb's Assassin series (jsut to show you where I'm coming from). So, how does Legends fare with the greats and not-so-greats? Well, it's pretty much up there with the rest of 'em, IMHO. The prologue is lyrical; the story proper is action-adventure on a par with your usual run-of-the-mill fantasy. What makes Legends stand out is its use of a strong female protagonist (even in this day and age, that's a rarity in this popular genre)with her male sidekick (her spar, Jai) and a tortured love-interest (Karvel'len)and a host of well-drawn characters (even the minor ones). Some stories are character-driven, others rely heavily on plot. Legends manages to combine the two. A rollicking good read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Legends of the Serai","review":"Legends of the Serai stole hours of sleep from me, so make sure your house is in order and your children and pets well fed before you pick it up. With rhythmic, almost melodic phrasing, author J.C. Hall will lure you into an imaginary world filled with adventure and passion. At the heart of the story is a haunting exploration of the transfiguring power of love--a subject that, for all its universal nature, requires a delicate touch to make it bloom.JC Hall has that touch--as displayed in her creation of an all-too-human young woman, Lady Cara'sen, who is torn apart by her longings for two very different men. Cara fights like a man, with skill and strength, yet she is completely female. Each man holds a deep love for her, but neither the fiery Karvel'len or the ever-devoted Jai can resist trying to deny Cara her right to choose.Although it has a fascinating plot, what catches and pulls you through Legends of the Serai is the beauty of the writing. The pace, while quick, is a bit more relaxed and therefore more satisfying than most modern fantasy novels. The author takes time for the little nuances and details that make a magical world truly come alive. In addition, the author's wry humor is exhibited at just the right times--giving the reader an opportunity for an occasional inner chuckle.This is a book to curl up with and let yourself be transported into an alternate world where honour, duty and devotion still matter.[...]"},{"Title":"Legends of the Serai","review":"If you like books which combine fine writing, elaborate myth, and fantasy and magic, then you will deeply enjoy Legends of the Serai.In a world ruled by the powerful legend of three mysterious stones, young and beautiful Cara'sen, descendant of a goddess and Lead-Officer in the Overseer's Special Guild, is out on a special quest in order to save her precious Western Lands from destruction. The young protagonist's struggle is internal as it is external, for she is torn apart by her love and desire for two very different men--her faithful spar Jai and the dark and alluring Karvel'len. At the heart of the mystery of the three strange opals is not only Karvel'len but also her long lost brother. There's only one problem: instead of uniting forces as they should be doing, the two men hate each other and would like nothing more than to see each other dead. To add to this, Cara'sen is haunted by the whereabouts of her father, who she hasn't seen since she was a little girl. Keeping this in mind, Cara'sen is a middle point surrounded by four male figures which affect and influence her life on various levels.The story begins with a fascinating prologue which explains the hierarchy of the goddesses and how the legend began. Keeping a tightly controlled pace, talented author J.C. Hall weaves a believable and realistic imaginary world filled with passion and adventure. Her prose flows beautifully and the dialogue sparkles with authenticity, drawing the reader into the carefully plotted story. Heavier in characterization and more stylishly written than most commercial fantasy novels, this is a book to savor slowly and certainly not one to be swallowed overnight. J.C. Hall is a fine storyteller and her skill and love for her story and characters really shine through the pages."},{"Title":"POEMS FROM THE BOOK OF HOURS","review":"I have bought copies of this for many people and I keep a paperback copy to lend in addition to my first edition hardcover.

Her method rather than opening a door closes one. No accident surely that the avant-garde reached their peak in this period whereas other mediums have progressed towards the arguably hollow victory of full abstraction."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Both my sister and I have had the pleasure of trying to study Virginia Woolf's 'To the Lighthouse', at A-level...without much success!

Read Faulkner as the master of the stream of consciousness technique. To the elitist reviewers who \\"Can't believe this only has a 4 star average\\", wake up to the fact that this book repulses many people, and it's NOT because we can't understand the content; it's that we see through Woolf's shallow and dull story telling masked by over-the-top modernist phrasing. Seriously, this is by far the most overrated \\"classic\\" in our literary cannon."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"It's a phenomenon that a place so unliterary as Hollywood is often responsible for renewed interest in a writer's work or personal story.Virginia Woolf got a giant boost a couple of years ago with a major film production called \\"The Hours.\\" Nicole Kidman received an Academy Award for her portrayal of today's subject/author.The edition of Woolf's \\"To The Lighthouse\\" read to produce this book report has a 1927 copyright and was published by Harcourt, Brace and Company; a brown-paged and rickety offering in gray cloth cover.the scribe, a screenwriter himself, took it up because of the awareness of Woolf gained from \\"The Hours\\" and surrounding media.It is difficult to say what the book is truly about. Like many good novels it's about many things, but no single thing you follow, anticipating development, comfortable with the pace of revelation. You hardly know what's being revealed.The story does not move many places or ever truly \\"get going\\" in the dramatic sense; that's not considered a flaw at highwayscribery, rather a virtue. Woolf's long ruminations and interior examinations are where the energy is, inside the characters who act little, but think much.The language is exacting, taxing, and sometimes the author's sentences finish somewhere else than they're supposed to. It's hard to imagine that such a baroque and delving prose would stand a snowball's chance in hell of getting published today.It was written, you see, before the vast commercialization of that same revolutionary film-making--as-storytelling process and the homogenizing effect it had on most people's treatment of literature.A family called the Ramsays have a coastal house somewhere in Britannia before the First World War. They are genteel; he a famous philosopher, she a hothouse flower of heightened sensibility.Three-quarters of the book take place in a 24-hour expanse as Woolf takes us through the minds of nearly a dozen people; people thinking about their relationship to a larger world, to themselves, to the people gathered at the Ramsays.Although not wealthy, the Ramsays can afford to keep some illustrious guests at the summer home and their brood numbers five or six. And so the author's mind-mining finds plenty of fertile ground for topics worldly and domestic alike:\\"...children never forget. For this reason, it was so important what one said, and what one did, and it was a relief when they went to bed. For now she need not think about anybody. She could be herself, by herself. And that was what now she often felt the need of - to think; well, not even to think.\\"So what?If you're a parent it rings true. It tells you something you knew innately, but had never crystallized into a solid idea. Good literature does that. Pulls us in by making us relate and instructs, turns pleasure into profit, while you're laying beneath the warm glow of a golden late-night lamp.But the scribe's writing like Woolf here (that happens).Mrs. Ramsay is the star of this gentile warm-season gathering, the looking glass through whom we experience the day-turned-evening event, the one who judges the motives and shortcomings of the guests, although we are treated to the points-of-view from other characters, too.A fading beauty, but a beauty both spiritual and cosmetic nonetheless, Mrs. Ramsay's particular gift is the arrangement of sublime moments and her conflict is that she enjoys them so much more than those she deigns to design them for:\\"Everything seemed possible. Everything seemed right. Just now (but this cannot last, she thought, dissociating herself from the moment while they were all talking about boots) just now she had reached a security; she hovered like a hawk suspended; like a flag floating in an element of joy which filled every nerve of her body fully and sweetly, not noisily, solemnly rather...\\"Looking for a little post-reading help, the scribe read an article by Louise DeSalvo on Woolf's relationship with writer Rita Sackville-West, during which she wrote \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"It's from a book entitled \\"Significant Others, Creativity & Intimate Passion,\\" edited by Whitney Chadwick and Isabelle de Courtivron, and published by Thames and Hudson in 1993. Some of the other couplings it assays are Clare and Andre Malraux, Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, Camille Claudel and Auguste Rodin.According to DeSalvo, the younger lover and writer saw that Woolf needed social interaction, and made sure she got it, because \\"Virginia based her fiction primarily upon observation, not upon her imagination.\\"So Mrs. Ramsay may very well be Woolf's mother, a woman affected by withdrawal and depression.While together, they generated the finest work of their lives, Woolf informing Sackville-West's writing with a greater literary quality, Rita giving Virginia an openness and the tools to reach a wider, best-selling audience.\\"To the Lighthouse\\" was one in a troika of novels (\\"The Waves\\" and \\"The Years) that \\"examined her childhood in the Stephen Family, a childhood riddled with violence, sexual abuse, and emotional neglect,\\" according to DeSalvo.The Mr. Ramsay of \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" corresponds to Woolf's characterization of life with her father as, \\"living in a cage with a lion.\\" His \\"self-absorbed\\" grief is on display and much-detailed in the novel.Not an unsympathetic man, Mr. Ramsay is falling just short of being a great philosopher and the resulting worries keep him from strengthening the fading connection he has with his wife. She must repress the need to quote the price of a roofing job to stay out of his fuzzy head where he is very busy. Those around him cannot help but be charmed by his magnetism and intelligence, but his overbearing nature (sometimes he's just being a father), leads mostly to resentment.So, \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is a work pegged to her childhood and perhaps Virginia is Lily, a minor character and more minor painter. Here she alternates between artistic courage and terror, enriching before a blank canvas.\\"For what could be more formidable than that space? Here she was again, she thought, stepping back to look at it, drawn out of gossip, out of living, out of community with people into the presence of this formidable ancient enemy of hers - this other things, this truth, this reality, which suddenly laid hands on her, emerged stark at the back of appearances and commanded attention.\\"If you want to read a map of your precious individual self, you might want to try Virginia. If you don't, maybe you shouldn't.Or maybe you should read it no matter what, because it's reading. Listen to how Woolf weaves her own enjoyment of books into the fabric of the character Mrs. Ramsay:\\"And she waited a little, knitting, wondering, and slowly those words they had said at dinner, \`the China rose is all abloom and buzzing with the honey bee,' began washing from side to side of her mind rhythmically, and as they washed, words, like little shaded lights, one red, one blue, one yellow, lit up in the dark of her mind, and seemed leaving their perches up there to fly across and across, or to cry out and be echoed: so she turned and felt on the table beside her for a book.\\"On this particular outing the family situation seems vulnerable, threatened by a crumbling roof and cracks in the emotional edifice, but it's difficult to tell if the looming threat is extraordinary or just the stuff we all live with. In any case, Mrs. Ramsay triumphs once more, creating a sublime moment that is gone more quickly than it took to manufacture. The guests enjoy a magic they've come to expect, but without guessing at the work behind it.The story breaks suddenly as Mrs. Ramsay turns the lights out on her children for the evening and the reader is then vaulted into a second book entitled: \\"Time Passes.\\"World War I comes. Some of those present on the summer weekend have been taken by it. Mrs. Ramsay has died, \\"suddenly\\" and the family has ceased returning to the beach house. Pages-long, majestic descriptions of the house's decrepitude, of nature's advances upon the property, of the lingering spirits that once warmed it unwind under Woolf's careful, intricate hand.Such stretches recall Italo Calvino who observed that literature represents a rare moment of order in a universe heading toward dissolution: \\"The literary work is one of those small points of privilege where things crystallize into a form which acquires such meaning.\\"Finally the Ramsays return, robbed of their life force, a pale facsimile of the prior clan, stitched to one another by grief only. Again it is Lily, the old maid and mediocre turtle artist, who brings us to the point of the piece. Veiled and indirect throughout, Woolf now bids attention be paid in her first sentence:\\"The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one. This, that, and the other; herself and Charles Tansley and the breaking wave; Mrs. Ramsay bringing them together; Mrs. Ramsay saying, \\"Life stand still here\\"; Mrs. Ramsay making of the moment something permanent (as in another sphere Lily herself tried to make of the moment something permanent) - this was of the nature of a revelation. In the midst of chaos there was shape; this eternal passing and flowing (she looked at the clouds going and the leaves shaking) was struck into stability. Life stand still here, Mrs. Ramsay said. \\"Mrs. Ramsay! Mrs. Ramsay!\\" she repeated. She owed it all to her.\\"So mostly, \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" is a character sketch and Valentine to Mrs. Ramsay: perhaps Woolf's mother, perhaps Rita Sackville-West, perhaps somebody else, an amalgamation, or nobody at all. Just somebody she thought we'd like to see.For time travelers, the tale offers the privilege of vacationing with a homogeneous family of middle-class gentility at the beginning of the 20th Century. It's no wonder Woolf could wander and wade through the psyches of those present. Isolated, far from the news of the moment, without any means of communicating to the outside world, everybody is obligated to be present and consider one another and the landscape of dunes, long lawns at dusk, and wind-rippled tide pools.And then it's modern literature and the modern world. The politics discussed at the table sound familiar and strangely up-to-date, the strivings and shortcomings of the characters are not far at all from our own: to be great, to be respected, to get to the lighthouse."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"First of all, this was my first experience in reading a stream of consciousness book. When I first began reading it, I thought I would enjoy it more than I did. Since I only read it in my spare time, which would sometimes only be fifteen minutes, I did not pay as much attention to the small details as I should have. It became difficult for me to follow each character because my own mind wondered off as the pages turned. Generally, I enjoy books that are suspenseful or have a fast-paced storyline, so this was simply not the style of book for me. Do not read this book if you are looking for an exciting plot or simply do not have the time to put into reading this short novel.There were many reasons why I did not enjoy reading this classic. First of all, I disliked the author's complex, third person omniscient shifting of perspectives through the various characters in the tale. The book focuses more on the summer home in the Hebrides than on the actual characters themselves. Only the character's inner thoughts are written about and there are very few physical descriptions of them. The story is more about the inner workings and complexities of the small group of people than the lighthouse (or going there). Narrative voice is shared between characters as narration becomes thought and smoothly passes from character to character, anticipating the stream of consciousness style. The themes are also very abstract and its plot structure becomes undefined at times.To the Lighthouse is a quiet and meditative novel that deals with post World War I issues. Often, I felt as if Woolf could not hold a single thought or development long enough tomake me care about anything. Virginia Woolf did give glances to a few good story possibilities, but then she would move on to something else; thus, losing my interest and never trulydeveloping any character or situation. As soon as something intriguing was about to occur, the book would jump back to events that happened in the past chapters.I have read books that I enjoyed less than To the Lighthouse, so I do not consider it to be a horrible piece of literature. If you like to read stories that jump and skip from place to place, then maybe this novel is for you. I felt this novel could have adequately been told as a short story with its only lost being its monotone and dull nature. I had to struggle to complete this book, so maybe the meaning was just lost on me. I kept reading to see if there was some literary genius buried within, but unfortunately I never found it."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Length:: 0:16 MinsThis is my analysis of Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I thought this book was pretty good as I kept on reading. At the beginning the author went on and on with that stream of consciousness stuff. I thought that toward the end of the first of the three parts it was getting interesting. It is about a middle class British family that goes through life in a typical way except that people stay at their house. Considering there are eight children and a husband and wife, that is a lot of people in one home. Overall the book was pretty good and i like how lily briscoe finished her painting. This book revolves around Mrs. Ramsay the main character who is portrayed similiarly to the lighthouse. She is the central lady who does all the work and solves all the family problems. She is like a lighthouse where everything is around her. She wanted to go to the lighthouse so I think that is why Woolf named it this."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Shouldn't a great novel be enjoyable to the reader? This is the most boring novel I have ever wasted time on. Admittedly the prose was beautiful.
