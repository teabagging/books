Among all the different characters that he chooses to play, whether he's a pilot, doctor, lawyer, or a college professor, i believe that Frank is somewhat confused of who he is. Frank \\"ran away\\" from home at 16; the age of teenager who is only halfway through high school. At 16, most people don't know where they are in life or what to pursue in the future. One thing was for sure; Frank wanted money and women.I believe Frank's unique personality came from the way he was brought up. Having endured his parent's divorce at a young age was a life changing experience for him. It all started with his father; Frank Abagnale. During the process of his(Jr.'s) parent's divorce, his father still loved is mother. So Frank(Sr.) would try to get his son to say things like \\"Talk to her son...tell her I love her. Tell her we'd be happier if we all lived together. Tell her you'd be happier if she came home, that all you kids would be happier.\\" His(Jr's) father led him to the first step of manipulation.Frank stayed with his father after the finalizing of the divorce. Since his father was quite a rich man, he had a whole variety of rich friends and Frank(Jr.) would come in contact with his friends quite often. This is where Frank learned the \\"attitude of the rich\\", with confidence.Finally when Frank did his first con with his father's money, Frank(Sr.) forgave him. \\"Look, son, if you'll tell us how you did this, and why, we'll forget it. There'll be no punishments and I'll pay the bills.\\" Frank probably felt that he could get away with anything at this point and without any punishment, he didn't believe this to be a huge mistake.With confidence, manipulation, some class and little fear of breaking the law, we come to Frank Abagnale Jr."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"A scan of a number of reviews, say that they found the beginning of the book to come off as very arrogant, etc. I definitely agree with this. It moves quickly enough to be interesting, but my first reaction was \\"he sure does like the sound of his voice.\\"But keep reading. While he never completely gets rid of that attitude, by the time you're 50 pages in, you're hooked (likely sooner) and the last 50 pages or so of the book are simply excellent. It's interesting to read the details of how he conned others, as well as his own code of ethics. Also, I'm sure many of these gaps have been filled, yet there are just newer and higher tech ways to scam people. The story about the stewardesses travelling with him, was just astounding. Ultimately he was punished--boy was he---and paid his debt to society. The entire story is very fast paced."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I have had the pleasure of hearing Frank Abagnale talk several times - once as part of a seminar for the American Banker's Association (ABA), and once for the Aid Association for Lutherans (AAL). He is as captivating in person as he is on the page, and in the meeting at the AAL he spoke a little more about losing his father while he was still on the run. He cried there, on stage, and as he spoke, so did a goodly part of the audience as well.I also read this book a long time BEFORE the movie was made. The movie is good, but this is better. Get this first.This book captures his spirit, his spunk, and is a great read. You wonder at the \\"scruples\\" that he holds to, and the girls he mets (and cons!). The one girl he was ready to marry - turns him in after he comes clean with her. He just barely escapes getting caught, and cries over a lost love.A great quote are these lines, which is used in the front leaf:A psychological evaluation by a University of Virginia criminologist-psychiatrist concluded that I had a very low criminal threshold. In other words, I had no business being a crook in the first place.How does one impersonate a Pan-Am Pilot, a Lawyer, a Pediatrician, and more? Read this book. The best part is that it's all true."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I saw the movie first, and was interested in reading the novel thereafter. It was as good as, or better than, the movie.First of all, everything from the movie is here, but explained with greater accuracy and details: Frank's family, his first con, why he ran away, how he became a co-pilot, and his crazy affairs with airline stewardesses.Although he starts and ends the novel with an air of boastful pride, it's hard for readers to hate him. In fact, it's so much easier to be amazed at his confidence, his suave nature with women, and the precarious situations he gets into. Instead of seeing Frank as the egotistical boy with uncontrollable urges, readers are able to identify with Frank, as he also reveals his fears and feelings of loneliness that accompanied him as a wanted felon.So many things were left out of the movie that the book details fabulously. We learn about his days as a sociology teacher, his nights as a doctor, and how he really passed the bar. Along the way, readers follow Frank's clever train-of-thought, learning a few things about check fraud along the way (which are discussed in just the right amount so that it isn't boring but interesting).His intimate moments were also exciting to read, as he recanted how his persuasion and confidence helped him fulfill his libidinous desires. What I also personally liked was that all of Frank's intimate details were described in such a sexy and non-gratuitous nature, leaving the dirty stuff to the imagination.Finally, the book ends with a lasting impression of Frank's months in the French prison. Here, the glorified image of the con man is put into a greater and more realistic perspective, symbolic of how Frank grew up to see his consequences, and how he began thinking about some of the individuals he hurt. It also puts a moral imprint on the book, suggesting that there are repercussions to a selfishly hedonistic lifestyle.In all, an extremely entertaining novel that was hard to put down. This is definitely a great summer read, and a good recommendation to those who dislike reading -- they'll be hooked on this one till the very end!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"A friend bought it for me for Christmas stating that I had to read it. I went home, opened it up, and found I could not put it down. It is thoroughly entertaining, and reads more like fiction than autobiography.The book covers the life of crime of Frank Abagnale, Jr. AKA about 10 different people involved in outrageous stings ranging from acting as Pan Am captain to pediatrician. It shows just how easy crime could be if someone were missing their frontal lobe.I was very entertained with the way this book haunted my own ethics. Amazingly, I found myself cheering for the criminal to get away with things. I loved seeing how he was caught on greater than three occasions, and yet managed to get away.If there is one downside, I would say that it is the abruptness with which the book ends. It cuts away before explaining how Frank was able to transition back to mainstream society.Alas, if you want to thoroughly entertain yourself while learning about a life in crime... buy this book. It is sure to delight."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I just returned from San Antonio. Mr. Abagnale spoke to our group. Never had I heard a more interesting story about a man who basically raised himself, and the turns his life took because of it. I would encourage all, if given the chance, to see Mr. Abagnale."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This first-person account by one the world's pioneering &quot;paperhangers&quot; (check counterfeiters) is moderately diverting, but eventually gets stale due to the repetitiveness of the author's adventures and the weak, cliche-ridden writing. In a nutshell, as a teenager and young man in the 1960s he passed himself off as a respectable professional (usually a Pan Am pilot) for the purposes of cashing bogus checks and living large off the results. It gets old reading about how he refined his scam this way or that and then partied with yet another lovely &quot;fox&quot; in this or that city. The book is more interesting when he passes himself in other professions (pediatrician, lawyer, sociology professor) and actually manages to bluff his way through actually practicing them for a short time. It's a testament to how anyone with good looks, an air of confidence in what they're doing, a keen sense of observation, and a bit of research can bluff their way through life, although it should be noted that many of his scams would not be nearly so easy in our contemporary world of computer record keeping and instantaneous data transfer. The veracity of his tale is hard to measure, certainly the whole books reeks of exaggeration, but the basic scams sound entirely plausible--whether he was able to pull them off as often or as easily as he makes out is hard to say.His after-the-fact self justifications mixed with his constant reminders that he only fleeced corporations, not honest individuals quickly get annoying. Abagnale does not write with a great deal of introspection either, he seems to have no motive for his crimes other than financing a luxurious lifestyle and getting his kicks. He never examines why he's driven in that way, although he obliquely blames his initial con jobs on the need to have extra cash to woo women properly. Women are perhaps the real losers in his cons, as he bounces from conquest to conquest in his attempt to live out some teenage fantasy, he breaks at least one heart that he tells of and likely many others. The result: &quot;My dalliances, by and large, had all the permanency of rabbits' relationships, and about the same degree of satisfaction.&quot;The book would have benefited from an interweaving of the story of his persuit by the FBI (which is alluded to here and there, but never really fleshed out), and his ultimate transformation from criminal to FBI consultant. Indeed, it's a story that would be more interesting and complete coming from a neutral observer who could paint the whole picture."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I have had a lot of double takes reading this book. How could anyone have got away with so much for so long. There is no doubt that Frank could have put away a retirement sum and gone to ground into retirement for the rest of his life, but why would he? He had so much fun. He lived everyones dreams, to be a pilot, a lawyer, a doctor, a lecturer, and all without even a high school diploma! My favourite part has to be where he recruits his own &quot;flight crew&quot; of stewardesses and takes them on an all expenses paid tour of europe, on rubber cheques.Obviously a highly intelligent individual Frank ascribes his success to being well turned out, paying attention to people and doing your research. I have to say that's good advice for life!It is no surprise to me that he now works in the business of closing all the loopholes that he himself exploited.It is well worth reading about the escapades of this (semi) moral crook who only robbed institutions, not individuals, except for a particularly mean prostitute! A great and surprisingly light read. Your cheque book will never look the same after you read this book!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I wanted to give the book four stars for how much I enjoyed reading it, but I had to reduce it to three for incompleteness.I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the author's complete lack of remorse really got to me (though he admits to having convinced himself that his crimes were &quot;necessary&quot;). By late in the book, it got kind of hard to take.There were two glaring omissions in this book. The first was a much more thorough description of the FBI's pursuit of this expert forger, to be meshed in the story; this would have given much more urgency to what he did (his multiple escapes from the arms of the law were quite interesting). The second was the very abrupt ending of the book, without even a postcript describing what happened in the last few decades along with more in-depth descriptions of why his scams would be nearly impossible now. This left me feeling like I had read only half of a book.While I understand the feeling that the author had another con going in writing this book, I am not inclined to believe that very much was pure fiction (I could easily believe that some of his exploits were embellished, based on how he wrote and how he describes himself).Altogether, a pretty interesting read when you want something light. Those looking for a thorough and tight examination of significant criminal career with attending profiles and such should definitely look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This was a hard review to write.I like the book. It had me hooked. And if you see the movie, the book is a must-read. It fills in a lot of spaces. But...I hate the author. This guy gives new meaning to the word pompous. He's a scam artist and he's pulling a con job on the reader. He's trying to make us like him. He almost succeeded with me. But hey, hold on, wait a minute- this spoiled kid scammed his own father. He scammed ordinary citizens with one of his bank robbing schemes- not the big businesses or banks- but ordinary people. I don't like this pompous jerk one bit. I wish I could give this book a one star rating- but I can't. It's a fascinating story and the author is a fascinating guy. He's also evil.This guy tells a story- glamourizes it- gloats a lot- then throws in the obligiatory \\"but I was wrong\\"- but not often enough and a little too late.Recent interviews show us that the author now runs a successful business teaching businesses how to avoid falling prey to the type of cons he used to perpetuate. He mentions how he regrets the past. That is after he once again tells about it. Yeah, right, Frank. You regret it when it costs you a client. Then you regret it. Not before. Not after.He tells of the one girl he had to tell the truth to. She fell in love with one of his persona's and he couldn't perpetuate the con. So he told her. And she \\"betrayed\\" him by turning him in. Hey Frank, you stupid moron- you betrayed her!!! He goes on to lament that now he can't trust anyone. Hey imbecile, you got it backwards, no one can trust you!! Remember? Idiot!Frank is a jerk. An arrogant, selfish, spoiled jerk. He wants our respect.I won't give it to him.But I will heartily reccomend this book. It is a good read. It also, upon careful examination, id testimony to the fact that Frank is the most supremely arrogant individual you are ever likely to meet. In print. On film. In person. Anywhere."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Frank Abagnale remains one of the most notorious and successful con man and forger in American history, cashing more than $2.5 million in bogus checks during his brief career. He began his career as a teenager, and was finally brought to justice in his early twenties, which makes his nefarious accomplishments all the more astounding. This is his memoir of his escapades on the wrong side of the law, as he passed himself off, variously, as an airline pilot, a doctor and a professor, while, in fact, being a high school drop-out. The ease with which he was able to manipulate the financial system is mind boggling, but not without its benefits. Many of the security measures that protect our banks and businesses from such thefts were probably implemented because of Abagnale's successes, and with his help, since he has become a much-sought-after security consultant since his release from prison.Abagnale's story is an adventure story of a young man who enjoyed the challenges of cheating the system. It is quite clear that he had incredible determination and smarts that enabled him to identify and exploit weaknesses in the institutions he targeted. It is quite clear that he enjoyed himself, at least initially, and that he had his own code of ethics that he upheld, even while cheating a wide range of banks and businesses out of millions of dollars. But this is also a cautionary tale, because he is also quite forthright about the stress of living life on the run, as well as the brutal conditions he endured after his capture in France. Clearly, this isn't a career path he would recommend for others. But living his life vicariously through this memoir certainly was fun!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This is the autobiography of Frank Abagnale, Jr. a con-man and counterfeiter who made millions passing fraudulent checks all around the world and, meanwhile, posed successfully as a Pan Am pilot, a pediatrician, and a lawyer. I enjoyed the movie based on this book so I hoped the book would be better. Although the book certainly provided more information about the scams and how he got away with it, Abagnale himself was much less charming in the book. He was too much of a womanizer and a...well...con-man. Emotions weren't expressed (other than relief at escaping one or another of his women), making it difficult to empathize with him. Also, the adult Abagnale (who took part in writing the book) didn't seem to feel much remorse about his activities. He rationalized: \\"I never conned a square John out of money,\\" but ignores the emotional strain that he must have put on many of his victims. Also, I am a little skeptical of the \\"true\\" part of this \\"true crime\\" story. I believe that the basic idea is true, but there were just too many convenient coincidences for his story to be entirely accurate. He must have taken bits and pieces of different escapades and pasted them together into a unified story, and over-emphasized his own cleverness. Clearly, he's a genius, but I still would have liked a little more \\"oops, that was stupid\\" in his story. It would have humanized him. Not even a genius can be clever all the time!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This is a classic example of why reading a book is usually better than the movie version. So many funny, incredible stories of Mr. Abagnale's ingeniously brazen scams that aren't shown in the movie. I greatly enjoyed every chapter and daring caper. Banks should count themselves lucky that there are few such shrewdly effective \\"rip-off artists\\" in the world. Single women, airlines, and hospitals as well. For years, he successfully impersonated doctors, lawyers, airline pilots, and university professors, first doing research and planning that merited a Phd. in con arts."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Frank Abagnale was a sixteen-year-old with his first checking account. It's no surprise that he quickly overspends and his account is overdrawn. Instead of facing the problem, he runs away from it. His similarity to other teens ends here.Because he looks ten years older than his true age, Frank is able to pass as an adult. He learns to make and cash bogus checks and begins traveling around the country disguised as an airline pilot. His quick wits keep him a few steps ahead of the FBI as he also impersonates a doctor, a lawyer--even on occasion an FBI agent. The story becomes incredible as he organizes and conducts a phony European \\"goodwill ambassador tour\\" unwillingly funded by his favorite airline. Frank is finally apprehended, does time in a series of European prisons, and escapes while being returned to the United States. His life becomes less eventful as he is finally recaptured, serves more time, and ends up putting his forging skills to work for the FBI to catch other criminals.Frank's cleverness is impressive as is his casual attitude toward the impersonal institutions and personal friends he cons. One hopes he has turned into a more considerate adult in his subsequent careers with the FBI and as a white-collar crime consultant in the private sector. This book is worth reading to help us understand the life of a criminal who lives by his wits. It is also worth reading for its sheer entertainment value. If you have not yet seen the movieCatch Me If You Can, I would recommend reading this book first.A personal reaction: I first encountered this book on sale for a dollar in a used book bin in the Brigham Young University Bookstore. The cover indicated that Frank had hid out for a summer passing himself off as a visiting sociology instructor at BYU. He was apparently a popular teacher and taught his classes by staying one chapter ahead of the students in the textbook and making heavy use of in-class role playing and other activities. Quite plausible--as a graduate student in psychology I \\"faked\\" my way through my first classes the same way. Nobody ever caught me, either..."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This was a very fascinating and fun read but entirely different than the movie which I thoroughly enjoyed as well.

Abignale - one of the greatest con men of all time who single handedly lived his life on fradulant checks and scams that just leave you thinking how amazing he was. This book is the autobiographical account of Abignale's teenage years from when he first created a scam on his father's Mobil credit card. There are so many times in this book that I had to step back and think about the air of confidence that Abignale displayed, yet curiously inside he was often paranoid and worried about the authorities catching up to him.Some of the stories are absolutely outrageous. I loved them all! This book also talks about his time in prison across seas in Europe and how terrible he was treated in the French prisons.If you liked the movie then you should definately read this book. It further explores his adventures and exploits in greater detail and includes many capers that were not in the movie. A must read!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I saw the movie.

Abagnale &amp; Stan Redding's \`Catch Me If You Can' becomes a big \`what so?' after a few chapters. While they are telling how Frank became the most wanted con is funny and interesting to learn how fragile the system is. But when they tell over and over again the same thing-- how he forged checks and pretended to be a Pan Am pilot-- the books becomes boring.In the middle of my reading I got me thinking \`Why am I reading this?'. I mean it is not even entertaining me. But I went on until the last pages thinking that anything really big would happen. But it didn't. The book left me with the feeling that someone up there loves Frank W. Abagnale more than other mortals, because this guy is so lucky that it is almost impossible to believe. I think the movie may be better, once it gets a \`story' from the book, and not only chronicle Frank's adventures."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I have a tape of a live performance given by Frank and also have his book. There are discrepancies between the tape and the book. In general things are the same but the book adds some of the course details of his sexual escapades that taints the overall story and some of the details in the book differ significantly from the tape. It also seems odd to me that a multimillion dollar consulting firm wouldn't have a web site, but do a search for Frank Abignale and see what you come up with. Who knows... maybe the bigest con is the book and the tape."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This is one of the best book I ever read.

I haven't seen the movie, but Frank Abagnale impressed me with his ability to transform himself. The book is written quite simply, making it a quick read, but worth the time it takes to read it.

But the place descriptions are flat, the dialogue is wooden and the family dynamic is never fully developed. A notable exception--Frank Abagnale's vivid description of his life in a French prison. I think this is one of those cases where the movie will transcend the book."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This is an extraordinary book. One of the funnest books I've ever read. This is kind of a book which you just can't put down and want more of. This book taught me what life is all about. Life is about having fun and enjoying every moment of it. Frank became anybody he wanted to be. He became, Pilot, Pediatrician, Lawyer, Professor of Sociology, FBI agent, Banker, Multi-millionaire....etc. The list goes on and on. He conned into anything he wanted to be. Truly exceptional human being. His IQ is estimated to be around 138-140. Near genius. His IQ really didn't matter because he just enjoyed what he loved doing. He didn't do it for the money but challenge. He describes the difference between Con artist and Thief and teaches you how to prevent from happening to you. I recommend this book to anyone who's traveling or reading for fun. This book makes you want to be Frank Abagnale. Not to mension that he had over 8 fake ID's. Only way to describe this book would be....It is like taking a summer vacation to the most advanturous and funnest places."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Catch Me If You Can is the story of the ultimate con artist.

Abagnale's tale is so amazing and so hilarious, and his style so engaging, that I simply could not put this book down. I sacrificed sleep and was late for work finishing this book off. Frank's adventures are exciting and hilarious, and at times my heart beat faster as I waited to see whether he would succeed with his latest outrageous caper.I give this book my highest recommendation. My only complaint is that the book ends very abruptly, and his subsequent fate is not discussed; nor, as I would be keenly interested to find out, how the feds managed to track him down.

Don't believe me? Read the first two sample pages provided on this site. I would call the writing moronic, but that would be too unkind to the morons of the world.Another problem is the story itself. The man opens his book with a tale where he risks the lives of some 140 passengers on an airliner, as he is at the plane's controls, though doesn't know how to fly. Yup! This is something to brag about.Then, on the same page, the author boasts of milking innocent people out 2.5 million dollars by age 21. Quite an accomplishment.

It kept me on the edge of my chair and was a quick read. It was a nice accompaniment to the movie and was great to have some of the details that the movie left out. However, it's still hard not to be skeptical of this guy. Once you're a con-man, it's gotta be hard to leave that behind.

Regardless, this was a fun read and I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Although I knew the ghostwriter, Stan Redding, as far back as the 1970s and in the 1980s when this shot to the top of the bestseller lists, I never sat down to read it until 2008. When I was done, I couldn't understand the fuss.I've had to chalk it up to the tenor of the times, in which any sort of true confession like Abagnale's would seem a revelation. In addition, I am sure the excitement of such an accomplished, child-prodigy con artist overshadowed the omission of some elements I would have considered vital to this story.Stan allowed Frank to run wild and loose on the narrative of his exploits with almost no confirmation, so that technique left it hard to believe. A thorough job of dissecting Frank's psychology might have salvaged that issue. But I'm betting Frank was holding back, and Stan was just taking what he could get out of him.But, c'mon! The things this guy claims to have accomplished as a teenager are over the top. I wanted Frank to tell more about how he got so smart, so young. If he really was that cool, he surely knew why.Nevertheless, Stan and Frank still produced a book that would entice a top movie director/actor combo of Scorcese/DiCaprio/Hanks to develop a feature film 20 years after the fact. But Stan and I were jouirnalists in Houston back in the 1970s, so I was expecting more from him.\\"Catch Me If You Can\\" was plenty of fun with a surface scrubbing of the main character's psychology that left me suspicious about how much of this true crime memoir actually was fiction. And it left me wondering if maybe Frank wasn't using Stan to jump start the con-man defense consulting business Frank eventually launched."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"It's very funny story and interesting.

If he's so good at the con, how is this book any different. As a novel, it's entertaining at first, repetitive after awhile, and offers no clear climax. A very hard book to judge, although I gave it three stars because it is engaging somehow. The lying, conns, and sexism are hard to accept, and the author doesn't seem to feel bad for all the people he conned. Difficult to like, impossible to hate?"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This is a fun book. Abagnale's intelligence and wit come through, though the writing is a bit stilted and the material quite dated. But Abagnale's ability to exploit appearances and to exploit the level of trust necessary for society to work is fascinating and very funny. Perhaps his most interesting con is his relationship with women. This is the ultimate con game, I'm afraid, and the book would have been far better had he explained his con in this regard and had he come to terms with it. Also, the book ends quite abruptly and is unsatisfying in explaining how Abagnale ultimately came to terms with himself."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"We sat in the second row as we listened to Abagnale recount his escapades as a con artist. His regret of his actions has led him to a life focused on preventing others from following his footsteps. That prevention includes his own consulting agency, training FBI agents, and lecturing us on identity theft. The serious moment of identity theft silenced the audience showing that Abagnale had earned respect. What Kyle and I took from that speech, besides some great antidotes on how to get money from an ATM machine, was a renewed concern about the protection of our own identity. Take note that both the book and the movie are media-hyped versions of the true story. This doesn't take anything from the read but it does make the reader ask questions of probability. I love the fact that Abagnale (Doesn't his name just roll off the tongue?) is still good friends with the FBI agent, Joseph Shea, whom helped to capture him."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I read Franks book years ago when he came to my city to do a talk for Bankers.

The book poses similar dilemmas: Can you separate actions from character? Can you create a life out of fictitious personas? Can a person redeem purpose and at the same time amend for the mistakes of a self-absorbed youth?Frank Abagnale writes a sincere memoir that shows life can be stranger than fiction. On the one hand, Abagnale's impersonations show amazing ingenuity to pass off as a pilot, doctor, lawyer and FBI agent, just to name a few of his ruses. From a broader perspective, he shows a limitless potential--any person can be anything he wants. He unwittingly proves that the effort to carry off a scam is as monumental as the determined resourcefulness it takes to achieve any legitimate dream.Minus the Spielburgian moments like dollar bills flying cut-to-size out of a European counterfeit printing press and DeCaprio a spoiled kid who fell into star-making roles, playing a self-absorbed playboy, the real story has its own immediacy and economy of narrative that reads well on its own.Catch Me If You Can is an astonishing read that will pull you into a world of possibility, weaving a story of bold moves to live a life any ordinary person could only dream of living. Abagnale has lived several lives and gives an account that leaves you breathless at the pace and scope contained in an entertaining read.

Abagnale with Stan Redding was made into a big Hollywood picture complete with several movie stars and helmed by a renowned auteur. The source material seems tailor-made for the silver screen with its outrageous but true aspect, and fans of the film would do well to invest some time in reading this original work. Being the consummate con man, Abagnale's real feat in telling his tale is to pull the reader in to a kind of complicity with all his nefarious deeds, so that before long I was rooting for his success even as he left a trail of unwitting accomplices (mostly nubile ladies) and fleeced bankers in his wake. The confidence bordering on arrogance that was necessary to be successful in all his capers comes through loud and clear in Abagnale's prose, but I found myself taken in just like all the rest of his marks. And I didn't begrudge it at all. Perhaps it's because I'm intimately acquainted with the American Prison System, but I found the descriptions of the French Prison to be both interesting and horrifying. Sweden, however, didn't sound like such a bad place to have to do time. And, while I don't recommend that anyone include prison in any five-year plan, I do recommend this book as an entertaining and unbelievably true story."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Son really enjoyed.

He is larger than life, smooth-talking, and above all, gutsy. You won't believe the things he comes up with to get himself out of trouble - if I remember correctly he escaped from police custody 4 times (using 4 completely different tactics). Several reviewers have criticized the book because this guy is arrogant, but so many of my favorite stories have characters (like James Bond) with big egos, so I loved it. Truth or fiction? I don't know, but either way, it is a fun read. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"After seeing the movie, I bought and quickly read the book. I had to discover what parts of the movie were true, and which were made up. And so I discovered what other things the little stinker had done!Of course you gotta admire him: walking into Pan AM and stealing envelopes -- herding fake stewardesses around Europe -- pretending to be a security guard and thus taking in all that cash -- one clever idea after another. The book is great fun, because it goes far beyond the movie in explaining how he set up the various scams.What I had hoped to learn, though, but was disappointed not to see, were the answer to a few questions: How does a man like this decide NOT to continue with the scams? The realization that he was hurting people was part of it, but I would have liked to have seen more. And how does a man who was going to bed with so many broads, suddenly change his ways to become a steady husband (assuming he has)? How on earth does he get some woman to trust him?"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"If you have seen the movie, and read the book, then you know that even though the movie is decent, it doesn't hold a candle to the book. This is a work of genius. Focus on The Family radio played Frank Abagnale's testimony, and it sounds almost unbelievable, but there's things in here that you can't talk about and just make up to talk about. I read the chapter about the French prison system. To just imagine the conditions of being confined like that, WHEW! The most accurate part in the movie had to be when he impersonated a doctor, and when it came down to it, went before a medical board, answered a few questions (which the movie didn't show), and became not only a pediatrician, but the head pediatrician down south in a hospital. Amazing book."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"A great book very interesting, I actually read this after seeing the movie, and of course enjoyed the book more, and when i saw the film, i found it to be very good... typical!

Very good book."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Frank Abagnale has had an extradordinary life, no doubt. His escapades are outstanding. Since other reviewers have given a brief synopsis, it is not necessary to repeat. Read the book for the sake that it is different from the movie which captures fleeting moments of the whole experience. The psychology is interesting, although I don't quite agree that a &quot;robin hood&quot; mentality relieves a person from being a crook.The text and/or prose is atrocious but bearable. There is an overuse of similes and these really trite statements which sound like the person who wrote it was stubbed at 8th grade and never grew up any further. The life and adventurers overcome the atrocities of penmanship."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This is a good example of how brilliance tends to get bored. We all know people with average intelligence that find decent success by performing mundane tasks, studying endless bland materials, and rising slowly through an organization. Well, Frank Abagnale wasn't one of them. He wanted to make money fast, and at the age of 16 he started his career as a prolific con man with numerous schemes and identities. Abagnale tried a little of everything. He posed as an airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, and college professor, but he made most of his money with counterfeit checks. The funniest part is that he did it all to pick up girls.The descriptive book tells a great story about a man who found weaknesses in a system and exploited them. Tired of routine, Frank was constantly thinking up brand new schemes and they all worked. He even had a good hunch as to when something was getting dangerous and he would move on. His incredible run lasted four years and his memories of capture and imprisonment are just as compelling.I was a big fan of the movie last year, but the book tells a different but equally interesting story. The movie was full of composite characters and a parallel story between con man and FBI agent. The book is just a straightforward telling of how one man fooled the system. It's well written. You should fly through it in no time."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Catch Me If You Can is an excellent that anyone can pick up and read. The title just catches you and the rest will hold you back until you are finished.Catch Me If You Can details the life of Frank Abagnale, a 16 year old who is good at catching details. When his parents divorced, he ran away, further into New York city and began his five year long crime spree.He found that he had a knack for parting people with their money through scams, starting with his father. Once in NYC, he found that airplane pilots and crews had a certain amount of respect. Soon, he had bluffed his way into a uniform and wings, and looked the part of a pilot. He then forged a pilot's license, certificate and ID card. He then took advantage of the system, in which a pilot could travel for free to get from place to place, called Deadheading. Using this, he was able to travel all over the world on rival airplanes.Along the way, Abegnale began to forge Pan Am checks, making many stunning replicas and cashing them in at banks.When he was nearly caught, he 'retired' to Atlanta, saying that he was a doctor. A neigbor of his found out and he was soon working at the local hospital for a while, learning as he went. After that, he posed as a Harvard Law graduate, forging a transcript and licence, and practised law for a while. Finally, he found a job as a teacher, learning his lessons before the classes he taught.This was all before he was twenty one.He picked up on airplanes again, and after a while, was caught in France and thrown into jail. From France, he was transfered to Sweden and then to the US. There, he made several escapes before finally being caught.This book was an excellent and exciting read. This guy really travelled around and made nearly 2.5 million dollars before he was caught.In addition to his adventures, the book puts an interesting light on check forging, which Abegnale said would become increasingly easier as technology improved. He was able to pass off countless checks, some perfect replicas of the origenals.I was only slightly disappointed with the book in two ways. The first was that Sean O'Reily, the FBI agent that tracked him down, only appeared in a couple scenes, and then only briefly. He is not a major character, and while I have not seen the movie, I would have liked to have seen him more, and how he accually tracked him down.The second is believability. Abegnale's exploits are out there, and I had some trouble believing him at times. His escapes are exciting, but are just hard to believe. At other times, it seems that he had too much luck and too many lucky breaks before he was caught. I would imagine that there is some exageration at several pointsHowever, it certainly makes an exciting story, and is still well worth getting."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is a great first person account of the con artist. It also re-teaches an old lesson. Audacity is almost always taken for authority.Abagnale learned at a very young age that honest people do not usually expect to be taken advantage of by someone who is dressed well and is articulate. He used his good looks and air of confidence to do things that seem and should be impossible.Catch me if you can is a book that is very difficult to put down. I would recommend it for a little mind candy to any reader interested in suspense. It is the real life version of Sheldon's &quot;Master of the Game&quot; minus the romance."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Entertaining but i cant help but think he's telling a few porky pies (lies) in the book.

He mentioned Abagnale's adventures of mischief, but I was not able to fully understand how addictive this book really was. I guess you could say that words could not describe the intensity of this book. I guarantee that, when you read this, you will have a smile on your face during many of the scenes in which Abagnale attempts the impossible. There is a temptation inside of all human beings to do what is labeled &quot;wrong&quot; in society. While most commonfolk avoid this temptation, Abagnale shows you how this temptation worked to his advantage when he pulled all the right strings. Imagine. There you are, being a good person, trying to abide by all of the laws that control you. Yet something inside of you wants action. Something inside of you is telling you to do something wrong, because you MIGHT get caught. Wonder what would happen if you fell into temptation? Don't miss out on this book. Please."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"He sure did. What starts off as an annoying, arrogant read quickly turns into the sort of real-life account that leaves you saying, \\"No way...\\" Abagnale conned his way into a pilot's uniform, a law practice, hospital rounds, and 6 months in a French prison, and he'll take you with him if you let him.My roommate recommended this to me for fun, but warned me that she had quit reading it after the first 20 pages. I almost didn't even get that far. Abagnale's narrative voice is one of the most immediately annoying I've ever read; he comes across in the initial chapters as a chauvinistic (women are \\"delicious foxes\\"--did ANYBODY ever sound so dull?), arrogant, self-pitying (despite his wavering between denials and awareness of this) jerk from a bored suburban home.Keep reading, though, and you won't be disappointed. What starts off as tentative bad-check-floating quickly becomes full-blown international larceny. More amusing, though, and more disturbing, are the ends to which Abagnale's capers force him. By the end of the story, feeling the heat, he abandons his pilot scam and ends up faking a Harvard Law degree and practicing law, and the pace picks up so quickly at this point that the last chapters rush by. Abagnale ends up in jail in France, and then in Sweden (and, apparently, there was a whole line-up of countries wanting to try him!), but the book's not over there; he's way too resourceful a con-artist to go quietly, and his post-arrest movements are even more exciting than anything before.It's a fast-paced, fun read. The prose is at times appallingly bad, with metaphors that are both overdone and mixed (\\"I wanted to be one of the bulls in this Georgia peach orchard\\"), and, as Abagnale goes on and on about how much he likes women and how often he likes them, you'll start to see in him the high-school kid who talks such big talk because he never walks the walk and thinks you won't like him unless he does. This book could have been punchier and better (and about 100 pages shorter) without those digressions.Still, by and large, I'd recommend it. I couldn't put it down for the last 150 pages, as it moves quickly and crazily, and Abagnale and his co-writer are careful to up the ante as the story progresses. All of which makes for a satisfying light read."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Working in the airline industry, I had the pleasure of hearing Frank Abagnale as a guest speaker at an airline-hosted seminar. (He said he owed it the airline personnel). Hearing him live was incredible. In today's world, it's amazing to hear what he got away with. I'm sure he may be one reason that airlines do 10-year background checks.... I couldn't get a copy of his book after his seminar (out of print), so I rushed to buy this copy. Hearing him live is much better than reading, but this is definitely the next best thing. It's fun and fast reading. I'm buying copies for my fellow airline workers (those in Security, Flt Ops, Inflight, Purchasing).... Oh and bankers, hotel staff, too. Is there a group he did NOT step all over? Thank goodness he's not doing it now. (At least we THINK he's not). We'd be furious with him instead of amazed.

If you were in front of me, I would look at you with a grin (as if to show that I knew something you didn't) and encourage you to do so.Frank Abagnale is less likable in the book, which is to be expected, but is still far from what we would consider a true villain. It caught me by surprise about halfway through how I was so fascinated by a crook with little or no moral values. I suppose this is how we live out our own bit of villainy.

Frank led a fairly normal childhood yet would constantly skip school and go hang out with his friends, sneaking into movies and shoplifting. He found his friends mischief to be amusing, yet immature and ignorant.When he was only 15 he had taken [a large sum of money]from his father.In his lifetime he faked the qualifications of a pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer, and a screenwriter, bouncing checks wherever he went. Frank was finally arrested in France when he was recognized by a stewardess. He was sentenced to the Perpignan's House of Arrest for the duration of one year. He had been transferred to many other prisons and escaped many different times since then. He was eventually caught. While on parole, astonishingly enough, he got a job informing banks about many techniques to look out for in check swindlers. From that, he got a job at the FBI's Financial Crime Unit."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This story is a wild ride... Frank Abagnale Jr. certainly swindled his way around the world in outlandish style, taking advantage of loose corporate security and the naivete, gullibility and sheer stupidity of all manner of people.What it boils down to, though, is that here is an exceptionally smart guy with a tremendous nerve who believes he's somehow entitled to live a life he hasn't earned, at others' expense. What a waste. He's a liar, a cheat, and ultimately a hollow person because of it.The story is fun, but it left me with more pity than admiration for the author. It would definitely have been a better book had we been brought to its real conclusion... how did this character make his transition into productive life?

First he tried scamming fake checks, and surprisingly, it worked! Then, he actually accomplished even greater trickery, fooling his way onto Pan Am airlines, impersonating a doctor, and even a lawyer!The novel reads like a strange cross between &quot;The Talented Mr Ripley&quot; &amp; &quot;The Fugitive.&quot; After getting into the story, you begin to not really think of Abagnale as a theif or criminal, rather you wonder how long he can keep up these charades.It's amazing what he was able to do just by asking simple questions, disguising hiimself to get information, and even conning a man into using a press to make fake checks! Frank Abagnale Jr must have had an honest face on him!The novel here is now under the command of Dreamworks SKG, and is planned as the next project for director Steven Spielberg (A.I.). The book takes a rather strange turn for material, but then again, none of us expected him to make &quot;Schindler's List.&quot; Still, the novel is a good read, and it seemingly ends sooner then you think."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I heard him tell his story on the radio one night about five years ago. I was captivated by his stories of crime and eluding capture and made a mental note of his name. Years later, a few nights ago as a matter of fact, I was browsing Amazon for a new book and his name came to mind. After searching for several minutes I located this book and excitedly placed my order. I breezed through the book in one day. I have to say that I am astonished at the man. He is likely to be the most self-centered, egomaniacal, lustful, lying, dishonest, cheating, con man to ever live. I found it difficult to enjoy the book due to my extreme distaste for his remarkably disrespectful treatment of the opposite sex, and his worship of self and money. I don't recall that the radio broadcast gave me the impression of his character that this book so clearly portrays. I thought that he was just an inventive and creative thief that you could love despite his penchant for bouncing checks; but instead I find that he is a man that treats women like toilet paper and has no respect for anyone. I began reading this wanting to like him in spite of his crimes, thinking that he had changed his ways over the years. But the book clearly displays his present character, and he doesn't seem to have changed a bit. He revels in his past without remorse or regret. The book is somewhat interesting to read but it has a major flaw. The most disappointing thing about this book; what made me decide to give only two stars; is the complete lack of an ending. There is no \\"part two\\". There is no follow-up that I can find. The story ends just when I was beginning to become interested. So, in a nutshell; egomaniacal man that worships his ..., his intellect and his money, goes on an incredible journey of deceit and theft that culminates in...nothing. The book has no ending.

This was one of the most fun books I've read in years. No, it is not \\"high-brow\\" reading by any means. It is a fun fast-paced \\"ride\\". I would not have believed this story (with its twists and turns) had it not been true. If this was a work of fiction, I would have shot many holes in the \\"plot\\". But indeed it is all true and life is more interesting than fiction and by mere intelligence, naivet&eacute;, skill and - yes - extreme luck, Abagnale escaped the FBI - sometimes by minutes.He is a crook but you root for him. In an earlier review, a four-star review, the reviewer deducted a star because of the in the book the authur incessantly brags on his Don Juan-esque escapades. Well, I too was a bit bored with his bragging but only when I realized that \\"women\\" (he never used drugs, tobacco or alchohol - even though he was a late teenager posing as a late 20's - early 30's - pilot; teacher; doctor; Asisstant to DA) was his weakness. He was James Bond without the government assignments and the shaken (but not stirred) martini's. His addiction was women and thus he needed money for that addiction. I do believe, in fact, he relates his love for women to a Heroin junkie's need for Heroin.Anyhow, you root for this guy because he never cons individuals, never uses violence but in the end admits he was stupid and did not think of consequences. He did hurt people in other ways.This is my first review so sorry for the rambling. This is the one book that you look for that grabs your attention.

There is no &quot;part two&quot;. There is no follow-up that I can find. The story ends just when I was beginning to become interested. So, in a nutshell; egomaniacal man that worships his penis, his intellect and his money, goes on an incredible journey of deceit and theft that culminates in...nothing. The book has no ending. I am sorely disappointed in him for his actions and for his book."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"What a terrifically humourous book about real crime. Now, that in itself is an unusual statement. This is not crime as in, well, In Cold Blood. It's more like The Pretender from T.V. meets junk bond scammer Michael Milken.Twenty years ago author and central chameleon character, Frank Abagnale, was not only a criminal but a New York Times bestselling author. Along with an upcoming movie, this true life adventure story is being re-released.This daring con man divulges everything from forgery of over $2.5 mil in checks, to being a pseudo-pilot for Pan Am, a sociology college professor, supervising doctor, everything but an Indian Chief--maybe that too if monies were involved. For five years his ego lead him around the world as Frank Abagnale aka Robert Conrad, Frank Adams and Robert Monjo. Maybe even more. Playing up life as if he owned the secrets of the Universe. You just have to admire a guy like that. Rather the way you pull for the fictional characters, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid. Only Frank lives-to now help the Government prevent the type of fraud and debunking our modern day bandit loved to pull off.This is just a great rollicking read &amp; I await the movie with much anticipation.other reading suggestion: &quot;The Millionaire-Story of John Law&quot; by GleesonThanks for your interest &amp; comment votes--CDS"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Not a reader of fiction, fantasy, sci-fi... therefore picked up a copy of \\"Catch Me If You Can\\" from a bookstore yesterday...Seen the film more than 10times.. loved the film, loved the characters, loved the plot... LOVED the book even more... can't put it down... the story just flows perfectly...Makes you wonder what Franky can do at the age of 16,17 etc.A real inspiration... the book's plot is BY-FAR better than the movie... Would have been great to read it before watching the film.. still good to read it after watching the film..Overall, it's a great bookfinished it in a day"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"If you have seen the movie, you MUST read the book! The movie was inspired by this book and was indeed based on real events, but it does not tell the entire story. I was amazed at how much the movie did not contain, and was equally intrigued by the twists and turns Mr. Abagnale's adventures took. It is time well spent."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Frank Abagnale admits he is (was) a con man and a swindler. In this memoir, he recounts his teenage years spent as a con artist. Frank had brass you-know-whats to even attempt, much less succeed, at some of the capers he pulled off. He traveled the world, seduced beautiful women and wrote thousands of forged checks, usually while impersonating a Pan Am airline pilot. He did short stints impersonating a doctor, a professor, a writer, and a lawyer, among others. (I was especially impressed that the high school dropout studied for and passed the Louisiana bar exam in nine weeks.)I was delighted when I ran across several copies of this book in my local used bookstore. (This is no doubt due to the popularity of the movie.) It is impossible to put down, a fast, high energy read that gives the reader the vicarious thrill of pulling off the perfect crimes. I was glad that Frank also included a description of his first few stays in prison - Yikes! I am watching my Ps & Qs the next time I'm in France!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I love a good (...)scam, ever since I saw The Sting when it first came out. So I can't believe it took me this long to get around to reading Catch Me If You Can. I saw the movie first, and it was great. But the book is better.Abagnale goes into great detail about how he pulled off his frauds and this really made it click for me. In spite of all the intracacies of bank ins-and-outs, for instance, the story moves fast. You just can't wait to find out how Abagnale will get away with his current scam or if he will finally get caught. He actually does spend some time in prison and even that is fascinating, if a more than a little gritty.Even if you've seen the movie, you will want to read this book, because the stories Abagnale tells are a notch better than the ones in the film, if only because things get condensed in a movie. The story of how he recruited a phony batch of stewardesses for a European tour, which was a good scene in the movie, was much better in the book"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This book was like a wild ride. Frank Abagnale leaves home as a teenager and embarks on the life of a con-man, but he does it with such style and finesse it's hard to believe this is a factual account of events. He impersonates a co-pilot, a lawyer, a doctor and a college professor amongst other things just to enhance his check scams. And even though he is a felon, you just can't help rooting for him. The action in this book moves very fast, so it is a light and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This book really got me from the start. The author's excellent narrative style made for a fun read. He also uses metaphors very skillfully throughout, and some of the more humorous ones even made me laugh out loud.I had a hard time putting it down at times. The intelligence of this guy to pull some of this stuff off is incredible! I don't condone or justify stealing and lying, but the stories are amazing nonetheless.Read the book! I promise you'll be entertained at the true adventures of this young man."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"By now everyone has at least seen the DreamWorks picture or heard of Frank Abagnale, the real fake, but a person would be really missing out if they stopped there. I had seen the movie a few months ago and although it was great (I'm a sucker for charming con men), the book blows it out of the water!Catch Me if You Can is a captivating book. I honestly could not put it down and ended up losing sleep a few nights ago because I did not want to stop reading it! I know that most people preface their positive reviews of this book with anti-crime speeches, but to tell you the truth, this story made me secretly WANT to be a con artist! Frank Abagnale, Frank Williams (whoever he was that week) was so clever, calm &amp; collected-how can you not want to emulate that persona!I'm not saying that I'm going to ditch my current identity and live my life on the run, but I am saying that this book is so well written and the story is told so vividly, it was a pleasure to lose myself for a few hours while reading it. I recommend it to anyone who revels in reading about crafty and incredibly bright people."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This is a great book because it's an interesting story and because it's fun to be a voyeur into Abagnale's exploits. I'm sure that some women would not like this book as much as men because it has a certain dose of machismo. I'm curious to know what happened to Abagnale after age 21!I finished the book in one evening. It is well written and easy to read."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I first read my dad's dogeared copy of this book a few years back and cannot tell you how happy I am that it's back in print. Abagnale's story is terrific, and that it's true is simply amazing. He impersonated airline pilots, lawyers, and college professors before he was 21 years old, passing fake checks and bedding beautiful babes along the way. And he got away from the cops around the world no matter how many times he was ALMOST caught. That Leonardo DiCaprio will play Abagnale in the soon-to-be-made movie will hopefully get this real-life adventure book the sort of wide-spread attention it deserves!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This book outlines his life story and gives details to his adventures and escapades. I couldn't put the book down and will read it several times again! Thanks to Frank for sharing his life story!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Catch Me if You Can, by Frank Abagnale is a very entertaining book. While reading it I felt a strange urge to actually try some of the tactics Abagnale himself used. As he goes into great detail explaining how forging a check is done, and what all the numbers on a personal check mean. At times, you are so caught up in Frank's adventures that you forget this is a true story of a boy who never even reaches 21 before being thrown into three different prisons outside of the US. Yes, Frank Abagnale spent time in prisons in the US as well as Switzerland and France. And throughout his time as a theif, do you know what his vice was? Girls. That is the reality that kept bringing me back to the concept that Frank is simply a teenager. After all, he started check fraud to get more cash to take out countless girls. An irony I found while reading this book was the fact that I myself was on a plane to the Miami International Airport, where Frank frequented from. I actually found myself thinking, what if that pilot isn't real? It was crazy. This book truely let my imagination run wild, and made me think briefly about a life in crime. (not really) I reccomend this quick read for anyone looking for an enjoyable book, however if you saw the movie do not start this book asuming that the movie is exactly the same, they are actually quite different. There is also a very good interview with Abagnale at the end of the book. This is a comical, yet not laugh out loud, entertaining, true story that can be read over a weekend."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Catch Me If You Can is an entertaining book. It is not well written, there are obvious fabrications, and Frank Abagnale comes off as a egotistic chauvinist, but the action is quick and the tales humorous. I would never recommend this book as an educational book or for someone who only likes stories with emotions, deep plots, and well developed characters, because they aren't really present, but it was a great book to relax with and just enjoy for the day or two it takes to read. A very good book for the plane or pool."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Nothing beats reading the autobiographical book by the man himself. Written in great detail with all actual names and events altered, Frank W. Abagnale is the result of a slightly dysfunctional and broken family. To fulfil his creative instincts and barrage of fantasies/curiosities, Frank masqueraded as a pilot, a doctor, a professor and most of all, a suave young gentlement whose charm was irresistable to hoards of women. While doing everything, Frank also passed millions of dollars in fradulent checks around many countries worldwide before 21 and concealed his tracks so well that the detective hot on his case was unable to arrest him.The book has much insight to offer. Every little detail from how Frank planned his missions to how he meticulously and painstakingly crafted his means to achieve his wants (or what had become needs by the time he was in too deep). In short, he was insatiable, risk-taking and anti-corporation.At the end of the day, Frank's ruse worked due to a combination of factors: his eye for detail, craft for fogery, wit, intelligence, inclination for risk and most important of all, LUCK. When his luck did run out, life became hell as he spent his days from prison to prison.The book is indeed a mind blowing reading that took you inside the world of a pubescent conman!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"If you tried to do today what you read in Frank Abagnales humorous account of his one boy crime spree in the mid to late 1960s you couldn't get away with it. The security hole in paper instruments have long been closed by document consultants, including the reformed Abagnale. Airline security was tightened drasticly long before 9/11.So is the prospective con man out of luck? Hardly each new technology produces its own security flaws. In an age of identity crime, it should come as no surprise that the smarted and more sophesticated the technology becomes, the smarter and more sophesticated the con man becomes.Attention to detail, steel nerves and fantastic luck will get you far in the con business, but it will also get you thown in prison sooner or later. Abagnale's story is a modern morality tale, whose ultimate lesson; \\"there's no such thing as a free lunch\\" should not be missed."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This book was one of the most entertaining I have ever read. It was both funny and interesting. The life he (Frank Abangale) led was amazing. After reading this book, I cant wait to see the movie. I highly recomend this book for any one that can read. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This is the amazing story of a con artist who had to swindle money to finance the expense of sex at 16. This con artists who was also a forger, impostor, ready to cheat ANYONE in his path for fun and profit in the most incredible manners, that causes me to wonder whether the story could be true at all?Here is the kid at less than 19 years old, who learned details how to be regconized as Pan Am pilot, traveled the world all over for free and swindled Pam Am (his imaginary employer) tons of $$$. By passing the state exam to practice laws in Gorgia within 6 months shows how keen the high school dropout was; I find this event is the most remarkable trait about Frank Abagnale -- exceptional smart mind which few, if any, can match to help him con, scam, cheat, lie to anyone, anywhere in any circumtance.When tested by psychologist, his \\"criminal threshold\\" was minimal, Abagnale was confronted by FBI agent: \\"You conned this shrink also, Frank? Low criminal threshold, what if you have high criminal threshold, looted Fort Knox?\\" This remark poses a question about Frank, whether his actions are just juvenile exuberance where he was free of any moral anchors to fund his passion to discover the world or he was just an exceptional con whose lie and cheat was his first order nature, undetected even by the experts. He must be somewhere in between.Fun and profit is probably fit to describe the book, he conned young girls in college to be PAN AM employees for public relation work, took them to Europe in his brotherly protection, paid them with faked PAN AM checks, had the girls endorsed the checks to him, scammed his net in NY and back to fun with his girls in 24 hrs in London was the benchmark of his physical stamina and mental imagination.Hilarious, loaded with details. Con story at its best if readers are free of prejudice."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I agree with one review about the abrupt ending, leaving us hanging as to what eventually happened to this guy, but my husband and I both enjoyed the book (audio) so much, I have to give it 5 stars anyway! While I certainly can't condone Abagnale's fraudulent ways, he seemed like the kind of guy who wouldn't hurt a fly. But a guy with the gonads of an elephant. It made me remember that people will very often just take you at your word even if you aren't as slick as Abagnale. His gall is amazing. Imagine finding out who the \\"big guy\\" in a huge financial institution (an arrogant s.o.b.) and dressing up like an affluent client, going in and saying something like \\"I need to cash a rather large check - J.P. will okay it. Oh, he's not in? That's right, he told me that last week, well just let me speak to his secretary. Hi, John Jones here, tell J.P. I'm sorry I missed him and Joan and I are looking forward to the event next week. He'll know what I mean.\\" The bank officer, not wanting to give the \\"big guy\\" one more thing to get angry about, agrees to cash the check. This is the kind of well-thought out scheme Abagnale pulled regularly. Who else could steal the night deposits, enlisting a couple of State Troopers who show up to help him or con his way out of jail, getting the warden & guard to help him? I can't help myself - I love this guy!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I am struck by the number of reviewers surprised or felt cheated by the abrupt ending. That is precisely the point. It strengthens the work. The literati constructs that require a resolute ending seemed to have missed the point entirely, especially considering the title itself.Frank W. Abagnale succeeded in his efforts to draw the reader into his confidence, only to abandon them as he strode into the darkness, never to look back. The last three sentences of the book serve as the metaphor by which Frank's story should be judged. The full weight of his larcenous acts culminate with this ending, engaging the reader as yet another victim along his spree. It is, in reality, the only way that this story could end. This is not a story of transformation rather, the true (and granted, boastful) story of a confidence man.The fact that there are so many readers expecting some resolve further illustrates that had Frank not been caught, could continue his craft still to this day. Everyone in Frank W. Abagnale's wake was left with the same emptiness least the reader, and I suspect the moviegoer, forget. In the end, it is the craft not the ending that that evokes this response."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Unbelievable book. For those of you who enjoy non-fiction, you just keep reminding yourself as you read this book that it's all true! What a life!

A couple of years later, after my release, I traveled to Houston to meet with him - I wanted to be a part of his consulting firm. Needless to say the timing was not right and it never happened.

Ellis very closely for several years (including *Against Deconstruction*), I'd like to offer a corrective or two to the review below. Just how carefully the reader read the text in question is unclear, but the review betrays some very fundamental confusions. For instance, the review states:&quot;Twentieth century analytic philosophy has, with its emphasis on necessary connections between words and things, reduced the subtle beauty and infinite complexity of language to a stereo manual. Derrida is the greatest living philosopher of our current age, along with perhaps Noam Chomsky.&quot;Now, Derrida and Chomsky may or may not be great philosophers; what *is* certain is that their views of language are very much at odds. Derrida speaks of &quot;infinite signification&quot; in the absence of a &quot;transcendent signifier&quot;...a fancy way of saying that since words don't map directly or &quot;neutrally&quot; onto referents, then signification (meaning) is &quot;infinite&quot;.On the other hand, Chomsky's UG (Univeral Grammar) argues for a &quot;principles and perimeters&quot; view of the brain and human intelligence: in plainer English, he means that the brain has discrete &quot;modules&quot; or sections that are responsible for equally discrete &quot;modules&quot; or sections of intelligence...so, for instance, one part of the brain handles syntax (grammar), while another handles spatio-visual data. This idea, take it or leave it, is very much like the &quot;stereo&quot; idea that the review below mocks...and the same review, of course, praises Chomsky. AND it categorizes Chomsky and Derrida as two great philosophers...well, given that the two are so much at odds, they can't *both* be on the money about language and signification. If Chomsky is right about language, then deconstruction is very much wrong, and visa versa. Yet the review lumps them together and shows no knowledge of the wide gulf between the two approaches.So, take the review below with a grain of salt, to say the least. Read *Against Deconstruction* yourself and make up your own mind. Whether you finally agree or disagree with Ellis's view of post-structuralism, you'll almost certainly learn an awful lot about language and linguistics; Ellis's rescue of Ferdinand de Saussure from the misunderstandings of poststructuralism alone is worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Against Deconstruction","review":"John Ellis' book remains a good beginning for individuals caught up in the deconstruction phase of their lives. Deconstruction is simply untenable, and Ellis simply elucidates this. His arguments are clear, concise, and often redundant, but then this is the obverse of deconstruction, so it may need repeating. There are other challenges to deconstruction that Ellis does not make, challenges more in line with the philosophy of language and mind (e.g., Kripke, Searle, Ryle, et alia) that are more decisive, but also more complex. This simple tome, however, has enough to get one started, and if the deconstruction bug is still not eradicated, there are other compelling arguments elsewhere to bolster some of the gaps."},{"Title":"Against Deconstruction","review":"In this slim, clear-headed volume, John M. Ellis gives a strong and well-informed account of the many outstanding logical, philosophical, and critical-theoretic objections to Jacques Derrida's theory of deconstruction. Juxtaposing his own lucid common-sense forms of discourse and analysis with those of the deconstructive mode, Ellis seeks to demonstrate here that deconstruction's goals are not only unreachable, but also pointless to pursue: the rear cover excerpt speaks of the essential critical act of &quot;finding the new, rather than debunking the old&quot;. And at that, the author excels.&quot;Against Deconstruction&quot; is written in an exceedingly clear and precise scholarly style, one that tastes of cool, classical Greek rhetoric. Each sentence is an enjoyable lesson in how to write clearly and think sharply, as is Ellis' clean large-scale organization; for this reason alone I would recommend it as an instructive rhetorical model for students and writers.Ellis' mental camera zooms in on the contemporary critical scene, first documenting the strange patterns of denial and argument that have appeared since deconstruction's rise to popularity in world academe. Next he examines Derrida's brainchild itself, untangling the Gordian knot of deconstructive theory and practice. Moving from logic and reason to linguistics and interpretation, Ellis subjects deconstruction to a rigorous logical and historical analysis, finally diagnosing it as a reactionary product of the French educational system, a product that has little value anywhere outside that environment.In his judgment of deconstruction's proper place in the critical landscape, Ellis articulates an elegant set of criteria for such judgments, and there lies the book's best feature. His formulation asks, &quot;How do we appraise a critical method? By what criteria do we judge the value of statements of critical theory, and individual works of criticism?&quot; Ellis' answers to those questions are excellent and well-presented."},{"Title":"Against Deconstruction","review":"John Ellis has spent a long and distinguished career debunking what he saw as trendy, illogical, and just plain faulty theories of literary criticism. For him, if any theory purports to explain the relation that a text has with its readers, that theory should be able to withstand a rigorous dissection by those who are more interested in truth and logic than in following the crowd. In AGAINST DECONSTRUCTION, Ellis takes to task the theory called deconstruction, as initially promulgated by Jacques Derrida in 1966. Even before deconstruction took firm hold in academia, Ellis, in his earlier THE THEORY OF LITERARY CRITICISM (1974), sounded a warning that theories which claim a special exemption from analysis and wrap themselves in mystic splendor are likely to be far less sophisticated than at first glance. Ellis shows disdain for any theoretician who stridently asserts that \\"logic, reason, and analysis are insufficient to discuss Derrida\\" (9). He further takes offense at the prevalent mode of deconstructionist thought that implies it need do no more than dismantle previously existing worn-out theories without offering a viable and presumably more useful alternative. A recurrent theme, Ellis sees in Derrida, is the latter's refusal to investigate alternatives to his own animus toward logocentrism. Ellis also exposes Derrida as one who shamelessly claims to be a firm originator of a dramatic and even heroic basis for judging texts in terms of their inherent contradictions as indicated by their binary opposites. Such binaries, Ellis notes, are neither original with Derrida nor a particularly fruitful way to limit academic discourse to polar opposites while totally ignoring a vast range of shades of meaning that are interspersed between them. Finally, Ellis lists many rhetorical tricks, flourishes, and deceptive practices, all of which add up to a theory that has succeeded in entrenching itself in literary discourse despite its many flaws. Clearly, as long as Derrida's followers can repeat the mantra that \\"all interpretation is misinterpretation,\\" then the validity of deconstruction as a useful tool in literary analysis will endure only for as long as it takes enough people to see that the literary emperor truly has no clothes."},{"Title":"Against Deconstruction","review":"Back in the 1970's and the 1980's the early writings of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida exerted considerable influence on literary studies at some of America's better universities. Professor John M. Ellis does not think this was a good thing and, in this little book, he tells us why.Almost everything of interest in this text is contained in the lengthy chapter entitled \\"Deconstruction and the Nature of Language\\". It's here that Ellis states and defends three theses:1) Derrida's claims that \\"there is no linguistic sign before writing\\" and \\"the concept of writing exceeds and comprehends that of language\\" are pretty much untenable no matter how charitably they are construed; 2) the speech/writing opposition deconstruction makes so much of has nothing to do with the main thrust of Derrida's thought, which is his advocacy of an anti-essentialist view of language (which is tenable, but neither original nor radical); 3) Derrida's description of language as \\"a system of signifiers\\" and his claim that \\"signifieds\\" can be in the position of \\"signifiers\\" betrays either a gross misunderstanding of Ferdinand de Saussure's theory of linguistics or a willful, and unsubstantiated, mutation of the same.In his remaining 100 pages Professor Ellis abandons close reading and careful discussion of Derrida's texts in favor of a more general examination of the rhetorical strategies often employed in deconstructionist literary criticism as practiced by Derrida's disciples (for example, Ellis shows that a sexy categorical slogan such as \\"all interpretation is misinterpretation\\" is either obviously false or, at best, trivially true). While interesting, a little bit of this goes a long way--I found myself skimming the last couple of chapters...."},{"Title":"Against Deconstruction","review":"Though the tide of deconstruction, the powerful Gallic efflux it was in the seventies and eighties, has ebbed somewhat, having given way to its close kin, New Historicism, it continues to have some currency in literary criticism: one would certainly be remiss if in her critical writing she did not drop the late M. Derrida's name now and then.And yet, after having read recently Professor Ellis's *Against Deconstruction,* an absolutely withering critique of the titular adversary by any sensible measure, I wonder how deconstruction managed to survive, in whole or in part, nearly a decade into the early twenty-first century.Let me say that I am not unsympathetic to the posture and attitude that characterize deconstruction's practitioners, but I have to admit that, as Ellis closely and rigorously argues, the revelation -- a revelation which makes one blush, believing he should have known this all along -- that deconstruction is old wine (admittedly, it is French wine, but old nonetheless) in new skins has forced me to cast a rueful eye upon my six years' apprenticeship in this discourse.Yes, \\"old\\" because all criticism, as Ellis points out, is contestive, skeptical, resistant; thus to lard one's critical writing with nearly inscrutable, neologistic French loanwords is at best self-indulgent, if not captiously insistent on solipsism. And \\"new\\" because deconstructionists parade rhetorical dipsy-doodles as truly learned, truly sophisticated subversion -- a subversion that, according to Professor Ellis, remains deliberately incomplete, because to do otherwise would force deconstructionists to commit to a definite position. Which leads one to the conclusion, as it does Ellis, that deconstruction is far more establishmentarian, far more conservative (an accusation I believe J&uuml;rgen Habermas also leveled at French theorists in general) than the hoary old, and supposedly monolithic (though this too is a bogus assumption, as it turns out), New Critical (?) interpretations of literature deconstructionist criticism purposes to supplant.There are surprises aplenty awaiting the curious reader of *Against Deconstruction,* the most surprising of which is the analysis of Derrida's (ab)use of Saussurean linguistics, perhaps the most damning thing to emerge from Ellis's forensics. And the reader will be left, then, to confront anew certain common-sense assumptions abandoned when she entered the thicket of literary studies: that it is often the most prettily wrapped packages which contain the most ho-hum gifts, and that the most indigestible critical fare is often the most meager."},{"Title":"Against Deconstruction","review":"Ellis's lengthiest chapter, concerning language, stokes my suspicions about Derrida. In that chapter, Ellis accuses Derrida of a fallacy, viz. the false dilemma, by implying that meaning in language can have but two possible explanations. Words either take their meaning from non-verbal essences or, lacking those grounds, are held in place syntactically, by relation to other words. Since the former has been discredited, only the latter in the form of word-play remains. And voila! - post-modernism comes into view. This is the dilemma fallacy in its purist form since excluded from the equation are all those intermediate positions, including Saussure's, that make use of concepts or categoreal distinctions. True, some varieties of this third approach have been discredited. But as Ellis's useful example of ambient temperatures shows, a variety of alternative concepts does not imply that categoreal distinctions are not based on non-verbal grounds. Derrida appears to have passed over such alternatives in uncaring fashion. If Derrida's many followers have a stronger position to state in support of deconstruction, I have not seen it.I would have preferred more material on Paul de Man, who for some reason is scarcely mentioned in the book. Nevertheless, Ellis has effectively challenged the current fashion among the avant garde."},{"Title":"Against Deconstruction","review":"I am not a specilaist ion the field and I purchased this book to undertand deconstruction and its problems better. I was not disappointed in Ellis' exposure of the fallacies of deconstruction; however, I think he focused excessively on Derrida, while there are others such as Lacan, kristeva to mention a few that also deserve some 'attention'. I found the chapter on Language to be the clearest and most useful; however, I stress that I'm not a specialist and admit that reading this volume was somewhat difficult due to its emphsasis on logical reasoning and arguments. Nonetheless, I do think that its criticisms of deconstruction - and especially its misguided applications in the US - were very clear and convincing. Indeed, I find that Ellis' is strongest when he describes the intellectual climate out of which deconstruction was born, that is the stale monolithic character of french literary criticism of the 50's and the nned to supplant it with radical aideas that ultimately turn out to be just as stale. My only criticism is the the writing style that may put off the non-specialist. accordingly for thsoe like me I recommend the beautifully written The Reckless Mind by Lilla, which also exposes the fallcies of Derrida and other deconstructionists."},{"Title":"Against Deconstruction","review":"There are many books, pro and con, about current literary theory. Most of them are written by literary academics. This one is by a philosopher. The significance of this difference is in the tools which the author brings to bear on the problems or on his intolerance of slipshod thinking and sleights of hand. This book is also rare in that respect. The usual attitude of professional philosophers to Derrida is to let his arguments \\"fall of their own weight.\\" However, fervently held beliefs do not fall of their own weight or even by the weight of argument. Ellis is to be complimented, therefore, for the extreme patience he shows in plodding through every detail of the claims of Deconstructionism and painstakingly refuting each one. This book will, of course, have no effect on the true believers. Nothing will. But for the undecided and the not-yet-converted this book may be a lifesaver. In the end, Ellis concludes that genuine theory \\"ought to employ analysis rather than rhetorical drama.\\" (p. 158). Instead, in Deconstructionism, \\"theory\\" becomes in large measure a new vehicle through which older, unthinking attitudes are clung to and genuine change resisted.\\" (p. 154) Ellis' book is analytical rather than constructive. For constructive answers to the problems that led to Deconstructionism and the other newer attempts at theory, see A Book Worth Reading."},{"Title":"Against Deconstruction","review":"First of all this text is remarkably lucid. Furthermore, it is quite fair in its critical analysis of the subject at hand. This text is also, though now around two decades old, very important to the ongoing debates concerning \\"deconstructive events\\".Strengths: Ellis raises powerful objections to the privilege with which \\"deconstruction\\" is treated by its adherents. Specifically, through this text the author makes it quite clear, even early on, that \\"deconstruction\\" may be read as self-undermining, both in presentation and execution. Even more particularly, Ellis's observation that there are better and worse interpretations of deconstruction, evinced by both Derrida and his commentators, directly flies in the face of the central \\"deconstructive\\" tenet that authorial intent can not be a controlling factor.Ellis also admirably calls to question some of Derrida's rhetorical movements, especially those key movements on which major points turn. For example, Ellis points out the habit of switching out terms for other terms, in supposed demonstration of validity, while no such successful demonstration may actually be taking place. I am thinking specifically of Ellis's discussion of the \\"language:speech/writing\\" translation, by Derrida, to \\"writing:phonic/graphic\\". This observation is quite prudent.The chapter on the utility of \\"deconstruction\\" as criticism is among the best in the book. I recommend this chapter be read along with the writings of Gasch&eacute; (against the possibility of \\"deconstructive\\" criticism) as well as the writings of someone like de Man or Norris (for the possibility).Weaknesses: There are several, but of most notable interest to me was the early discussion of what Ellis takes to be a confused understanding of Saussure by Derrida. I do want to emphasize that on much of this material concerning a historical and conceptual analysis of Saussure, Ellis is quite spot-on; for example, his discussion of the \\"garbling\\" of 'sign', 'signifier', and 'signified' on the part of Derrida and his commentators is remarkably keen and one of the most poignant contributions he brings to the discussion. I hope that many readers, especially those committed to Derrida's \\"project\\", pay close attention to these passages. Elsewhere, however, I take it that Ellis is misconstruing things. For example, Ellis offers evidence that he takes to directly call into question the idea of ethnocentric logocentrism, in particular that Saussure offered a groundbreaking response to the Western tradition of preference for the written (strictly-speaking, not the written in any expansive Derridean sense of the term) in an ostensibly total lack of awareness of Plato's opinion on the matter --- and this is very much an area to which Derrida, following Nietzsche before him, looks to respond. Here Ellis takes Derrida to commit the offense which he condemns in Saussure -- privileging the written over the oral, but this is decidedly off-base.The text also looks to be too selective for a deep critique. For example, some of the passages withdrawn from Spivak's translation of Grammatology are encapsulated within a lack of original context, and in some cases the questionable points of argumentation hold much more weight when taken within the entire essay or chapter within which they are found. This, alas, can be a struggle in the composition of any critical response to a text. I also have small concerns about the extent to which Ellis really went through the original French versions on his own -- being no issue had he not explicitly noted in a footnote on p. 18 that he had done so. I think that, at points, some passages fall victim to poor translation into English. Of course, this burden may not be exclusively placed upon Ellis, but if he is able to read the French, I see it as a less excusable error than it would be with the lack of French ability.In a word: This is an extremely valuable text but like any other it cannot offer any final word on the matter of the \\"deconstructive\\" possibility. I would recommend this book more to dogmatic followers of Derrida than I would to those who have already dismissed his project, although this text should be read by philosophers and lit critics alike, not to mention anyone else working within the humanities or social sciences."},{"Title":"Against Deconstruction","review":"Ellis' critic asserts to his own arguments, but overall is highly misleading. At a first glance, it shows that not matters how hard he tried to put his prejudices aside on analysing his opponent's system of beliefs he succeed in filtering them with his own bias and frameworks. On a deeper level, he honestly, tries to go about it as if he were dismantling the contradictions of his opponents in their own terms. Regrettably, it can never be in their terms for the simple fact that John M. Ellis doesn't agree with those terms.However, John M. Ellis achieved the illusion of disarming his opponents in their own terms almost to perfection. Disappointedly, though understandably he only managed to believe in his opponents' terms provisionally. His way about those terms is executed by making them contradict his own mind frame, which he insists, are those of common sense and of a proper rational thinking as if he, in fact, were using them without contradicting himself.John M. Ellis writes in his book and I am quoting page 95:Imagine a conference on cancer research at which the general sense is that recent research is going nowhere. A deconstructionist rises to tell the conference that it must look at hitherto marginalized, thus neglected, ideas. A researcher, intrigued by the possibility of a new idea, asks what specific suggestion or suggestions the deconstructionist has in mind. But the deconstructionist replies only that the field must question its concept of what is central to cancer research. Evidently, replies the researcher, but just what aspect of the current consensus on centrality is the problem, and which of the thousands of currently neglected chemical possibilities is the one that the deconstructionist is recommending? If now the deconstructionist replies that is recommending a general strategy, not a concrete proposal, the audience will conclude, correctly, that he has nothing to say after all. For what he has just said is rather like saying, \\"Have a good idea.\\" That is not even a strategy for finding new ideas, much less a new idea in itself.To reply to John M. Ellis I use his own lines in this way:Imagine a conference on deconstruction research at which the general sense is that recent research on the subject is going nowhere. John M. Ellis rises to tell the conference that it must look at neglected ideas by the deconstructionists. A researcher intrigued by the possibility of a new idea asks what specific suggestion or suggestions John M. Ellis has in mind. But John M. Ellis replies only that the field must question its concept of what is central to deconstruction. Evidently, replies the researcher, but just what aspect of the current consensus on deconstruction is the problem and which of the thousands of currently neglected deconstructional possibilities is the one that John M. Ellis is recommending? If now John M. Ellis replies that he is recommending a general strategy, like considering deconstruction a dismissible crackpot, the deconstructional audience will conclude, correctly, that John M. Ellis has nothing to say after all. For what he has just said is rather like saying. \\"Have a good idea.\\" That is not even a strategy for finding new ideas, much less a new idea in itself.Other examples like this can be found throughout Ellis' book. No matter how hard he tries to be in a dialogue with his assumed opponents he fails at each time either by misleading them or by falling trapped of the same contradictions he places on them.John M. Ellis keeps on insisting on the fact that deconstructionists have nothing new to offer. He however, fails to understand that from a philosophical viewpoint deconstruction has never been worried about creating anything new, but recreating old general question that come back to us with new lights. To reduce Derrida's heritage to the socio-political situation in France is interesting but not enough to understand Derrida's ideas. Ellis' dismissal of certain philosophical tradition is also understandable considering his own stands. However, to considered deconstruction as unsound is part of his own strategy of opposition that has nothing to do with deconstruction soundness and it is just another proof of his inability to step out of his own credo.Even when John M. Ellis sounds Wittgenstein-like, he never managed to grasp the fact that deconstructionists might sound illogical not only because they seem to contradict in themselves, but because their assertions belong to organized sequences of signs outside their fallibility. Unfortunately, John M. Ellis sees the deconstructionists' infallibility as their own failure to admit contradicting themselves. But it is the fight to be fallibly accepted against our seemingly infallibility, what Ellis' logic has a hard time to digest.To summarize, the new ideas that John M. Ellis demands so much from deconstructionists are nowhere to be found in his book. I wouldn't doubt that John M. Ellis tried to be seen as a new, original interesting proponent against deconstruction, but his own arsenal of tools betrayed his enterprise."},{"Title":"Against Deconstruction","review":"It is always nice to hear the other side. Having read Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions for a philosophy of science class I recognize the old-guard's last grasp for power when I see it. Certainly this is a well written book and insightful at times but it is also a representative document of the way we were. Deconstructivism is a hugely important area of study if only because it explodes the various fields it encompasses and allows us to re-evaluate the politics and powers which have heretofore shaped \`the facts' and \`truths' referenced in those fields. As far as Derrida goes, his work is a huge breath of fresh air. Twentieth century analytic philosophy has, with its emphasis on necessary connections between words and things, reduced the subtle beauty and infinite complexity of language to a stereo manual. Derrida is the greatest living philosopher of our current age, along with perhaps Noam Chomsky. And the last writer was correct, Derrida's theories are not specifically new (I love Nietzsche too) but his applications are. He illustrates the dynamic in language which analytic philosophers pretend is not there. You cannot truly know insects when the ones you study are already pinned in the cornell box. It's Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty all over again. So read this book -- it is always good to know the other side, but don't be afraid to shed the dead weight and question the \`facts' and \`truths' you have been spoon-feed by capitalism and patriarchy -- the two (one-sided) fathers of our current academic system which, after all these years is finally losing some ground to real truths.

When I was reading the novel, I didn't appreciate it as much as I do now. The complexities of his relationship with his wife, his job, and his faith have kept me thinking of different scenarios, things he could have done. Perhaps what I like best about Graham Greene's writing is that he doesn't dictate your feelings. You are free to make your own judgments of the characters. In fact, it is very easy to make arguments one way or another about what the characters believe because he doesn't spell it out for you as if you were a child. By not overwriting the characters, there is some mystery, as in real life. Can you ever truly know another person wholly? Also recommended: The End of the Affair by Graham Greene, which is even more complex and mysterious."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"The Heart of the Matter by Graham Greene is a delightful read, both because of the simplicity of the language and honesty of the tale. Scobie is a middle aged Police Deputy Commissioner, obsessively sincere to his duty, and particularly useless to his book reading wife Louise. The tale is set in a West African colony, where it rains for six months, and apart from loneliness, bugs, roaches, malaria and third world struggles oppress the few white men who reside in the colony. Wilson appears in the colony and takes a liking to Louise. Before he can get anywhere, she leaves for South Africa.A plot of circumstances makes Scobie's life a mesh where he needs to be the friend of very Yusef he despises and fall in love with twenty years younger, Mrs Rolt, or Helen. By the time his wife decides to return, he is tangled in a desperate struggle between two women, good and bad, his principles and everything he must do to compromise them, and the story proceeds into a realm of beautiful tragedy, leaving the reader spellbound.There are few most memorable chapters in the novel. One is the description of a game Wilson and Harris invent and play, where they compete to hunt roaches. Other is the last one, where the Heart of Matter leaves you stunned and silenced in its sincere description for how little people matter once they are dead.There are many sentences that I invariably will remember for a long time. Examples: 1) Virtue, the good life, tempted him in the dark like a sin. 2) Men become twins with age: the past was their common womb: the six months of rain and the six months of sun was the period of their common gestation. They needed only a few words and a few gestures to convey their meaning. 3)The word \\"pity\\" is used as loosely as the word \\"love\\": the terrible promiscuous passion which so few experience. 4) He listened with the intense interest one feels in a stranger's life, the interest the young mistake for love. AND LAST, but not the least 5) 'Of two hearts one is always warm and one is always cold: the cold heart is more precious than diamonds: the warm heart has no value and is thrown away.'"},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"In THE HEART OF THE MATTER, Graham Greene employs some of his favorite themes to show how his protagonists aspire to moral elevation, encounter temptation, and then succumb to that temptation. Chief of Police Major Scobie is another in a long line of Greene protagonists who are surrounded by rot, decay, corruption, and just plain seediness but nevertheless try not to wallow in all that immorality. Scobie is an honest top cop in a graft ridden West African district during the Second World War. For him, the war is a distant affair, one that encroaches on his turf mostly when he has to ferret out Nazi spies, saboteurs, and illegal contraband smugglers. For fifteen years, he has managed to walk a delicate balance between doing his job and doing it too well. Further, though he loves his wife, she has begun to show the classic Greene symptoms of marital boredom. She had been counting on his getting a promotion to District Police Commissioner as a panacea for what she has increasingly come to see as her life being bent back on itself. His promotion, however, goes to another younger officer and while this does not terribly bother him, it most certainly does her. She tells Scobie that she needs a vacation from the humdrum life that he seems to tolerate but she cannot. At this point, several of Greene's themes come into play. A good man with good intentions is placed in a negative and hurtful environment. He sees enemies everywhere, and he is not sure whom he can trust. He is about to make decisions that will take him on a journey that is at least as much spiritual as physical. It is tempting, of course, to equate Scobie with Conrad's Marlow, especially since both Scobie and Marlow are in the same general area of Africa. Unlike Marlow who did not allow Kurtz's evil to alter his moral compass, Scobie is to encounter evil on a more personal, less universal level, with devastating consequences.Scobie's downfall occurs incrementally with the first step occurring when he needs money to pay for his wife's trip. This decision to borrow money brings him into contact with a rather sleazy Syrian merchant named Yusuf who agrees to a loan. In a closed-community like this one where all the thieves know one another, Scobie's loan attracts the watchful eye of a British counter-intelligence agent who immediately guesses the truth but needs proof to arrest Scobie. At this point, Greene's tale is a fairly believable melodrama in which he places both man and land in an arena where the latter is filled with evil and the former is waiting to be infected by it. Greene complicates the plot with additions that do not seem organic to his design: to test man's ability to retain faith. Instead, he chooses to involve Scobie in an affair with a young widow whose only purpose is to further enmesh him in a tangled web of deceit. In the best traditions of the international potboiler Scobie sees no way out but the usual self-exit. What began as a reasonably involving thriller quickly enough devolves into a predictable mess that suggests that for a matter to hold the reader, its heart ought to resonate with more universal, if not believable plot contrivances."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"The Heart of the Matter by Graham Greene is perhaps the darkest Greene novel I've read to date, and that's saying something. The setting, the barrenness of the main characters' social and personal lives and the apparent presence of the devil in the book combine to make this a depressing -- and engaging -- read by Greene, one of the master writers of the internal and spiritual landscape.Henry Scobie is a police officer passed over for promotion for commissioner in a west African coastal colony of the British Empire in the twentieth century. The setting of the novel is indicative of the oppressive spiritual crisis that is to build and explode for Scobie throughout the course of the novel. The colony is either baking in heat or inundated with rains. At the end of each season, the characters seem about to go mad for want of the next, only to repeat the cycle of exhaustion. There are rats, cockroaches and other assorted irritating and dangerous creatures everywhere, in the houses and hotel rooms, in the baths, everywhere. Malaria hits Scobie early on, and we can see from his casual decision to \\"sweat it out\\" while on a trip to investigate a suicide that it's not an unusual occurrence. The pain of the landscape is exacerbated by WWII and the allegiances and enemies it creates in a faraway land as well as its rendering of normal activities, like writing and carrying letters for post, as crimes. This is a miserable, miserable place to be.But Scobie seems to like it; he is comfortable in this landscape. He, unlike his wife, is not ambitious, and is not unhappy about being passed over for promotion. However, he does worry about the effect this has on his wife, Louise. His love for her is anything but idealized, if it even is love. He seems more to pity her than anything else and feels the burden to provide for her happiness however he can very deeply. They are both devoutly Catholic, and have lost a daughter in their marriage, their only child. Scobie, who writes \\"just the facts\\" in his diary every night noted their daughter's death with only, \\"C. died.\\" against that day's date.In an effort to provide for his wife's happiness, Scobie borrows money from a man of dubious character, Yusef, a Syrian merchant living in the colony who seems to be often under police surveillance. The money is spent to send Louise to South Africa. Both Scobie and Louise know that she is not liked in the colony and has few friends except for a new clerk, Wilson, who is not really welcomed at the club due to his lowly status. Wilson is in love with Louise and hates Scobie for not valuing her as he does (in idealizing her and his feelings).It is in his dealings with Louise that we first see that Scobie is sadly unable to estimate her understanding of him and their relationship accurately. He always seems surprised when she guesses what he is thinking or when she knows he is lying to her about his feelings, etc. And yet they have been married some years. The reader starts to see that Scobie's view of others is (humanly) inaccurate and serves his own purposes of pity and concern more than it serves the future of any close relationship.While Louise is gone, Scobie is called to a rescue site of some boat passengers who were victims of a German sea attack. Many tragically die, but one woman, who looks like a child as she is carried into his life on a stretcher clutching only a stamp album, becomes a new love interest to Scobie. Helen Rolt has lost her husband in the attack, and after her recovery is living in the colony waiting to return to England or move on somewhere else, and Scobie, in his efforts to care for her -- she was such a heartbreaking vision -- falls in love with her and starts an affair.It isn't long before we can see the same patterns in his relationship with Helen that we see with Louise. He says he loves her -- and seems to -- and yet his love is played out only by promises he doubts he can fulfill and pitied concern. Again he underestimates his lovers' perception of realit; again he seems to have taken on a burden, rather than a companion; again he seems to be more lonely in the relationship than outside of it. And yet he craves it and cannot let it go. Even when Louise returns.Scobie's spiritual life matters to him, and he, a policeman, is very concerned with the law, and struggles to cope with meeting the laws of his Christianity while pleasing and helping the two women he says he loves, neither of which seem to understand him completely, though they \\"get\\" him more than he seems to get them. In further dealings with Yusef, real and palpable evil comes into the story in a manner as oppressive as the weather and the climate. While Scobie seems to be succeeding in Louise's ambitions, he struggles more and more with meeting the law of his Catholicism while not hurting Louise or Helen.The sad and tragic aspect of Scobie is that he sees the rules of his religious life more clearly than he sees the love and grace it is to provide for him. Just as in his relationships with women, he underestimates what God knows and understands about him and might do for him if asked. He takes on all the responsibility of the pain and loneliness and the evil of this place, while never seeking assistance. The pain of the last chapters is unrelenting, though a small bit of hope and grace is articulated by one of the characters toward the end. I'm clinging to these few words, or I'd lose all my hope myself."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"'The word &quot;pity&quot; is used as loosely as the word &quot;love&quot;', Greene writes in this novel: 'Pity: the terrible promiscuous passion which so few experience.' Far from being a novel about the struggle between private passion and public duty, The Heart of the Matter reveals the struggle between pity and pity. Scobie, thought by many critics to be a 'tragic hero', in the Aristotelian sense, is destroyed because his pity becomes monstrously self-centred, it becomes his 'hubris'. Sex is replaced in this novel by pity. Scobie's infidelity is in pitying another woman, not in sleeping with her. Caught between pity for his wife and pity for his 'lover', Scobie is a untypical adulterer; and caught between his belief in God and his desire to suspend the ethical norms in which he operates, Scobie is an untypical Catholic.Yet this novel is typical of Greene, in that it portrays untypical people, feeling untypical things for other untypical people.

There are heavy religious overtones to this novel, but they never feel preachy or compromise the strength of the drama.The main character is Major Henry Scobie, the deputy-commissioner of police in a British-occupied West African state during World War II. He's an honest cop on a force that is given to corruption: Some officers routinely take bribes to overlook diamond-smuggling operations, many of which are masterminded by a sly Syrian named Yusef, who manipulates his friendship with the officers through favors and blackmail.Scobie's wife, Louise, is miserable; she is lonely and feels ostracized by the other officers' wives in the community. She would like to leave and go to South Africa for a while, but Scobie can't leave his post to go with her or afford to send her because he's been passed over for promotion to commissioner. His last resort to scrape together the money is to borrow it from Yusef, which puts him squarely under Yusef's thumb.After Louise's departure, Scobie meets a girl named Helen whose husband drowned when their ship was attacked. He falls in love with her despite the fact that she's young enough to be his daughter and mocks his piety. He wonders if adultery can be a sin if the love is genuine, but this is not just a cynical attempt to rationalize his infidelity. Adding to the conflict is a clerk named Wilson who is in love with Louise and, while he pretends to be Scobie's friend and moral compass, acts a sort of dual role as watchdog and betrayer.Like the protagonist of Greene's &quot;The Power and the Glory,&quot; Scobie's character is defined by the fact that he is a devout Catholic who is contritely aware of his sins. Although he believes that suicide would be eternal damnation, he poses a crucial question for himself: Would it be better to kill himself for the sake of honor than to live shamefully, insulting God by kneeling before the altar while living adulterously?I see Scobie as a &quot;white knight&quot; type of character -- a cavalier, a protector, someone who was born to be a policeman, someone who is sworn to follow the moral code of Christianity. When he fails in this task, or believes that he fails, he is forced to question the validity of continuing his mission; that is, his life. After reading so many novels about people with moral uncertainties, I find a fresh perspective in this man who draws courage from his convictions and acts accordingly."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Scobie, a British police officer stationed in a nameless (perhaps Sierra Leone) West African state in the waning years of the Second World War, is a desperately principled soul. After sending his wife to South Africa on holiday (an expensive proposition that causes him to need to borrow a sum of money from the local-Syrian-moneylender/black marketeer, Yusef), he finds himself driven perversely to commit adultery.Yusef and Scobie's relationship, as a subtext, provides a deeply interesting foil to the four-cornered relationship between Scobie, his wife, Helen (the adulteress), and Wilson (who professes to love Scobie's wife...behavimg much in the fashion of a dog). Through the interplay of Yusef and Scobie, Greene provides the reader insight into the fundamental shallowness and duplicity of human relationships...professed friendship and blackmail dominate. The heart of the matter, as expressed here, is that human relationships are implicitly inferior to the relationship that we may choose to experience with the divine.As for Scobie, he ... himself by taking sacrament (communion bread) without first confessing himself.

Beautifully written, skillfully rendered characters, and spiritually profound. Only Greene wrote novels like this treasure."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"This is one of the most important novels by Greene in his vast production. Henry Scobie is an assistant police chief in a West African coastal town (surely in Sierra Leone, where Greene was stationed during WWII), in colonial times, during the war. He is an honest man, a good officer appreciated by his coworkers. He's unhappily married to Louise, a fanatical Catholic woman, who hates her life in that hellhole. She starts pestering Scobie into sending her for some time to South Africa, be he has no money to do so. Meanwhile, thanks to his job, Scobie enters in dealings with one Yusef, a suspected criminal. In the middle of the world war, even this remote corner is full of spies and theater to intrigue. In spite of Yusef's insistence on bieng friends with Scobie, he refuses, on account of the guy's bad reputation. Enter Wilson, an accountant with a trading company, who shares with Louise a love for poetry, which brings them together...Trapped between three fires, plus a tragic incident he has to investigate, Scobie's moral strength begins to give way. All his certainties, his solid faith in God start to shake. There is no way he comes out alive and with his morals totally upheld. Louise goes, finally, and a little after Scobie participates in the rescue of some people whose ship has sunk, in a faraway place. There, in that ship, comes Scobie's disgrace, the seed of his moral decay and growing anxiety.For all the melodrama that lies behind the story, if one understands Scobie, then it is impossible to exaggerate the magnitude of the existential debacle and the moral crumbling-down he experiences. Out of the blue, Scobie's personal and professional ethics goes to the dogs, but he is unable to contemporize with the facts. Perhaps another writer (a French one, for example), would have come up with a picaresque or a sitcom with this material. A Maugham character, with some changes here and there, would have taken the situation with \\"philosophy\\". Conrad, a master at portraying guilt, remorse and repentance, might have given the story an epic tone. Not Greene.Although there are other important characters, like Father Rank, the central story is that of the infernal pentagon formed by Scobie, Louise, Wilson, Yusef, and someone else. The question is: What happens when an honest, sincere man suddenly has everything against him, like a Divine conspiracy to try him, and he fails? And no, the answer is not: \\"To begin with, get rid of that oppressive religion\\", since religion is not the only source of morality and ethics. It is a question of self-image; not frivolity or selfishness, but precisely the opposite: our image in the minds of others, and if you believe in God, also in his mind. One of the most disturbing novels by Greene, along with \\"The Power and the Glory\\", but maybe even more disquieting due to the nature of the menace. Excellent."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Over forty years ago a new English teacher at my school answered a question asked by an eager student. The question was, \\"What do you think is the greatest novel written in English?\\" He didn't think for very long before replying, \\"The Heart Of The Matter.\\"We academically-inclined youths borrowed Graham Greene's novel from the library and eventually conferred. There were shrugs, some indifference, appreciation without enthusiasm. We were all about sixteen years old.I last re-read The Heart Of The Matter about twenty-five years ago. When I began it again for the fourth time last week, I could still remember vividly the basics of its characters and plot. Henry Scobie is an Assistant Chief of Police in a British West African colony. It is wartime and he has been passed over for promotion. He is fifty-ish, wordly-wise, apparently pragmatic, a sheen that hides a deeply analytical conscience. Louise, his wife is somewhat unfocusedly unhappy with her lot. She is a devout Catholic and this provides her support, but the climate is getting to everyone. She leaves for a break that Scobie cannot really afford. He accepts debt.The colony's businesses are run by Syrians. Divisions within their community have roots deeper than commercial competition. There is \\"trade\\" of many sorts. There are accusations, investigations, rumours and counter-claims. Special people arrive to look into things. There's a suicide, more than one, in fact, at least one murder, an extra-marital affair, blackmail, family and wartime tragedy.But above all there is the character of Henry Scobie. He is a man of principle who thinks he is a recalcitrant slob. He is a man of conscience who presents a pragmatic face. He makes decisions fully aware of their consequences, but remains apparently unable to influence the circumstance that repeatedly seems to dictate events. He remains utterly honest in his deceit, consistent in his unpredictability. His life becomes a beautiful, uncontrolled mess. His wife's simple orthodox Catholicism contrasts with his never really adopted faith. He tries to keep face, but cannot reconcile the facts of his life with the demands of his conscience. His ideals seem to have no place in a world where interests overrule principle. He sees a solution, a way out, but perhaps it is a dead end.For twenty-first century sensibilities, the colonial era attitudes towards local people appear patronising at best. Perhaps that is how things were. But The Heart Of The Matter is not really a descriptive work. It is not about place and time. Like a Shakespearean tragedy, the events and their setting provide only a backdrop and context for a deeply moving examination of motive and conscience. And also like a Shakespearean tragedy, the novel transcends any limitations of its setting to say something unquestionably universal about the human condition. Forty years on, I now realise, that my new English teacher was probably right."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"It's hard for me to review The Heart of the Matter without mentioning The Power and the Glory, so I won't even try. While many people think The Power and the Glory is Greene's tragic masterpiece, I think the case could be made for this book. In a way, The Heart of the Matter is the reciprocal of The Power and the Glory - instead of leading a fairly villainous protagonist on a path to redemption through death at the hands of the ruling authority, it takes a basically good authority figure, the police commissioner Scobie, down a path to both spiritual damnation and public and private ridicule. I find it ironic that Scobie's one abuse of his power, sleeping with a native, is but one of the many committed by the whiskey priest in The Power and the Glory, and the final act of each, suicide, is seen as heroic in The Power and the Glory, and quite pitiful in The Heart of the Matter. The is of course easily attributable to Greene's Catholic obsession with redemption - the whiskey priest proclaims his sinful nature and the narrator forgives (and deifies) him, while Scobie (and the narrator) clings to his own essential goodness - thus the sin of pride is what ultimately prevents Scobie from either human or divine forgiveness. This is problematic at best and arrogant at worst for an audience unconcerned with godly redemption. I would fall into the godless swine category, which is why I find Scobie so much more likeable than the whiskey priest, and why I find his ultimate ruin so much more tragic. And if we're rating tragedy, isn't that the most important indicator?"},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Henry \\"Ticki\\" Scobie at first leads a sanguine life, runs into a life stupified by languishing heat to the point of frequently experiencing torpor, and ultimately succumbs to common human frailties, including one of the greatest sins.Like the unnamed priest in Graham's classic \\"The Power and the Glory\\", Scobie's character lives in a secluded third world country as an expatriate worker; is a foreigner in a foreign land involved with war, and holds a position of authority observed with dignity by the locals. And, interestingly, the beginnings of each book include cavalcades of attention for the rare entry of a ship and people meeting or discussing matters with the local dentist.Scobie's wife nags to leave the heat and boredom of the land. She prevails, at a cost which he cannot afford. Thereafter, living in a land without his wife, he meets a young woman whose physical attraction to his 50-year old self can only be accepted. But, when reflecting upon this awkward relationship, his first tryst, he confesses, that: \\"When we say to someone, \`I can't live without you' what we really mean is \`I can't live feeling you may be in pain, unhappy, in want.' That's all it is. When they are dead our responsibility ends.\\" This statement become extremely important later in the book.Eventually, his wife returns. Things become terribly complicated in his previously uncomplicated life. The stress builds and angina sets. He cannot sleep. Torn between two lovers, and being hunted by fellow civil servants as well as local mafia, he realizes he and his life have accelerated to a speed to which he is not accustomed, nor could become accustomed to. Such a life is extremely un-British. Scobie is quintessentially British.Some characteristics of Scobie and his wife remind me of the fateful characters of Waugh's Tony and Brenda Last of \\"Handful of Dust.\\" And, the rich dialogue of this book reminds me of the polite but sometime acrid comments volleyed like shuttlecocks between characters. The wife in each encounters a similar ending.This book well rivals any other written by the author. He is a master of delivering the pains and poignant reflections which people often make when scolded by heat, sun and torrential downpours associated with Africa or Mexico (site of \\"Power\\"). Also, his artful delivery of the reader to fictional lands is one of his greatest talents. This is a great read."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"This was Greene's first book I read. Some time ago I had come across the book review of part 3 of Norman Sherry's biography on Greene in The Times. What caught my eye was his voracious appetite for sex and having a list of 41 favorite prostitutes. From his novels one gets the impression he encouraged frequenting brothels, as some of his characters usually end up there even if the sex doesn't fulfill them. Many of Greene's novels are imbued with religion and aimed at moral issues facing human beings. His protagonists tend to be childless fathers, lose faith in God and commit suicide to save others (such as God or spouse) from having to make decisions about them. The book's protagonist, major Scobie, is afflicted with excessive feelings of responsibility toward others. He feels pity for everyone he knows at the expense of himself. If you like this book you might want to consider reading \\"The Power and the Glory\\" and \\"The End of the Affair\\", the other two religious-themed novels by the author."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Major Henri Scobie is deputy-commissioner of police in a war-torn state in West Africa. A highly principled officer, he is forced to borrow money to send his despairing wife Louise on a holiday in South Africa. In her absence he falls in love with Helen Rolt, a young widow, and his life is transformed by the experience. With a duty to repay his debts, an inability to distinguish between love, pity and responsibility to others and God, Scobie inexorably moves to his final damnation.The novel pictures a man who realises that despair is the price he has to pay for setting himself an impossible aim: to be just. He soon reaches the point of knowing about his absolute failure and of never being able to reach the heart of the matter. Because of his weakness Scobie is forced to tell so many lies that even for a Catholic like himself it is no longer possible to kneel down at the confessional. He knows that he is desecrating God because he loves another woman. There is no hope anywhere he turns his eyes: the dead figure upon the cross, the plaster Virgin or the religious representations of events which happened so long ago that they no longer seem relevant. Finally Scobie resigns himself to love failure because he can't love success. Even his promotion to commissioner means nothing to him anymore and he feels resigned to death because he isn't resigned to life anymore."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Not only does Greene manage to capture the heat and humidity of Africa with his brilliant writing, but he also tells the heartbreaking story of Scobie and his relationships.

The review that compared this to Shakespeare was on the money...timeless, beautiful and tragic. A great book that hopefully will not be lost behind the politically-correct and shock-value novels of today, in the curriculums of future generations."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Orwell reviewed the &quot;Heart of the Matter&quot; and somewhat trashed it making fun of Greene's perception of Catholic damnation. Orwell taunted Greene saying that his view of Hell was not some horrific Boschian Inferno but more of a Night Club of the damned. However, religous perception's aside, Graham Greene could weave a tale and bring characters to life on the page through dialogue and crystalline detail of the physical world in a way that Orwell never could. THOTM stands out as a great literary achievment for the way it studies the relationship of a Man to his Faith and to Love, not divine love but human love, or in Scobie's case: all too human love. Only Graham Greene can fuse the plot lines of a thriller replete with murder, diamond smuggling, adultry, bureacratic careering in the African sub Sahara with a novel whose central question is conflicted GRACE &amp; FAITH. This novel is truly a study of the human soul of Scobie the police officer whose world is ruptured when his integrity becomes impugned by acts of Love that cause him to lie and commit crimes. Greene pits good against evil and then blurs the boundaries until the world of his fictional landscape is inverted and nothing is as it seems. A masterpiece by a writer who easily courts immortality."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Even for Graham Greene, a fine novelist, &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; is a standout masterpiece. It raises the question of how a good man, surrounded by corruption and undermined by his own weakness, can find the moral righteous course of action. What is compassion when all acts are contingent, when the world is impure, and when aggression and deceit seem to triumph all around?These weighty philosophical questions are carried well by a tightly crafted plot and by compassionately rendered characters. One of the truly noble books out there."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"This is one of the masterpieces of our time and having read it twice confirms that fact. Every true story, said Pappa Hemingway, ends in death. Greene's story is no exception. The things I liked the best were the fully developed and consistent characters, the fast pace, the amazing density, and the logical conclusion which is esthetically pleasing and morally correct. For those of us who write novels this is a textbook of how to carry the story questions and keep the reader interested. The subtle humor also helps. Read it yourself and let me know what you think."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Considered by many critics to be one of the great novels of the twentieth century, The Heart of the Matter is also Greene's most penetrating dissection of his Catholic faith. Greene was a Catholic the way Dostoievsky was a Russian Orthodox Christian: both used belief to slip through the gates of orthodoxy; once inside, they hurled their doubts like bombs, in prose so powerful it shook the very structures they claimed to support.Greene's hero, Henry Scobie, is an honest, if plodding, police superintendent in a malarial British outpost in West Africa. Scobie's primary ambition is to cause no unnecessary suffering, and, in the case of his wife Louise, no additional unhappiness. His fall from grace begins when he borrows money from the morally dubious Yusef because Louise wants to get away to South Africa and an easier life. Once Louise has set sail, Scobie takes up with Helen, a young widow stranded in the colony. When Louise unexpectedly returns, Scobie has to choose between doing the right thing according to Catholic dogma or following his feelings.Scobie has increasing difficulty embracing a god who refuses to let him be passionate (with Helen) and compassionate (to Louise). The choices he makes put him on the Catholic version of the Perdition Express. Unable to give either woman what she really needs, increasingly in Yusef's debt, and, most importantly, bereft of the comforts of his religion, Scobie drifts toward despair on a quickening current.Scobie has only good will toward those he cares for, but, in the Catholic sense, commits the sin of pride. His attempts to resolve the suffering of others usurps god's role. These attempts are doomed to fail because Scobie, unlike god, can't foresee the consequences of his actions. Greene published this book in 1948, at a time when fascism had just been put down at enormous cost and communism was ascendant throughout Eastern Europe. The Heart of the Matter is his response to those who put forward atheistic solutions to human suffering: absent god, human compassion alone is inadequate to heal the wounds we inflict and incur.The book is slow going at times - it's full of knotty interior monologues that are heated arguments with god - but it rewards the effort. The plot is intricately constructed and unfolds with Greene's typical skill and flair. The minor characters are well-drawn. The sweaty, bug-infested coastal setting is palpable in its oppressiveness. And whether or not you buy into Greene's religious outlook, you'll have no difficulty feeling for Scobie, a good man in Africa undone by the wayward promptings of his all-too-human heart.If you like this book, I'd recommend A Burnt Out Case, also set in Africa, and The Power and the Glory, a powerful look at the meaning of faith, often thought to be Greene's greatest work."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Scobie is an honest middle aged Colonial policeman in Africa with an unhappy wife, few friends, no money and little chance of advancement. He and his men, and Wilson--a spy who has fallen in love with Scobie's wife--are trying to break up a diamond smuggling operation in their port city, which is especially busy with the outbreak of World War II.When Scobie's wife decides to go to South Africa &amp; prepare the way for his retirement, he is unable to raise the required cash. Yusef, a Syrian merchant suspected of the diamond smuggling, offers to lend him the money. Scobie recognizes the inherent dangers in such an arrangement but he longs to make his wife happy and so accepts the loan.With his wife gone, Scobie stumbles into an affair with Helen Rolt, a shipwreck survivor. A devout Catholic, Scobie is tormented by guilt over this affair and when his wife writes to inform him of her decision to return, he is faced with an insoluble dilemma. He wants to make both women happy and he wants &quot;peace &amp; solitude&quot; for himself. Compounding his problem, Yusef and Wilson have both found out about the affair &amp; use the knowledge for their own ends.Eventually, and inevitably, Scobie determines that there is only one way out of his predicament.I read some comments by Greene about the book in which he said that the book the critics and public read is not the book he was trying to write. Despite himself, he gave us a terrific book about Scobie's struggles to be a good man and be true to his faith in God.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"The Heart of the Matter provides a wonderful insight into man's weaknesses and foibles. Yet it does so in a way which makes the reader sympathize with, rather than condemn, the main character. Through Scobie, we learn about the dangers of duplicity, and how badly a man can ruin his life, and the life of those close to him, by avoiding the inevitable decisions life forces upon us. We see how quickly a man can lose the reputation he has spent years building.Despite these faults, I found myself sympathetic to Scobie; indeed, I even liked him. In that sense, he is like Updike's Rabbit, Sinclair Lewis' Babbitt, and Richard Ford's Frank Bascomb, all characters the readers can love &quot;warts and all&quot;..Greene also provides a portrait of life in the British Empire's far-flung and forgotten regions. It is a much more sympathetic portrait that the one painted by Orwell in Burmese Days, yet it is still very revealing.

The Heart of the Matter is not a perfect novel. In fact, it is all about imperfection and weakness. It is in many ways an exploration of the many ways in which being human means failure to be perfect. West Africa, with its dampness and insects, is the main character and the others function to illuminate every way in which both good and bad intentions fail to realize their intended consequences.Scobie is an English police officer whose failures are evident in both his career and his marriage.

Although the whole town knows of the affair.But being a good human he loves GOD and could not bear to live a decietful life. He loved his wife and Helen, but could not have either. Ofcourse the event which drives him to the brink is own involvement in murder of Ali, his faithful servant of 15 years. He had no other choise but to escape. In Scobie we see a glimpse of Dr. Plarr of \\"The honorary Consul\\", similar adultery theme."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Graham Greene is usually not commended as a great stylist. But this book defies this pronouncement. There is a subtle, morose desperation that pervades Scobie's life (the protagonist), a British citizen working in Africa as an inspector and law enforcement official with special duties to search ships in port for war contraband. The multi-layered conflicts conspire to render this novel a true work of art, structurally, thematically, and stylistically, which I suppose is what any great book has to have to be great, that is, many superior aspects all working together. Scobie is at war with his own values, with what he is supposed to be and feel as a British citizen, as a Catholic, as a law enforcer, as a representative of an imperial power, and as a man. He fails at coming to terms with the private and public self, and because of this, he suffers. The Heart of the Matter seems drawn from a very deep part of Greene's psyche, and I believe it's his best novel. It is truly amazing that the author of this book also wrote light-hearted, comic novels as well. I don't know whether Greene had in mind the view that this book could be considered the acme of his work, under which all his other work could be subsumed and hence the title. Regardless, after reading it for the fifth time, I keep getting more enjoyment and insights from it."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"I've noticed a theme in Graham's books. His characters seem both to themselves and to us to descend into this dark hole of apostasy, damnation, and doubt over the course of the book, but in the end, one is left with the strange paradoxical feeling that that very descension was somehow the life of faith and love of the Christian. This is part of what makes me love Graham so much, and specifically &quot;Heart of the Matter.&quot; He understands the heart of the believer, and what he tells us - if we are honest - is painful. But there's a comfort in it, if for nothing else that Graham normalizes it for us. Those of who are believers in God, yet who wrestle somewhere between love of him and hatred for him, between faith and doubt, are reminded that perhaps we are not abnormal. That is how I felt reading this book, anyway."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Mr.Scobie seemed perfect when I first read the book,but when I analyzed his character I found that he is too weak.He says that he loves failure but he faces it and he commits suicide.He always chooses weak people and tries to help them.For example, even though he didn't like Helen and Louise he pitied them.Louise he pitied because he had once been in love with her and Helen was a 19-year old widow.He felt responsible for everybody. I think that this is his fault because at the end all these troubles spoil his life."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Vintage Graham Greene, with a police inspector forced to choose between his Catholicism, a wife he endures out of pity and a lover he feels he is hurting.

The religious context is a fixture in Greene books, and this is no exception.Quite a downer, but a worthwhile read"},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Perfect condition. I was really happy with the book, it was a good quality version, nice cover, matching the opne advertised and no marks or bends etc"},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"In Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century \\"The Heart of the Matter\\" is the only Graham Greene book listed. Greene was in good company, with such companions as Golding, Kafka, and Steinbeck. Greene was certainly well prepared to write \\"Heart.\\" In 1935 he and his cousin trekked across Liberia (cf. \\"Journey Without Maps\\"). During WWII, Greene worked for the Secret Service in SIerra Leone. It is not possible to write a great book without describing the environments in which the characters interact. \\"Heart\\" is set in a British colony on Africa's West Coast, with some attention paid to adjacent Vichy French territory. As we move through the book, we learn, for example, about torrid heat, torrential rains, hovering vultures, house rats and wharf rats bigger than rabbits, pesky flying and crawling insects, the transient beauty of the laterite road at sunset, a debased local black population, diamond smuggling, and Syrian (Lebanese?) merchants often of dubious integrity. We learn nothing of native life in the hinterland. Whence the title of the book? On p. 107 of my copy, Major Henry Scobie, a police Deputy Commissioner finds it absurd to contemplate happiness in a world so filled with misery: If one knew the facts, would one have pity even for the planets? If one reached what they called the heart of the matter? \\"Heart\\" is divided into three Books, each with with several Parts. In Book I several of the main characters are introduced. Edward Wilson is a newly arrived accountant, probably really a spy He is plump and has brown dog's eyes, a setter's eyes (GG detested dogs). Louise Scobie is Major Scobie's wife. The two profess love for one another, but it may be merely tolerance. Louise is inclined to books and poetry, much like Wilson with whom a liaison develops. He claims to love here and kisses her during a jaunt to an abandoned railroad station. This liaison proceeds throughout the book. But Louise (\\"Literary Louise\\") to many at the club feels she has to get away from this town, preferably by going to South Africa. Major Scobie's insurance won't pay for the passage, so he has to borrow. at four percent interest, from the Syrian entrepreneur of questionable character, Yosuf. Eventually, almost a friendship between Scobie and Yosuf develops between them. On one occasion, Scobie had to visit a distant hamlet where a young man had hanged himself. The local padre, Father Clay, said murder would have been better than suicide. In Book II, we learn of the arrival of a number of lifeboats from a torpedoed liner. Among the survivors is Mrs. Helen Rolt, a newlywed whose husband hadn't survived. Over the course of the book,Helen evolves from stamp-collecting ingenue to Scobie's mistress, to slut. As mistress, she and Scobie fall in love. But quarrels soon ensue, mainly regarding Henry's relation with Louise, who telegrams she's returning. A woman friend had informed Louise about Helen. A thread that permeates the book is Scobie's doubts about his Catholicism, even his belief in God. Father Rank isn't of much help. Religious and personal conflicts begin to wear Scobie down, and he begins surreptitiously to consider suicide. Being promoted to Commissioner doesn't help. A colleague finds out he has two years to live but reconciles himself to dying happily. Scobie feigns heart trouble. Book III pursues these themes until the final solution. Louise slugs Wilson for referring to Henry as Tiki, her pet name. Wilson continues spying and threatens to ruin Scobie. Scobie obtains a number of Evipan pills from a physician. He begins to horde these and soon has enough to kill himself. He is quickly buried--the diagnosis, angina pectoris. But Wilson finds Scobie's diary. Suicide is evident. Father Rank isn't sympathetic. Scobie is denied even a good Catholic death. Louise bitterly faces an uncertain future. Helen starts bitching around."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"A wonderful book but certainly full of heartache and soul searching. Greene's story doesn't have a lot of 'action' but I found it impossible not to became engrossed in Scobie's life and dilemma. His wrestling with God and his personal demons are intensely portrayed - amazing to see the single act of taking communion become as suspenseful and drama filled as any scene I've read in quite a while"},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Graham Greene made the distinction between what he called his \\"entertainments\\" --books which often took the form of thrillers or light hearted satire--and his novels--works which contained religious, philosophical or political concerns. The Heart of the Matter falls into the latter group and focuses on the theme of one's love for God versus one's love for another person or people. Scobie, a colonial police officer working in West Africa , is weighed by the responsibility and pity he feels toward his wife Louise. These feeelings lead him to compromise himself--and sin--by borrowing money from a morally suspect moneylender, so that she can relocate to a more comfortable life in South Africa. Later, Scobie becomes involved in an affair with Helen, a woman thirty years his junior who has survived forty days in the open-sea and the loss of her husband following the sinking of their ship. Upon his wife's return, Scobie becomes spiritually and psychologically tormented by his commitments to both women. These commitments, again, lead him to even greater professional and spiritual compromises.Many people consider The Heart of the Matter, along with The Power and the Glory, The End of the Affair, The Quiet American, and Brighton Rock, among Graham Greene's greatest acheivements as a writer. However, I've never felt Heart quite equals those other works. There's something missing from the story, a type of cohesiveness, that fails to integrate the first part of the book, which revolves more around Louise, with the later part which deals more with Helen. The pacing, especially during the transition between the two main parts, is slightly off. There also seems to be an occasional conflict between Greene's natural abilities as a storyteller and his desire to explore the theme of love for God versus that of another. Greene's philosophical pursuits are stronger in this book than any other and because of this the story slightly suffers.Taken as a whole The Heart of the Matter is a flawed masterpiece, which contains passages and scenes worthy of a master. But the book also contains occasional mis-steps that distract from the overall beauty of the story. I recommend this book wholeheartedly because it's by Greene, but do not consider it among his very best."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"I just happend to read a few books about the psychology of British Catholics lately by wonderful authors like Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene and found them absolutely disturbing in the most wonderful and thoughtful way. The Heart of the Matter is about deeply rooted sense of responsibility, pity, and despair, through a very complex character--Henry Scobie, \\"the man of goodwill\\", the one with painful awareness of the predicament, \\"point me out the happy man and I will point you out either the extreme egotism or evil--or else an absolute ignorance\\". The spiritual background is familiar to the author and his other books, the Catholic sense of sin and absolution/damnation, and its powerlessness over the reality of human heart that is in turmoil, \\"The Church knows all the rules.

If you buy this edition skip it and read it after you finished the novel."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"What is the \\"heart of the matter\\"? For me, Graham Greene ranks with Faulkner and Conrad in his unsparingly honest, yet empathetic insight into the human heart. And, not that of great men, but of ordinary people who try hard to stay right, not always succeeding, but often failing nobly. The Heart of the Matter is to me Greene's most vivid and memorable foray into this terra incognita. Scobie is noble, flawed and fully realized. The so-called \\"invented\\" world through which he walks is so richly atmospheric that it hardly seems fictional.The plot here is a bit less animated than in some of Greene's other famous novels, but the richness of character and detail keeps you involved. Ultimately, this is a book I will never forget, largely because it gave me the chance to view the world through the eyes of of another human being, which to me is truly the \\"heart of the matter.\\""},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"The Heart of the Matter is not a mystery, a high-octane adventure, nor does it center on an extraordinary event. Rather it is a story of one man whose faith and character is put to the ultimate test. That man is Henry Scobie.Henry Scobie is a British assistant police comissioner stationed in a West African coastal town during World War II. Scobie is a devout catholic who is unhappily married but feels obligated to fulfill his wife Louise's needs and make her happy. An honest man, Scobie has remained faithful to his wife in their fifteen years of marriage and has upheld his duties as an officer of the law. But when Louise decides to get away for a while because she does not like the town they are in, Scobie's beliefs and convictions get challenged and he fails to measure up to the man he thought he was. He winds up falling in love with a nineteen-year old girl and during the affair he feels torn over his desire to be with her yet continue to keep his wife happy and to honor God. At the same time his work also suffers, as he begins to do business with some unscrupulous characters. His good reputation and sense of self-worth deteriorates day by day. Distraught and at the end of his rope, Scobie takes extreme measures to overcome his conflicts and the story wraps up with a shocking conclusion that leaves the reader with plenty to ponder.At times the plot moved slowly, however, Greene did a fabulous job at capturing the ambiguity of the human condition and providing insight into the inner demons that plague us all. Many of Greene's famous quotes came from this book, including my favorite, &quot;Point me out the happy man and I will point you out either egotism, selfishness, evil--or else an absoulute ignorance.&quot; I think William Golding said it best when he stated, &quot;Graham Greene will be read and remembered as the ultimate chronicler of twentieth-century man's consciousness and anxiety.&quot;"},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"The Heart of the Matter, as do many of Greene's novels, considers the questions of faith, good and evil from a Catholic point of view. Greene, a convert to Catholisism himself, imbues the character of Major Scobie with a fierce sense of justice, duty and responsibility. He is alone as an honest man in the less than honest world of the Ivory Coast during the early days of the Second World War. As the assistant comissioner of police, he sifts evidence and weighs the scales of justice carfully, but as with all of Greene's protagonist he suffers from a fatal flaw, his relationships with women.His duty towards a wife he no longer loves forces him into a compromising position with a well know Syrian moneylender in order to fulfill her wish to be sent away from the colony. Falling in love with a newly-widowed woman thirty years his junior and the affair that follows plunges him into further turmoil, worsened by the return of his wife.Throughout, Scobie fails to resolve his love and duty towards the two women. In seeking to place their happiness above his own, and please them both, he damns himself before his maker, and falls ever deeper into the tangle of lies in which he finds himself.Greene's protagonist arouses pathos in the reader, as we watch an essentially good man ground down by conflicting emotions and responsibilities. Simple solutions seem outside Scobie's ken, and no amount of wishing can prevent the end towards which he rushes headlong.If you have never read any of Graham Greene's fantastic novels, may I suggest that you make &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; your first, it won't be your last."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"This is a sad book. We watch the decline of a good man trapped in an impossible spiritual impasse.The book lays out, in lucid prose, all the fine moral lines faced by those with faith. Not only are we treated to the Catholic guilt of Scobie, who commits moral sins out of the need to help others, but we are shown the hypocrisy of his &quot;good&quot; Catholic wife--who follows all the rules but loves no one but herself.Pay special attention to the reactions of all the characters to Scobie's final action. They reveal all the complexity of the issues involved and all the blindness produced by human limitations. A terrific book that will leave you thinking, whether you're religious or not."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"This novel is a brilliant masterpiece which speaks directly to the reader's heart.The writing is of such finesse and the plot so powerful that you won't be able to put down the book until you find out how Major Scobie &quot;resolves his problems&quot; in the end (his problems centre on how to ensure his wife's, his mistress's AND [even] God's happiness even if it means he has to pay the ultimate price for it).The novel will evoke every kinds of feelings in the reader. I know I felt love, tenderness, sadness, sometimes impatience but always PITY for Major Scobie, a deeply religious man who is merciful, responsible and kind towards everyone else but whom nobody really cares about, what more pities. Even though &quot;everyone&quot; claims to love Scobie or to value his friendship, they are actually selfish, ordinary people who have their own hidden agenda (even if they don't realize it) and want something or other from Scobie. All these &quot;demands&quot; weigh the poor man down so badly that in the end, he is driven to commit the final act of damnation so that (or so he thinks) the ones he loves will be free of him and they will no longer be unhappy.It's truly wonderful and fulfilling to read a novel which offers such a great insight into the mind's psychology and the human heart. I've been a fan of Greene's works since I read &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; which I loved dearly.I believe that one doesn't have to be a Catholic to appreciate and understand the novel, despite its heavy references to the religion (eg. about sins, confession, communion, repentence, etc).I can't praise this novel highly enough! Just pick it up! It may even transform some of your views on life (for the better). If not, at the very least it'll transform you instantly into a Graham Greene fan (that is, if you aren't one already)!"},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"&quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; is the story of Major Scobie, a relatively high-ranking policeman struggling vainly for advancement in a small coastal African town. He remains with a wife he doesn't really love out of an extreme sense of duty and loyalty. For those familiar with Greene's &quot;The End of the Affair,&quot; it is almost as though Greene took Henry Miles, the cuckold who remains married to Sarah because it is comfortable, and made him the protagonist of a novel.Scobie, a converted Catholic, seems to take his religious convictions more seriously than his wife, who is more concerned with appearances and the way the socialites in town regard her. In this small coastal town, the attention she pays to her public standing quickly appears as it is, rudely farcical.Trying to separate himself from his wife, Scobie strikes up a tenuous relationship with Yusef, a suspected Syrian smuggler. When she leaves for a vacation, Scobie falls for Helen Rolt, a young widow. Herein, the main action of the novel begins, as Scobie finds himself forced to reconcile his dead love for his wife with his affections for Helen, his career, and his relationship to Yusef, all within the context of his Catholic faith. A truly amazing work. I am convinced that Graham Greene simply did not know how to write a bad novel."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"\\"The Heart of the Matter\\" is the sad story of a man tormented by an inability to live up to the dictates of his religion. Deputy Police Commissioner Scobie begins the book as a rare subject, an English colonial policeman in Africa not on the take. He is cursed, however, with a wife who constantly, if not always overtly, reminds him that the life he has provided for them is beneath her. Louise Scobie is one of those Catholics of the mid-twentieth century that believes things like missing mass on Sunday is a mortal sin, but unfortunately can't bring herself to \\"avoid superbia\\" as the nuns used to admonish schoolchildren in the fifties and sixties. In other words, Louise is a snob. When it's announced that her husband won't be promoted when the commissioner retires she simply can't deal with the shame of it.Most of Scobie's capacity for love died several years earlier at a boarding school in England when their nine-year-old daughter was taken by a sudden illness--the difficulty of communication and the fact of World War II prevented him from even attending the funeral--and the third person narrator notes how he retreated into his job, but \\"[t]he less he needed Louise the more he felt responsible for her happiness.\\" Louise does see Scobie's struggles, even gently accusing him of wishing she were dead. He responds, as he always does, that her happiness is his priority, and promises to find a way to pay for her passage to South Africa, where she'll be able to be with friends and without the ignominy of not being the new commissioner's wife. The only way to find the money is to borrow it from a well known but smooth Syrian crime boss who likes Scobie because he can trust him to be incorruptible.Crossing the proprietary line of borrowing the money flows into crossing the mortal sin line as Scobie takes up with a much younger woman. While he grows to love Helen, whom he meets in a hospital while she recovers from nearly dying in a shipwreck, he cannot love what he sees himself becoming. Scobie's struggles with despair are moving and genuine, even as the reader perhaps wishes Scobie were just a little bit smarter than he is. If he were of course, he wouldn't be Scobie, never able to attain his desired simple life where he can do his job and feel loved and loving, redeemed and free.Greene's narrator is sympathetic and not particularly judgmental. The style is clean and direct and the book is well organized. I won't necessarily rush out and read another book by Greene, as it's time I avoided reminding myself of the Church-inflicted and self-inflicted moral tortures that Catholics put themselves through. He's a fine writer, though, and \\"The Heart of the Matter\\" is a fine book."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"This is the first Graham Greene book that I have read, and it definitely will not be my last. The Heart of the Matter is the tragic story of being the ultimate martyr. Scobie, who is the protagonist, has an overwhelming sense of duty to everyone but himself. Set in a claustrophobic African city Scobie's honesty and sense of justice seems to bring out the worst in everyone else. He is often accused of sleeping with the locals or taking bribes from the Syrians, all of which is not true. His largest responsibilty is his wife, Louise who he feels unhappiness is his own fault and therefore must fix it by sending her to South Africa. In order to do that he has to borrow money from a well known diamond smuggler Yusef. Throw into the mix a jealous letter censor named Wilson who is in love with Louise. Not to mention his lover Helen who has her own needs and demands.Many comparisons are drawn between Scobie and Christ in terms of sacrifice. The only difference is no one asked for Scobie's sacrafices and they provide for his unnecessary demise. While the book is heartbreaking in its failed human relations it is also beautiful and filled with insight into human greed, lust, jealousy and regret."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"I thought this was an incredibly well written story of a man having to come to grasp with his faith and real life issues. Greene was very vivid in his description of the helplessness felt by Scobie, who represents everyman and can be identified today with other people in a dead end job and loveless marriage. While Scobie was flawed, Greene did a fine job of making him to be someone you could feel for, flaws and all. As a Catholic, I could understand the struggles to live one's life in line with Church rules, but I do not have quite the titanic struggle Scobie had. Book was very thought provoking and interesting."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Graham Greene - The Heart of the MatterThis book is a great example of why I enjoy reading novels.For my money Graham Greene is one of the greatest novelists ever to have walked the Earth and one of only a few who actually matters. If you have never read a Graham Greene novel then you are missing out on something special and this would be a good place to begin - but then all of his novels are very good.It's no simple story - although it can be read as one. Scobie is the Deputy Police Commissioner of a West African state during the second world war. He has just been overlooked for promotion but couldn't really care less. His wife Louise, on the other hand, is shamed and having grown tired of the place, wants to spend some time in South Africa. Unable to afford the cost of the journey, the previously incorruptible Scobie borrows money from a local moneylender and well-known local bad guy. Having made one bad choice, Scobie goes one better by beginning a relationship with a much younger woman. From here Scobie's life spirals out of control and as a devout Catholic he quickly becomes overwhelmed by the sins he has committed and he struggles hugely with his intense guilt.Just under the surface of this fascinating story is commentary on themes such as faith, love, the shallowness of human relationships and deceit. Perhaps at the heart of the matter is the fallibility of humans and their relationships with others.Greene's novels linger with you long after you have put them down. They have substance. They have the power to affect and move you and I find myself pondering them long after I have put them down.Green is simply a brilliant story teller and an outstanding author. And this is a tragic, engrossing and moving novel. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"After I read this book, I kept thinking about Scobie and his struggles with his faith or lack of it. When I was reading the novel, I didn't appreciate it as much as I do now. The complexities of his relationship with his wife, his job, and his faith have kept me thinking of different scenarios, things he could have done. Perhaps what I like best about Graham Greene's writing is that he doesn't dictate your feelings. You are free to make your own judgments of the characters. In fact it is very easy to argue one way or another about what the characters believed because he doesn't spell it out for you as if you were a child. By not overwriting the characters there is some mystery, as in real life. Can you ever truly know another person wholly? Also recommended: The End of the Affair by Graham Greene, which is even more complex and mysterious."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"I'm a big fan of Graham Greene's, so you need to know that if you're considering my credibility. That being said, this and The End of the Affair are my favorite novels ever and I am perfectly willing to defend them and/or convert others to the Green Party. The Heart of the Matter is not a perfect novel. In fact, it is all about imperfection and weakness. It is in many ways an exploration of the many ways in which being human means failure to be perfect. West Africa, with its dampness and insects, is the main character and the others function to illuminate every way in which both good and bad intentions fail to realize their intended consequences.Scobie is a pathetic English police officer whose failures are evident in both his career and his marriage. His wife Louise is a shadow of a woman, haunted by a child's death and a foreign country.

Greene captures very accurately what life was like inSierra Leone in 1942. Having lived in Africa (Congo) I identify easilyand readily with the setting, I can picture the trips up country on the bad roads,the houseboys the weather all of it. It is extremely accurate. Also the politics of the government employees; the Syrians (we had Lebanese) is captured beautifully.The bad. I find Greene a little dated in 2013 as far as the romantic angle goes. That a 53 year old man (Scobie) would take his own life because of a mistress and unhappy wife seems unbelievable. Maybe a man in his 20s or 30s...But by 53 most men I know would have Yussef's philosophy... if they (women in his life) don't like it they can leave (but they never do).All in all the book works very well but you can see the brush strokes a little too easily (a broken rosary missing black beads--next to the dead house boy Ali) for it to be a true master piece.Romantic themes are extremely hard to carry off successfully and he does a good job considering the task. It's too bad they have to be a part of novelslet alone core themes that is not what makes this book great.I still give it 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"I ran across this book at a Goodwill store recently.

My copy of this work, whose cover I posted, a brilliant black and white photograph of a tropical deluge in what appears to be a small village, helps convey the conditions that could result in that ultimate despair.Greene is one of the best known and prolific English 20th century authors. The settings for many of his works were impoverished developing countries, as the current euphemism has it. At least some really did develop, like VietnamThe Quiet Americanand MexicoThe Power and the Glory (Penguin Classics). Several are still stagnant, HaitiThe Comedians (Penguin Classics), CubaOur Man in Havana (Penguin Classics)and this one, on West Africa, based on Greene's stay in Sierra Leone.Henry Scobie is the main character, a ranking policeman, among a small British community, during World War II. His wife, Louise, is a devout Catholic (Henry is a convert, and does practice). She is unhappy, and he seeks to send her to a less harsh setting is South Africa. Naturally there is a staple of expat life: philandering, real and potential, in a very tight and incestuous community, as it were. And finances haunt. Bon mots? \\"It's a wonderful excuse being Catholic' she said. \`It doesn't stop you from sleeping with me - it just stops you from marrying me.\\" For a practicing Catholic himself, Greene could take a cynical view of his religion.Closer to the heart of the matter of the human condition: \\"When he was young, he had thought love had something to do with understanding, but with age he knew that no human being understood another.

Being an \\"ex-\\", I found the Catholic themes of guilt, confession, et al., more than a bit tedious, and the submission of one's will and desire to the \\"man of the cloth,\\" frankly, a bit ludicrous for not having been finally resolved.

Cockroaches, rats and diseases abound. The British colony shares a border with a Vichy French (German-allied) colonial country so there is much intrigue about industrial diamond smuggling and the sinking of ships off the coast. This capital city is a melting pot with Africans and British of course (and the n-word is frequently tossed around by the latter over gin), Germans, and Syrian merchants, some of whom are Muslim and some Catholic.Our protagonist is the chief of police. A man devoted to duty, he manages to create a totally loveless, duty-bound relationship with both his wife and mistress. He grows to dread spending time with either one. We watch his gradual and painful descent from stellar civil servant into evil.The Heart of the Matter is a very \\"Catholic\\" novel. UnlikeBrideshead Revisited, also considered a Catholic novel, the discussions of Catholicism aren't incidental to the plot and characters, but very much in the fore. There are discussions of points of Catholic theology with priests, the protagonist's wife and mistress, and religious discussions at cocktail parties as well as the debates that go on in the police chief's mind. But these aren't prolonged discussions; the plot moves and it's quite a fascinating book, suspenseful to the (bitter) end."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"This remains one of the best books I've ever read.

For me, Graham Greene ranks with Faulkner and Conrad in his unsparingly honest, yet empathetic insight into the human heart. And, not that of great men, but of ordinary people who try hard to stay right, not always succeeding, but often failing nobly. The Heart of the Matter is to me Greene's most vivid and memorable foray into this terra incognita. Scobie is noble, flawed and fully realized. The so-called \\"invented\\" world through which he walks is so richly atmospheric that it hardly seems fictional.The plot here is a bit less animated than in some of Greene's other famous novels, but the richness of character and detail keeps you involved. Ultimately, this is a book I will never forget, largely because it gave me the chance to view the world through the eyes of of another human being, which to me is truly the \\"heart of the matter.\\""},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"At one point in the novel Greene's Scobie reflects on the nature of the passion that rules his life: pity, that promiscuous passion that so few realise, a passion more dangerous than love. The novel contains no love stories, but is rather about the quest of one man, a flawed man, to learn how to love rather than pity. Scobie's last words are 'Oh God I love...'. We never discover who or what he loves, but Greene's ambiguous ending ensures, at least, that Scobie loves.This is a novel with deep and often complex themes, but it's style is engaging and accessible, as is typical of Greene. It's setting in West Africa, with all its instability and corruption, provides a backdrop for the struggles that Scobie encounters, with his wife, Louise, with his young lover, Helen, and - most importantly - with himself, his past, his memories. Of course there is also a struggle with his faith, as Greene's best novels always reflect in some way the novelist's own incessant struggle with a difficult and unrelenting faith.It is a rich, yet painful, novel."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Reading this book was like watching paint dry in 100% humidity, only slower.

As a Roman Catholic, he is bound nevertheless to stay with her, and as a respresentative of England in a steamy West African country, he is honor bound to present himself as a happily married man. However there are cracks in the surface, in which doubt and anguish seep through, and it's almost as if a cloud of locusts follow him around as he passes his days in a fever of unknowing. God seems very far away, and the lies that he never used to tell himself come fast and furious now. Can he find grace in the arms of another woman, the fresh, dewy eyed Helen? Upon this dilemma Graham Greene hangs a whole tragedy of misunderstanding and meanness, with deep spiritual implications.I sometimes wonder where Graham Greene drew his inspiration from. When he developed the characters of Louise and Helen, it's almost as if he were thinking of the old madonna-whore syndrome and trying to make it revitalized along with the deeply entrenched conservatism of the Catholic Church.Reading the book today, of course, we are more critical than most readers might have been back then, of Henry Scobie's ambiguous place within black African culture. Greene however sees through this apparent oversight and manages to finish the book with a flourish that will satisfy even the most determinedly post-colonial savant. The only thing that seems unlikely to me is Helen's attraction to a man so much older than herself and who is no sex machine. Dream on, Graham Greene!"},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"The Heart of the Matter tells the story of Scobie - a British Police officer working in West Africa. Green's novel debates, like a lot of his books, the Roman Catholic faith. Scobie has an affair and he feels the only way to escape life's difficulties is suicide, but of course suicide would mean eternal damnation. I disliked this book. I became a Graham Green fan after reading Brighton Rock and I felt this book looked interesting. I was mistaken. This was plot-wise almost deadening. As always Green's characterisations are fabulous. Scobie, his wife and Wilson are all fully developed and fully believable characters but they're not very interesting! The plot is pretentious. It is a simple short story plot dragged out to a novel's length.

One character says to the other, \\"This story is dull.\\" I couldn't help but chuckle that the characters in this story could put Greene's story in such an accurate choice of words.The Heart of the Matter does have some good insights about the depth of a man's soul, and near the end of the story we finally get some insight into this man's character, but that, unfortunatley, is short lived. There is some good ideas of man's guilt about religion and his relationship to God here, if only Greene could have figured out a better way to tie it all together.The main problem with Greene's novel is that while you are reading it, you don't actually care about any of the cold, one dimentional characters portrayed here, with the exception of Scobie. The story takes forever to get going, and once it finally gets some steam to it, we are cheated by an over the top ending. The ending made this novel worse, in my opinion. It is not that I don't enjoy dark novels or twisted endings. In fact, some of the darkest novels are my most favorite. In those novels, however, I acutally cared about what happended in the end. This is one of the most overrated classics I have ever read.

This is the story of Henry Scobie, a quite unremarkable character. Every element of his life is in some way shaped by his earliest teachings by the Roman Catholic Church. He finds himself conflicted between the love of his mind and the love of his heart. The struggle he faces, influenced to significant degree by his faith, leads to his sense of justice. While many-a-quote comes from this brilliant novel, the one that I treasure the most comes as Scobie loses his necklace, and Greene describes it as the Saint, whose name nobody could remember. Might Scobie have been not of the lowest of spiritual development, but, perhaps, meriting martyrdom? I first read this novel in high school and, 30 years later, when provided the opportunity to pick up on my reading, I chose this as one of the first books. There are moments when the reading is quite slow and nearly as boring as Joseph Conrad (sorry, but it's true in my world). The narrative, development of Scobie's character, and plot are all masterful, making this one of the finer novels that I've read. I give this an A+ and I highly recommend reading this to anyone with an interest in spiritual development. The Power and The Glory is another Greene novel in this genre, almost as good as this."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"In his inimmitable manner Graham Green has shown in this distinctly humanist novel why the dictates of heart that recognizes life as the supreme should ultimately be valued. Religion has not been rejected but in a way rather integrated to an idea of life but it extracts its price for life to claim its own place. Major Scobie didn't know that the love that never existed between him and Louise would not be honoured even by mistake after his death. He was mistaken to assume that he was setting Helen free from the sin and trouble of their love by his death. Everything remains the same vindicating Heart and even religion at the end! What a grand story telling, excellent plot and unfolding of thoughts!"},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Surely, this book is about suicide. Supposedly, Graham Greene was bi-polar, but we only see the \\"plus\\" side, I think, in his writing. He always seems so calm and even tempered, while the rest of the world goes maddeningly by at breakneck speed, truly insane and without an once of reasonableness. For example, his wonderful wife suddenly deciding she wants to live in South Africa without him and then just as suddenly returning.Being a Catholic writer, he writes about so many moral issues. This is about the issue of suicide. And I believe his point is that the Catholic Church is morally wrong in condemning suicide, since as he says so poignantly, surely God would pity such a person, having going through the tortures of Hell to commit suicide.One other thing in this work, which I believe is so important in the story line, but which no one else seems to mention, is the death of their 9 year old daughter in England while the protagonist is stationed in Africa. The death of a child is by far the worst experience for a human being and I think is the millstone around our hero's neck and cause of his final demise at his own hands."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"I read this book while traveling in Africa.

The location is exotic, not appealing, but exotic; most of the characters are convincing, not likeable, but convincing. Scobie's wife is a pill, but Scobie's not even good enough for her. Mrs Rolt is a sad case even in this company, and Yusef is perfectly drawn - an absurd crook.Well before the end, one realizes that it's all one long bout of a man feeling sorry for himself, resenting his religion and fighting with himself over it. He goes from one misstep to the next, and we're never once surprised to see him do it. He's a most unattractive combination of narcissism and paranoia. Worse still, he's right to be paranoid; some of those he suspects of being out to get him really are out to get him. One feels sorry for him but only for as long as it takes to become fed up with him. But it is a page turner, so one reluctantly reads on. Mrs. Scobie reveals a bit of ingenuity at the very end, but it's too late by then to think much more of her than one has all along.Somerset Maugham isn't as highly thought of as Graham Green, but Maugham would have taken the same characters in the same place and situation and made a much more interesting story out of it.Did I mention that it's depressing?"},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Greene is an intimidatingly good writer. A lot of the truly classic authors carry with them a certain mystique, arriving with all their major plot details spoiled, a fancy edition with an introduction by someone else. Not that all such literary classics are great, or even good (see the next review) but this type of reputation more often than not indicates a strong accomplishment. Greene is an author of that stature, but I first encountered him as a more casual, as if less celebrated author, and to an extent that still comes through in the book editions I get, the lack of major literary discussion on him I come across, and even the name. \\"Greene\\", really? Is that the name of a literary giant?Greene is the name of a literary giant. He's one of the best, and The Heart of the Matter is very much up to form. The pace works to deliver the core struggles of the character through the plot to the reader, at a certain point in analysis looking for something as a plot-element or a character-revealing element breaks down. I didn't enjoy this quite as much as The Comedians or the Human Factor, but it's an impressive work by any light.Ultimately this book is an account of a man who commits adultery and then suicide, believing throughout that both actions damn his soul to an eternal hell. I'm quite a few degrees away from supporting a belief in adultery, suicide or damnation, yet I still found it a very moving story, one that benefits from rendering an alien form of thought as utterly credible to me. At times a good mainstream author can offer a more complex world-building experience than a lot of science fiction ones, here it brings home how strange and complex our fellow humans can be. There's always another narrative. This is something that all good writers have to tackle to some extent, but it emerges with particular force in Greene. In part this particular scenario probably benefits from Greene's own religious philosophy, but he's able to take the commitment very seriously. Scobie deals with his situation in some very destructive ways, but he retains his own viewpoint and set of justifications, and when his mistress claims he couldn't believe in damnation for his adultery, or his wife claims he couldn't have committed suicide, they're both wrong, and wrong in a manner that shows a crucial failure of imagination. Greene's accomplishment isn't merely that he represents Scobie as a highly sympathetic and moral man, but that he shows him to be as complex and self-regarding as any other, despite the intrinsic contradictions built into his final actions.Though as I said, not entirely in his best. One defect with worldbuilding--using again a science fiction staple for this non-SF book, which seems consistently appropriate--here is not giving enough focus on the colonial scope. The book takes place in WWII British West Africa, and there's some very good scenes on the racial bias issues inherent to that situation, but the whole thing doesn't go nearly far enough for me, doesn't engage with the real ugliness and ambivalent passions promoted by this issue, in the way Orwell renders so well. Instead Scobie comes across as largely calm and unaffected by this issue, and there's a lot of untapped potential here. Still, this book is by my standards a masterpiece.Reminded me of and was better than: Flaubert's Madame BovaryReminded me of and was worse than: Coetzee's Disgrace"},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"I am a fan of Graham Greene's work and I read this because I was currently going through the books on Time's 100 best novels list.

I prefer Greene's non-\\"Catholic\\" novels and the Catholicism in this one just seems too over the top. The protagonist just doesn't seem to add up. Setting the novel in West Africa does nothing for the plot or atmosphere of the book. It could have taken place in any generic setting.

Foremost is the perfectly presented portrait of a marriage that has turned into a lie for both Henry Scobie, the honest policeman of this coastal town, and his \\"literary\\" wife, Louise, who has become the object of pity and contempt for all the frustrated local British \\"club\\" members who constantly mind one another's business. Scobie no longer loves his wife but can't bring himself to hurting her. He simply pities her. And Louise no longer loves Henry and wants desperately to escape from West Africa, especially when she finds out that her \\"Ticki\\" has been passed up for promotion to Commissioner. The atmosphere becomes dark and twisted as a young man, Wilson, appears on the scene and, in his youthful stupidity, falls in love with Louise while he conducts secret investigations on British authorities suspected of aiding in the smuggling of industrial diamonds through Africa to Germany. Scobie is one of those suspects. A marvelously film noir portrait of a corrupt Syrian merchant, Yusef, is thrown into the mix. I can see Sidney Greenstreet doing this part to perfection in a screen adaptation. Add jealousy, desperation, a contrast of honesty and lies, sex, and the tortured feelings of a deeply religious man and you have most of what this novel contains. O yes, and then, as always, there's the brilliant writing of Graham Greene, his wonderful metaphors, crystal clear descriptions, and fantastic insights into the crabbed and self-defeating thought processes of his characters. All this equals a modern classic. My only complaint is a bit of redundancy and pedantry regarding Catholicism, a religion I cannot stomach anymore, and my personal disbelief that someone like Scobie can take Catholicism so seriously. But this is my own thing.

Scobie is an upstanding British policeman stationed somewhere in Africa (Sierra Leone?). There he resides with his wife Louise, a spoiled, soul-sucking dilettante. She proves to be a great foil for Scobie, who is revealed to be an insufferable milksop. It seems that the reason he is with Louise mostly has to do with his ardent Catholicism (see: masochism) and her uncanny ability to make his life abjectly miserable. Due mostly to his unflinching honesty in a world of corruption, Scobie has been passed over for a promotion that was deservedly his. Through a seemingly providential series of events, Scobie has his millstone of a wife shipped off and subsequently meets a young shipwreck survivor (think Lolita meets Heart of Darkness). For once in his cowardly life, Major Scobie allows himself to actually be happy and, for a brief period, finds solace in the arms of his new concubine. Alas, good things are not meant to last. Partly due to his own self-destructive tendencies and partly due to the machinations of the socially inept 'Wilson'(a sweaty poet/pervert who has designs on Louise), Scobie's world comes crashing down. He becomes indebted to Yusef, the Syrian black marketeer with a heart of gold, his wife suddenly decides to return, and he agonizes over cannabalizing his lord while not in a state of grace (see: transubstantiation). Greene introduces, unintentionally I think, his comic stylings into the latter part of the book. Scobie comes to regret the one honest thing he has done in his life and quickly destroys himself and everyone he holds dear. That is to say, he loses what little dignity he had and the reader can allow his/her self a quiet chuckle as his sorry excuse for a life comes crashing down.

The weather is hot and clammy, there is always a rat scampering around their house, they have to sleep under mosquito netting, and he has occasional bouts of malaria. As the story opens, he has just been overlooked for a promotion. But he really doesn't care.

But a few weeks after reading the book, I now think I know. The main character, Scobie, is confused when his life is turned upside down by events that seem to be beyond his control - his sincere desire to make his wife happy, and the sincere comfort he finds in his relationship with another woman. This emotional dilemma crosses over into his professional life, where he finds his obligation to duty overcome by his desire to cover-up the confusion he finds in his personal life. He has no problem with sincerity, except that he has too much of it. Thus, the title, &quot;The Heart of the Matter,&quot; seems to represent the violent collision of desire and duty that ultimately leads Scobie to take extraordinary measures.Greene's performance in writing this work is stunning, as it is in many of his other novels. (I would compare &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; to &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; and &quot;The Quiet American,&quot; both very powerful novels.)

Another element of its greatness is the writing.

In that simple sentence, Graham Greene captures the essence of human relationships and the kernel of his brilliant novel, THE HEART OF THE MATTER, as well as foreshadowing a host of events to follow. Not a half-page later, Greene describes his protagonist Scobie's own feelings, \\"He felt...the dreariness of a man who tries to write an important letter on a damp sheet and finds the characters blur.\\"The West Coast of Africa, Joseph Conrad's literal \\"heart of darkness,\\" becomes for Graham Greene the landscape of hopelessness and despair, of lies compounded by deceit and murder. His hero, Henry Scobie, is a good man, fair and just in his handling of police matters and dealing with the ethnic carnival of Africans, Syrians, and assorted Britishers who surround him. Everyone in town knows Scobie is the only honest man thereabout. Yet it is his very honesty and desire to avoid pain in others, to manage their happiness, which causes people to despise him and his every action to backfire. He consistently confuses pity and love, living as a failed father, an adulterous husband, and a failed Catholic, a man without friends and ultimately without a God. Scobie himself ultimately recognizes that his every action, no more how well intended, results in the infliction of emotional if not physical pain on others, culminating in a tragic murder for which he was responsible even though he himself did not commit the act.Graham Greene's coastal port is an Hieronymous Bosch setting, filled with human debris: the afflicted, the pettily pretentious, and the failed, with schemers and thieves and liars and murderers, and with those whose daily task is to convince themselves they matter for anything. Greene surrounds them with a hostile and unforgiving natural world, prone to torturous heat and endless rains and populated with all manner of symbolic death - fevers, diseases, suicides, vultures, cockroaches, lizards, ants, and mongrels. Even the streets of the town \\"stretched out on either side like the arms of a skeleton.\\" Into this oppressive stew of decay he places his protagonist. Henry Scobie is a Christ figure whose forty days in the desert is passed in an incessant rainy season instead, who suffers (and succumbs) to the temptations of Satan (in the form of Helen Rolt and the Syrian, Yusef, who insists he only wants to be Scobie's friend), who questions his faith and doubts His Father's love. In the end, Scobie feels just as forsaken as Jesus on the cross. Only their resolution is different. Then again, perhaps not so different as they might seem, since Scobie justifies his climactic actions on their power to save those about whom he cared.Yet in the end, despite all the secret messages and smuggled diamonds and human betrayals, THE HEART OF THE MATTER is a novel about one man's struggle with his Catholic faith. References to religion and religious belief permeate this book, with Scobie in particular struggling constantly to reconcile the demands of his faith with his desire to protect others. For Greene's hero, Catholicism offers nothing but impossible paradoxes. Catholics know the truth, in Scobie's estimation, and are therefore damned by their knowledge. \\"How often, he thought, lack of faith [in the form of Helen Rolt] helps one to see more clearly than faith.\\" Scobie is too honest to confess behaviors he know he will repeat, yet he would rather commit mortal sin than hurt his wife Louise by admitting the truth of his adultery. \\"It's never good lying to oneself,\\" Scobie tells Yusef. \\"One sees through the lie too easily.\\" Finally, Scobie chooses escape and eternal damnation over confronting the mess he himself has made, ironically (for a policeman) failing miserably at what he conceived would be the perfect, face-saving crime. Heroic in his own confused mind, Scobie turns out to be as failed in life as he was in his faith. On yet another level, Scobie's tragicomic inabilities to discover the truth in his police cases or provide for the happiness of those around him offer metaphorical commentary on British (and all Western) colonial imperialism - inevitable unhappiness, harm, and even death despite the best of intentions. As Scobie himself notes, \\"no human being can really understand another, and no one can arrange another's happiness.\\"Greene's writing is masterful, creating a strong sense of place filled with a memorable supporting cast - the deviously slimy Wilson, the ineffectual Catholic priest Father Rank, the outlandishly pathetic Harris and Bagster, the dubious Yusef, the social climbing Louise, Scobie's inscrutable \\"boy\\" Ali, and of course, the widowed nineteen-year-old Helen Rolt, the obscure object of Scobie's love/pity. He creates indelible images with extraordinary economy: \\"His hilarity was like a scream from a crevasse,\\" or \\"her face went out like a candle in a sudden draught of wind.\\" Published in 1948, THE HEART OF THE MATTER remains thought provoking and relevant to this day and belongs on the \\"must read\\" list of all serious readers."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Graham Greene is one of the most entertaining writers I have ever read. So why is it that among my favorite of his books ranks this sodden and eventless wreck?Because the smallness of the events is major; the insight into the mind and the problems therein is revelationary and the pain and confusion of the characters is truly affecting. Nobody is bad in this book; evil comes in a far more natural and random way and the only problems people cause is by talking or drinking just a little too much. Of course the world is a mess: the stirrings of war in Europe and the constant pressures of society that demands you give your life to someone else's order. Scobie is an honest and loyal man, one of the faceless ambassadors most people have forgotten about, and he lives his life in exhausted comfort with a nagging wife he'd long ago lost affection for. When the exotic romance of a rescue gives him a moment of glory all of his buried ambition rebells against the tightly ordered character he had imposed upon himself. Add to the fact that as a born-again Catholic he is still very passionate about prayer and the literalness of The Word.Things go quitely wrong and then we close our eyes and feel for the tragedy of such wayward and innocent people."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Comment - Get rid of the first review!

To be genuine with what we do, and to be courageous no matter who and what we face...A real classic to be read and reflected upon..."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Oh the moral dilemmas brought to bear in this most compelling of novels. Brilliant, simply brilliant."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Just like in Graham Greene's \`The End of the Affair' --and in many of his books-- God plays a crucial role in his \`The Heart of the Matter'. It is because of Him that the novel's protagonist Scobie ends up taking drastic --and tragic-- decisions.\`Heart' is set in a West African state, where a British man called Scobie lives with his wife and some other foreigner, while the War is consuming the world. He is a police officer who is very honest, competent and has no ambitions in his career --to his wife's disappointment. Louise Scobie, the wife, gets shocked when she learns that he was passed over for promotion. She feels that the most important people in local society --i.e. the English ones-- don't like them, and she spends most of time trying to be their close friend. When she's tired of that place she decides to move to South African, leaving her husband alone. But for her travel, he is forced to borrow money from a Syrian criminal, who likes Scobie because he is incorruptible. Or so he thought.Not long after his wife leaves, Scobie meets the young, beautiful and widower Helen. He falls in love with her, and that's when his downward spiral begins. He is tangled in a web of lies and has to deceive and betray his wife, friends and department. But, what makes matter worse is that he is a very religious man, and to God's eyes he is committing a huge sin, and this is what most consumes Scobie.At a certain point, discussing with friends the idea of hell, Scobie states that he doesn't believe that hell is a place full of flames, but the sense of loss. And this shows how Scobie is sent to hell --in life! -- when starts losing everything --even his dignity. The devotion to God -- or so believes Scobie-- has a main role in this point of his life, and he is a torn man, fighting against what he wants, because he thinks it is wrong.Greene is a master storyteller, and is able to create very believable characters and situations. He once stated that he believed Scobie to be a little far fetched, but even if it is true, the character serves well to a specific purpose. The language is very elaborated without being difficult or boring, it only enhances the reading of such a great novel."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"This is another masterly novel from Greene. The setting is some African country and one really gets the feeling of a swamp which the civilised people from England slowly, but surely, sinks down into. The main character of this novel seems to be the setting."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"What is the \\"heart of the matter\\"? For me, Graham Greene ranks with Faulkner and Conrad in his unsparingly honest, yet empathetic insight into the human heart. And, not that of great men, but of ordinary people who try hard to stay right, not always succeeding, but often failing nobly. The Heart of the Matter is to me Greene's most vivid and memorable foray into this terra incognita. Scobie is noble, flawed and fully realized. The so-called \\"invented\\" world through which he walks is so richly atmospheric that it hardly seems fictional.The plot here is a bit less animated than in some of Greene's other famous novels, but the richness of character and detail keeps you involved. Ultimately, this is a book I will never forget, largely because it gave me the chance to view the world through the eyes of of another human being, which to me is truly the \\"heart of the matter.\\""},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"In this, one of Graham Greene's so-called \\"Catholic\\" novels, one of the few semi-sympathetic characters, Father Rank, states that is it better to confess just once after multiple sins than to commit a single sin but never repent. That may be true according to Catholic doctrine, but Father Rank forgets to inform Scobie, Greene's protagonist, about the fine print: committing mounting, multiple sins as the result of deceit and rationalization comes at a very high cost.The flip side of Creation, of course, is Free Will, and Scobie proves that it cannot be exercised with abandon. Eventually, if one Believes, one must make palpable choices rooted in that faith, rather than hide behind a series of self-deceptions, even if pain to self is a consequence. Scobie's endless self-delusion (Helen \\"needs\\" me; my wife would be better without me; ad nauseum) only delays the day of reckoning when he must take some sort of principled stand, but the delay raises the stakes as the ever-cautious detective fails to fully commit - to God, to his wife, to his mistress, even to his job.With his one final act, and one built upon a carefully constructed deception that trumps all prior artifice, Scobie ironically turns his back on a basic tenet of Church teaching in a feeble attempt (he suggests to himself) to do the least damage to others. What he may have seen as the noblest of actions barely causes a ripple with those he leaves behind, except for the one he cared for the most, who is hurt the most.After a labored opening and some very overt melodrama, but also some finely-turned phrases and well-crafted character development (the oily, sycophantic Yusef and the mouse-like yet truly repugnant Wilson are beautifully drawn), Greene seems to be saying that in an unfair, imperfect world of Original Sin, each of us must make choices - sometimes harrowing choices - if we are to come closer to pursuing a life of integrity. While God may be infinitely patient with us, we cannot refuse to embrace hard decisions, even those that could have life-shattering ramifications. After all, that is why He gave us Free Will in the first place."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Graham Greene is one of those writers (I'll put Maugham and Conrrad and Stevenson and Wilder in this category--but there could be long lists) whose style is beautifully honed and whose characterization, plot and dialogue are like the best of lyrics. Our protagonist Scobie is faced with strata of personal, moral, religious conflicts. And although set in a Port in Africa during WWII, there are no shoot outs, air attacks, or battle scenes. The Heart of the Matter is an excellent book because it is excellent for the same reason any great book is. It has a number of superb qualities that weave themselves into a coherent work of art. The book is a mediation and meditation on facing the conflicts of various social and religious values one tries to adhere to and what happens when one finds oneself unable to do so. Unlike most contemporary storytelling, though, the unraveling is slow and methodical. If you think there is something amiss with the qualities of contemporary best sellers or equate the level of the novelistic art today with the same level as Muzac, read some good writing. It may encourage you to read more. You may very well start a movement--and a noble one at that."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"For the well-prepared reader, the story is outstanding. \\"The Heart of the Matter\\" is autobiographical, covering Graham Greene's time in Her Majesty's Secret Service in Africa in WWII (where by the way he was brought back to London due to less than stellar work in Africa / interpersonal relationship issues).

So Graham Greene wrote in 1980, three decades after his publication of 'The Heart of the Matter.' Ever a tough self-critic, the novel has been far better received by scholars and audiences than Greene himself. This widespread success has helped to establish Greene as one of the twentieth century's leading British novelists and, with figures such as Evelyn Waugh, Paul Claudel, and Franois Mauriac, as one of the greatest Roman Catholic writers in modern history.First published in 1948, 'The Heart of the Matter' was inspired by Greene's life as a British intelligence officer in Sierra Leone during the Second World War. Greene, mixing his Catholic background with immense skills in fiction, journalism, and travel writing, penned a social drama that is arguably the best of his career. It earned the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, Britain's version of the Pulitzer, in its first impression and reached Time Magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.Taking place in a Sierra Leone township during wartime, Greene draws vividly from his experiences as an MI6 official and the well-known irregularities of his love life. He immerses us with the novel's opening pages into a hot, humid, and malaria-ridden territory of coastal British Africa; the sweat on one's arms, the constant feeling of being watched, and the sound of vultures clopping on tin roofs predominate this scene. The locals of Sierra Leone - those of the Black underclass - are illiterate, often born out of wedlock, and fill roles comparable to slavery.Against this musty backdrop, Greene paints his characters with a simple, journalistic flair. The focal point is Henry Scobie, a deputy commissioner who is next in line to head the colony's police department. Scobie and his wife Louise are devout Catholics who seem out of place in their African surroundings: Scobie, while regarded as an honest and efficient officer, is distrusted by his colleagues for being too above-board. Louise is an aloof and opportunistic woman who has little in common with her husband, including a thirst for social advancement and a love of poetry. Yet their relationship endures in this bleak setting; marriage has once again become a 'habit,' as Greene so often laments.Scobie's main asset - a sympathy for those around him - is also his most glaring weakness. Consumed by a police state where unhappiness reigns, Scobie damages his integrity by taking loans from Yusef, a Syrian gem trafficker, in order to send Louise on a costly relocation to South Africa. While Louise is away, he falls in love with Helen Rolt, a young woman who managed to survive days at sea following a boating accident that killed her just-married husband. Scobie discovers his faith as a Catholic, the one power he can turn to, unraveling in this chaos while at the same time galvanizing his link with the divine. This happens while a London spy named Wilson, who holds childish feelings for Louise, keeps a watchful eye and happily reports to his superiors.'The Heart of the Matter,' written at the peak of Greene's literary abilities, is a novel with superb emotional depth and range. Much of the story takes place as an interior monologue that follows Scobie's ensuing crises in love, faith, and the will to live. While firmly rooted in Greene's Catholic outlook, the novel extends beyond his faith and deals with universal concepts of self-respect, compassion, and decency: how can one maintain his truthfulness, Greene asks, in a world of lies and deceit? Should we really have intolerance for deceit when the world appears so rotten? And is total understanding between human beings possible when compared to the definiteness of a man's spirituality?Compared to earlier novels such as 'England Made Me' and 'Brighton Rock,' 'The Heart of the Matter' has better-developed characters, a more cohesive plot, and solid narration. Greene still falls into an overuse of simile and certain events don't happen with a feeling of the inevitable, but 'Matter' still ranks as one of the best-written novels in twentieth century literature and holds a deserving place in Green's 'Catholic' cycle of novels that secured his legacy.'The Heart of the Matter' is a frequently-printed novel that can be acquired in used copies on the Internet. Used for this review was the 1960 printing by Compass Books (C70, 306 pages), a subsidiary of The Viking Press. More recent editions have appeared from Penguin Books and Vintage Classics. The novel is an absolute must for Greene fans and highly recommended for all serious readers."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Graham Greene does something in The Heart of the Matter which is extremely difficult to do: he depicts the inner turmoil and emotional breakdown of a human being in a non-pretentious, non-self-conscious, completely BELIEVABLE way.So many other allegedly great authors have tried to do the same thing, with very few successes. Most often you get turgid \\"prose\\" which reeks of pseudo-intellectual showboating, turning the character in question from a flesh-and-blood entity into a cipher, which leads to a predictable conclusion that you could not care less about.Greene avoids that lot and achieves true profundity. I was impressed almost in spite of myself, because I previously did not conceive of him as a front-ranker, and I have no truck with religious mores. I still don't think he is an all-time genius, but I DO think that there was something beyond sheer erudition and assiduity to the man...something which the gods either confer or don't.The MLA asserts that The Heart of the Matter is the 40th best novel of the 20th century, which underrates it...at least compared to some of the books--e.g., Henderson, the Rain King; To The Lighthouse--which are ranked higher. But enough time wasted on the MLA...The novel starts off slowly, almost prosaically--you may think to yourself \\"What's the fuss?\\" for a hundred pages. But then comes the moment when the protagonist, Scobie, comforts a dying girl in two outstanding paragraphs...and from that point the book shifts into high gear.Things begin to happen abruptly, but not in a manipulative, writer's-construct way--they have the patina of real life, where sometimes years of equilibrium are disturbed by life-altering events which occur in rapid succession. (Greene--mirroring life, perhaps--does leave a few loose ends.) I am as keenly attuned to factitiousness as a hog to truffles, but I never caught a whiff of artifice.Aw, Christ, just read it."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"The setting for Greene's novel, although never named, is Sierra Leone, where the author himself spent some time as an intelligence officer. But law enforcement, subterfuge, and colonialism serve as mere (if occasionally satiric) sideshows for the crisis of faith of one well-meaning, upright policeman, Scobie, whose fatal flaw is a sometimes-misguided sympathy for those closest to him.Even Scobie's troubled relationship with his wife is described early on as one in which \\"pity and responsibility reached the intensity of a passion,\\" hardly the emotions on which an untroubled marriage can be based. Both marital duty and a sense of guilt prompt the first of his many offenses; to allow her an extended vacation away from the colony, an extravagance they can't afford, he must compromise his integrity. Then, while his wife is away, \\"pity and responsibility\\" in no small part lead Scobie to fall in love with a woman rescued from a shipwreck. In Scobie's confused mind, adultery seems equally an act of selfless compassion and an act of selfish passion. And the series of lies required to maintain this relationship rapidly turns the path he has chosen into a maze he can't escape.And into the maze he goes, at the center of which is damnation. To many non-Catholics, Scobie's decline might seem the result not only of real sins (bribery, adultery) but also of the trappings of seemingly arbitrary rules that rely more on religious dogma than on a universal morality--for example, taking Communion in a state of \\"sin,\\" a violation presented as if it were one of the worst breaches Scobie could commit. While this \\"mortal\\" sin is only one of several steps in his apostasy, his subsequent angst is depicted in legalistic terms rather than moral ones. The walls of the maze are constructed as much by the rules of his faith (and the corresponding damage to his own peace of mind) as by acts that genuinely hurt others.What saves this discussion from a doctrinal parochialism is the fact that Greene himself seems unsure of the relative value of faith (an individual matter) and of charity (the desire to do well to others). Scobie's slide down the slippery slope is a series of actions that, in no small part, are well meaning--his first crime, burning a contraband personal letter written in German, which might or might not contain secret code, is certainly meant as an act of kindness to a fellow Catholic. His sins and their consequences can't hide the heart of the matter: Scobie is a good man. There's more than a little mockery when Father Rank says, \\"The Church knows all the rules. But it doesn't know what goes on in a single human heart.\\" The real question, Greene seems to be asking: who are we to judge?Finally, the reader is well advised to avoid the so-called \\"introduction\\" by James Wood in the Penguin Centennial edition of this novel; Wood's spoiler-filled summary of the plot, its various twists, and the book's ending are so thorough as to make reading Greene's text itself beside the point."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"First off, I'm not a huge Graham Greene fan. I can appreciate him, but I don't necessarily always enjoy him. I recognize that his reputation as one of the great men of 20th-century English letters is a well deserved one. But I don't love his stuff. I'm not sure why, but it just doesn't ring my bell.But The Heart of the Matter is the exception for me. I won't claim that this novel is somehow remarkably different from his other stuff. It's vintage Graham Greene, that's for sure. It's slow and methodical, well crafted, building up patiently to a subtle yet powerful crescendo. Like The End of the Affair, and every other one of his books that I've read, it has a tragic ending that somehow you see coming even in the opening pages. And yet you don't end up with that not-so-satisfied feeling of a bad detective novel that gives too many clues too early on. Because you anticipate the tragedy from the beginning, you feel the characters' pain all the way through. And it still hurts in the end, even though by that point you have long since come to accept it as a fait accompli.I think the reason I'm not wild about Graham Greene is because sometimes I feel like I really need to work to get the most out of him. He is the undisputed master of understatement. And because of that, you really need to pay attention or you just might miss something. I made the mistake of devoting less than 100% of my attention to a key passage, and found myself missing a crucial turn in the plot. With Graham Greene, the big stuff doesn't need fireworks and a spotlight to draw attention to it. In fact, the big stuff grows in size and importance the more he under-emphasizes it. I think there's something very British in all of this. Sex, infidelity, violence, death... they all take place off screen, and that fact gives them a greater importance than if they were laid out graphically for us to see.Has there been a movie made out of this book yet? I think it could be adapted well for the screen. It would lend itself well to that artsy, period-piece feel that came through so well in The End of the Affair."},{"Title":"The heart of the matter (Heron books)","review":"Were I to recommend a novel by Greene on his politics alone, I would recommend _The Quiet American_, or the _Human Factor_. This is a novel apparently very removed from Greene's later concerns- a Pascalian set piece, very akin to various pieces produced by Catholic novelists with a taste from Jansenism during the 1930s and 1940s (viz. the Brazilians Octavio de Faria and Lucio Cardoso) about the futility of Man searching salvation on the strenghth of one's good works and about the paramountacy of God's Grace that can save one in the last minute of one's life. But then there's is something in the feeling of alienation that Greene conveys in this novel that transcends his strictly Catholic concerns - an urge to make sense, to overcome the feeling of general meaningless, that makes his novel enjoyable and worthy of a recommendation for the more \\"general\\" public- and that perhaps explains the sharp turn made by Greene in the 1950s."},{"Title":"The Protocol","review":"I just have to strengthen the views of others--don't waste your time with this book!

Hauck tells the fascinating story of a small railroad in Southwestern Ohio.The railroad was founded in 1888 as a local narrow gauge railroad built to supply rail service to the highlands in between the Little Miami and Great Miami river. It never becomes overly profitable, it never has a huge amount of traffic or becomes a part of a huge rail corridor, and it eventually is broken up and abandoned. It is this plain, mundane atmosphere that makes the story so interesting. This is not just the story of one road but can represent the story of hundreds of little railroads all over the country.Hauck tells this story against the backdrop of the wider Midwest narrow gauge movement. He claims as a thesis the inefficiency of this concept. Cheaper construction costs for the narrow track did not make up for the shortcomings of the gauge. He spends the first half of the book discussing the CL&N;'s narrow gauge operations as well as its integration in the Toledo, Delphos, and Burlington system. This is one of the few books that does discuss the TD&B; or the \\"Little Giant\\" and its narrow gauge empire.Along the way the author gives the reader unprecedented detail. The CL&N; was near a century old at the time of publication and for a railroad that old the amount of information presented is outstanding. Documents, maps, and even pictures of old roadbeds all point to a well-researched manuscript. Hauck also goes one step farther, interviewing older residents who road on the passenger trains in the 20's and 30's. These interviews manifest themselves as interesting antidotes and side stories that would be missed otherwise. They bring out more of the human side of rail travel and just how different these railroads were than the ones of today.If there is one flaw with this work it is the omission of any footnotes or bibliography. Hauck claims it would be too difficult to record every interview and document he researched as a source, but even a partial list would have been helpful. Anyone wishing to do further research on this railroad will be limited to this dead-end secondary source.Never-the-less, the usefulness of this book for any researcher, historian, or model railroader can not be underestimated. In addition to a complete map of the system and major stations there is also a well-research locomotive roster as an appendix. All 24 CL&N; locomotives are accounted for with numbers, models, and years of service.Rounding out the material is an index and a large number of black and white photos. Overall, Narrow Gauge in Ohio fulfills dual roles. It tells the story of the Midwest narrow gauge movement as well as the story of a specific railroad in time. While the information could have been more extensive the publisher was clearly looking at small run and thus limited in pages.

Although Anne reveals an intimate, often confusing emotional connection to the major players, the reality of her comprehension of Scott and Jackie is remote; as though she observes their behavior from a distance, giving us, in actuality, a bird's eye view.Throughout Bird's narrative, she describes a number of events that, to a curious person, would have been golden opportunities to ask questions or fill in the blanks of her biological family's history. Perhaps at some of the events she attended: weddings, baby showers, family reunions, and weekends in Carmel, Anne was privy to some Peterson lore; but she doesn't describe any of this in her book.When Scott comes to live with her, she allows him to behave in what she describes as a \\"bizarre\\" manner, yet she rarely asks him a direct question, and completely avoids asking any difficult questions that the entire rest of the world wanted to ask, such as why he bought a boat in December, why he continued to call Amber Frey, why he rented cars and avoided participating in the searches, and many other questions regarding his fishing trip and curious detachment from Laci's disappearance. Instead, she matches him drink for drink and avoids the temptation to interrogate him.To those of us who followed the trial, this is maddening. Here was one person who just might have been able to cast some real light onto Peterson's psyche, which could have been invaluable in understanding his state of mind. But, no. Bird sits there like a potted plant watching, \\"Murder She Wrote,\\" blithely ignoring a real-life murder investigation right under her nose.For whatever reason, whether out of fear of learning the truth, a genetic aversion to confrontation, or severe emotional compartmentalization, Anne squanders her coveted front-row seat in the most highly publicized investigation since Simpson.After Laci's murder, Anne's relationship with Scott transforms from adoring newfound sibling to indifferent, hostile stranger within three months. Perhaps \\"Dr. Jekyll\\" sensed Anne's skepticism and her husband, Tim's misgivings and, true to form, switches to Mr. Hyde.When Anne refuses to testify for Scott in the penalty phase of his murder trial, Jackie echoes Scott's icy rejection and emotionally (if not literally) abandons Anne, for the second time, for her failure to toe the line in the family's desperate denial. Of course, both Jackie and Scott are quite skilled at this, based on their ability to dismiss and vacate family, friends, employment, and homes without the slightest regret.Ironically, from Bird's cautiously crafted tale, we can conclude that one of the most dominant genes from the Latham family was not only brown eyes, heavy eyebrows, round faces or shapely legs; it was denial."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Anne Bird tells it like it is...even when it makes her look bad. It is smoothly written and I had a hard time putting it down. I read it in 2 days. I have read several books on this case but this is the best yet. It shows a side of Scott that explains perhaps why he is the way he is. And much more to keep you reading!!!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book was a great and fast read. I found it hard to put down, and it's very interesting to see more of what was going on behind the scenes. This book defintely gives insight into Scott Peterson's sociopathic nature, and where it came from. All along, during the trial, I had a hard time feeling sympathy for Jackie Peterson. Call it instinct or whatever, but this book tells me now why I felt that way. Anne Bird was fortunate in not being raised by Jackie Peterson, and appears to be about the only \\"sane\\" member of the family. I commend her in writing this book, as it was probably part of a healing process for her. I think anyone in her situation would have done the same, and not sit back and see the Peterson family portrayed as \\"victims.\\" Conner was Jackie and Lee's grandson too, yet they were more concerned with Scott's wellbeing, than the fact that he murdered his own child. He actually slept in a room at Anne's house which overlooked the bay where he dumped Laci's body. Thumbs up to Anne Bird, and I recommend this book for anyone who would like to learn more about the case and Scott's actions."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Usually I do not read these sort of true life crime books but I had seen Anne on some TV show (I think Larry King but might be wrong) and was curious as to what she had to say. It is funny how people assume she did it for money or are horrified she \\"turned\\" against blood family. That is part of the problem in our society, family or not, not being held accountable for their actions. So what if they are related? She is supposed to be on his side just because of that? She did exactly that in the beginning at the cost of her marriage. I can understand her husband Tim, since he thought Scott was guilty, not wanting Scott staying in their home with his young children and Anne was sort of foolish to not understand this. But I can also understand, in the beginning, how she would try to help Scott as that relationship was new and she was happy at having her extended family. In time, she did see the light but I also think it took a bit longer than anyone who had a brain in their head should have taken. Jackie and Lee are a real trip but I do not question Anne genuine fondness for Laci. It is a very readable book, interesting to see how Scott behaved behind the scenes. In reading the book, it seems that Anne already does come from money so I do not think money was a huge factor. One thing that I did like about the book was how Anne portrayed the loving adopted family she has. Adoption gets a bad rap in this country and it is nice to see someone who was adopted have love and respect for their adopted families."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I'm glad that Anne Bird took the time to put her thoughts into this book. Ms. Bird was in a unique position of observation of Scott Peterson, and hers is a heartbreaking tale of finding and losing family.Imagine being adopted by a well-to-do family, and having everything you want growing up, including happiness, only to have your birth family step into your life and destroy it the way Scott Peterson destroyed so many lives, including the brutal destruction of his wife and unborn son.Bird's list of the thirty-three items are, if not all, dominantly composed of gut-feelings. It serves as a lesson to all of us to pay attention to our inner selves. We, as people, interact with normal people every day of our lives. Anne Bird had had a normal life, and unfortunately when confronted with abnormal behavior, it was something she couldn't fathom and desperately didn't want to believe. Gavin de Becker has cautioned us to listen to our instincts, and in Ms. Bird's case it would have been better for her if she'd listened sooner.Her tale is one of personal tragedy outside of the horrific murders, a tale that clearly shows there is always more than one victim in a crime. Discovering her \\"new\\" birth family, placing trust in that family, and having a particular affection for Scott and Laci (who were/are both dynamic people) was all toppled by the pathological actions of an individual Ms. Bird earnestly wanted to believe in. Of the trial, Ms. Bird states, \\"It was unreal ... I felt I'd stumbled into another dimension, a dimension where my reality made no sense.\\"If you want more info on the Scott Peterson case, this isn't the book to start with. I recommend starting with Catherine Crier's 'A Deadly Game' and following up with Keith Ablow's 'Inside The Mind Of Scott Peterson'. Those two books will give more background on the actual case itself; this book is more of a filler on how Ms. Bird was sucked into the vortex of Scott Peterson's collapsing universe, and serves to point out how many more victims there are in a single crime than those who died at the hands of the madman. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"It's sooo easy to take a cheap shot and say that Anne Bird wrote this to finance her wine/carpaccio/Disneyland/Xanax habit, but if she did, that's okay. Catherine Crier wrote a brilliant book about the Peterson case and I doubt all the proceeds are going to charity.But what to make of this poorly written and not-terribly-well-thought-out book? First of all, Ms. Bird clearly has some issues with being adopted, though why I don't know--her adoptive parents are loving, supportive, and RICHRICHRICH, as she takes pains to alert us. I guess she's annoyed that Scott was considered the family \\"golden boy,\\" though in my experience those kids generally end up worse than their siblings. (My spouse has an acquaintance whose mother also considered him the \\"golden boy\\" and who could do no wrong--she even defended him when he put his own brother in the hospital. He'll probably end up in court one day and his mother will be there pulling a Jackie Peterson). But Ms. Bird just LOVES everybody when she first meets them, although she makes sure to tell us \\"I know it seems as if I liked everybody indiscriminately, but I'm actually not that way\\" (not a direct quote, obviously). She thinks some aspects of Jackie Peterson's behavior is creepy--though it struck me that Mrs. Peterson was probably just awkward in the situation, who wouldn't be?--but nonetheless she and the Petersons go on trips to Disneyland, the shore, fancy restaurants, etc. She proclaims that she and Laci are practically soul sisters though they meet about four times and only rarely talk on the phone. Despite Ms. Bird's avowal that the purpose of her book is to \\"get justice for Laci and Conner\\" (this was accomplished at the trial, Anne!) Laci is a cardboard character who likes flowers, shopping, and complains about her aching back.There are some interesting tidbits about Scott and the rest of the Peterson clan, which saves the book from a 1-star rating. We already knew about his porn channels, of course, but the pattern of silly lies (like claiming he and Laci were going to name the baby \\"California\\"--Anne hilariously writes \\"I didn't know what to make of that\\"), going out boozing with Anne while the search is going on, Jackie's defense of Scott's lies to Amber Frey with \\"Well, he's been all those places!\\"--if it weren't for the fact that a woman and her unborn baby are dead, these people would make wonderful Springer or Maury guests. This includes Ms. Bird, who sits watching \\"Murder, She Wrote,\\" neglecting her kids and jeopardizing her marriage because \\"He's my brother.\\" I'd argue that her adoptive siblings are her \\"brothers,\\" but I guess she feels differently. Her \\"33 reasons\\" are pretty ludicrous (Laci was almost certainly NOT killed in the pool) consisting primarily of such insights that Scott Peterson was at Cal Poly when Kristen Smart disappeared (again, almost certainly not a connection), Scott making \\"flirtinis\\" for the babysitter and getting into the Mile-High club (again, chilling details, but not dispositive). She also \\"reads\\" guilt into a tale Scott weaved for her regarding a children's cemetery that he and Laci supposedly stumbled on and a vision that Scott had of Laci. Again, Scott's guilty--but these stories don't really tell us much that we don't get in Catherine Crier's far superior book.As for dissembling, Anne Bird proves she's not above it herself. We are asked to believe that upon hearing Laci is dead, her three-year-old son takes his crib mattress and tries to drag it outside saying, \\"I'm going to put this outside for Aunt Laci for when she falls down from the heavens.\\" PLEASE! Also, for all her talk about believing Scott to be innocent at first, she seems curiously eager to get involved in the case. She had absolutely no useful information to give either the defense or the prosecution (seems like she tried one, then the other) and when she failed to get her sufficient 15 minutes of fame, she hitches her wagon to Gloria Allred and peddles her stories in this book. If you can borrow a friend's copy or check it out of the library, it's a fun read if you were a Peterson trial junkie (which probably includes most of the country). Again, stories of the wildly dysfunctional Petersons would be funnier if Laci and Connor weren't horribly dead...but Anne's working out her \\"adoptee\\" issues, so I guess it's all right. Uhhh-huhhh....."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I'm sorry but if my sister was found guilty and I knew she was guilty of murder, I'd absolutely write a book about her. She would no longer be consisdered my sister, she'd be a monster. And i'd want the whole world to know too. You people that get mad at Ms. Bird for \\"selling her brother out\\" make me sick. As long as she isn't publishing false information, she has the right to write a book and profit on it."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"The Scott Peterson case captivated the nation and I too, was enthralled by the case and the trial. I bounced back and forth deciding whether or not to read this book, and now I know that it is one that I should have skipped.I suspect that the author was just cashing in on the chance to make a buck, and to see her name in print. There is nothing really new in this book, save for a few tidbits of family background and lots of mundane details. It seems that Anne stood by her \\"brother\\" before the verdict and enjoyed the notoriety that the association brought her, but after the guilty verdict wrote a \\"tell all\\" book with her \\"earth shattering revelations\\" and attempted to apppear as though she suspected him all along. She tries to inject herself into the investigation and make her inside information more useful than it really is. There are a few mildly interesting bits of info on Jackie's behavior toward Laci, however I can imagine that her judgemental behavior was not reserved for her daughter-in-law alone, but that she is disdainful of any that doesn't meet her lofty standards. If you were really captivated by this case, you might get something from the book, but I felt disappointed with the lack of substance."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"The book is a quick read, and it's obvious that Ms. Bird has never written a book before, however I tried not to hold that against her and tried to keep an open mind. The first half of the book is a whole lot about Ms. Bird herself and her privileged life. You hear a lot about things such as her bonuses from work, her husband not \\"getting lucky\\" when they first went out and so on... I was a bit frustrated since the book was supposed to be about why she thought her brother was guilty, yet she hardly even touched on the subject until the end of the book. The 33 reasons that she lists are in the VERY back and are mere opinions about his behavior than anything else, such as he was upset when he didn't get hit on at a local gay bar, etc. It did shed a little bit of light into the whole family and how Jackie really was, I didn't gather from TV how insanely jealous and critical she was of Laci. Other than that, I wish I hadn't paid $26.00 for it and I'll be selling it on E-bay for a pretty cheap price. Hope this is helpful!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"It is amazing how in life we never really get to know a person no matter how long we been knowing them. In other words, we will always know the look of the person, but never know their hearts. The book is amazing, well worth every penny."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"As much as I admire Amber Frey, her book added little to what was already known about Scott Peterson and his family. Anne Bird's book, on the other hand, tells us lots we didn't know. I won't give away any details, but Scott's mother, Jackie Peterson, is revealed to be just about as big a sociopath as Scott. A very fast read; I read it in one sitting. If you're a Peterson trial junkie, this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Read this book the first time for the details of Scott's behavior, which truly are creepy. Then I suggest you read it again, as I did, and consider the unlikely circumstances that made this story possible. It almost seems biblical. The child given up at birth, reunited with her family, and then placed in the middle of a horrible crime that divides the Rocha and Peterson families. I actually felt very sad after reading it the second time, imagining how many conflicting emotions Anne Bird must have had in writing this book. I, for one, am glad she wrote it. It removes any lingering doubt (not that I had much) about Scott's guilt. Perhaps more importantly, it helps assuage my discomfort at the seemingly perfect person committing a crime. He clearly wasn't perfect...wasn't even all that human. Poor Laci. I think it's also uncanny that Laci's high school boyfriend is in jail for murdering his girlfriend, and that Jackie's father was murdered during her childhood on December 23...the very date her own son murdered his wife. The only thing I wish Anne had addressed was how Jackie's other child, Don (also given up for adoption) felt about the case and about Anne's decision to write the book. Don really came across as one of the most likable and solid people in the book. I wonder if he feels Anne betrayed Jackie."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Thank you Mrs. Bird for writing this book. You have provided a terrific insight to the Latham/Peterson family dynamic. Your account of events leading up to and after Laci's disappearance is chilling. I was stunned at Scott's self centered, spoiled brat behavior as well as Jackies seemingly mean spirited remarks about Laci. I read this book in less than a day. I could not put it down. May God bless you and your family."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Ms. Bird has written from the heart. The reader who is looking for irrefutable evidence of Scott's guilt or innocence will be disappointed. However, as a Peterson clan insider, Ms. Bird does buttress the circumstantial case against Scott with her own direct observations. The story is all the more compelling because Ms. Bird initially believed in Scott's innocence. Most admirable, Bird does not use heavy-handed tactics to sway the reader to her view of Scott's guilt. Rather, she lets events and circumstances of which she had first-hand knowledge speak for themselves. The photographs included in the book were helpful. Ms. Bird obviously had deep affection for Laci, and we learn more about Laci, the woman. Bird also offers a theory as to how Scott committed the murder which is quite convincing. The book is not meant to stand as the definitive account of the Laci Peterson murder. Instead, it is the tale of how the tragic events impacted one woman close to the epicenter. It's a human story, and the book accomplishes what it sets out to do. I sincerely hope Ms. Bird is healing from this aftermath of her involvement with her birth family."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This is an excellent, honest account from a sisterwho wanted to believe Scott Peterson was innocent.Tremendous read and very heartfelt."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I'd considered reading this but never bought until yesterday when the Petersons screamed at Laci's grieving brother while he was on the stand. I felt like their ongoing denial helped create this soul-less guy and I bought this on the way home from work. This book convinced me of what I already believed. I read it very quickly. I do not fault Anne Bird for writing this book; I do, however, feel sad that her birth family caused her so much anguish and that she was forced to confront that a brother she loved was so evil and that her family life suffered as a result. Her \\"reasons\\" were not what compelled me to read this. Understanding the psychology of Scott Peterson's family was, and Anne Bird provided this. Anne, I am glad your adoptive family raised you differently than you would have been raised otherwise. You are not wrong to turn your back on a man who killed a pregnant woman and his near-term baby and those who would defend him at any cost. I, too, am adopted. If being a member of any family requires you to look away from and defend evil, then bless you for not wanting to pay that price of admission."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I got this book the day it came out. I read amber freys book. It was good but this book lets us into the life of scott peterson. Its scarey to see how bizarre his behavior was leading up to laci's death and after. I do give this book five stars. Very in depth. Great Book!!!May god bless laci's family."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"First of all, I don't think for one minute that Bird was out just make a quick buck, nor does anyone know if she's getting any money out of it. To say this is judging someone for something when you don't even know the facts. Scott is Bird's blood relative, and I admire her for speaking out about his guilt. After all, HE DID CONFESS TO THE MURDERS- TO HER! If I were in Bird's shoes, I'd want the world to know that even though this is my blood sibling, HE WAS CONVICTED of Laci's and baby Connor's murders, and received the death penalty by 12 jurors unknown to him. It's also law enforcements job to follow and scrutinize a prime suspect, especially when the suspect is still having affectionate phone conversations with his mistress during the search for Laci. Kudos to both Bird & Frey for their courage and honesty!!!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Anne Bird, from inside the family, writes a convincing book with new information that reaffirms Scott's guilt. Of course, most of the readers of the book do not know anything about Anne Bird. Assuming she is not an evil person her convincing book takes away the small amount of lingering doubt that remained in some minds after the trial. Writing such a book condemning her brother is certainly an unusual move. However, Laci's murder was such an unusual case and so brutal that being convinced of Scott's guilt she would almost have to speak out.This book is much better than one would expect in a case like this. The book is much better than the many thousands of hours of TV coverage of the Peterson case. Scott Peterson lived with the author and her husband for weeks after the murder of his wife. Even as a sociopath he could not hide the truth from his sister for weeks. As one would expect, the truth came out during that time. If you were a big-time TV watcher of the case, as you read this book with the inside information that only a family insider could provide, you will probably feel that many of those hours watching TV were wasted hours as they were not close enough to the case to provide the inside scoop that this book provides."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I also agree that this was a much better and informative book than Amber Frey's --but they both have shown what a total sociopath Scott Peterson is & how he charmed his way into both Amber & Anne's lives. Scott is the \\"bad seed\\" product of his rotten-apple-of-a-mother, Jacquie Peterson. The saying that the apple doesn't fall too far away from the tree is true. It appears that Jacquie was able to give up 2 out of 3 of her children to adoption without much feeling & Scott was able to lose Conner without ANY feeling! I think BOTH he AND his mother are wacko & Jacquie should have had help long ago. This is just another example of how bad over-indulgence of a child can turn out verrry ugly. Anne is lucky that that she was adopted into a caring & loving family. Her other brother who was adopted out wasn't as lucky and I do feel sorry for him because he's still looking for love in Jacquie, his biological mother. How sad. When I heard that Anne had written \\"Blood Brother\\", I just toyed with the thought of reading the book. Then I saw her on both Dateline & Oprah & was so fascinated by both what she said about Scott & what the psychologist said about sociopaths on the Oprah Show that I ran out & bought the book which I read in one evening. It is really scary to think how many Scott Peterson's (both male & female) are running around out there......... Hopefully, Scott will read her book & admit to himself that he indeed killed Laci & Conner. As for Jacquie----GET SOME HELP! (You too, Mark Geragos!!!) Good job, Anne and if Jacquie never speaks to you again, consider yourself one of the lucky ones. And finally, If any of the jurors EVER doubted their decision--read the book!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Jackie & Scott are evil, lying narcissists. Thank God Anne, was adopted to a wonderful family. Jackie should be questioned for her role in Laci's disappearance because I believe Jackie hindered the investigation with information she may know about the murder; all in an effort to protect Scott.I hope that Anne is able to focus on her adopted parents, her children & her husband & move forward with her life. Great book!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I'm not generally into true crime books, but I was pretty fascinated by this case.

Technically she was harboring a murderer! Once she realizes that he WAS the murderer, she must have been devastated.Some say Anne shouldn't have capitalized on her special relationship with the Petersons, but the truth is they used HER. I can't imagine how traumatic it must have been for her to know this guy held her baby during its christening! After all she went through helping this murderer, Scott, she deserves the income and peace of mind that this book hopefully has given her.I love Anne's writing and hope this will not be her only book.

This author is in a perfect position to help with that process. She is biologically related to Scott and knew both him and Laci fairly well. However, she did not grow up with Scott and is therefore able to have some distance and objectivity. Book is well written and although there is very little actual information that hasn't been available in other ways, this is an interesting perspective. My hope is that, having written the book, Ann can let it go and continue with her pre-Scott life."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"The title is misleading. It should be \\"33 reasons my brother is a jerk\\". There are no solid reasons he killed his wife. [...]. They did not use anne in court since there really was nothing to go on but her opinon.I thought the book was interesting as far as getting an inside look at what scott was like socially and with family, also lacey's personality. I feel bad for the author to find her birth family, only to have this terrible thing happen and come between them."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Like a lot of people, I followed the Scott Peterson trial. I watched Court TV when I could and became very familiar with all the particulars.Anne Bird is Scott Peterson's older Half-sister. She was given up at birth by a teenage Jackie Peterson, and was reunited with her a few years prior to the infamous murders of Laci and Connor Peterson. While there is plenty of information available on this case, I was hoping for an insider's view, a fly on the wall, as to what was going on behind the scenes. While Anne was an insider, I didn't come away with any thing new.The only thing I really found interesting about Anne Bird's book was her description of Scott Peterson's actions after the bodies of Laci and Connor were found. Since Peterson stayed with Bird and her husband during this time, she had a front row seat.If you've followed this case, you're really not going to find anything new in this book. You'll get some Peterson family history; Anne's take on her adoption; reuniting with her birth-mother, Jackie Peterson; and her thoughts on Scott and Laci's relationship.Other than Scott, Jackie Peterson is the individual who comes out looking like a basket case. She's portrayed as delusional, critical, opinionated, controlling, and, well, a little off her rocker. You'll find out that she had two children out of wedlock (Anne being one of them), given up for adoption; didn't approve of Laci; and Scott was never viewed as anything other than the perfect son.Anne constantly refers to Scott and \\"The Golden Boy;\\" and up until Laci's disappearance, the title fit. The Golden Boy could do no wrong, and was allowed to run back to Mom and Dad when he got into trouble. Bird's opinion is that it was this shirking of responsibility, of not being held accountable for anything, that in some way led to Scott Peterson's inability to cope with being a responsible husband and father.So what will you get after reading this book? If you've followed the trial, you won't learn much much more than you already know, I'm afraid. I got some insight into Peterson's actions and how he was acting when not in the public eye, but beyond that, I really didn't come away from this knowing anything more than when I started. So, no, there's no deep insight into Peterson's psyche; only guesses as to how and why this tragic event took place."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"The book was written fairly well for a first timer. It is an interesting look at the case from a different angle. Maybe other members of Scott's family will wake up and smell the guilt."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"The book may not provide many revelations to those that familiar with the case, but for my part, the inside view of Peterson definitely makes for an interesting and insightful read. Probably one of the most important books written on the case and definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"It humanized the half-sister Anne Bird. I found myself understanding why she wanted so desperately to believe in her half-brother Scott's innocense.Anne Bird was born of Scott's mother, Jackie, who promptly gave her up for adoption. Fortunately for Anne, she was adopted by a loving and stable family.Which was probably the best thing to ever happen to her. In this book, Jackie Peterson is portrayed as unstable and her display of favoritism towards her \\"golden boy\\" Scott is undeniable. I remember when all of this was all over the news, so I believe Anne was not being cruel in her assessment of Jackie. If anything, I felt Anne was being too kind.This book is a very fast read, and don't buy it if you want an indepth analysis. Instead, buy it to understand that Laci and Connor were not the only victims of Scott's sociopathy."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I liked the book. I would have liked to have met Laci as she seems to have been a nice person.But really the author Anne Bird is kind of nasty and petty. For example she complains about Scott Peterson going out to diner with the extended family and ordering a nice bottle of wine while her husband had the house wine and she got stuck kicking in more money than she felt fair when they split the bill. She really has some issues and needs to seek professional help, lots of anger there from her being given up for adoption."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"this poor girl what she was put through by jackie peterson. i used to think lee was the tuff one of the family all along it was jackie....not that lee is any better but jackie is her mother. this is a heart wrenching story of a girl who was welcomed into a family she didnt know only to be used by that same family....she loved laci and was not going to lie for her birth mother or her brother......bravo anne"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book is a shameless attempt to cash in on a famous case and nothing more. Ms. Bird's 33 reasons are the proof of this crass motive because, to put it mildly, they are lame.For example, Ms. Bird says that because Scott arrived at her home in a variety of cars is proof that he killed Laci. Because Scott maintained his pool, this is proof that he drowned Laci in the pool. I'm not giving away any of the book, because Ms. Bird has already discussed these points in the media.The author came from a privileged background and apparently lacks the compassion to appreciate the difficult circumstances that led to her birth mother, Jackie giving her up for adoption. If Ms Bird were an honest person, she would admit that she was influenced by the media witch hunt surrounding the Laci Peterson case, and that is what convinced her of Scott's guilt, rather than the 33 reasons she describes."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This is a terrilble book. I feel bad that Anne Bird feels so guilty, but that's about the extent of anything positive I can say about this read. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"The material in this book could have been contained in one magazine article rather than an entire book, but it is not surprising that yet another individual is capitalizing on tragic events that have received too much media coverage. Perhaps writing this book was somewhat cathartic for the author, but the many snide remarks and repeated references to \\"children that were kept\\" and \\"children that were given away\\" become annoying and distracting after a while. The book seems more about her unresolved anger towards her birth mother than about the convicted individual. It is surprising that a well-educated and well-traveled young woman would allow herself and her family to supposedly be so manipulated by a woman she'd met only met a few years earlier and toward whom she apparently felt no genuine bond. Many of the events described (e.g. how Laci was murdered) are simply her own perceptions and suppositions. I think this is a thinly-veiled attempt to smear the family, and in particular, her birth mother, who, while as imperfect as the rest of us, tried to include this young woman in her life in later years. Her birth mother is surely experiencing a great deal of emotional suffering over the entire tragedy; therefore, publishing this book seems very mean-spirited. Also, in the unlikely event of a second printing, the publisher should note that the book contains typo's which must have been overlooked in their rush to publish this worthless story while the public interest was still at peak. I believe my money would have been better spent in the form of a charitable donation in Laci's memory and I'm sorry I allowed myself to be intrigued by the author's TV interview which led to my purchasing it."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Very good book and many thanks to the author for writing it!I am glad I bought this book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Although I did receive this book from Padman 434 in a more or less timely fashion, the book, \\"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty\\" was not worth the wait. The other book I ordered, \\"A Deadly Game\\" by Catherine Crier, was bought directly from Amazon, and I got it in 4 days. It's super. I'm now wondering why you do business at all from padman 434. All the posted reviews on your site were negative."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Since Anne did not testify as a witness for the defense or the prosecution in this trial, I was not expecting 33 COMPELLING reasons-and I was right on. Many of the reasons are inane innuendo-and none would hold up against evidence standards in any court of law. The book does provide SOME limited information into some of Scott's movements from mid-Jan until his arrest in April-buying clothes (call out the guard!), etc..What came across to me in the book was the obvious repressed anger and abandonment issues towards Mrs.Peterson, that Ms. Bird has for being placed for adoption. This is the filter through which she has perceived the many things she has written about. Bird labels Mrs.Peterson as being \\"in denial\\" and sadly, Bird is in major denial herself about her anger and feelings of sibling rivalry and how they have influenced her decisions and perceptions, as well. I came away wishing she would have spent a lot more time with the therapist she thanks at the beginning of the book. Real courage would have been working through these issues, not writing a book like this for money. One more messed up person cashing in on this trial via Gloria Allred. Such a shame for Rocha and Peterson families and for Anne Bird. Unless you have a specific interest in psychological issues around adoption, etc, I would say borrow the book, check it out from the library or buy it USED in a few weeks on Amazon."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"product was advertised as new, purchased as a gift, obviously not in new condition, there were stains on the jacket, and underlining in pen in the text."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Geez, they simply can't let that woman rest in peace, the money makers are out there writing sensational stuff for the idiots!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"You can tell this was a cathartic project for the author and a necessary one in my opinion. I wish there had been more details, but that is my own morbid curiosity about this case, I suppose.The editor of this book should be ashamed. There were many mistakes in print, making some passages difficult to understand and some of the pages were missing the last few words on the right side of the pages which was maddening. Also, the picture section was so small they were more like thumbnails and almost impossible to see!There are a few questions I have: what was the significance of mentioning Scott wearing his wedding ring? She says this multiple times but never explains herself, also I would have liked to know more about her relationship with Scott's family as it stands now. What about Don?I suppose Ms. Bird feels better writing this and I wish her and her family well."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I have to wonder about the motivation behind this book.

I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"By the authors own admission she hardly knew her half-brother Scott Peterson since she had been given up for adoption as a baby. However, Scott did live with Ann (the author) during much of the time the entire country was searching for a very pregnant Lacy Peterson. I felt the authors pain at being overjoyed to have connected with her roots while at the same time struggling with her gut instinct knowing she will lose her family again. Ann Baird shows us inside the world of Scott Peterson as only a family member could see. I highly recommend the book to any true crime reader."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book has interesting views of Scott Peterson. I think that it was kind of cheesy to write a book about him though. I think it was important for someone on his side to tell the story though. I just wonder about some of the things that supposedly happened. Scott Peterson is a freak!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I was extremely disappointed with the book and the author. Basically, most of the information in the book was about MS. BYRD, HER life and her \\"FEELINGS\\" about Scott and how/why he murdered his wife. There were very few CONCRETE ideas as to why she believes he killed Laci and even then, most of her ideas are laughable. The book has very detailed descriptions of conversations and memories. I find it hard to believe that Ms. Byrd can recall exact conversations that occurred many years before this book was written. She comes off as very spoiled, over-indulgent and alcoholic. Because this book is mostly about Ms. Byrd, I would have found it interesting had she been an interesting person. Instead, this book is filled with boring details and 33 unbelievable reasons that Scott killed Laci. (And I truly believe he did kill her.)"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Just finished reading this book - although it was well written, a quick read (one day) and full of never-before-disclosed tidbits of information on Scott Peterson, it has a definite ring of jealousy and envy on the author's part. Most of this is understandable, given the fact that she is adopted, but it is disturbing how she keeps referring to Scott as the \\"child my mother chose to keep\\" whereas she was given away at birth. And, Jackie Peterson definitely seems to be in a delusional state of denial (aside from being severely dysfunctional which is probably how she ended up with a sociopath for a son in the first place!), but does that justify writing a book about your family and airing all of their dirty laundry out in public?? Nevertheless, it was a very interesting read, especially for anyone who has closely followed this case."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I thought that Anne Bird did a good job and told her story from her heart. I think she should have stood up more to her biological mother, Jackie, who was always saying nasty things about Laci, and how her \\"golden boy\\" would never do such a thing. - By sticking up for her \\"brother\\" the super liar, she almost destroyed her own marriage. If I would have been Anne, I wouldn't have gone out of my way for Scott and family the way she did. She almost destroyed herself as well. I would have NO guilt about Scott Peterson if I were her."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I have read a lot on Scott Peterson case. This book is good but over all no real insight, pleasant enough but this perspective I could of went either way on. Bottom line didn't mind reading it, it was a very fast read, but if I had not read it I don't think I would of felt like I missed anything. What I do find is if you get what I call iffy books used, you never waste your time and money. One good thing about amazon they have used books."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"If you truly care about reading the Biography of Anne Bird, this is the book for you. If you want a good book about the Laci Peterson case, go pick up A Deadly Game by Catherine Crier.This book reads like a bad writers journal. Anne Bird took advantage of the fact that she was family to make a quick buck. She claims to be the best of friends with Laci, although they met roughly four times. She must have said \\"He's my brother\\" 900 times. She makes it sound like she was the only person who believed that Scott Peterson was innocent, and stood by him until the very end. It is upsetting that someone would stoop this low.Don't waste your time on this book."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"What I found interesting in this book was Anne's deep hurt over Jackie leaving her Several mentions are made of Jackie's kids-the ones she kept and the ones she gave away.It is clear that Anne's therapy has not resolved these wounds and She is still suffering. My heart goes out to her.Her motives in writing this book are unclear to me.I am not sure betrayal is correct though one could conclude that.I think she did like Scott.This book is payback to Jackie as a reminder that Her \\"golden boy\\" who Jackie actually raised did not turn out so well. A definite hidden agenda is in this book.There is no new evidence but for some reason it is an OK book."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"You have to choke down a feeling of disgust to read this book, but soon enough that self-loathing goes away and you are caught up in Anne Bird's long story about how she found her new family and grew to care for them, then when she figured out they were genetically sociopathic, she took care to distance herself from them--particularly when she realized that, after all was said and done, Scott probably did kill Laci after all (and the unborn baby Conor).No one who is not adopted has any right to judge Anne Bird for what she has done. People say she is disgusting, but they just aren't seeing the truth. The truth is that Jackie, of all people, let Anne down by giving her away--and then even though Anne thought she loved Jackie later (after being reunited), how could she? The seed of resentment had been planted long ago. How can you look a woman in the eye, a woman who has given you away and kept your brother--who turns out to be a killer no less, and a cheater--and smile and say, \\"You're still my mother.\\" The facts are that Anne grew up in an OK household, but how did Jackie know that when she gave her up so long ago?As Anne admits, she did some worrying about her own bloodlines, for if Jackie was so awful, and Scott a cold-blooded sociopath, aren't these things shared genetically by Anne? No wonder she has chosen this path, she can get it off her chest, help the US understand more about the Peterson family, and also rake in over 1.2 million dollars.She'd have to be insane not to take up the offer of the publishers and agents.If they make a movie from Anne's point of view, I think Meg Ryan should play her, and Jeff Goldblum could play Scott. As for Jackie, who else but Bea Arthur?"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This woman has no perspectives, no insights whatsoever to handle her thoughts and feelings let alone writing a book. Very disappointing book. Amber Frey is far more better. Just read the book title, too awkward already! I don't recommend this book at all."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This was an excellent book and hope that many others purchase it!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book is good and I recommend it as it gives more of a clear picture of the goings on and mind of this murderer. The information she clearly describes in this book was probably difficult to write as she cared about the relationships with the Petersons.I would recommend this book as it clearly helps people see why the jury found him to be guilty and sentenced him to death. I read this book after reading Witness by Amber Frey and I recommend reading the books in that order."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read in my life! By the second chapter I realized I had completely wasted my money. There was no new information in this book at all that we haven't already heard about. It is not worth the paper it is printed on. Full of grammatical errors. Where was her editor? Anne Bird should be embarassed."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Christina Crawford, Lucie Arnaz and B.D. Hyman would be proud!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"If you're interested in the Scott Peterson case, this book does give some juicy tidbits from more of an insider's standpoint (more than, say Catherine Crier's book which basically stated from the first chapter and throughout the book, \\"I knew he was guilty, guilty, guilty! Yay Me! What insight I have!\\").This book almost follows the same formula, but with a twist, it was written by Scott Peterson's 'biological' sister, I guess you could say, who had been given up for adoption by their mother and had come to know him in only recent years. The book in a nutshell is primarily focused on how she came to know her brother Scott, her experiences with Jackie, their mother, Jackie's quiet dueling with Laci (you get the fact they really didn't like each other), her own experiences with Laci, and the subsequent happenings when Scott stayed with her in part during the course of the investigations.It's interesting to a point, but the way it was written is bothersome and sometimes tedious in an elitist sense. Perhaps I am being too critical of the author, but at times her input about how much love and wonderful support she gets from her own family borders on grating.. \\"I didn't feel much need to be comforted, I already had a great family\\", etc... she sings the angelic praises of her own family throughout the book, which gets tiresome after the first three mentions of having an ideal family. She's an adopted child, but she's well adjusted, and supported, and loved, did I mention loved and supported? I didn't think adopted kids were actually loved.. Thanks for enlightening me. We get it, Anne. Also, the manner in which she writes seems to put everyone in his or her place, with a kind of keen judgmental brush to it. This is especially true regarding Jackie, her birth mother. It seems Anne has a real bone to pick, as she states more than once about 'the kids you keep and the kids you give away' quite caustically. She really wants to be objective but can't, due to these newly imposed strange people in her life that she must deal with simply because they are 'family', not to mention the lack of understanding and outright anger she has toward her birth mother. I think this book is less about Scott Peterson and more about exposing the demon Jackie Latham. When Scott is included in the book, it's always under Anne Bird's ridiculous scrutiny of every move, every expression, all body language and behavior he exhibits. By the end of the book you feel like Inspector Anne needs a lot more than the Xanax she talks about being prescribed... She seems genuinely spooked and paranoid, like someone who has long obsessed over something and needs professional help. The chapter in which she wrote about meeting Scott Peterson in jail actually resulted in laughter for me. I imagined a woman who just got out of her Mercedes for her first ever 'real jail experience!'-- something to tell her friends about at fondue Thursday while they understandingly nod and tell her how strong she is for having made it through this ordeal. She also speaks periodically about being in therapy, (this is so hard for me!) her tears cascade down her cheeks and plop right onto the advance from the publisher that sits firmly in her lap. Basically much of this book could be titled \\"All About Anne\\" or \\"My Life With Anne Bird\\" by Anne Bird as told to Anne Bird on Anne Bird's chaise lounge...The way I look at it, a horrible murder was committed, there really is no 'closure', and nobody understands why. But they do understand book and movie deals. This is her account which is unfortunately limited only to her faculties, but I think there's a much longer road to travel in quote unquote \\"getting into the mind of a killer\\"."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Jackie Latham Peterson had herself a hard upbringing. Her father was brutally murdered and the crime remains unsolved. She placed the author and second child, Anne Grady Bird, up for adoption rather than endure a possible unhappy marriage or obvious poverty raising her birth children. Anne's older brother, Don, was also adopted and they share the same birth mother, Jackie, who remarried Lee Peterson and became mother to John and the golden boy known as Scott. It's obvious that they doted and spoiled Scott as their favorite.From appearances, Scott is the golden boy as Anne learns about her birth mother and forms relationships with her new family. The problems arise when Scott's very pregnant wife, Laci, goes missing on Christmas Eve. For the author, it's a tough situation because she loves both Scott and Laci and she welcomes Scott into her home during those tough weeks and months following the disappearance despite her husband's objections and opinions about Scott's guilt. He's not acting like a grieving husband but is already chasing after their babysitter known as Lorraine.I do have a problem with the book's author because rather than admit his guilt. She does more damage to her family relations by contacting Gloria Allred who was defending Amber Frey, the woman who helped get the conviction. The author would have fared better by getting another attorney rather than somebody like Allred eager to convict Peterson.The author has made enough excuses for Scott and Jackie's actions. But the real guilty party is Scott Peterson who has destroyed his own family by tearing them apart. The author can't communicate with her birth mother because of her feelings. Scott ruined that relationship as he has ruined relationships with the Rochas (Laci's family) and others. There is only one person to blame and that's Scott.Don't believe that Lee and Jackie Peterson were responsible for the murder of both daughter-in-law and grandchild. They have other children who did not become killers. Scott's actions of premeditated murder of his own pregnant wife and unborn child was calculated and cold. I don't blame the parents for holding out hope for his innocence or accept the hard fact that their son, Scott, has murdered a part of their family and is responsible for ruining their finances by seeking donations now for his appeal.Scott is sitting on death row in California's San Quentin but he is one of 700 and counting on death row which is really useless in California unlike in Texas. My heart breaks for the families even the Petersons who still stand beside Scott and proclaim his innocence. For the Petersons to accept his guilt would be devastating to his parents, his ardent supporters.But I don't think the author helped the case very much. She did paint a portrait of a very human family with flaws and colored a picture. I feel bad that her birth mother, Jackie, has ended their communication. Although the author still has her adoptive parents and extended members of the family, this case was a hard on everybody involved even the Petersons who are victims of Scott's crimes as well."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"It's late in the game and I just read this book. I got through it in one day. Let me start by saying the positive. I loved the design, the photos were great. Pictures you haven't seen anywhere else of Laci. I loved the black pages of photos. Nice design. The story is average. No blockbuster information. Even the so called \\"gossip\\" about the Petersons is nothing more than what we've heard before except these are first hand accounts. And of course it talks about Scott's behavior. His lack of concern for Laci after the disappeareance and the search. I bought this book after reading all the other books thinking there would be more information here. There is a bit but not much. I think this case draws me in because I am waiting for that one tidbit that will make me say \\"ah-ha.\\" But I don't find it. His bizzare behavior and his family that's a bit off is what you get from this book. Why Anne Bird felt compelled to write this book, I'll never know. There is almost nothing new that she added. So maybe it was money motivated. Why does she call herself Laci's friend? There is no evidence of this close friendship between her and Laci. And when she cries that she misses Laci--that doesn't sound real. Also the assumption on everyone's part that if Laci knew about Amber she would have told someone--come on--she never told anyone about Janet Ilse. So why would she mention Amber if she knew about it? She wouldn't have told her mom, nor her friends, nor anyone. And it was all this facade and upkeep of appeareances that Scott depended on to carry him over and make people believe he couldn't have done it because they were a couple in love. It's ok. I guess Ms. Bird just had to tell her story about her little brother Scott but this isn't a book to run out and get. And why go visit Scott one finally time when she was already writing a book to betray him? Anne, pick a side and stay on it. I still say the best two books on this case are Crier's \\"A Deadly Game\\" and Sharon Rocha's \\"For Laci.\\" Blood Brother has the best pictures though."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I am a big fan of true crime books. It always mystifies me to read about the criminal mind. Where did these people \\"come from\\"? Were they born or a product of their environment. Scott Peterson and this account (or any other I have read on the topic) brings me no closer to understanding the answer to those questions, but what an interesting read nonetheless! This book fascinated me because the author, Scott Peterson's half-sister, had just met Scott two years previous to these horrible events. She provides a true \\"insider's edge\\" into Scott Peterson's life, personality & marriage to Laci.The book was an easy read and it flowed as though the author was sitting in the room with me telling me the story herself. I found the author to be likable, believable and for a first book, very well written."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I agree, those who followed the Scott Peterson case and want to know the *surface* details of what he was doing while the police were out looking for Laci and Conner will find this book to be an interesting read (check it out from your local library though, don't spend your hard earned money for such a light read).All in all, I found this book to be disturbing, but not for the most obvious reason--that being getting a brief glimpse at the behaviors of a psychopath. No, I was disturbed by Anne Bird's portrayal of her relationships with Scott, Laci, and Jackie Peterson. The details she provided failed to substantiate such \\"closeness\\" to any of them.However, I think anyone who has dealt with a psychopath will understand her need to justify being taken in (ie, fooled and used) by both Scott and Jackie as well as her need to write this book."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Very interesting story from Ann Bird's point of view. Especially interesting for those of us who are local in Northern CA and who have followed the story of Scott and Laci Peterson."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"There is nothing new in this book about the case but it helps to put things in order and to see from a different angle what Scott Peterson was doing and where he was at different times. The book told me more about Scott's mother than it did Scott and surprisingly that helped me to see the dynamics of the family before the tragedy happened. It is also glaringly obvious that the book was written for financial gain only, however, I cannot say that I blame the author for doing this given her history with her and Scott's mom."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Anne Bird's mother gave her up for adoption; 32 years later Anne met her brother - Scott Peterson, known as the \\"golden boy\\" of the family. Soon after she also met Laci, and everyone was looking forward to Conner's birth.The bulk of the book covers Scott's actions after Laci disappeared. Much of the time he stayed at Anne's house with her and her husband, Tim. While Tim quickly soured on Scott - believing he was guilty, Anne took much longer to get beyond family loyalty. However, after hearing too many highly unlikely stories (eg. Laci knew about the affair with Amber, and accepted it) and innapropriate actions (eg. looking at porn on Anne's computer, hitting on Anne's babysitter, repeated comments that the police were looking in the wrong location, and general lack of concern), Anne too joined those who believed Scott did it.Adds credibility to Peterson's conviction, but should have been accomplished in FAR fewer pages. But then it wouldn't have been a book!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"A voyeuristic look at Scott Peterson's daily life following the murder of his wife and unborn baby boy. This book offers detailed accounts of Scott's bizzare behavior and irrational lies, and also a brief background on the Peterson family history. For anyone searching to answer why something like this could and did happen, don't bother reading this book. It offers no real \\"new\\" insights, but instead invites the reader to share in the agony and pain forced upon the friends and familys of this young couple after Laci's homicide. However, if you just have to know more about the depths of Scott's Peterson's demented perverse mind... you will find this book interesting and even grossly laughable."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book is a quick, interesting read. I learned things I did not know before---events witnessed by Scott Peterson's half-sister, Anne Bird. I also learned more about the Peterson family, in general, from this woman. Anne Bird has quite a story to tell, and I am glad she told it. One can only imagine how difficult it must have been for her to decide in the end that her half-brother was guilty and to alienate her newly found birth mother (Jackie Peterson) in the process. But, this case will be analyzed a lot in the future, and her information is an important piece of the overall Scott Peterson puzzle."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I enjoyed reading Ann Byrrd' take on what took place, how she refused to believe that Scott was guilty, but slowly begain to wonder, and then the 33 reasons that convinced her.A good read."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I gained new perspectives reading this book.

I was looking to expect 33 good reasons why Anne Bird believes her brother was guilty, and expecting the book to be all about that.

You will be glad you did and you will thank me."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"To me this book was one of them you can't put down. I thought it was interesting at first that his sister wrote a book against his innocence, but as you get to the middle of the book you start to realize all his suspicious behavior isn't just suspicious. The book was well written, she used a lot of emotion but that wasn't just an \\"opinion\\" book because she also put the facts. I would reccomend this book to anyone whose been following the Scott Peterson case, the book in its own way closes the story for us. It fills in all those gaps we heard nothing about on the news.

Just alot of speculation.Have to agree with Jackie Peterson regarding Scott's questionable behavior after Laci was reported missing - \\"How is someone supposed to act under those circumstances\\"I just checked out \\"A Deadly Game\\" by Crier so I will see how that book compares to this."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I read the book in one day, it gave some interesting background details on the Peterson family but nothing too in depth. HEr 33 reasons were basically his reactions to to the case as it moved along...not any concrete evidence. Don't get me wrong, I think this man is 100% guilty but I also think that she cashed in on the opportunity to make yet another book and to make some money. Interesting reading but borrow a copy...I paid $24 for this book and it was definately not worth the price."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Actually, I started reading Catherine Crier's book after Anne Bird's, so maybe now in comparison I'm not as impressed with \\"Blood Brother.\\"It is an interesting read, though. On one hand, like Amber Frey, she is seemingly honestly telling her side of the story, and it does give us more insight into the character of Scott Peterson and his (ewwww) mother.It sure took her awhile to figure out her brother could have had something to do with Laci's disappearance. I guess she was just another bamboozled person temporarily fooled by Peterson. I can't really judge her for it. She did eventually put it together for herself, for her own reasons that she enumerates at the end.One thing I noticed - All of the people in her family sure seem to have a lot of discretionary income, because they always seemed to be vacationing, brunching, lunching, and travelling."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This was a great look into Scott Peterson and a life that few people knew existed. After reading Anne Bird's book, I am even more convinced about the monster that was once known as a loving husband. Loving husbands love unconditionally and do not commit hanus crimes. May Lacy and Connor rest in peace."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"If you followed this case like I did, I would recommend that you read Anne's book. It is quite an eye opener.This book not only gave us more confirmation of Scott being a sociopath and more but it also confirmed what I had always suspected that Jackie Peterson is really all about.Poor Anne and her family went through such a horrible ordeal very shortly after she found her biological mother. It was so revealing to read that not only did Scott not care about Laci and Conner, but Jackie seemed to always go out of her way to disparage Laci, even after she \\"went missing\\" before her and Conner were found washed up dead in the bay. I would not blame Anne if she wishes that she never reunited with Jackie.I am so glad for Anne that she has a wonderful adopted family who will help her sort out her feelings and conflicts that she tried so hard to describe in her book. I hope this book helps her, her husband and her family get on with their lives."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book was a complete watse of money. It offered no new information, except that Scott's mother is NUTS. I read it in one afternoon, and was left with a book no one wants to even borrow! Sorry Anne, but your fifteen minutes of fame is over."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Those of you so embittered by Ms. Bird's work haven't read the book I just finished, entitled \\"Blood Brother.\\" It seems to me this is definitely a woman's book; i.e., so many poor reviews by male readers, although some women's reviews are also very scorching. What do all of you expect from a neophyte author? I have given three stars because I find much missing from this work. It seems as though we're getting only part of the story and Ms. Bird has held back much. I'm also very disappointed that it's just over 180 pages of text with a minimum of one-inch margins on top, right and left, with a font just large enough to fill pages but still small enough to keep from hitting you in the face at the outset that you've been ripped off. C'mon, Ms. Bird, give us a follow-up with the meat of the story you've left out. You can't have known Scott for this many years and not observed much more than you're telling."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I read this book with the anticipation that I would finally be learning alot about the Peterson Family and why Scott did what he did. However, I found out right from the start that Mrs. Bird didn't even meet Scott until the late 1990s-by the way, why did she start the book and talk about how she recieved a call in 1997, and then go on to talk about events that occured over the next year, and finally states that Laci and Scott married in 1997(after she had known the Petersons for a year)? Seems to me that there were some editing problems there. Anyway, the book is a quick read with some good pictures, has some insight into Jackie Peterson,a few sweet memories of Laci, but by the time you get to her 33 reasons, the only thing you are left to believe is that Scott is a cold person that did strange things, which is something we already knew-I would not have convicted him based on her 33 reasons. However, I did find her last chapter about visiting Scott interesting, and a little sad. I sincerely hope that Mrs. Bird is planning on donating some of her proceeds to the Laci and Conner Foundation. I would recommend this book to anyone looking that was interested in the trial, and would like to learn a little (with emphasis on little) about the Peterson family and about how Scott is handling his verdict."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book is a waste of money-I am honestly sorry I bought it!!Bird doesnt tell us anything new -what is obvious however is her own unhappiness with her own lot in life-and her ability to profit from this whole tragic episode.I wish i had made a donation to the Laci/Conner fund-I would imagine the author will not be making any such donation from her blood money-she should remember that what goes round comes round!!I hope her childrens books about her do not spew the same vitriole for her as she did for Jackie!!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"NO, SHE DID NOT KNOW THE REAL PERSON, SHE FOUND THE HARD WAY.

REGARDS, DH"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I have been following the Laci Peterson case since she went missing. I eagerly purchased this and Catherine Criers book when they came out. This 'Anne' comes across as petty and jealous with not as much insight as she portrays. The 33 reasons she gives for Scott's guilt are her own personal feelings, and some already known circumstances. What I got from this book is that Ms. Bird was intoduced to the Petersons in 1998 and hung around for some parties and good times. She decides that she is above them, withdraws, and writes a book exploiting her family. I don't see how she was close to any of them and this book was written in poor tase, I think. I don't think much of the Peterson family and Anne is no exception. They deserve each other.I definantly believe Scott is guilty but his own sister backstabbing him is a bit much. That family has some serious issues."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book is proof that anyone can write a book and get it published. I kept wondering to myself if Amber Frey had helped her write this as it was about as enlightening as hers. I didnt feel there were any real revelations and so much \\"filler\\" writing, details that were not important to the book. I personally think she is acting out of anger for being given up for adoption and may have a drinking problem. If you must read the book, wait for it on paperback. And these 33 reasons for guilt seemed more like her random, rambling thoughts. What happened to this family is a horrible tragedy and it's unfortunate that so many people take this as an opportunity to make a buck."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Absolutely mundane. Ramblings of everything you already knew.Don't waste your time or money. If you must read it, get it at the library. Wagsey California"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Picked up the book in the bookstore but did not buy it. The pictures in it were good.However for the most part the 33 reasons, are very inadequate at best in pointing conclusively to guilt. The reason he was guilty was because of overwhelming evidence brought before the Jury. What the author uses is Monday Morning quaterbacking of almost any inane event as a \\"reason\\" for guilt. If the prosecutor used the authors reasoning in court, the defendant would probably not have been charged with anything. The 33 reasons are summarized towards the end of the book.Interstingly she had almost 2 years to come out with the book, and of course chose to come out with it after the verdict. If you like to read trash buy this book if you are serious and intelligent then leave it in the bookstore, especially after reviewing the 33 reasons summarized near the end. Incidentally why would someone want to write about his/her own blood in such a manner ?. Isnt it enough that the Jury decided the case? why add insult (to injury) to a death sentence ? Hmmm."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I understand that a lot of these type books, articles, etc. are written by people that can't stand not getting their '15 minutes of fame'. Never have I read one of these tell all's that it's so blatently obvious. The title caught my attention, and then I actually got to read the 33 reasons...trust me, it's not what you're expecting! Unless you're expecting to read the unconnected thoughts of a woman with a lot of self importance. Most of what she presents as fact is nothing more than things she has imagined in her mind - many of her thoughts have nothing to do with Scott at all. My opinion? She had her own importance built up in her mind and was very shocked to not get more airtime herself. The result of her imagined shunning? This book. Ms. Bird really builds up, and plays off, her close relationship with Scott and Laci. My question is this... if her life was so closely intertwined with Scotts in the months leading to his arrest why have we heard so little of her? Why was she not a witness, even after offering to be? The bottom line... This book is terribly written and immediately made me question everything that she presented as fact. Ms. Bird comes across as a liar, and not a very interesting story teller either."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"i enjoyed reading this book because it gave an inside view regarding the behind the scenes of the case. This was the only book that actually saw their relationship first hand. There was no speculation regarding scotts brhavior after laci went missing. It also showed a more inside view of scott an laci that i feel alot of people are looking for to see what it was actually like. I would recomend this book before the others."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I thought that Anne Bird did a great job with her book \\"Blood Brother\\". It's a very interesting book, is well written and was enjoyable to read. I'd already read and very much enjoyed Sharon Rocha's book \\"For Laci\\" and it was interesting to get a different perspective from a blood relative of Scott Peterson's.I believe that the reason that Anne was able to write with such honesty and objectivity was because she really wasn't that deeply tied to her half-brother Scott. She hadn't grown up with him or his family and thus wasn't that emotionally connected to them. I don't think it would have been as easy for Anne to write this book if she'd actually grown up with Scott, Jackie and the Peterson family. If that had been the case, she would have had a tighter family bond and true family loyalty which would have prevented her from being so objective regarding this horrible crime and thus her book would have suffered."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"When a case like the Laci Peterson murder makes national news, people come out of the woodwork claiming their earth shattering revelations and connections. Anne Bird was one of those people who wrote her book for the purpose of excersising her demons and connection to the Peterson family.Anne Bird was one of two children that Scott's mother, Jackie Peterson, gave up for adoption. While Anne enjoyed a happy childhood with her adopted family, like many adopted children I have met in my lifetime, she always wondered what if about her birth family. She eventually reunites with Jackie in 1997 and builds a relationship with her.Anne reveals a few details we otherwise hear about in other accounts, including the tales told by Sharon Roche. What Sharon only hinted at, Anne was able to offer more insight into. Jackie was a smothering, egocentric Mommy Dearest who loved and adored Scott as her golden child. I've met women like her before. A former friend of my Mom's always compaired her two children to me and my sister, and saw us as the model of success. Her two children could do no wrong, were never disciplined, and were taught that it's ok to lie, cheat and steel because as long as they came out looking good and getting the things they wanted it was alright. They grew up to be foul mouthed, violent, and criminal. Over the years her jealous antics got to be too much, but somehow Mom valued their friendship and hung on. She refused to believe what was in front of her eyes until the very end. When the end came, Mom was sadder than I have ever seen her, but the truth came out. Just like it did for Scott.Scott is a lying, cheating, meniacal brute who cared for little except boozing it up and having fun. He had a variety of discipline problems (being expelled from schools, fired from jobs for stealing, etc.) He clearly did not want a child, as it would have taken the focus off of himself. Somehow he decided that rather than leaving the marriage he should murder Laci and their unborn child; and, after they were out of the picture he could go on and reinvent himself.Why not 5 stars? Anne had an obtuse connection to the Peterson family, if that. She admits that she did not have much contact with Laci, and they would only meet in the flesh four times. Laci seems like a nice enough gal, but how much could you know by only meeting someone four times? It's also hard for me to believe (even though Anne was not a reliable source in this department, but, I never cease to be amazed by the antics of people) that Laci and Scott did not have discussions about children before they married. Anne wouldn't know anything about this being in role in the family. Plus, she wrote her book as therapy for her being an adopted child who had a connection to the Peterson family. Enjoy it for some insights into Scott and his family, apples don't fall far from the tree."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Considering her unique relationship to the Peterson family, I expected more insight into the family dynamics. While I'm sure that she knew and loved Laci, her claims of condering her a \\"sister\\" and the extreme closeness she shared with her & Scott seems unlikely, since she never once visited them at their home, nor did she ever meet Laci's family. This was a tragedy for all involved, but the book is superficial, and contains many facts that were well reported in the media. Save your money and buy Catherine Crier's book, a much better take on the Peterson investigation and trial."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I've read several books about this trial by now and I like this best. The Catherine Crier book is good, but I watch her show and the TV trial coverage, so I already knew most of the facts. Blood Brother is a look at Scott Peterson through the eyes of a woman trying not to believe that her brother is a murderer-a woman given up for adoption by her mother - who is also Scott Peterson's mother. And a woman just trying to fit into her newly discovered biological family. Great anecdotes about all the main characters of the drama -- including Laci -- and a riveting description of what Scott Peterson is really like. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"The murder trial has become a phenomenally popular, but invariably overplayed, diversion in America. Bird's book, however, offers an uncommonly personal and painfully revealing glimpse into the private life of the media circus du jour.One can't help but feel compassion for the victims, their families, and as the book unfolds, its author: Scott Peterson's sister. Recounting key events chronologically, Anne Bird slowly comes to terms with the guilt of her brother the \\"golden boy\\" (the blindingly affectionate nickname Scott Peterson's mother bestowed upon him).With no shortage of \\"true crime\\" books available, and plenty of \\"true crimes\\" to inspire authors, Blood Brother will nonetheless remain especially significant. Bird shared an undeniable closeness to Peterson -- the kind of bond that encourages loyalty. The kind of loyalty that can twist and exploit the unconditional love of a family.Bird's account of her descent into, and eventually, painstakingly, out of denial sets her book apart from others of the genre. Those interested in the case will definitely enjoy Blood Brother. Even those with merely a passing interest will appreciate her honesty."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I finished this book last night. Anne Bird's description of her last trip to visit Scott in jail (before San Quentin) was depressing and disturbing. Her description of Scott in that strange bulky outfit given to prisoners who might be a suicide risk, and how he was telling her everything would be all right once he got to the appeals process, left me with a sinking feeling. I felt sorry that her long lost half-brother turned out to be a killer. Anne had loved him so much and felt a bond with him at first. I felt depressed that such a good-looking, charming young man who should have had the world at his fingers, threw it all away because he felt trapped with a pregnant wife.The woman who wrote this book is not the plain blonde we would see on TV speaking on behalf of the Petersons. That girl is married to Scott's older brother. The author of this book, Anne Bird, is the baby girl Jackie Peterson gave up for adoption back in the 60s. Anne was raised in a loving home along with 3 other siblings. She also has a biological brother who Jackie also gave up for adoption. Jackie and her family came back into Anne's life in 1997.I found this book fascinating to read, and I read it pretty quickly. Scott spent alot of time at Anne's home after Laci disappeared and before his arrest. Its terrible that Scott hanging around, and Anne's initial defense of him, caused such problems in her marriage. I wish Anne and her husband the very best."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book reveals two things: It provides the reason Scott killed Laci (instead of seeking a divorce) AND it exposes his mother, Jackie Peterson, for being the dysfunctional dishonest person that she is. After hearing the \\"Amber Tapes\\" at the trial, Anne asked Jackie to respond to Scott's lies - such as when he called Amber and claimed to be calling from Paris and other various places; Jackie defended Scott by claiming that his statements weren't really lies because Scott had been to those places before! (Whew! With logic like this, no wonder she had 3 out-of-wedlock births in the 60's by different men!) Jackie had also told Anne several different stories explaining why Scott was found with $15,000 in cash at the time of his arrest. Later, Jackie testified in court to one version that didn't make any sense. Also, one cannot ignore the fact that this is a woman who gave birth to 4 children by four different men -- hardly normal, especially back in the 1960's, and the first three were born out-of-wedlock.The fact that Scott was viewed by his parents (his mom, in particular) as the \\"perfect, golden boy\\" was the \\"set up\\" for him to commit murder once Scott decided that he didn't want the resposibilities and financial burdens of fatherhood. He knew that his carefully constructed image of being \\"kind and caring\\" would be destroyed if he were to divorce Laci (either during her pregnancy or sometime after the birth of Connor) because he would not have had a \\"good and acceptable reason\\" to divorce Laci. He also knew that divorcing Laci with a baby would carry an 18 year financial burden of child support and a few years of spousal support. Even with that, Scott probably could have put up with the financial burden of a divorce if he could have divorced Laci without tarnishing his golden image....but he knew he could not. He concluded that he could not come up with a good reason to divorce Laci that would have been believable to his family and friends -- especially after a baby had been recently born.One point that was not made in the book was how inappropriate it was for a mom (or parents) to label one child as a \\"golden boy\\" when there were other children in the family. It is bad enough to give that name to an \\"only child\\" because no one can live up to that pedestal image and it encouranges disceit, but that label was probably perceived by the other siblings as a \\"put down\\" to them. After all, if he was the golden boy, what were they - last week's hash??Anne's book reveals info that no one else does since she saw \\"behind the scenes\\" of the Peterson extended family. She saw that mother Jackie is a liar and that she (along with husband, Lee) created this golden haired monster. Lee could not have been the good father that he's been made out to be - he left his first wife because he couldn't stand the noise and demands of their little children! He then went out and got himself an expensive car (I think a Corvette - certainly not a dad car. No \\"father of the year\\" for him!Jackie and Lee spoiled Scott because he was the only child that was biologically related to both of them. Their other children were only related to Lee OR Jackie.Since Jackie (Anne's birth mom) had given Anne away for adoption, Anne was able to finally realize the truth without fear of losing her real family (her adoptive family). The rest of the Petersons probably live in fear that if they admit the truth that Jackie and Lee will do something awful to them."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This is the best account I've read about the history and inner workings of the Peterson family. It explains why Peterson would turn out the way he did with a rationalizing mother and a family that never held him accountable for his actions. I would suggest reading this 1st, Deadly Game 2nd, and avoiding Amber Fry's book altogether. As for negative reviews, I don't understand why someone would read any of these books unless they were interested in the details and minutia of the case. That's simply the nature of non-fiction Crime literature."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I read all the reviews, and decided I wanted to read it, anyway.I was surprised by all the negative things that people said. I don't know what they were expecting, but I knew it was her story, and she wanted to tell it.It always interests me when you can get more than just one side to the story. Her's is a quiet background.I highly recommend this book. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.It was very well written, and kept your attention. It had a few typos, but what book doesn't now a days.I just finished reading \\"For Laci\\" and I think... what a waste.There is only one person responsible for all the sadness, and that person is Scott Peterson."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I read this book right after the one written by Laci's mother Sharon Rocha. This one was particularly good because Anne gave a great account of how her brother behaved before and after Laci's murder."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"If you find yourself still interested in the case of Laci Peterson, then this book is for you. It takes you on a journey through the life and death of Laci Peterson through the overlooked point of view of Laci's sister-in-law, Anne Bird. It is a fascinating and thought-provoking book, but no matter how many books are written on this subject nothing will ever change the disheartening ending that Laci Peterson will not get to have the child she had so joyfully looked forward to raising."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"If you read any other books regarding the Peterson case, there's no harm in adding another, though I do believe that anyone that knew Scott or had known the case has tried to make money off this tragic story. I have read almost every book wrote, but it got to a point of repeat. This book however does have a side no other could write about. So I would buy it again."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"If you saw the Dateline episode with the author,you needn't buy this book.I read it in one evening.Lets just say there are no deep revelations here but true crime fans will probably enjoy it...otherwise there are better ways to pass your time."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book makes one wonder just how much does one really want to know about................anything and anyone. Anne's natural curiosity about her birth mother (why not the father?) led her into a dangerous place. In retrospect, would she go there again?This is a very fast read; one lazy summer afternoon is all it takes. The chronology of the book is good but it is a little redundant in places. I would have liked to have a bit more information about Scott's earlier years. However, this book is totally Anne's perspective and she didn't know him during that time. Clearly Anne writes to cleanse herself and to forgive herself for being so slow to see what was happening. This can be annoying but in this case it is not.Anne's adoptive parents and her husband are saints. At times one wonders how they supported her decisions.I am not a Peterson trial junkie but I found this an interesting read. Certainly a situation as unlikely as this makes for a good story.Not stated but there is a warning here: turning one child into a spoiled brat, a \\"golden boy\\" is not doing ANYONE any favors."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"You've seen in other reviews that this book is not well written and that's true. However, as you read about Scott Peterson and the family he grew up with, you start to recognize the story of a monster. Anne Bird probably wrote this book as therapy to come to terms with the horrors of forming a bond with a long lost brother only to come to the slow realization that he was not what she thought he was. Anne fills in the gaps of the real life story about a man living two lives and a family that continued to \\"forgive\\" him despite the horrors of what he'd done.It took a lot of courage for Anne to say that Scott Peterson murdered his wife and unborn child. Don't judge this book on the quality of her writing, but on the content of what she has to tell the world."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book was very interesting. Amber's book was good but this one is even better. it reads more like a novel than a true crime book. you will learn more about Scott and his family than any other book on the case that I have seen. anyone that has followed this case should read this book.you will find it hard to put down until the very last page."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"There will be pieces/parts/details in this book that you haven't see or read in mainstream media (e.g., Scott being bummed that no one \\"hit on\\" him when he visited a gay bar, Jackie Pee's (continuous!) snide comments toward and about Laci), but Anne Bird is no writer. Reasonable read if you aren't bothered by poor structure and a sometimes choppy flow."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book is filled with new information - a great behind the scenes look into the Peterson and Rocha families. I have more of an understanding now of their courtship and relationship. The list Anne makes of her reasons she believes Scott is guilty has merit. Even Scott's smallest behaviors and lies all point toward his absolute guilt and Anne does a great job to help us try to grasp all of the facts. I am so glad she wrote this book. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I have read all the \\"Scott Peterson\\" books that have came out, this one seemed to be more interesting as I felt Anne Bird told it like it was. Yes, she may seem bitter about some things but hey, most of us want to read it like the person feels it! Jackie Peterson, I feel bad for her and her family but she needs to come to terms that her son IS a murderer, and you can love your son but not condone his actions. I would suggest getting the book thru e-bay or borrow one from a friend as it is a fast read."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I'm sure the poor reviews here were written mostly by the unrepentant Peterson family and friends. Mrs. Peterson appears to be a narcissist who raised a sociopath. Her behavior throughout has been appalling. Thank God the author of this book was raised elsewhere."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"First, I admit I was a Scott Peterson Murder trial junquie. But even if you are not, this memoir is very interesting and has lessons we can all learn from it. Second, I picked up this book expecting little or about as much as I got from Amber Frey's book. I knew most of the info in Amber's book prior to reading it. I did not know the early details of Amber's life to the degree she wrote about them in her book. I knew very little about Anne Bird except that she was given up for adoption by Jackie Peterson and had met her biological mother several years ago. This book validated most of my before unsubstantiated feelings about Jackie Peterson and many about Scott. I had the sense that Anne was not really all that comfortable ever with Jackie, but tried for a fairy tale ending even though she knew that ending could go either way from books she had read about adopted children finding their biological parents. Thank God for Anne that the Grady family who adopted her truly loved her and supported her through all phases of this ordeal. I could not put this book down and read it straight through. My Mother immediately followed and did the same. I still have some questions for Mrs. Bird-How is her family-the Gradys now; did they continue to love and support her? What was Lee Peterson really like? There were very few comments about Lee. I would have liked to have known more about his relationship to Scott-to Jackie with her children, to Tim Bird. How is Anne's marriage now? What is Anne's relationship to Don, her biological brother now? How is Don's relationship to the Petersons and Scott-Don did after all ask Anne how well she knew Scott-not sure why that question came about. Had Don decided Scott was guilty before Anne did? I wondered how deep the conversation between Don and Anne was about Scott's guilt or innoncence. This woman, Anne, who had a wonderful life, almost perfect, got a call from her biological brother, Don, and her life has never been the same since. I believe Anne Bird was truly a victim of Scott as well as Jackie. The one thing that enraged me more than anything in the whole book was how Jackie had the nerve to ask Anne who she gave up, to take in Scott, so he could hide out from the press and others. The poor girl was only married a short while and had a child. Anne being raised so nicely probably felt she had no choice, and she probably wanted at some deep level to please her biological mother. Mrs. Bird is just so lucky to have the Gradys and Tim as well as to have found Attorney, Gloria Allred to represent and protect her. God bless Anne for her honesty here and with the police, and I truly hope her life will return to more like the way it was before the day Don called her."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book will basically tell you everything that you already know from watching Nancy Grace and CNN. I do think that Scott Peterson is the scum of the earth, however, this book in no way proves that he committed murder. Sorry, but it's true."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This was a very disappointing read. Anne Bird offered no real insights to why she believed her brother was guilty. The writing was terrible and all the stories were contrived. The editor should have done a better job. The author was pretty much rambling in no direction until the end of the book. It was also obvious throughout the book that she wasn't really a part of the Peterson family, \\"in the know\\" or very close to Laci. The fact that she's trying to turn her various encounters at holiday functions into something more was very apparent. Save your money and borrow it from the library!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This candid and compelling book by Scott's half-sister, Anne, is a chilling account of one sister's heartache ignited by a brother's betrayal, deception and the murder of her much loved sister-in-law, Laci Peterson. Anne gives a vivid portrayal of Scott the loving brother and Scott the sociopath turned murderer.It is a brave and heartwrenching behind the scenes look at one of the most calculated double murders of our time."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I am sort of ashamed that I bought this book. Although I have no problems with being a true crime fan (I have come to grips with that), I know it is always pretty self-serving and low of people to profit from misery and crime in their lives. I mean, it might seem that the justification is that STRANGERS are making money off their family tragedies, so why not them? Well, I guess it just seems gross. Most true crime is written by professional writers and reporters or former law enforcement officials who are just reporting the facts.On one hand, reading objective accounts of the crimes and trials or the lives of the victims and criminals is probably more enlightening, but one can't help but wanting to know what it is like to be...the friend (Ann Rule to Ted Bundy)...the lover (Amber Frey to Scott Peterson) or in this case, the sister of the person who perpetrated crimes against humanity.Still, it is obvious that these people (not so much Ann Rule- writing true crime was already her job when she came to realize her friend Ted Bundy was responsible for some horrible murders) just want to profit from the hoopla. I mean, there are tons of books about OJ Simpson out there from every angle.This book seems, at least on the surface (if you ignore everything I just said) to be a very honest account of a tragic story that the author became embroiled in after reuniting with her birth family. It is not necessarily a smoking gun in the sense that there was no secret confession/admission of guilt, no clearer picture as to Scott Peterson's guilt than what was already out there. Still and all, it was a quick read and a fascinating first-hand account of what we all just saw on television.I am still, however, bothered by the way people jump at the chance to profit from these terrible events, especially since they would not be able to do so if people like me weren't so darn fascinated by it all.PS- Amber Frey is full of it when she claims she did it for Laci and Conner!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I read the first review above and had to say what I was thinking after reading Ms. Bird's book. What is it with Jackie Peterson? From what I read in this book, I can't help but think she knew, (if she wasn't involved), if he told her about the sitter he'd have told her about Frey and probably the conversation about \\"losing his wife\\". This may not have been the best book in the world but it definitely may me think something isn't right with that Mother!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"The book kept me totally engrossed. Read it in one afternoon. The only fault I have with the book , is it way way too short. Give much insight into the psychology that makes up the Peterson family. Especially Jackie the mom. I wish I had a way to contact Anne Bird, because I would like her to know how courageous and honest I think it was for her to have written this book. Too much denial and dishonesty in the Peterson family.How I see it she is the only one in the family that has the honesty to tell it like it is. You go girl!!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I read this book because Sharon Rocha mentioned it briefly in her book \\"For Laci\\" and it is a good book to hear some of the other side of the story.

I would recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"First I read \\"For Laci\\" by Sharon Rocha -- surely the saddest book I've ever experienced. I was amazed at the details Laci's mother could recall. And then upon reading \\"Blood Brother\\", I knew that Mrs. Rocha's memories about Scott Peterson were for real. While reading \\"Blood Brother\\" I was amazed at how far people will go to give the \\"suspect\\" the benefit of the doubt -- how much we don't want to believe anyone we personally know could be guilty of such heinous crimes. I was particularly moved at the telling of the story by Scott about the pet cemetary -- how he, though a seeming monster, deep down, needs to unburden himself from this evil that he knows is in him.... made me cry. Only Christ can listen to Scott's confession without condemning him."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book enlighten me.... I loved it....

I was disappointed in the way she said she handled her relationship with Scott. All in all the book proved to be anticlimactic and it would have been better to just write all this in a journal or diary. It was mostly about her and her feelings or lack thereof.When I finished reading the book, I said \\"What a loser.\\" Simultaneously Anne Bird's and Scott Peterson's faces appeared in my minds eye."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Book came fairly quickly, it's in excellent shape and I am looking forward to reading it."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Written in straightforward, serviceable narrative style, \\"Blood Brother\\" is authored by Anne Bird, half-sister of convicted killer Scott Peterson. A few years previous to the disappearance of Peterson's wife Laci, Bird had been reunited with her birth mother, Jackie Peterson, and had found another warm and welcoming family.\\"Blood Brother\\" describes Bird's slowly growing suspicions that Peterson may indeed be guilty. Her book gives us many previously unknown details of Scott's whereabouts, actions, and behavior before he was arrested. She describes her increasingly conflicted feelings about the man their mother referred to as \\"my golden boy.\\" Although she realizes that she risks alienating the warm relationship she had established with her birth mother, she becomes convinced of Scott's guilt.\\"Blood Brother\\" is an absorbing look into a California family's lifestyle of ease and comfort, unravelled by violent death and sensational publicity. Although Regan Books doubtless rushed it into print, the book is well-crafted, articulate, and well worth reading. Recommended."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I closely followed the Scott Peterson trial, and this book gave a lot of insight into what Scott was up to after Laci went missing until he was arrested. I read Amber Frey's book, and I must say I enjoyed Anne Bird's book much more because it was written from a perspective that had not been shown on tv. However, I would recommend reading both books because they seem to complement each other. When Scott leaves Anne's house and goes somewhere to meet Amber, most of the time Anne doesn't know where he's going. But then when you read Amber's book, it tells exactly what he was doing around that time."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I READ THE BOOK OUT OF INTEREST SINCE I FOLLOWED THE TRIAL PRETTY CLOSE. I ALMOST ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS GUILTY FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE ACTED. AFTER READING THIS BOOK I THOUGHT THAT HIS SISTER (ANNE BIRD) WAS AN IDIOT. I WOULD HAVE NEVER LET HIM CLOSE TO MY CHILDREN AND ALMOST RUIN MY MARRIAGE. HE HAD NO CONSIDERATION FOR HER FEELING AND FAMILY. HIS MOTHER IS A NUT CASE AND AFTER READING THIS BOOK I THINK SHE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER HERSELF ALWAYS COVERING FOR HER GOLDEN BOY WHAT A NUT."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This is just another person making money from the deaths of Laci and Conner Peterson. Ms. Bird comes across as a very jealous sister, jealous of Laci and her beauty and jealous of Scott and his relationship with his Mother.I read this book through to the end and then I went back and re-read her \\"reasons\\" she believed that Scott was guilty. First of all, they weren't reasons, just senseless drivel drummed up by the publishing company and author to make it appear that there was actually a reason for her to believe in Scott's guilt.When she talks about her son going missing she doesn't let us know that he was \\"lost\\" in a hotel room with all his relatives and was located within a minute or so. The rest of the reasons are also misleading nonsense.

Yes, her story about reconnecting with her birthmother was interesting but just because Scott Peterson happened to be her brother doesn't mean she needed to write a book about it. Anne Bird is making money from this. It's revolting. I honestly think she just wanted to make some easy money and get some attention. She has nothing to add that we don't already know concerning his guilt. She wasn't ask to testify, so obviously the procecutors didn't feel she had anything to add. I think that their mother delivered two sociopaths, one to kill and one to profit from it. This woman is a piece of work."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"For those of you who have been intently following the details of the Scott Peterson case it is vety illuminating. You feel as if she is telling the story right to you and you become an intense listener. Someone who is impartial and tells it like it was."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"A book that is very poorly written, doesn't present any valuable and thoughtful information, focuses on many other external and quite secondary issues - Anne's issues, very repetitive on many occasions, and extremely poorly executed.In my opinion, as other reviewers have already mentioned, Anne was simply struggling to get into the spotlight most likely because her life was quite insignificant, and she was dying for attention. Anne is a person with many, many issues herself, which makes it difficult for her to write a story about someone else without bringing the focus over and over again onto her and her life as whole. It seems as Anne's main reasoning for writing this book is to assure her readers how closely she grew with her biological mother and how close she was with Laci and her brother Scott (if she really was that close - where did all the loyalty toward her biological mother and brother go?!!! The spotlight was more important, I guess!). When one reads the book, one can gather that she wasn't close at all but wanted and wished that she were -- for the same reason that I mentioned in the beginning -- just to be in the spotlight.The list -- I didn't understand why the book's title was chosen to be named after that silly two pages of writing, which is probably the worst part of the book to begin with. The things that are listed are as a reasoning of a 10-year old kid. An adult could, and when writing a book, should do better!This book is artificial, exaggerated, and childish-reasoned! It is just another way of trying to bring some variety into someone's quite boring and monotonous life."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Great behind-the-scenes book! Many more unheard of details. Stunning revelations about Scott's bizarre behavior! As if we didn't see enough already.And BTW, did you see Scott's \\"ailing\\" mother carrying furniture out of Laci & Scott's house on tv?!?!Whatever criticism you have for the author's decision to write this book, and even if you judge her for what you deem \\"mercenary\\" behavior, you cannot dismiss this book. This book rings of pure and clear truth.Ms. Bird is finally being objective. People who weren't adopted don't understand and don't want to accept that Bird can look at her birth family objectively - because they're NOT really her family. She's not turning on them, they turned on her when she was given away as a baby. She was always an outsider, no more than a \\"good friend\\" to the Petersens. I can see that Ms. Bird has finally gotten over needing her birth-family and birth-mother's approval. Good for you Ms. Bird!!!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"As another reviewer pointed out when reviewing this book, the author has the unique perspective of being able to observe Scott Peterson and the Peterson clan before Laci's death and after Laci's death. That is why this is one of the best books written about the Peterson case because it goes beyond the public side that we spent watching on tv. Anne Bird presented a point of view that no other Peterson insider could or would dare to make.Her personal story was compelling as were the 33 reasons why she thought Scott Peterson was guilty. Bird even provided a theory as to how Scott Peterson murdered Laci and that made as much or more sense as any other theory put forth regarding a bloodless crime.As interesting as her observations regarding Scott's continual lying and odd behavior were, Bird also provided some insight as to just how much in denial her Peterson relatives were and how many half-truths and outright lies were offered by Jackie Peterson.After I finished this book, I came up with my own list of insights:1. I have absolutely no lingering doubt when it comes to Scooter. He is where he should be.2. Scooter's mother Jackie is as much as a sociopath as he is, which begs the question do sociopaths raise sociopaths.3. Anne Bird is one lucky lady to have a super adoptive family and the only thing she has to be grateful to Jackie Peterson for is that she gave her up at birth.4. Anne Bird shouldn't beat herself up too much about trying to believe in Scott. Sociopaths are really hard to spot.This is really a great book for any observer of the Peterson trial to read. I couldn't put it down and read it from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I just hope everyone reads this eye-opening book. Thank God, Ms. Bird, that you finally came to know the truth about your brother. And please, do not dare let the negative reviews get to you. The truth is never, ever wrong. I could only imagine the gratitude that Sharon Rocha feels towards you for your courageously coming forward and speaking out for Laci and Conner. Especially considering that Scott will probably never confess to this horrific crime that he committed. Always think of the peace you will have, by knowing that down the road there won't be any regrets that you never spoke out in truth for Laci and her unborn child.

Obviously, Jackie's unfortunate childhood and growing up in an orphanage affected her psychologically and she sounds like a woman with deep issues (the apple doesn't fall far from the tree...) I also believe Ms. Bird was blessed to be given the gift of her adoptive family. I won't tell much but one thing I could NOT believe was how Jackie actually charged her own newly found biological daughter for something in her own antique store. There just seemed to be something so telling from that for me. All in all, this is a fascinating account of what Scott was doing when he wasn't getting the mail, walking his dog, talking on his cell phone or lying to diane sawyer (his nose got more and more red as that interview went on). That's really all we got to \\"see\\" of Scott. Also, Ms. Bird's theory on how the murders may have been committed chilled me to the bone. I had never thought of that option before."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Who wrote the earlier reviews of this book? the Peterson Family?Jackie Peterson is one step away from being a wacko herself(if she ain't already). I can't say that I have ever seen a more blatant example of family members (not the Author) being blind to the truth or just plain liars like Scott. Anne Bird owes the Peterson Family NOTHING !!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This chilling account of a perfectly normal, nice-seeming woman who reunites happily with her biological family only to be drawn in to the Laci Peterson murder case is truly scary on many levels.Anne Bird was given up for adoption by Jackie Peterson (then Latham) at birth. Raised by two wonderful people who gave her every advantage, Anne was a happy college student when she was contacted by her biological family--and went on to meet her mother Jackie and her half siblings--one of whom was the family's \\"golden boy\\"--Scott Peterson.Anne and Scott became very close, or so Anne thought at the time, and she especially adored Laci, whose bubbly personality enchanted her. Laci's charm, however, was lost on mother-in-law Jackie, whose behind-the-scenes snipes at her were so cruel, according to conversations cited in this book, that this reader was quite taken aback. Although Bird apologizes for her biological mother repeatedly, it doesn't ring true.And neither does Scott's entire personality, which Anne had taken on faith. As the events of Laci's disappearance take place, Anne, who is in total denial about her brother's possible involvement, even to the point of hurting her own marriage, nevertheless cannot but notice Scott's seeming lack of caring, or any emotion at all. He finds time to hit on Anne's attractive adult babysitter, even mixing \\"flirtinis\\" for her! After nearly breaking down with anxiety, Anne finally comes to terms with what she had been hiding from herself all along: The brother she has come to love so dearly has a VERY secret side.As a lover of true-crime books, I found this seemingly innocuous book to be very scary. In fact, it gave me nightmares, not from anything Bird said in the book, but from the message behind it: You never really know another human being. Quick, fast, read...not really revealing, except for Jackie Peterson's less-than-perfect side, but riveting nonetheless."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This young woman has not only proven that the real parent is the one who raises you, but she has struggled with \\"what price family?\\" And has come up with the right answers. Although Jackie Peterson is shown as a self centered, my way or the highway mother, Ms Bird has not in any way done a hatchet job on ANYONE. She is still conflicted and obviously cares about all of her family.This comes across as a book of honesty and integrity. I am glad I read it. It is so poignant that you find yourself feeling sorry for EVERYONE involved in this entire tragedy, even Scott Peterson. He is guilty of ruining so many lives with hismonstrous murder of laci and connor but he is truly pathetic and will probably never comprehend fully what he has done. And if one digs deep enough, this young man's charactr flaws are related to 'mommie dearest.'"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This book gives you an opportunity to see Scott Peterson in yet another perspective. A unique perspective in that he lived with Anne AFTER Laci went missing. She reveals more examples of Scott's inappropriate behavior. Thru her eyes you see another side of Scott. She also gives you more insight into Jackie Peterson, her relationship with Scott and her DISLIKE for Laci.She offers a new hypothesis as to HOW Laci was murdered. This book is worth the read if you are interested in the case."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I just finished the book....an easy read. What seems to stay with me after reading the book is how \\"void\\" of emotion Scott appeared to be based on Bird's description of him. Of course the experts say this is fitting for a \\"sociopath\\". He just seemed to be so \\"surface\\" and nothing about his behavior seemedconvincing that he really \\"cared\\" one little bit about his missing wife and baby other than a periodic fleeting comment. As far as Anne's denial...I think thereare people who are very insightful and find it easy to get a quick read on people. I don't think Anne is one of those people. Or, she was \\"too close to see the forest through the trees\\" possibly but with the help of her husband, the media, Jackie, and good ole' Scott himself she was able to see Scott objectively in the end.Many of the reviewers dislike that she wrote a book. I see it differently. I think that by writing this book she helps the general public try to make sense of a crime that captivated a nation. Scott and Laci seemingly had the perfect life....yet we learn he may be a \\"sociopath\\". Sociopaths are people who are very hard to spot....no one in a million years thought Scott could do this to his wife. Remember Ted Bundy....he was a fairly attractive and social yet he was a \\"serial killer\\"! The prosecution never really presented anyone throughout the trial who could say anything very negative about Scott before the murder. Even Anne had to really search \\"deeply\\" almost to the point of being annoyingly naive. Yet to give her the benefit of a doubt she also saw the \\"wonderful\\" side of Scott...the side that said and did all the right things. She had to go even deeper than what Scott presented on the surface and evaluate what she thought other people, \\"normal\\" people would be like in certain situations. In the end, I think she realized Scott was a shell of a person and she could begin to process the possibility that he indeed was capable through his make-up to kill his wife. I think her \\"inside\\" observations...(remember, she isn't a trained professional)could prove useful for those of us interested in understanding a case like this...a person like Scott...now a named \\"sociopath\\".We always hear about the devastation murderers or say serial killers cause but we don't always get a truly good feel for the \\"why\\". I think any insight from a person who knew them and has the gutts to spill the beans could prove helpful. Someday it may prove useful to someone living with a \\"sociopath\\" or \\"serial killer\\" to have a very well researched profile that they learn about in their high school human relations class. ha ha thats a leap and kind of a joke but not a bad idea now that I think about it."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I thought Anne Bird's story was interesting and gave a somewhat different perspective, that of someone who was going to do her dead-level best to give her new brother every benefit of the doubt, maybe even beyond what was reasonable. I can certainly sympathize with her. She had just discovered her \\"new\\" family and was enjoying getting to know them, especially her new sister-in-law whom she could tell would quickly become a dear and close friend, the same way everyone felt about Laci who knew her. She didn't want to believe that her brother could murder his wife and unborn child. She came close to jeopardizing her marriage for her belief in Scott and was even compelled to seek counseling to help her deal with her inner conflict. She suspected deep down the truth long before she was willing to admit it to herself, and that hurt; she felt guilty and disloyal. She didn't want to lose her new family, but she didn't want to live in a delusion.Of course as time passes and she can't hold back the doubts any longer, the shine begins wear off this new family. She was already baffled by Jackie's constant, petty criticisms of Laci, but then Scott's suspicious behavior followed by Jackie's rants against everyone from the Modesto PD to the Rocha family, and her thinly veiled instructions to Anne to outright lie to authorities and the press about Scott's whereabouts or activities become more and more difficult to overlook. In the end, though, I wish she had chosen a somewhat different title for her book; perhaps something like \\"The 33 Reasons That Made Me Feel Like Scott Peterson is Probably Guilty\\" would have been more accurate. To be honest, her list of reasons is really nothing more than her personal observations and opinions of his conduct after Laci vanished. A few of them are astute observations, and I agree with her that many of them are suspicious and inappropriate behaviors, but the list itself has little or no legal substance whatever. I don't believe she could have contributed anything of substance to the trial for either the prosecution or the defense. But unlike many reviewers here, I don't think Anne was at all bitter about having been \\"given up\\" as a baby, and thus wrote this book to spite her birth mother. Quite the contrary: she had a MUCH better life with the parents who raised her than she would have living with her single, biological Mom. Also unlike many reviewers here, I don't have any problem with someone getting paid for writing a book so long as that book is interesting. I thought the book was very interesting (and a little sad for her as she was really in a delicate position) and I'm very glad I read it. I hope that by now she has come to terms with her past predicament and has achieved some peace of mind."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I finished this book in less than a day....couldn't put it down.

How obvious!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I was pregnant at the time Lacy went missing. That, and being a school teacher myself, really drew me to this case. I have read a few of the books as well as followed the case on TV. I felt this book was interesting because you could see the struggle with Mrs. Bird's feelings. From one side, she was not connected to the Peterson family throughout her life so she was finally able to get to a place where she could see the reality of the situation; a place she may not have been able to get to if she was not adopted all those years ago. In a way, she was as equally Laci's sister as she was Scotts. You could also see the struggle for her to believe his innocence. To have the family that abandoned her so long ago take her in. Although Mrs. Bird did not have \\"new\\" information to pass along in the book, it is written so that you can feel her struggle. Thank goodness she was adopted by the family that raised her. I think in the end, the morals and values they instilled allowed her to realize the unthinkable!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I just finished reading Blood Brother and I'm left feeling a multitude of things. First of all, the book was a little difficult to get through because Anne wrote it herself. It would have been nice to have a little cleaner of a book to read. Sometimes it would ramble and stray a little bit.This story also goes to show that Scott Peterson and his parents were in denial the entire time this ordeal was unfolding. Anne was too, but then she saw the light and decided not to risk her true family for this false one.I'm not an adopted child, so I had a hard time relating to Anne's relationship with her biological family. She kept stating that the family that raised her (the Gradys) were awesome and could not be replaced. However, it seemed like the Petersons (and Lathams) just slipped right into place as a secondary family. She seemed to attach right on to her role as older to sister to Scott. She really believed in this guy that she had only known for a few years. It was almost unbelievable to read.If you are an addict of the case then I would read this book, but just don't expect a best seller-type novel."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I was one of those people who watched the unfolding of this case daily - In fact, I was glued to the \\"Court Channel\\" several times per day, just waiting for the latest news re: Laci & Scott. Although I hate to admit it, I felt as though Scott Peterson was guilty from the first time I saw his face - I don't know exactly what it was, but I just knew something wasn't right...In Blood Brother, Anne Bird discusses her realtionship to the Peterson's & how she became tangled up in this tragedy. She describes her journey from absolute belief in his innocence, to finally a realization that he was, in fact, guilty.I've always wondered how some people can still defend their loved ones despite so much evidence to the contrary, but after reading this book, I think I'm beginning to understand... It appears that both love & fear play into this denial.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this case, as well as those interested in family dynamics. It describes the behind-the-scenes actions that were not discussed on t.v., and allows one to get a glimpse of how a family reacts to such a horrendous trajedy."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"So she's related to him, big deal. I read the book like most people to get an insight to what happened and get a few more details. I find it sad that she was so quick to make a buck based on her \\"hunches\\". She's a mother of 2 young kids, why is most of the book about her drinking too much with Scott at her home? At one point she says she drives a few hours to spend time with her adoptive parents, only to leave her 2 kids there for the weekend so her and Scott can go drinking. What is the point of this?So he acted bizarre (we could see that just watching him on TV). It's one thing to feel caught up in it, but I think you should have a little dignity and respect for yourself and not run around with many heresay stories. That's all this book is. I'm sure Jackie (her birth mom) is sorry she ever found her long lost daughter. Maybe this book is PAYBACK for Scott being a child that was chosen, not put up for adoption like herself.To see her on Oprah and Good Morning America and Dateline, etc etc etc. just to discuss what she thought about him...give me a break. You didn't write this book to deal with it yourself - that's what journals are for - it's all about the $$. And to call Laci a close friend when she only saw her 4 times tops...How bad do you need to stick yourself in this story? Scott is paying for this crime already. But thanks for the extra kicks when I'm down, Sis."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"As I was walking out of the book store with this copy under my arm I was feeling a bit embarrassed. As if I had not seen and heard enough about this case on the TV I decided to part with my money to read more. Well it was from his sister so I thought there could be some interesting bits and I admit it, I was interested in case the minute a talking head breathlessly starting taking about the missing pregnant lady in California. I do not know what exactly I thought I was going to find in the book that was not already splashed all over the TV and it turns out that there really was not much new in the book that could be considered exciting. It was basically just this gals story and her interactions with Scott Peterson over the last two - three years before he was convicted.As for the 33 reasons I found myself guffawing and rolling my eyes at about 75% of them. Some of them were so ham handed and over done that you would have thought Tonight Show writers had added a few to the mix for humor. Add in the fact that the editor or publisher should have used a far heaver hand with the book due to the inexperience and down right poor skills of the author, you get a book that has a very short life span once the memory of this event fades from the short term memory banks. The good news is that this had to have been the largest font I have ever seen in a book, they could barley get 20 words per page. I assumed all in an effort to increase this gossip / money grab story to book length.Overall I thought the book was poorly written and almost bordering on libal, yet I still enjoyed it. Think of the book as this weeks addition of a gossip tabloid and that about hits in on the head. The book is just like fast food - quick, easy and tasty, but not really good for you. It should just about give you the Peterson case OD you need to move on to the next made for TV drama."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Writing may be good for the soul but this one breaks the heart. One hallmark of the \\"Greatest Generation\\" was their refusal to air their dirty linens in public or comment on personal matters. Exploiting human misery, though, is a booming cottage industry.Michael Moore makes millions off sufferings from terrorism, school shootings and war. The Buckingham Palace crew has reaped profits from the shoddy Princess Di \\"story\\". Associates of Bill Clinton went to the bank with derogatory stories about their \\"friend\\".This is the latest twist - an admission/confession/explanation in which relatives/friends bare all. As far as evidence goes, it adds absolutely nothing except a resolve that this man had the capacity to do what he did. As a father of adopted children her take was interesting but she needs to resolve some issues. His family life may be interesting but who really wants all these lurid details about this disturbed individual? This was better than the awful tome by Scott's \\"girlfriend\\", Amber, but that isn't saying much. Speaking of \\"girlfriend\\", isn't it amazing how easy we adjust to media talk?Now that Scott is convicted, I hope Ms, Bird finds some inner peace and closure to what seems like a life of suppressed anger. As for as uncovering the \\"real\\" Scott Peterson, that will have to wait for another day when someone more objective can look at the situation."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Her skin, her hair, her smile, her dimples. Lacey- the doll-like bride. Scott is the golden child and his adoptive sister has a butt load of info about his relationship and wants to air the family's dirty laundry. HMMMMMMMM. Maybe she killed Lacey and framed her bro in order to get rid of the \\"golden boy\\". It would be an interesting twist if nothing else."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I did find the book interesting,however the more I read I was shocked by the fact that she involved her REAL parents in this cesspool. I am sure they were embarrased and maybe even frightened. She gave Scott a key to her parents cabin at Lake Arrowhead, plus a key to their home in San Diego. Her husband made it clear to her that he did not want this guy in his house and she would whine \\"He's my little brother\\". She owed nothing to the Petersons yet she drug her family through this sewer. She admits her marriage is in trouble. Anne you should have thought about the people you REALLY owe something to."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Not worth the paper its printed on. Sour grapes it looks like, her mother gave her away and kept Scott, not only that they were well off. I take what she says with a grain of salt. I truly believe shes just trying to cash in on a tragedy. She should be ashamed of what she is doing to her family !! Would you write a book like this about your brother?? Just as sick as Amber Frey."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I had thought Scott was guilty. Then I found out he was my cousin (as are you, we share the same great-great grandparents). So I started researching the case. How can a man be convicted on the way the media portrays him? Anne, I am confused about why you felt the need to write this book when Scott had already been convicted? Also, you failed to provide any compelling evidence to me to prove his guilt. It's heartbreaking."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"When I bought this book, I thought it was going to have some new convincing evidence why Scott was guilty that hadn't be revealed before. It didn't. If you didn't believe Scott was guilty when you purchased the book, you wouldn't believe he's guilty after you finished reading it. There's virtually nothing new here from Anne. Alot of what she says was already mentioned before a long time ago. There are some incidents in the book, that seem to be fictional to me. It seemed to be put in there to feed a certain market of people that I'll call extreme Scott haters. Those are the kind of people who followed the trial and every show about the trial everyday, went to court tv message boards and posted how much they hated the peterson family and read everything about the case and couldn't wait for new information to come out. These are the kind of people who took the death of Laci Peterson and turned into some kind of fun game for themselves where they could make jokes about how Scott killed Laci and everything involving the case. While I believe Scott did it, I am willing to hear those who are not so certain to hear their points of view, extreme Scott haters are not. They don't want to hear anything that doesn't paint Scott as a cold blooded pyscho. Personally, I think it's enough that Scott has been convicted and is serving a death sentence for the crime he commited but for some people, they have to continue talking about the case and not letting it drop. Anyway, some of the \\"scenes\\" the book seem to be written just for those types who love to hate Scott and his mom. You can just imagine them reading it and loving it and saying to their poor husbands \\"See! Listen to this, Anne said Jackie said Laci look like Mickey Mouse! She is evil! What a horrible woman.!\\" I'd like to know from Laci's friends if Laci ever said anything to them about having trouble getting along with Jackie Peterson. I don't think Anne would know that much about Laci and Jackie's relationship. She never visited Laci at her home and Laci is hardly in the book. It sounded like Anne barely knew Laci and had mundane conversations with her. Does anyone else find it odd that Anne seems to be the one harping on Laci never thinking things were good enough and trying to make them better. She tries to make it sound like it didn't bother her but the way she brings it up frequently, saying Laci wouldn't wear half her maternity clothes because they weren't good enough, most of her old baby clothes she had to give her wasn't good enough makes you wonder if Laci's need for perfection didn't get on Anne's nerves and not Jackie's. It seemed like the incidents where Jackie \\"says\\" mean things about Laci could been made up so Anne could have a chance to make snide remarks about Laci's perfectionism and put the words into Jackie's mouth. Anne probably realizes that most of the public doesn't like the petersons and that by writing a tell all book that mainly sets out try to slander Scott and Jackie, she is feeding a public demand for people who enjoy hating them. In the beginning of the book, I had no problem in believing what she said about her half brother but toward the end of the book, she turned Scott into someone who she was trying to make evil but it came off as bad camp. I just wanted to know if she had anything to do with the making of the tv movie \\"The perfect husband, the laci peterson story\\" because her book plays out ALOT like that except she's the best friend character where \\"believes\\" he's innocent. The petersons are played as evil, Jackie sounds like the leader of some mafia, \\"You have disappointed the family.\\" LOL! Scott starts calling her sis alot even though he is already like in his 20's when he meets her!!! Then Scott uses a line about killing a cat as a pick up line..sure, that would happen, yeah right! They fight over jewelry that Anne gave Jackie and then Jackie gave Laci. Anne's huband plays the almighty \\"voice of reason\\" who keeps telling her Scott is guilty. Then Anne and Scott go around drinking and go riding around in expensive cars. This book is stupid, it rings false in many parts of it and anybody who reads this will know the author was trying make some easy money and get some media attention."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Don't even read this even if someone will lend you a copy of the book and for pete's sake don't purchase it. It's not worth the price they're asking for it. The most it should have been priced at is about six dollars considering it has nothing new to say. The first thing that annoyed me after I finished reading the whole thing was how easily Anne could turn around and change her opinion of everything she wrote in her book. She talks about her husband pressuring her into seeing Scott as guilty, her therapist she recently sees who later she could claim (if her brother ever manages to get another trial or to convince the Petersons to forgive her) influenced her deceison to change her mind about Scott. It's pretty clear about the question marks by her \\"reasons\\" why Scott is guilty that she isn't sure of anything and she is way over prepared to back up and state she was wrong and be forgiven by her biological family. She wants to remain attached to the Petersons while trashing them at the same time. In the book, she quickly places blame on others like in the babysitter tabloid story leak, not admitting to leaking the story herself, she blames her husband and lets him take the fall so she can stay connected to the Petersons. She reminds me of Latoyia Jackson in a way because she is using the fact that her brother is infamous to further slander him in order to put herself forth and make money in the process. Make no mistakes. The book is not about justice for Laci and Connor at all. I can't even believe she could utter those words. It's like a catch phrase these days to make lots of money for morons who happen to have known Scott or Laci Peterson. It's really sad. The justice for Laci and Connor was taken care of in a court room. It has nothing to do with book sales. And noonne cares what each individual of Scott's family feels about his situation of the events leading up to his arrest and his trial. This book seems like it was just an excuse for anne to say nasty things about her mother and to try to convince the world that suddenly she had a realized her brother was guilty after months and months and some therapy and after her husband said he was, she finally chose to believe him. Yeah right. It's almost unbelievable some of things Anne credits Jackie Peterson to having said. I can believe the part about her defending her son and refusing to believe he could kill but the remarks about Laci? I don't know. I say, consider the source. Also, what's up with Anne writing about how she is out partying with Scott many times and showing him off to people and almost relishing in the fact that he has become infamous and easily recognized? Ewwww. Because one of her reasons was Scott was out partying and because since she was with him drinking, does that make her guilty too? ha! Also, you could tell so much of the book doesn't add up. If you figure out when Scott and Laci got married and when she said she was contacted by the family, you will see an error. I think there's also an error regarding when she noticed Scott's appearence changing and the conversations is written like was written by the writer who of the babystitter club books, lol. Alot of this book reminded of the trial when it was discussed and how they were discussing Scott making up the stories. Sounds like Anne inherited that same gene because alot of this sounded like rubbish. She's close to Laci but Laci's hardly in the book before she goes missing and not only that, she has never visited Scott and Laci's modesto home before Laci went missing, all the sudden her her son blurs out constantly about his missing aunt for no apparent reason (except to give drama to Anne's book), she pays 30 dollars for lipstick and goes riding around friend's ferraris, she and her mother fight over cheap jewlry that somehow found a way into Laci's possession allegedly. She called Sharon Rocha gave her a hot tip to find Laci and never received a phone call from Sharon (who she doesn't even know), only from the dective. Okay. Oh and the golden boy nickname was given to peterson pretty much by the media when people were testifying on his behalf during when the jury was deciding between life in prison or death and the court tv anchors were saying Scott sounded perfect like a golden boy or a boy scout..almost too good to be true. I seriously doubt his family had called him golden boy before."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"What motivates a person to turn her back on the birth family that took her in and accepted her without question to write a tell-all book? Money. IRS problems? What happened to the woman who told everyone within earshot that she firmly believed in her brother's innocence, far longer that she admits to in her book? Money. At what point did Ann Bird decide she believed her brother was guilty? When Gloria Aldred whispered promises of easy cash in her ear.The list of 33 reasons she believes her brother is guilty has some odd punctuation. Nearly every reason is followed not by a period but a question mark. What are readers supposed to understand about that?Ann Bird didn't believe her brother was guilty of murder until she was promised money. In all of her communications both public and private she declared not only her firm belief in her brother's innocence, she was working on his behalf. It is thanks to Ann that the marina workers who saw Scott the morning of the 24th were located and gave statements to the fact that when they saw Scott launching his boat the afternoon of the 24th it was easy to see inside as it was backed into the water....easy to see it held nothing more than fishing equipment.Ann shames herself and the birth mother and family who took her in no questions asked, but her jealousy over slim attractive Laci and Scott, the apple of their mother's eye finally got the better of her.If it's possible this book is an even worse read than Amber Frey's book. It's clear the ghostwriter didn't have much time, but in these cases they rarely do. If you want to make money you have to strike while the iron is hot.Take my advice, if you're dying of curiosity and MUST see the book do it over coffee at the book store and don't donate your hard earned money to a woman who would stab her birth mother in the back to pay off the IRS."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"So many of the reviews on this book are obviously slanted -- either pro or con for the adoption/adoptee issues -- instead of the book itself. Sad, isn't it?I found the book to be only average, though it did have some interesting information, if true. How can one ever know if it is true, when subjectively written?The book reviews, on the other hand, are truly eye-opening. From those who find this book a 'tell-all' from an ungrateful birth child and/or adoptee, they speak eloquently about adoption...not Scott Peterson.I must say that it is ridiculous that so many adopted children can't just accept the fact that they are loved by their adoptive parents, and let it go at that. Why stir up the past in seeking birth parents/siblings, when you might find something as ugly as a killer in your blood relatives? Does that mean YOU might be a killer too?And what of this woman's marriage? It is obvious her husband has been a long-suffering spouse of a confused and troubled adoptee.However, in the woman's favor, I must say that at least she didn't seek out her birth family -- they came calling on her. Perhaps she should have just said NO then, instead of finding out something she probably wishes she'd never known: Her blood brother is a killer."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"How can you people who liked this book actually say its something everyone who likes a good suspense should read!?

No kidding - that is one of the 33 reasons Scott Peterson is guilty. The remaining 32 reasons are just as inane.It seems like everyone is out to make a buck on this horrible tragedy - especially one who 'was not kept'. How do you get even? Write a tell all book about the one who 'was kept'. Despite Ms. Bird's claim of total happiness with her adoptive parents and not being too concerned with finding her birth mother, the bitterness comes shining through in this book.I also have a question for Ms. Bird. If you lived life in a fishbowl for two years, accused of killing your husband, hated by everyone and followed constantly by police and the media, just how 'normal' would your behaviour be? None of the behaviours in this book absolutely point to guilt - to me, they just identify someone trying to cope - whether in an appropriate manner or not. He had to be aware that every breath, every blink, every nod was under scruntiny. How could anyone not act 'bizarre'?I am not convinced as to Scott's guilt or innocence. I only know that there is no conclusive evidence that he committed this crime - I can't judge people because they don't look or act in a way that I think is appropriate. I do know that Scott was tried and convicted by the media long before any evidence was heard in court.If he is guilty - may God have mercy on his soul. If he isn't, may some evidence come to light which exonerates him. If he is exonerated, I just wonder how his sister will feel knowing that she sold him out for a buck."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"(Well a kid at heart at least)As Ron Grantsky stated, this is her claim to fame, and how shockingly low people will go to make a name and money for themselves....I do agree that Jackie Peterson is also a sociopath though, I am one of two children given up for adoption as well, and the child kept is my mother's \\"golden child\\" too, so I definately relate to that, however I would never betray my own sense of dignity by writing a book about one of my family members to profit from them, that is despicable!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Another lame attempt to line the wallets of Gloria Allerd and two more \\"victims\\" of Scott.

Why would she trash her brother like this? TO MAKE MONEY! She betrayed her own brother for money. Scott is absolutely guilty -- there is no doubt about that. I have no respect for a sister who would make money from this. I would still love my brother and try to understand what he did -- not that I would ever condone it. I'd still be his sister til the end -- when he's executed. Which he deserves -- but I'd tell him before he took that walk -- that I still love him."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Blood Brother by Anne Bird is a painfully honest account of a woman who was blessed to be raised by a wonderful, adoptive family, a few days after birth, and is later on in her life, reunited with the maternal side of her birth family. A few years after this reunion Anne is relied upon by her birth family to help them, and specifically Scott Peterson, during a difficult set of circumstances~ the aftermath of the murders of Laci and Connor Peterson.While standing behind her brother in the belief of his innocence, Anne lovingly and appropriatley opens her home, family, and life up to Scott Peterson as a means of support and refuge. Anne did this not just for the physical sake of Scott, but also for the emotional benefit of many of the Peterson family who, believe in diluded fashion (especially Lee and Jackie Peterson), that Scott is a victim of a corrupt judicial system.Eventually the behavior of Anne's brother becomes more than Anne can bare. In standing behind him, her relationship with her husband suffers, there is acute consumption of substance as a means of coping with the stress of the situation, and Anne ends up speaking to a therapist who is able to provide Anne with the clarity she needs to make a decision that would change the course of her life forever.Anne is an amaizing woman to put it mildly. Meeting and relating to your birth family is an experience that is best understood by those who have traveled that vein of lifes journey. But Anne had another vein added on to her journey and that would be to loose her newly found family over no longer being able to support the lies greatly needed in order to keep members of this family sane.Anne did what was right when she knew there was no shred left to believe that her brother was innocent of murdering his wife and unborn son.Personally, I am very greatful to Jackie Peterson for giving Anne to a family that possess the gifted capacity as people to unconditionally love, support, and respect her intuition, thoughts and feelings on the matters of her life.Clearly, the Grady family is very deserving of Anne.May God bless Anne, her family, the Grady family, the Rocha/Granski families, and Laci and baby Connor."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I found Anne Bird's Book an OK read. It did not tell us anything new about her Brother's crime( We know he did it)Anyway, I expected more from this book. (Not more about Scott's crime no one will ever know exactly how it happened but we know he did do it.) I was waiting throughout this book for that \\" Big story\\" of what the Peterson family was about. But I did not find anything in here that we didn't already know.In the Book it tells us how another child that Jackie gave up for adoption named Don had found Anne and how he wanted Anne to meet Jackie there Birth Mother who he already met and has a relationship with.In the Book she tells you about Jackie and her eerie feelings about Lacy missing and so many things we knew from seeing it on T.V.But Anne delivers No more about Jackie that we already saw. That Jackie was a nut Job. How unconcerned she was about Laci Missing. Calling Lacy's family Evil because they want to know the truth even after the fling of Amber comes out, Jackie is still insisting this should just all go away and even tries to find a girlfriend for Scott.Yes the woman is Psycho!I wonder why Anne got so involved with them so fast even when she felt Jackie was strange.And to keep in touch so much with them was weird especially when Anne had her doubts. I do feel that Anne liked to be in the midst of this whole situation. It was exciting to Anne and she felt so popular with the Peterson's so she liked the attention.She just regretted it in the end. I honestly feel if Scott were not found guilty she would still be close with him.Also drinking seems to run in the family. Through out the book you will hear what a big drinker Anne is she needs some help herself with that issue.It was at times and interesting read but it got boring many times as well. Either hearing the same thing over again waiting for something big to happen that never did. It was not one of those you can't put down books. A good read for in- between books! I really give this book 3 stars because it did not even tell us anything knew about Jackie. We heard and saw how she was in her interviews on TV and Lee as well. We saw the whole fiasco on TV when The Peterson's tried to stop Sharon Rocha and her family from gathering Lacy's belongings at the house.It seemed like Anne was writing her diary and made it in to a Book and it was not the greatest read it was basically OK."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Anne Bird answered a lot of my questions concerning her personal upbringing and how she began her relationship with her biological mother, Jackie Peterson.I found her book to be very sincere and honest. While I didn't learn very much about the activities of Scott Peterson, as mostly everything in this regard has been discussed or brought out in other media,she did give insight into some of the Peterson \\"clan\\" and how they operate. I think if you are interested in this convicted double murder by Scott Peterson, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Ms. Bird's book is quite interesting if you were an avid follower of the Peterson trial. Since she met the Petersons as an adult, she was able to form an initial mature opinion about the Petersons and happily for everyone, it was positive. Being the good and devoted sister she strived to be, she continually gave Scott's smooth, cunning and odd behavior benefit of the doubt regarding the disappearance of his much-loved-by-everyone wife, Laci. Anne's husband soon had reservations about Scott's guilt and peculiar alibis, but Anne remained consistently insistent of his innocence to the detriment of her marriage. Gradually, her perception and eventual decisive realization and acceptance of Scott's true character forced her to see him as he truly is: pathological liar, sociopath and double murderer.Ms. Bird's book is not dynamic, but it is interesting. I'm sure it was very therapeutic for her to write it and it offers the public another perspective into this riveting, extremely sad incident and all the people involved."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"For all of us out here that followed the case from start to finish (will it ever be really finished?) I say \\"Thank you Miss Bird\\". All this time, I have been trying to figure out why this is one of those \\"fascinating cases\\" that we can't leave alone. I think it may be that we were almost sure that he was guilty, but never absolutly positive. Now because of your honesty and bravery, we finally know. Amber's book was good, but my feeling is that she didn't really let loose. It was good, but kind of stiffly written and not very deep. Blood Brother gives us the real Scott Peterson, behind the scenes when he felt that it was OK to be who he really was. Now we see a bit of how it really was between Laci and Scott. What his parents are really like.This was an incredible case and we needed some kind of closer. This book is the truth, the real truth. Absolutely the best, and I know because I've watched every TV show and read every book that has been written so far. Hands down, this book is so far superior to all the rest, it's not even funny.You go ahead and make your money Miss Bird. You deserve it after having to be around those people who call themselves your family.

The media in turn could only give this particular story a minute or two. It's only when the books come out that you begin to get the whole story.In this book (No. 1 on the NY Times bestseller list) Scott's sister discusses her rather strange life and somewhat reluctantly comes to the conclusion that her brother is guilty.Anne Bird was given up for adoption by her biological mother, Jackie Latham. Only many years later did she make contact with her 'natural' family.I wonder if it wouldn't have been better for her to have never met up with them.

I had questioned before whether or not he planned to kill his wife or if he had simply \\"flipped out\\" I wanted to believe the latter because it is too scary to think that someone you think you know and love and share a life with could be hiding something so horrendous inside of them.I have to disagree with everyone who thinks that this book was meant to condemn the author's mother and her son. I don't think she actually said Jackie was a \\"bad\\" person. She just questioned how far she would go in protecting her \\"golden\\" boy and exactly how much denial one person could be in.I do believe she geniuenely loved her brother and was heart broken when she made her final conclusion regarding his guilt. She fought against what almost everyone thought when they met him. She didn't want to face the truth as it was presented before her regarding a loved one being a murderous monster and who would?This book did go into a lot of the mind of Scott and it truly has made me believe he is where he needs to be. I won't get into the death penalty or my personal feelings on that but I will say him being in jail for the rest of his life is not a bad thing for the environment.One down side I will admit to finding is that she claims she was so close to Laci yet she never went to her home. I think it is possible she played up the closeness of the relationship them two shared for the book's benefit.All in all, if you followed the trial and what to know some unknown stuff. This book will suit you..."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"If you're interested in learning all you can about sociopaths, the family that enables them, and domestic violence as I am, \\"Blood Brother\\" is well worth the read. Full of detail and insight, and with better than average writing, Anne Bird's 214 page book on how she hooked up with her biological mother (Jackie Peterson), half brother (Scott Peterson), and his wife (Laci Peterson) and then gave Scott refuge in her home, was one I could not put down. Athough I had closely followed the details of the Peterson case, becoming a faithful reader of the Modesto Bee and Laci's website, this book added a lot of insight into personalities and interactions of the principals of the case. There's a big difference when Scott and Jackie are media interviewees, telling the world what they want us to hear, and when they're being observed by family and friends. Here are some of the insights I gained thanks to Anne's book:Laci Peterson - The world knows Laci as the smiling photogenic woman in the photographs, but what was she like as a person? And given that it's extremely unlikely that her first experience with domestic abuse would be her murder, why hadn't she apparently complained of abuse, be it verbal or physical beyond hinting of trouble? One of the positive points of this book is that it brought Laci to life. Bubbly and talkative, Laci was a perfectionist when it came to floral arrangements, table settings and the like. As I read about Laci, I was haunted by observations in the book, \\"Not to People Like Us - Hidden Abuse in Upscale Marriages.\\" Upscale, well educated, perfectionist type women who to outsiders seem to be married to the perfect guy, don't like to admit to themselves that their relationship has serious problems, much less to others. With family, friends, and strangers they maintain the illusion of the perfect relationship as best they can, keeping their \\"dirty laundry\\" private.Scott Peterson - It's well known that sociopaths can be extremely charming , lie when it's convenient for them, lack empathy, and are amazingly self-absorbed. Observed by his half sister Anne, her husband and friends, it is clear that Scott Peterson is a textbook case of a sociopath. The search for Laci was in full swing, yet Scott was making \\"flirtini\\" drinks for the Anne's babysitter, fixated on cleaning his pool, and complaining that police were cramping his style. Not exactly the behaviors of a grieving husband. Anne provides many examples of his lies and self-absorbed behavior.Jackie & Lee Peterson - With Scott as a textbook sociopath, it's no surprise that Jackie is one of those \\"my son can do no wrong\\" type of mothers. Anne fills in the details of just how much Jackie will lie, deny, and instruct others to do the same to protect her precious golden boy son. Jackie to Anne: \\"If anyone calls and asks you about Scott and the babysitter, deny it.\\" When Jackie said that to Anne, Lee in the background said, \\"Just say you don't recall.\\" Less high strung than Jackie, Lee's parenting style was the same. It's not surprising that Jackie had pattern of bailing Scott out of trouble throughout his life. Untouched by the consequences of his bad behavior, it's not surprising it got much worse and that he apparently thought he could get away with murder.Anne Bird - Anne strikes me as a nice, rather nave, honest, somewhat people-pleasing kind of person in her book. She freely tells you when she drank too much, used anti-anxiety pills, or used bad judgment. I didn't get that she was out to glorify herself or her husband, nor vilify Scott or Jackie. Having grown up with a happy sheltered life, apparently the kind of person who sees the best in people, and charmed by Scott and Jackie; the idea that Scott could have killed his wife was the last thing on her mind. As evidence trickled in and then snowballed that Scott was doing some major lying and really could not care less about Laci, Anne still would not allow herself to believe that Scott was guilty--long after her husband and the other (non-Peterson) people around her realized he was. She came up with her list of the 33 ways Scott's behavior was inappropriate to help herself process that this and admit to herself Scott may be guilty. On the one hand, I think calling this list 33 reasons Scott is *guilty* is misleading book marketing. Individually, some of the reasons don't necessarily point to murder, for example reason #3 (upgrading his porn channel while his wife is missing) or reason #10 (mysteriously left college and ran to his parents). But collectively, the 33 reasons do add up to the portrait of a sociopath and murder suspect with enabling parents. Based on some of Anne's comments, including her comments to her therapist about wanting to her children to know that she morally did the right thing, I think Anne's primary motive in writing this book was not financial. In my opinion, Anne wrote this book to convince herself that Scott is guilty, and to convince the world that she is no longer in denial about this, and is a morally decent person."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"The author knew Laci Peterson for 8 years, yet does not tell much about her in the book. I think that is weird and disappointing. I wonder if Laci meant as much to her as the author claims. The book was NOT very thick, so what kept the writer from devoting a chapter to simply describing Laci better and telling more memories ?! She would have been the ideal person to do so ! It's like, \\"HELLO ! Why didn't you think of that ?!\\" Oh I read new things about Laci in the book, yes, but was left with the feeling that it was just minimal. Yet Bird claims to have been close to Laci.This book shows Jackie as being a rather creepy, critical mother-in-law. How PETTY to have resented Laci at all or to have talked behind her back. I couldn't believe that Jackie thought Laci was silly for trying so hard to make things nice. Good grief, Laci was a young woman, still trying life out. What is wrong with that ? Jackie is simply creepy and perhaps was even jealous of Laci. How horrid.I have more sympathy now than ever for Laci. There she was with these Peterson PIRANHAS, she married into this family of COLD FISH with BIG TEETH. I mean really. Laci had Scott, her sociopathic husband. She had her \\"mother-in-law\\" who liked making snide remarks about her...and the rest of Scott's pathetic family as well just didn't want to discuss Laci or act much like anything happened at all when she died. Its obvious they just were more concerned with covering for Scott than feeling upset over Laci. I was just chilled at reading the way the author described that no one from Scott's family really talked about Laci.With those people, Laci was surrounded by the worst. It is just very sad to contemplate. They did not deserve Laci. She was too good for them.On T.V. appearances, the author describes Jackie as being so sweet, etc., and so I wonder about this author. Jackie was creepy to Laci, period. Thats not sweet."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I gave this book 2 stars because it did hold my interest, at least at first. Kind of like a soap opera - you know it's really ridiculous but you get sucked in and have to keep watching. But it didn't pay off. I kept waiting for the \\"big revelation\\" that never came. This book tells us practically nothing about the case that we didn't already know (unless you have been living on another planet, or are Amish and don't have a TV) It comes off more as a biography of Anne Bird, possibly her way of dealing with her adoption issues - although it sounds like Jackie did her a huge favor by giving her up for adoption - her adoptive family sounded much more stable, emotionally and financially.One thing that bugged me - a big thing - was how Anne kept getting virtually slapped in the face with evidence that pointed toward Scott's guilt. As you are reading you think, \\"Ok, now she's going to figure it out.\\", but she keeps retreating to the mindset of \\"He's my brother, he loved Laci, he can't be guilty!\\" Not meeting Scott until she was 32 makes me wonder if she would really, truly look at him as a brother. Which leads to another thing: Anne's continual insistence that she and the Petersons were \\"very close\\". How much interaction did she really have with them? How could she have been such \\"good friends\\" with Laci, and never have visited her house? It just doesn't ring true. I expected more, and Bird doesn't deliver."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I found the book interesting, especially the author's account of Scott Peterson's demeanor following Laci's disappearance. He was staying in her home to avoid the media, so she got a first hand look at his strange, detached behavior. It just confirms that Scott Peterson is a classic sociopath. I also found the unusually close relationship between Scott Peterson and his mother of interest. It appears that Jackie Peterson also possesses sociopathic tendencies, and one cannot help but wonder if she and her husband contributed to their son's problems by never holding their son responsible for his actions. They have definitely been in total denial for many years when it came to their \\"golden boy\\". The Peterson family dynamics seem very creepy.I do feel sorry for the Ms. Bird. After finding her birth mother and what seemed like an ideal family, Ms. Bird was no longer of use to them and, in fact, disowned by them once she came to the realization that her half-brother was indeed capable of committing such a horrific act. Thankfully, it sounds as if her adoptive parents are very loving and supportive of her and will help her get through her ordeal."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Excellent book I felt like I was there. Amber Frys book was ok but this one would be the one to purchase. Shows Scott Peterson in detail after the murder his daily activities and craziness. I believe he did it he murdered his wife."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Despite myself I felt this was somewhat of an interesting read, especially the background on Jackie. That speaks volumes to Scott's narcissism and other pathologies. However, there is one significant error and I cannot believe nobody caught this during the editing/publishing process. Anne Bird's perspective on the picture of Laci's dining room table is skewed. She repeatedly refers to the table being set for Christmas Eve dinner (see page 153) and that the setting was not Laci's standard handiwork. Was it not common knowledge that Scott and Laci were supposed to have Christmas Eve dinner at Sharon Rocha's home? Lesser known perhaps was that Laci was planning to host a Christmas Day brunch, but it was a widely known fact that she was supposed to be at her mother's for dinner Christmas Eve, hence Scott's phony phone call to Sharon asking if Laci was there. Anne Bird refers to the place settings not being up to Laci's high standards...in this book's own pubished photo, the only setting on the table was the Christmas crackers! There were no plates or napkins or silverware. In short, what the heck is she talking about? Also, she repeatedly refers to \\"cream\\" colored maternity pants that she gave Laci and the fact that Laci was found in \\"cream\\" pants. Wasn't it \\"tan\\" pants that all the media coverage and trial testimony touted? Cream and tan are two different colors, maybe not by much, but the fact that the author used \\"cream\\" repeatedly while \\"tan\\" was the color du jour in the case was annoying. I understand that she felt too afraid to call Sharon Rocha to offer condolences, but I didn't agree with the reason. The adopted child 'fear of rejection' doesn't fit here. What fits is the shame in being related to the Petersons and knowing that a Peterson would be the last person Sharon would want to hear from. However, there was at the least a 3 week window before the Rochas turned on Scott in which Anne could have called and expressed her condolences. A card at least, geez, if she was such a great friend of Laci. But note, the primary reason Anne ultimately placed an unreturned call to Sharon was for earrings, not condolences. I don't understand how she felt so \\"close\\" to Scott either. From everything I've read about him, he was a shell of a man who was hard to get close to. She didn't really lay out the experiences they shared that would have accounted for a \\"close\\" relationship. She never even visited their home in Modesto. One other conflicting part was where Anne Bird said on page 202 that her therapist assured her that there was nothing she could have done to save Laci, \\"...there had never been a hint of trouble in their home\\". That totally conflicts with the two stories earlier in the book where Jackie had confided to her that there was indeed \\"trouble\\" between Laci and Scott in the months before the murder, but Jackie didn't elaborate and according to Anne Bird, she never found out what it was, though I wonder if that's true. I also wonder how Sharon Rocha felt reading the pieces on Jackie's treatment of Laci, I don't know that all of those instances were necessary and probably hurt Sharon even more. Only two things could come from those revelations, further separation for Anne from Jackie and more pain for Sharon. So again, was it necessary?The drowning in the pool theory is hogwash. To assert she was in the pool to relax her back when he killed her doesn't add up. I can't picture Scott wanting to go the extra mile of having to lift a 150 pound soakwing wet body out of the pool. Laci was found with pants and bra on, for some reason I can't think that Scott would change her from a bathing suit to clothing, and bothering with a bra, after he killed her. Something tells me he was probably repulsed at the sight of her pregnant stomach. He killed her the night of the 23rd before she even changed into her pajamas. She wouldn't have been swimming at night given the temperatures in December anyway. Anne Bird is no detective.Catherine Crier's book was the most straightforward and consistent accounting of this whole tragedy, while Sharon Rocha's book was the most heartwrenching and honest."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I was very anxious to read this book, and see what Anne Bird had to say about her brother. I got the sense that she is an honest person, trying to tell her story. I wish she had included more photos, the ones she has in the book are new to me. I enjoyed it, and appreciate that she shared her view."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I read this book in one sitting, too, as did many of you. For those of you who are harshly critical, be careful, for not only are you way out in left field (in my humble opinion) but there will come a day when you will be judged with the same ignorance and harshness with which you are judging Anne.I have a grown adopted daughter whom I cherish and adore with my every breath & ounce of strength and heartbeat in my body, as do Anne's adoptive parents. My daughter has never felt driven to find her biological relatives, and once when I tracked some down, she just laughed at me. Anne was not wanting or needing to find her bio relatives either. THEY sought HER. And, unfortunately, no matter how grand (and many are) the relationship between adopted relatives, the adoptee even as an adult is extremely vulnerable to the affect and influence of the brand new blood relatives who \\"threw her away\\" and are now courting her. Add to that the fact that Scott wasn't always so obviously the stone-cold narcissistic, self-serving, evil lunatic WE all heard and saw through the media's eyes for months - he utterly impressed and charmed many, many, many people in his short life before his wife and son came up missing. How much more would he want and be able to win the affection of his brand new ONLY BLOOD sister????I don't believe that Anne wrote this book for the money, altho I hope she makes a bunch. She has had a tremendous amount of stunning and overwhelming garbage her bio family has brought into her life that needed working through, and I think her book did that for her, and I'm glad, and grateful, for her. I'm sorry they ever found you, Anne. You didn't need what they brought you and you owed them nothing. Of all the books written about this case, the only two I deem worthy of being read are this one, and Catherine Crier's masterpiece, \\"Deadly Game.\\" (I commend Amber Fry heartily for her testimony for I doubt Scott would have been found guilty without it. But I haven't read her book and don't intend to. As prominent and urgently needed as her testimony was, in actuality, her part in this from the perspective of people who want to know WHY? HOW? could this have POSSIBLY happened, Amber's role is a sidebar and after all the sick tawdry testimony, I don't need the book about it to help understand WHY and HOW.)This is one of the saddest true crime stories I've ever heard about.Walk with God, Anne and Tim and Ryan and Tommy. Be free. Don't own ugly stuff that isn't yours to own. Be glad and grateful for the good stuff that has belonged to you and still does."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I haven't read the book yet because I just ordered it but reading these reviews irritate me. I think it's ridiculous that everyone keeps downing her for writing it. You're telling me you wouldn't try to make money off of your sibling. Yeah right! People are always trying to make money off of anything they possibly can, no matter how ridiculous. And if you would stand by them, and support them, then you might as well say murder is ok. You can still love them but you don't have to approve of what they did. How do you know she is just trying to profit from this. Alot of people are very intrested in this and are just curious to know the truth behind the family and maybe she's doing it just for that or for the sake of Laci's family. How do you know profits aren't going to them or other families of victims? You don't. So don't down something you don't even know about. And for those of you who think it's ridiculous because you're \\"tired of hearing about all this\\" then what did you read it for in the first place!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Thank goodness I only spent 50 cents for this book at a thrift store and still feel like I was ripped off. Anne Bird wrote this for her gain. She had only meet Laci a few times but professes to have been so close to her. What a joke!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This Book was very interesting! I have never been faced with anything like this but how far do you go for ANYONE when ALL the facts point to a certain person. This book reminded me a lot of the Casey Anthony case with all the lies, lies and more lies and the mother (and sister) sticking up for him even after it was layout in cold blood! The sister finally comes around but the mother is still in Cindy Anthony denial! I understand loving your children to no end as I have 6 but I dont think I would be so blind as Jacky Peterson or Cindy Anthony! And if I knew what they know I would not back my child. I would love them but would not back their evil ways.Anyway, this book is definately worth the read!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I really enjoyed this book a lot. I followed this case closely from the beginning and it was quite interesting to see the perspective of someone who was inside the Peterson family. Very captivating and a quick read."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I've recently started reading all the books with decent reviews about the Scott Peterson case. I was looking forward to reading this book because Anne Bird obviously has an insider's perspective on Scott and the rest of his family, plus the title of the book was obviously compelling.While her book did offer some good insight and, as she pointed out toward the end of the book, it gave her the opportunity to tell her story, I didn't the book told me much that I didn't already know. It was interesting to see the internal struggle Anne had with not wanting to believe Scott was guilty but also facing the facts that much of his behavior was bizarre.What I had hoped most from this book was some \\"slam-dunk\\" evidence (33 reasons) why Scott Peterson was guilty of killing Laci and Connor. Unfortunately, the 33 reasons she provides are really just specific examples of bizarre or questionable behavior from Scott. Certainly they troubling but they weren't exactly \\"reasons he's guilty.\\"A quick and interesting read but if you're looking for something a little more all-encompassing about the Scott Peterson case consider checking out Catherine Crier's book \\"A Deadly Game.\\""},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Good read! Kept me interested. Given my interest in this subject, I appreciated Scott's sister's perspective and this is just that."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Anne Bird comes across as thought provoking, intelligent and HONEST. She tells us a great deal of things that previously were not known about Scott Peterson and his family. I admire her for writing the book and applaud her efforts."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I thought the book was very interesting. It took a look from an angle we seldom heard about...from the sister. I thought the book was well written, and since this case draws so many of us to read anything we can get our hands on, this book should also be read. Even she questions whether or not Scott is guilty or innocent. Great read!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"It is obvious that Anne Bird is a new author, however do not let this shy you away from this book. You get another perspecive of how many lives that what Scott Peterson did were affected. I personally like to follow this type of people watching as there are always so many victims in crime. Anne Bird is also one of those victims."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I purchased this book after Ann Bird's appearance on Oprah with the hopes of getting an inside look at the Petersons, who seem to be a very dark and dysfunctional family. However, Ms. Bird did not deliver on anything new or substantive. I also came away with the impression that her relationship with Laci wasn't as close as she would have had readers believe and that her book was more an opportunistic vehicle for cashing in on the Rocha family tragedy than anything else."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"While the book did not strike me as being written by someone looking to cash in on a tragedy, I have to say that I am not sure what her the author's mission in this was. The title indicated that she had 33 of her own reasons why she believed Scott killed Laci. So I was under the impression that the author would spend time actually talking about these 33 reasons. She did not. She merely mentions a list of the 33 reasons why she believes her brother to be guilty, but doen't really expand on any of them. And they really are not what I consider good enough reasons to write a book much less call it \\"33 Reasons why Scott Peterson is Guilty\\". It's misleading. So if you think the author has anything profound to say, forget it. Other than that, I thought the book was just plain boring."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"The Peterson case has riveted me from the day Laci's sweet face was plastered all over the news. This book offered nothing new and in fact was riddled with spelling and grammar errors throughout. It became clear to me by the time Anne starting talking about Amber Frey and how she was getting \\"her\\" story out, that Anne all of a sudden felt motivated to tell \\"her\\" story which she claimed were for her boys. Not one of her 33 reasons could be proved in a court of law, yet she wonders why she wasn't called to testify. The whole book had a underlying tone to it, that shouted, \\"Don't leave me out\\". There was no story here. I felt sorry this woman who finally found her birth mother and reunited with her siblings had to go through this nightmarish event, however she should just feel thankful she was given up for adoption. The REAL story in the Peterson case lies within the dysfunctional raising of the \\"Golden Boy\\" best spelled out by Dr. Keith Ablow in Sharon Rocha's book about Laci. A much better read and will clearly define for readers how Scott Peterson committed murder. My advice to Anne is to steer clear of the Peterson's who no doubt will continue on this crusade for their son's innocence. This book wasn't worth the money."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Anne Bird sadly tells a story that is more about herself than her \\"bloodbrother\\" and her reasons to suspect his guilt. Although, it was somewhat insightful as to what he did while he stayed with her and some of his actions she reported were curious and suprising. The author Anne simply does not have a real foundation for a book. She just told a few naughty things that she knew about her birth mother,Jackie Peterson, and Scott's odd behaviour. Obviously she was in this for the love of money. It is not worth the money. Borrow it from a friend if you feel compelled to read it. Go to the library and check it out. It really is a waste of money and valuable time."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"Anne Bird does not really shed any new light on the whole Peterson case. She did however manage to explain the whole Jackie Peterson/adoption thing. Wow! She should be very happy not to be affiliated with this family. What a bunch of losers! Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I've read both this book and Amber's book, and they are equally riveting. It's true what they say, reality is stranger than fiction. I don't think any fiction writer could have come up with a weirder plot for a story. These two people were directly affected by Scott's behavior, they were right in the thick of it, so I see no moral issue with them writing books to tell their stories. It can be therapeutic, or opportunist, whatever you want to believe. Now if this had been some long lost friend-from-thirty-years ago who had gone to junior highschool with Peterson, and sat two rows behind him in science class, and just now decided to write a novel, I would be suspicious. But this isn't the case. As far as the writing style goes, it may not be academic, but so what? These are true stories. There are many, many other people out there that have written books seeking to make a quick buck, and these two don't fall into that category."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"This was a very interesting book which told many unknown details about the Peterson case. I would definitely recommend it for anyone interested in the Scott & Laci Peterson case. It's much better than the other books recently published about this murder case.Regardless of this though, I find it somewhat callous of Anne Bird to have written a book that so defiled her birthmother and brother (even if they were uncaring, sociopathic individuals). She mustn't have really cared about them as she said that she did in the book."},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I have absolutely no love lost nor sympathy for Scott Peterson. But the fact that this book was even written is repulsive to me. To betray a family you claim you want to know better for a few bucks is insane. Haven't Scott's parents been through enough?Oh, and there was nothing earth shattering in this book. No new tidbits of info. Just a tattletale book from a spoiled and greedy family member.

What I did find out was all the clubs, restaurants, schools and destinations that Anne and her family (families) and inlaws frequented. It seemed too that if you took all the name dropping out you could eliminate about a third of the book. I got the impression that Anne wrote this as a look at me, I want some attention too type of book. She wanted so badly to have some sort of info that the investigators would be interested in but even after being turned down several times by both the prosecution and the defense because she had nothing of value to give them she decided that she would write a book with all of her imagined important clues. Maybe if she would have come out of the alcohol induced cloud that she was in reality could have sunk in and she might have been able to have witnessed something of importance. I feel sorry for Anne because of her need for attention. Maybe that's why she liked Laci so much. Laci's beauty, energy and intelligence drew a lot of attention. When Anne was with Laci some of that attention spilled over. What a sad family. What a sad excuse for a book. Even the editor and proof readers didn't waste much time on it!"},{"Title":"Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty","review":"I honesty think this woman just wanted to make some easy money and get some attention.

It almost has the feel of &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; only instead of a nasty, greedy old man, we have an embittered old woman. The ending is very nice; but, along the way we lose a kind and loving character.

Since the old woman is &#34;stuck&#34; with the child, the only thing she does is just tolerate her presence. The young woman and the little girl form a bond.

The mother was a what I considered a typical high class prostitute. The father you're not sure about, other people telling his story.

At that time, the upper reaches of the Madeira were as wild and inaccesible as any place on earth, including Antarctica. It's said that a man died for every crosstie on the railroad, and that's probably not a huge exaggeration. So Tomlinson's trip was a true adventure, even though his writing style is modest.His account of the Amazon and the Madeira near the beginning of the 20th century is fascinating, and his anecdotes about his time at the construction site are hilarious. He comes across as a modest man with an adventurous streak and a wonderful sense of humor. This book is a delight to read as a sheer travel adventure.It is also the only easy-reading description I've encountered of what was then the sheer wilderness of much of Amazonia was like before it was opened up by the advent of airplanes and the construction of the Trans-Amazon Highway. Even now, much of Brazil's part of the Amazon basin is wild, but now one can get in and out of all but the most remote spots conveniently. In Tomlinson's day, a million square miles was still mostly unmapped and almost unexplored; reading this book is an easy way of learning what true wilderness was like.I recommend it highly; it's one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The sea and the jungle","review":"When I first read this book six years ago, I was struck by its leisurely pace -- some readers in today's &quot;now&quot; technological age might find the text maddeningly slow -- but that is the delight in a book of this sort, written in 1912. Tomlinson's meditations, ruminations and wanderings are part of the larger adventure reflected in the times in which he took the &quot;Capella&quot; voyage. And, from these digressions come crisp, first-rate descriptions of the ship, its crew, and the surroundings. Even today, I can recall certain passages that still strike me in their clarity and precision (Ex: the huge, turbine arms of the Capella's engines whir and thump with &quot;bird-like alacrity.&quot;). This book requires patience and indulgence, but is extremely rewarding for someone in this right frame of mind."},{"Title":"The sea and the jungle","review":"H M Tomlinson, a newspaper office employee, sets off on an adventurous and dangerous trip in a steamer in 1909. He is in for a wild winter Atlantic crossing that brought to mind A PERFECT STORM. This if followed by a medically risky and awesome adventure up the Amazon-with all the crew popping quinine and wrapping themselves in mosquito netting. The book was particularly enjoyably for me, in part because the author seemed so ordinary--he had read travel books and refers to them in the text, but he had a pretty ordinary day job. He also was just my grandfather's age and they both loved travel--and shared the family name of Tomlinson-a connection with some unknown, but now sort of knowable, British cousin. There was something of John McPhee's LOOKING FOR A SHIP in this book--the character sketches and the palpable heat of the tropics. But it does not have the tight focus of that work. There are parts of this book that had me roaring out loud in an airport waiting room. But, the man could have used an editor. When he was good he was very good.

Tomlinson's descriptions of the voyage across the Atlantic and then the journey up the Amazon are exquisite.His style - to some extent - is like Melville. His anecdotes of individuals encountered are like Somerset Maugham. The book is highly personal and Tomlinson brings us with him to the Amazonian. The sheer primeval jungle and remoteness in early 1900's is well worth the read. Tomlinson does not glamorize - there are abundant insects, bad food with a visually growing forest. His humour is whimsical and topical. Has the drudgery and meaninglessness of work changed much over the last 100 years?

He eventually specialized in gastroenterology and his descriptons of exploring the colon for cancer before colonoscopies and MRI meant taking the intestines out and going through them with the fingers. His index fingers were permanently clubbed after doing this for years. He lightly touches on the Mayo family, and goes into surprising detail about his struggles with the Mayo board. The legacy created by William Worral Mayo and Mother Alfred, the Catholic nun who formed the first hospital in Rochester, is also mentioned. It seems as though Charlie and Will Mayo have received almost all of the attention of the current Mayo Clinic, but it is interesting to hear about the genesis of the organization.

Most leaders, managers, and companies have adopted methods of deciding what to do and how to implement them without considering the fundamental assumptions and experiences with those methods. In essence, this important knowledge work is back where the planning of manual work was before Frederick Taylor. What he says has implications for quality, production planning, capacity expansions, new product design, IT, and many ohter functions, processes and activities.Before you dismiss this point as being merely of academic interest, consider several of Mintzberg's more telling points: Forecasting is seldom accurate for long; creating intense alignment in the wrong direction can make a company vulnerable to sudden shifts in the market; formal staffs can simply create political games; and thinking that is not linked into the important processes of the company will have limited impact. If those points are right, what does it mean about how work should be performed in your organization?Having been there and done that as both a strategic planner in the early 1970s and a strategy consultant before that, I recognize the disease as he diagnoses it. In fact, many of the people he quotes and evaluates are people I know. I also saw many of the companies improve themselves by doing less planning.You can only cover so much in one book, but the potential of strategic work is to improve significant communications, thinking and action in the enterprise. That can help eliminate the significant stalls that delay progress. If Professor Mintzberg decides to do a second edition of this book, I hope he will do more with those subjects.What has been disappointing to me and others who are familiar with the problems that strategic planning has experienced is the lack of alternatives being proposed. Mintzberg has proposed one, but it is pretty primitive. It just gets rid of some of the wasted motion in strategic planning, without building on success.One of the few advanced processes that I know of is one that I co-authored in the soon-to-be-published, The Irresistible Growth Enterprise. If you are interested in that subject, take a look at that book's introduction.I was pleased to see Mintzberg challenge Michael Porter to choose a method for selecting among paths for a business or company. When I first read Porter, I felt he waffled on that point, too. My research and experience strongly suggest that paths that leave you better off regardless of the unexpected changes you could experience work best. To locate those paths can be made systematic, as a way of helping people apply both analysis and intuition to finding better alternatives. That is what strategic planning should have focused on. I agree with Mintzberg in assigning importance to the generation of new and better alternatives as one potential benefit of strategy work, whether done by the line executive, a staff person, a consultant, or all of the above together.I especially liked his awareness of the need for commitment. Involvement is a necessary part of gaining commitment, and the strategy processes that many use misses that important connection.The book could have been improved, however, by doing some field work with companies which developed strategies that prospered well beyond their peers and seeming potential. What did they do that helped to create these results? Or was it a case of a stopped clock being right twice a day? Without answering that question, Mintzberg leaves us back in the pre Frederick Taylor days, except with a better idea of what does not work.I have done substantial unpublished research on just that question. It is clear that there are several models that companies have used successfully to develop better strategies, implement them well, adapt to changes in a timely manner, and build systematically on success. I suggest you consider Clear Channel Communications as a company that focuses on rethinking the basic business model, Southwest Airlines as a company that achieves a superior cost position and efficiently transfers benefits from that to all stakeholder groups, and Linear Technology as a company that follows a strategy that should allow it to prosper regardless of the shifts in things it cannot stop or control.No review of this book would be complete without noting that Mintzberg's persistent skepticism makes for some pretty humorous reading (unless you are one of the writers or planners he is questioning). Be sure you take time to enjoy the subtle humor in his writing.Well done, Professor Mintzberg! I think this is the best work about how managers should manage their fundamental thinking that I have seen in the last 20 years.You should be sure to read this book both to understand the lessons of strategic planning and what that implies for other thinking processes in your enterprise. You management education will not be complete until you do."},{"Title":"Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning","review":"Throughout the history of quality management, practitioners have had to be knowledgeable and conversant in the areas of most interest to their respective organizations. In most years, this has involved dealing with issues surrounding how to run a better project to build a better information system. The quality practitioner has always had a role in developing methodologies, deploying tools, measuring processes and quality, and facilitating organizational change. The basic assumption that the information technology function exists to build systems and operate data centers in which to run those system was rarely challenged. The advent and proliferation of personal computers, and the more recent shift toward client/server computing, represented only variations on the common theme. Quality professionals have been seen as adding value to the extent that they have been knowledgeable and conversant in these key areas.More recently however, information technology organization! s have been forced to question their own very existence. Many of the issues have been around for quite some time: decentralization of processing power and application knowledge, outsourcing of development and operations functions, growing maturity of the purchased package application arena, etc. Large systems integrators have created value adding umbrella functions over these service domains, and in the process, have created very real competition for once confident and embedded information technology organizations. Information technology managers are struggling to think about, and correctly act upon, these strategic changes in the industry. Today the quality practitioner must become conversant and skilled in the strategic skills of planning and implementing organizational change in order to continue to be perceived as value adding by information technology management.To say that the quality practitioner must develop skills in strategic planning can raise more than a few eye! brows in most organizations. The idea of &quot;strategic pl! anning&quot; carries many negative connotations among managers who have historically seen strategic planning reduced to a bureaucratic maze of meetings and reports that are quickly filed away once published, allowing work to return to the pre-planning norm. [Quality professionals will note that many similar connotations have begun to be attached to TQM.] In THE RISE AND FALL OF STRATEGIC PLANNING, Henry Mintzberg offers an extensive discussion of the roots of the various strategic planning models and his well-documented explanation for the failures and bad feelings associated with strategic planning. His conclusion is positive as illustrated by his subtitle, Reconceiving Roles for Planning, Plans, and Planners.&quot;People called planners can sometimes do strange things, just as strategies can sometimes result from strange processes. We need to delineate the word carefully if it is not be eventually dropped from the management literature as hopelessly contaminated.&quot; [p! g. 7] Mintzberg seeks &quot;to characterize planning by the nature of its process, not its intended result.&quot; In looking at this process, he finds what he believes is an underlying contradiction in planning, namely, that &quot;the assumption underlying strategic planning is that analysis will produce synthesis: decomposition of the process of strategy making into a series of articulated steps, each to be carried out as specified in sequence, will produce integrated strategies.&quot; [13]Traditional strategic planning literature recognizes strategy in two forms. &quot;Intentions that are fully realized can be called deliberate strategies. Those that are not realized can be called unrealized strategies.&quot; [24] What typically goes unrecognized &quot;is the third case, which (he calls) emergent strategy, where a realized pattern was not expressly intended.&quot; [25] Because emergent opportunities fall outside of the formal planning process, and would violate the publis! hed plan, key ideas and opportunities are not only missed, ! they are actively avoided in the interest of implementing the plan. These missed opportunities, in hindsight, discredit the entire strategic planning process and profession.Mintzberg encourages a combination of strategies. Management can &quot;pursue what may be called umbrella strategies: the broad outlines are deliberate while the details are allowed to emerge within them. Thus emergent strategies are not necessarily bad and deliberate ones good; effective strategies mix these characteristics in ways that reflect the conditions at hand, notably the ability to predict as well as the need to react to unexpected events.&quot; [25]Some of the central premises that Mintzberg feels have led to the current negative perception of strategic planning include: that the &quot;management of strategy can be sharply separated from the management of operations, and the strategy formation process itself can be programmed.&quot; [23] In an argument currently echoed in the quality litera! ture, strategic planning isn't something that can be done separately from line management, it constitutes the most important part of line management. If so, the role of the separate planner, or planning function, is drawn into question. Mintzberg's &quot;contention is that many of the most important roles played by planners have nothing to do with planning or even plans per se.&quot; [361] He offers three &quot;nonplanning roles of planners: as finders of strategies, as analyst, and as catalyst.&quot; [361] Like the quality professional, the professional strategic planner adds value to the organization by focusing a specific skill set on the need to facilitate an organization-wide process of change.Mintzberg's work offers a transition piece between the traditional bureaucratic strategic planning processes, that have earned much disdain in the management community, and the modern emerging role of strategic planning and value-added planners. It is in THE RISE AND FALL that M! intzberg goes beyond this negative characterization to disc! over the emerging and positive role for strategic panning and planners."},{"Title":"Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning","review":"Henry Mintzberg is, as always, the iconoclast. It is well worth reading any book he writes because, invariably, he presents an alternative perspective on how business and how organisations work, generally one which drives from the combined power of both a theoretician and an experimentalist - a rare breed indeed.The Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning is no exception. It is a book about finding a general theory of strategic planning which, given that the search is rooted in Mintzberg's observations of what actually happens in the real world, has the potential for practical application.His perspectives make one's understanding of the subject more complete; they promote one's ability to balance a potentially narrow view of the world with something richer. It doesn't really matter whether you think Mintzberg right or wrong, spot-on or off-beam, at least you have an alternative view. There are so many tidbits in his books that you invariably pick up something of worth.From my own perspective, having read through (and intending to continue to read) the book on many occasions in my own attempts to implement some strategic planning concepts, I draw my own conclusions about two of Mintzberg's perspectives which I feel are worth commenting on.Firstly, he takes the unique view of dividing the conventional planning model vertically along budget, objective, strategy and program lines (rather than cascading traditionally through corporate, business and functional lines down to actions). I have found, after much toying with this perspective, that it amounts to an hypothesis on how strategic planning actually works, and nothing more. His book focuses on expounding that exploratory hypothesis and, to some extent, because he focuses so heavily on it and because it is such a novel way of looking at things, it actually tends to make one forget that it is only a hypothesis. After many readings, I'm not sure how much the perspective enlightens and how much it obscures - that is the nature of hypotheses.Secondly and finally, Mintzberg provides his own outline of how to pursue strategic planning using a three step model. Alas, and disappointingly, the model provides little practical guidance at the end of the day. It is far too vague, far too removed from everyday requirements. It also suffers from the absence of an actual example of its application. Then again, that's not what the book was about - although I was hoping.Thank you Henry Mintzberg for the insight. The book is worth every cent for that alone."},{"Title":"Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning","review":"I have read varied books and articles of Mintzberg. All of them convey the realities of the real organizations, not fictions of varied writers and quick-fixer management consultants. This book is about the formal strategic planning school.

Mintzberg especially questioning the assumption that is formal planning is the best way to create strategy and formulation and implementation can be seperated. This book is a good source for people to want to move from fictions and academic rhetoric to the strong and real realities. I advice this book for all sane and realist creatures. Thanks Mintzberg..."},{"Title":"Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning","review":"Henry Mintzberg provides a panoramic overview of the history of strategic planning. He uses this backdrop to offer powerful insights into strategy development.Mintzberg carefully examines the vexing question of how strategy is formed. His clear differentiation between strategy formation and strategic planning are helpful in understanding the actual creation of strategies vs. the planning for those strategies. He contends strategic planning should be called strategic programming based on the fact that it has little if anything to do with the formation of strategy. He clearly delineates the difference between deliberate and emergent strategy formation while explaining the need to respect both methods. His \\"black box\\" of strategy creation, where human intuition works in yet unknown ways, provides insights in how to support and improve a process one cannot hope to fully understand.Mintzberg creates useful and memorable constructs which help sort out strategy's key aspects. First he addresses how strategy is actually formed in the real world, as opposed to how planners think it should be formed. On that foundation he reviews the pitfalls and fundamental fallacies of planning, such as assuming strategy will appear spontaneously out of a planning process not specifically equipped to create strategy. Lastly, he proposes remedies for how strategy creation can actually be fostered to improve results and be integrated into strategic planning.Mintzberg's constructs and perspectives will help business leaders make sense out of the flurry of strategy information which continually bombards them."},{"Title":"Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning","review":"Even if you don't agree with Henry Mintzberg, this is &quot;must&quot; reading for executives.

Bell's book is NOT for the reader unfamiliar with Cavell and Derrida, and to a lesser extent Austin, Searle, Wittgenstein, Stanley Fish, and others. Bell assumes a basic knowledge on the reader's part of deconstruction, the works of Cavell, postmodernism, and the history of philosophy in general. Upon that foundation, he has deeply researched and written about the \\"abyss\\" between the analytic (American) and continental (European) philosophic approach, with the interesting thesis that deconstruction, generally assumed to be a European import to the U.S., is actually as American as anything.Bell is at his best when analyzing Mark Tansey's philosophic painting \\"Derrida Queries De Man\\" (which opens the book), giving background on the figures of Cavell and Derrida, and creating a fictional hybrid philosopher to bridge this abyss named \\"Jackie Goldstein\\" (created out of the names of Cavell and Derrida before they changed their names). Bell's writing is characteristically rich, dense, and often open-ended, opting to let the reader think and decide for herself rather than providing any easy answers to the questions raised.My main problem with the book is that it is highly specialized in one rather obscure, academic area -- Bell is not only writing about philosophy but professional philosophy, and his work suggests the influence of the \\"ivory tower\\" of a college campus atmosphere and the abstractions of PhDs arguing over language. It lacks a grittiness and, at times, a connection to non-academic ordinary life.But in this realm of philosophy Bell is adept at guiding the reader through the inconsistencies and contradictions of these two schools of thought, adding a flair for mystery that makes the narrative enjoyable. Bell also weaves in his own philosophical development and history. He has, unlike some professors, never been unwilling to embrace postmodern philosophy and its effect, sometimes damaging, on previous philosophic systems.The bottom line is that, for what it is, this book is an important and stimulating look at two sometimes differing, sometimes similar schools of thought, and the sometimes difficult works of both Cavell and -- especially -- Derrida. For those interested in some possible directions after postmodernism and some unique insights from a unique philosopher, Bell's book delivers.\\"Ever since Anaximander wrote those famous prose lines describing the 'arche' as 'to apeiron', metaphysics has refused the peace Wittgenstein dreamed of, putting words to the silence of the boundless.\\"-Roger BellSounding the Abyss (p. 170)"},{"Title":"The Great Pyramid: A miracle in stone","review":"It is ammazing how Seiss reads the physical structure in light of biblical history. The comparison of the dimentions of the Great Pyramid to Scripture and history of Gods' people both Jew and gentile is very thought provoking. I have found that recent findings do not discredit any of Seiss' observations. This just helps to enforce the divine being active in the building of this Great Pyramid as Seiss explains. The nonbeliver will have difficulty not to investigate further.There is very strong EVIDENCE of the divine intervention in the building of the monument. Divine science is displayed or should I say Science before science was discovered is displayed. For those who need proof of a God this book is a strong evidence that can not be overlooked. A must reading for those who wish to see where the divine is active in the physical aspect of man's workings. Another foot print of the almighty creator left on his creation for man to see and ponder on. Seiss is a man who has been blessed with great insight to the workings of God. His book on the Apocalypse also displays this."},{"Title":"The Great Pyramid: A miracle in stone","review":"This is a wonderful book! Seiss does a first-rate job of concisely introducing the reader to the fundamentals of the Judeo-Christian spiritual content of the Great Pyramid. He does this in a way that is very engaging, and it makes the book hard to put down. It is also easy to read, despite Seiss' use of Victorian English writing, which is another plus. All in all, this is a book that I would highly recommend for anyone interested in studying the spirtual and scientific truths embodied in the Great Pyramid. It is concise, practical, and informative. In other words, it is excellent."},{"Title":"Linux System Security: The Administrator's Guide to Open Source Security Tools","review":"Among the many other books on the shelves with similar titles, this book spans the gamut of security. No one book can claim to be &quot;The Book&quot; on Linux/Unix security, but this one is an essential for library of the budding &quot;sys-admin.&quot; Aside, from the detailed instructions for plugging security holes, Mann and Mitchell explain how and why it works. I found this book very helpful.BK"},{"Title":"Linux System Security: The Administrator's Guide to Open Source Security Tools","review":"This is the best of the books I've seen on Linux system security. It focuses almost exclusively on freely available tools, and therefore should appeal to those poorly funded installations that use Linux because of its low cost. The authors cover many tools in the detail needed to obtain, install, and use them in an intelligent way. I was very impressed with the scope of coverage, from system policies to the use and configuration of crack, and everything in between. Although not everything within that scope can be covered in complete detail, the book also includes many useful references for additional information.Among my few complaints would be that the authors tended to present the tools within the context of a network utilizing firewalls, a DMZ, and limited service servers. In practice many installations will not be so well constructed. In fairness, the utility of the information presented was usually unaffected by the assumed architecture. Although the presentation is relatively distribution neutral, the examples and specifics referred almost exclusively to RPM based RedHat 5 and 6. I would have been interested in seeing parallel details for Debian based distributions, if for nothing else than to gain a sense of the differences that might be encountered based on packaging."},{"Title":"Linux System Security: The Administrator's Guide to Open Source Security Tools","review":"Actually all tools described are not Linux specific and can be used for any Unix including FreeBSD and Solaris.The authors seems to know the subject and really used tools that they are writing about. For several popular tools the book provides some useful info that is difficult to find elsewhere. Pretty decent typography, although it's a little bit too academic and does not use icons on margins that IMHO simplify reading.As for the classic open security tools, the book covers PAM(36 pages), Sudo(20 pages), TCP Wrappers(24 pages), SSH(55 pages), Tripwire(24 pages), CFS and TCFS (30 pages), and ipchains.From the first reading it looks like the chapters are *not* a rehash of existing online documentation. In addition to the chapters about classic open source security tools I like chapters about logs: a chapter on syslog (Ch.8) and a chapter on log file management (Ch.17).Now about weaknesses. The chapter on Tiger is rather weak. Moreover regrettably Tiger is a legacy tool, but actually information is not completely useless -- it's not difficult to switch to another tool after one understands how Tiger works. Actually Perl is superior for writing Unix vulnerability scanners in comparison with shell. May be hardening scripts like Bastille would be a better choice for this chapter in the second edition of the book.Book is incomplete in a sense that neither Snort (or any similar intrusion detection tool), nor open source network scanners (Saint, Sara, etc.) are covered.Of course there are some typos, but generally not that many. But what is really bad is that the Prentice Hall book page currently is pretty basic with no errata or additional links. The authors do not provide a WEB site for the book.This book can probably be used for studying Unix security at universities along with somewhat outdated Practical Unix and Internet Security and this combination can somewhat compensate deficiencies of the latter (non tool oriented descriptive approach)."},{"Title":"Linux System Security: The Administrator's Guide to Open Source Security Tools","review":"I read most every security book that is released and this one is so exceptional in quality that I felt impelled to add a review.

This book has at least 50 pages on the subject!I could go on and on about this book it is so good!This book is written by experienced people, not just an author who was assigned another book to write.You will not regret buying this book!"},{"Title":"Linux System Security: The Administrator's Guide to Open Source Security Tools","review":"Anyone involved in securing computers and networks usually has several security texts on their bookshelf. No one text can have all the answers for every security problem out there, and one of the best things going for this book is that it doesn't claim to do so. But it does contain information on some excellent tools and resources you can use to secure not just your Linux system, but systems with a lot of other flavors of UNIX. The book talks about the most common security vulnerabilities and various open source packages which do everything from detecting these problems to blocking them out as completely as possible. The beginning of the book has some very useful lists of Examples, Tables, and Figures which give you easy access to important concepts. Appendixes give excellent Internet resources usually only known to hackers and other security experts along with tools not covered by the book (but pointers to where to find more info). The style the book is typeset in is very similar to the Stevens books on UNIX Programming and TCP/IP, which makes it easy to read. I would say this book makes an excellent companion to Maximum Security, by Anonymous. Maximum Security gives you the information blast, and this book expands on some of the important tools like tiger, xinetd, and Tripwire.

Everyone has one good one in them, but with the exception of a handful of writers (Ellison, Kathe Koja, a few others) whose work is consistently well above the bar, you're more likely to come up with a writer whose work is usually medicore, but who every once in a while lets fly with something so wonderful that the whole world needs to know about it. And thus the continuing popularity of the horror story anthology; the quest to try and find all these truly great stories from any given time period and collect them all into one large volume.I'm sure you all have short lists of the truly great stories from otherwise mediocre short story writers, at least as long as you've read enough horror to know them. King's &quot;Survivor Type.&quot; Barker's &quot;In the Hills, the Cities.&quot; Morrell's &quot;Orange for Anguish, Blue for Insanity.&quot; The king of all horror stories, Richard Christian Matheson's stunning &quot;Red.&quot; Masques IV, while full of stories that are average or slightly above average at best, manages to add a new story, and a new author, to the hallowed canon. His name is David T. Connolly, &quot;Julia's Touch&quot; is his first published short story, and if he's got a drawer full of this kind of stuff at home he's destined for the kind of greatness that Stephen King and John Grisham can only dream about. Interestingly, while trying to write this review last week (this mailing has been held up by my inability to find this info on the web), I went looking for every review of Masques IV I could, and the vast majority focus on the medicority of the stories by the more established authors. Go figure.Yes, certainly, there's some other good stuff here, most of it from the usual above-the-bar suspects (Chet Williamson, Lois Tilton, Dan Simmons), but it's the Connolly story that makes this worth the price of admission, no matter what that price is. Beg, borrow, or steal a copy of this anthology to get at that story, for you will walk away from its few, sparse, painful words a changed person. As for the rest, well, like any other anthology, you win some, you lose some. ***"},{"Title":"Psycho-Pictography","review":"I have studied self actualization for a few years.

The book puts it in the visual perspective the brain understands. The Bible tells nothing but stories. Great motivators always have a great story to tell.

I dare say I did not learn anything new from the baby Rudin that I did not already know from Gaskill.Some of the features I appreciate are (1) the plain language explanations of proofs and motivations before/after each theorem, and (2) graphs to illustrate the idea behind the theorems/examples. I wish other authors would include more graphs and illustrations!If you want to understand the concepts behind how calculus works at Riemann level, this is a great book to start with. And I like Stromberg as a follow-up book. (There are some but not a lot of new things to learn even from Stromberg once you master Gaskill.)However, this book does not mention analysis in R^n whereas the baby Rudin does. And the chapter on topology could be better in providing motivation and concrete examples. Things clicked for me when another book started out by saying that compactness can characterize a closed interval as versus an open interval in R.And I would have like to see how this book would introduce Lebesgue measure.

Back in the real world Willow has finally showed up and is going toe to toe with Amy. We do not get back to the plotline where the military thinks of the Slayers as being terrorists, which I find rather intriguing, so I assume that is a set up for something down the road. However, by the end of this issue all of the pieces appear to be on the board for the end game and I am willing to round up on issue #3.So far all three issues have ended with a bug (gasp!) reveal on the final splash page, and what bothered me is that the reveal of Amy in issue #1 reminded me of the reveal of Darla in \\"To Shanshu in L.A.,\\" the season one finale of \\"Angel,\\" while Willow's appearance on the last page ofissue #2explicitly repeats the sudden appearance of Giles at the end of \\"Two to Go\\" from season six of \\"BtVS.\\" I find myself wondering if Whedon is trying to mix familiar bits with all of this new stuff to make the transition to this new format palatable. I mean, we know what the man is capable of and I am certainly hoping that he is able to work into this \\"season\\" his story idea for bringing back Tara (a good pair of shoes holds not temptation for me). However, I think it is safe to say that Joss is laying the foundation for his brave new world in this first story-arc and you should plan on being here for the long haul.Reading Joss Whedon's \\"BtVS\\" comic book might take a bit of getting used to and it dawned on me today that the pacing is much more like what he is doing in one of the other comic books he is writing, \\"Astonishing X-Men\\" (\\"Runaways\\" is now the third), than what we learned to love with the television series. It turns out \\"The Long Way Home\\" is going to be a four-part story, which will conclude in the next issues. But given that the real villain is not disclosed until the final splash page of issue #3 it seems there is a lot to get covered next month. Initially my big question was whether each issue of this comic book constitutes an entire episode or just an act in an \\"episode,\\" and at this point I think it is clearly the latter case. So when I think that Joss has a lot of 'splaning to do regarding who shows up on the final page I know at the same time that I am going to have to see how this whole thing plays out before I make a final judgment on how well things are going with this first \\"episode.\\" Suffice it to say that my hopes outweigh my fears in this regard."},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 #3: The Long Way Home Part Three (Dark Horse Comics)","review":"These comics just keep getting better. This one starts off immediately after Issue #2, and the action never stops. This, I'm sure, is the issue that will woo over any Buffy fans that have been doubting the greatness of these Whedon-penned comics.So many questions come up after reading the first few issues, so I was counting on some answers in this one. We get to find out the following...+ Who is Amy's boyfriend?+ Who is the \\"My love\\" guy in Issue #2? Is it the same guy as the floaty-leather-jacket guy?+ Is Renee alive after being stabbed last issue?+ What's up with Willow and Kennedy?Also, we get an appearance from a very popular baddie--none other than Ethan Rayne. Not to mention the unforgettable image of Spike/Angel that Scott Allie promised us in the letters section of the last issue. All that, plus scenes with Giles, Andrew, and the re-union of Xander, Buffy, and Willow.The art, as usual, is amazing. However, one scene bugged me. There's a scene with only Willow's face, where she says \\"She looks tired\\" (referring to Buffy). In that scene, it looks like Willow either almost fell asleep herself or got her hands on a whole lotta drugs. But other than that one little flaw, everything is done well. Particularly Jeanty's interpretation of Ethan Rayne. Spot on. And, while I didn't think Giles looked like himself in Issue #2, this issue shows a VAST improvement. Very Gilesy.And what can be said about Whedon's writing and plotting that hasn't already been said? Everything is tight, all is perfect. The cliffhanger at the end makes me want the next issue right away!

The last page was a shocker. Love it. What more can I say?"},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 #3: The Long Way Home Part Three (Dark Horse Comics)","review":"Wonder no longer! As a huge fan of Buffy/Angel/Firefly/Joss, I was anxiously determined to adapt to this new format for Season 8...and, after a few issues, adapted I have. And I guarantee that you will, too - anxiety free. Let me tell you how you won't regret it:1. It's Joss! He IS these characters. Even just scanning the word and thought bubbles, you can HEAR them all quipping and whining and fighting just like in the good ol' days. It's super fun to try to figure out who the \\"surprise\\" character is on the next page from the little bit of enticing dialog revealed before you make that fateful page turn...such is Joss's talent for words that you'll instinctively know who it is before you see the art. You might as well be hearing their voices off-camera on the show, pre dramatic entrance.2. While some of the body-language slash facial-expression \\"acting\\" by the artists doesn't quite match what the actor-actors (on tv) might have chosen, it is incredibly well done and seems to be getting better with each new issue.3. The comic medium is actually used to deliver new stuff...especially special effects that would've been waaay too \\"special\\" on tv. (Dawn's giant situation, for example...but other stuff, too. Especially in this issue.) Plus, you know that some of the harshness of real-world reality, like annoying network notes and the unavailability of actors, etc, just won't be responsible for derailing stories here.[As an aside, I have to believe that some of the giddiness of this freedom is responsible for the much-hyped Buffy/Spike/Angel fantasy panel which, to me, seems completely bogus, out of character, and gratuitous for the comic-book-guy-stereotype. Some version of this for Xander - totally! But not so much for Buffy.]4. Joss does an incredible job of smoothing the tv-to-comic transition. As another reviewer (Beranbo) eloquently describes, Joss blatantly chooses \\"surprises\\" that almost over-resonate with connections to the tv show. And, in retrospect, you look at the surprises and you're like, \\"duh-of course! Why didn't I see that coming?\\" But no matter how well you know your Joss shows, you STILL don't see \`em coming. Unlike the other reviewer, even though I occasionally saw through the device-iness - I not only bought into it but completely LOVED it.Most importantly, the combo platter of Joss's script, the art, your imagination, and your love for the show will allow you to FEEL the characters and their stories and be swept away into their world...which is the whole point!"},{"Title":"Master of Ballantrae","review":"Stevenson is best known today as a writer of juvenile fiction. This doesn't do justice to his skills as a writer of historical fiction or his ability to explore psychological and moral issues. Master of Ballantrae is one of his best works. Set in 18th century Scotland, it is an exploration of the nature and relationship between good and evil. In many ways, this is a parallel book to Jekyll and Hyde. In Master, the different aspects of human moral behavior are explored in conflict and relationship of 2 brothers, one charismatic and amoral, the other, stolid and virtuous. This is primarily a psychological novel of family tragedy brought about by the characters of the 2 bothers in a conflict ignited by the Jacobite uprising of 1745. Stevenson does an excellent job of handling the characters and plot. As with his other work, there is a nice depiction of 18th century Scotland. This is not a great work, but it is very good."},{"Title":"Master of Ballantrae","review":"I am a big fan of Robert Louis Stevenson, and I think that &quot;The Master of Ballantrae&quot; is his best novel.

James Durie (the Master) is such a wicked man, but seems to charm (most) everybody. He is such a round character. He torments his poor brother Henry Durie and Henry suffers in silence. Only Mr. Mackellar knows of Henry's sufferings. The Master makes the book so colorful. It's full of adventure, romance, sorrow, and revenge. I highly recommend this book, because it was so interesting and kept you wondering what would happen next. I am sure it will capture your attention as it did mine."},{"Title":"Master of Ballantrae","review":"I have always liked everything written by Stevenson, but The Master of Ballantrae far outstrips everything else. It is a subtle insight into human nature, and a great adventure story as well. The episodes are majestic, and the story, though bleak, is very touching. I have read it many, many times and think more of it the more I read it (to paraphrase Mackellar on page 1)."},{"Title":"Master of Ballantrae","review":"_The Master of Ballantrae_ is not one of Stevenson's better novels but I knew that before going into it. It's been sometimes described as \\"masterly\\", and since I've rarely read any Stevenson I didn't like, I gave it a try. The psychological battle between two brothers is the sub-text of this Scott-like epic historical tale with elements of James Fenimore Cooper's _Leatherstocking Tales_, _Treasure Island_ and _Kidnapped_. However unlike Scott and Cooper, who had nationalistic designs, Stevenson's is a darker more inward looking story of psychology. The overall effect is strange and a bit \\"Sensational\\" (ala _Woman in White_). Not to my taste, but I understand Stevenson was influenced by Scott growing up and wanted ultimately to write a series of Scottish historical romances that would help with Scotland's independence movement. But instead he wrote Ballantrae in the middle of winter (thus \\"A Winter's Tale\\") in the Adirondack Mountains of New York on his way to the Pacific, far away from Scotland, to which he would never return. Rather than a national epic it is an odd sort of genre-bending thriller probably best read today for the psychological struggle between two brothers."},{"Title":"Master of Ballantrae","review":"The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale by Robert Louis StevensonThe book is full of adventure, romance, sorrow, and revenge.

Definately not your momma's stories. Most of them masquerade as reviews of films that have never been made or books that have never been written. Berry, at his best, wraps an excellent story around literary theory to create a nice pill that's easy to swallow. \\"A Theory of Fiction,\\" \\"Torture!\\" and \\"Knott Unbound\\" stand out in this regard. Some of the stories are uneven, however, failing to satisfactorily mix intelligent discourse with an experimental impulse. So when Berry is good, he's very good. When he's not, he's just okay.

Even on those terms it fails. E.g., how can a section about wills be part of the \\"joys\\". If anything, wills are a problem about being gay, and irrelevant to gay sex, joys or not. I would say that this book is not at all directed towards gays, who I'm sure will know much , much, much more about the subject than has been written here, but towards those who have a prurient interest, are mere gawkers, or who are timidly venturing towards it.

The setting of this is in North Carolina in the period after the Civil War, and is the second book in the \`Carolina Cousins' series. It documents more of the challenges which were faced by the young women of Rosewood and their extended and unusual \`family' made up of whites, blacks and half-negroes who emulate what it means to be a true Christian family.Even though the story is oftentimes told in the first person voice of Mayme Daniels the illegitimate child of a black woman and Katie's Uncle Templeton it is really the story of another young black woman, Emma Tolan whose self esteem had been sadly de-moralized while a slave on a neighboring plantation. Emma was portrayed as a slightly scatterbrained young woman who had arrived pregnant when cousins Katie and Mayme aided her in the delivery of her now four year old son William. After escaping from a cruel white master Emma had found sanctuary and love within the generous and loving Templeton extended family. When the bedraggled and wounded soldier, Micah Duff found his way to Rosewood he too would find that same safe sanctuary as he was soon embraced by and invited into the \`family'.Micah was a remarkable black man from the north. Spiritually aware, educated and speaking more like a refined white gentleman than even some of the Southern men which of course did not endear him to the powers to be in the \`new South'. As Micah's wounds healed he became more and more aware of the beautiful black girl Emma, and before he knew it he'd fallen in love with her. Unfortunately, a white man with political aspirations couldn't afford to have his dirty laundry aired in public, and have a black son show up to ruin his chances of glory. While plans were progressing to eliminate his annoying indiscretions, Micah would battle in order to keep both Emma and William safe in order to save his dreams of them becoming a real family.The story was simple yet complex with numerous secondary characters that took some time in having to sort out the relationships between all of the various members of the \`extended' Templeton family. The author kept the lively pace moving briskly along with the intrigue and suspense of the dangers that dogged Southerners who treated former black slaves as equals. If at times my reading slowed it was in trying to decipher the Southern negro patois the author utilized that while adding a level of natural flavor to the story, was at first difficult for this reviewer to understand. Otherwise, I found this to be a well written and well researched novel for the period showing the bitterness and turmoil of the population from those defeated Southern states. More importantly, it was a novel showing true Christian values and of faith in God and how that faith could sustain a body when the most horrible tragedy of loss of a loved one threatens to rip a person's life apart. This was a beautiful story of love and faith both profound and insightful that is sure to please most fans.Marilyn Rondeau, RIO - Reviewers International Organization"},{"Title":"The Soldier's Lady (Carolina Cousins #2)","review":"The Soldier's Lady by Michael Phillips is book two in the Carolina Cousins series, which is itself a sequel to the Shenandoah Sisters series. Micah Duff, the buffalo soldier last seen in A Perilous Proposal, shows up tired and injured at Rosewood, the North Carolina plantation that has became a haven for both blacks and whites. He meets Emma Tolan, a former slave, and sparks fly. I really enjoyed the first series, but I've been disappointed by the Cousins books. They start with a chapter without names throwing the family into distress. Then the book backs up a few months and tells the story preceding the disaster to come. I don't like books that use this technique; it feels like blackmailing the reader into finishing the book. Mayme telling the story in the Sisters series felt natural, but the jumps between narration in this book seem awkward at times. When Micah tells the story of his childhood, it feels unnatural and a bit forced. The premise of McSimmons wanting to get rid of Emma and William also seems contrived considering that it (I won't go into detail because of spoilers) was common practice in the South before the War. I've really enjoyed reading about the Clairborne family, and it's obvious that there will be more books in this series. I just hope that the others are more rooted in history and plot."},{"Title":"The Soldier's Lady (Carolina Cousins #2)","review":"Reading a novel set in the post-civil war south about blacks and whites learning to live together is a good thing. How many Caucasians stop to consider how terrible and difficult life was for slaves. Even after the abolition of slavery, it was a long hard road. Books like this provide that awareness and give whites an appreciation for the struggles faced by blacks even today.This is the second book in the Carolina Cousins series. This new series doesn't suffer from being an offshoot of the popular Shenandoah series. Just like the novels of George MacDonald, a man who has served as a mentor to Phillips, character development is primary. The focus is on relationships and issues.Phillips follows MacDonald's lead in emphasizing the fatherhood of God, our relationship to him as children, and obedience as the primary way to know and follow God. Though this might be considered light reading, it contains thoughtful spiritual content. Like MacDonald, Phillips provides keen insights into human nature and the nature of God.He is not afraid to challenge traditional thinking. His views, which are slightly unorthodox at times, can be a little unsettling, but they are also thought-provoking. Some may find them refreshing.Particularly interesting are the romantic relationships. Jeremiah starts to wonder if Mayme, the woman he planned to marry, is interested in his long lost friend Micah, who comes to live with them on the Rosewood Plantation. Jeremiah begins to wonder if he has more in common with Emma, an uneducated former slave, who has a son named William. Phillips effectively portrays the insecurities and uncertainties typical in romantic relationships. He keeps you guessing as to what will happen.Blacks and whites living and working together in the post-Civil war south may seem far-fetched but the good writing and storytelling make it believable. That's not to say that this group doesn't experience hostility and danger from others. They do. The story starts with an act of evil and then backtracks to fill in the events leading up to it.This is a pleasant read, and since it's been shown that whites and blacks have different perceptions on racism, books like this can be a bridge to a more realistic perspective and promote empathy."},{"Title":"The Soldier's Lady (Carolina Cousins #2)","review":"the 1st book in the set, was given to me, and I was a little reluctant at 1st, because of the time setting, but, once I started, I could'nt put it down, and the way it ended, leaving you hanging, I asked the lady that gave me the book, if there was a sequel, she did'nt know, so I went online and found them, and told her, now she wants to read them as soon as i'm done."},{"Title":"The Soldier's Lady (Carolina Cousins #2)","review":"The Carolina Cousins series is an excellent collection for adults and young teen readers. It has some wonderful spritual lessons and it has some incredible motivational properties. Although it has elements of wholesome Christian values, it is very tasteful and it does not over state these elements. It is not a fanatical series. This series would be great for secondary grade students. I'd like to see this type of reading in our school system and not so much goth or mystical mayhem. I have the full series of the Carolina Cousins. Each book is best read in sequence. I read the first book out of sequence and then I wanted more. The book had a list of the series so I ordered all of the books on Amazon. I've just started reading The Soldier's Lady and I cannot put it down. Lots of energy and twists. Wonderful historical fiction. This is good wholesome Christian literature. The story takes place in the post-Civil War era. African Americans are trying to find their way in a society that diligently tries to hang on to the slave system that made any White man with a dream a wealthy baron."},{"Title":"The Soldier's Lady (Carolina Cousins #2)","review":"I was not impressed with this book.

It is an insightful look at the crisis of \\"brain-as-mind\\" thinking, and the idea that the \\"whole\\" is greater the sum of its percieved parts. Luhmann is about as even handed as a writer can hope to be, but ultimately seems to conclude that the whole person approach to psychiatry is probably best for the individual and the larger culture.The book works equally well as a piece of cultural criticism depicting the competing points of view among the schools of psychiatry as a thought provoking paradigm used to portray \\"kinds of mind\\" and the ways we think about ourselves and each other. There are, to be sure, many more than TWO MINDS, but there does seem to be Two Dominat Camps. One that thinks we are little more than a collection of our symptoms and one that thinks we are much more imaginative and capable than the limitations of our physical selves.Great piece of social history!"},{"Title":"Of Two Minds: An Anthropologist Looks at American Psychiatry","review":"A bit outdated now, but still very very relevant to modern day psychiatry.

It seemed to promise to be an outsider critique of psychiatry in the same lague as such classics as \\"Asylums\\". Instead, I found the book to be superficial on a number of different levels and rather unfair to both the psychoanalytic and biological approaches to psychiatric treatment. As a clinical psychologist, I have had alot of exposure to psychiatric training, psychoanalytic therapy, and the scienitific foundations, as well as practice of biological psychiatry. It is from this background, that I found the book lacking on so many fronts.Luhrmann never provides a satisfactory definition of what she means by psychoanalytic psychotherapy. What she does is proceed to rule out many contemporary forms of this treatment (e.g., interpersonal psychotherapy), without opeartionalizing what's left. She further confuses writings about different forms of psychoanalytically-oriented treatment, for example misattributing Roy Shafer's opinions from \\"The Analytic Attitude\\" to psychoanalysis, when in fact he was talking about psychotherapy. The treatment of biological approaches is even worse. She reduces an evolving area of science into opinion-ridden discourse. Indeed, it appears that she simply has made little effort to understand the biology and pharmacology of psychiatric disorders. Any number of undergraduate or graduate courses in phyisological psychology, pharmacology, etc. could have made this relatively accessible to her. Instead she dismisses science as \\"just jargon\\". The shortcomings in this analysis are, unfortunately, obvious for someone with a basic foundation in these biological areas.The book contains many footnotes, yet the author seems compelled to make sweeping statements about custom & practice in mental health that are unsupported by references. For example, Luhrmann claims that psychanalytic therapy forms the primary basis for psychotherapy training in psychiatry but provides no reference for this. In practice, many psychitaric training programs emphasize other approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapies, whose research base fits an evidence-based model of treatment better than most psychoanalytic approaches. Luhrmann also seems surprisingly unaware of the roles and backgrounds of other mental health fields. Nurses, for example, are the backbone of inpatient psychiatry and psychiatric nurse clinicians play a growing role in ERs and in consultation-liaison psychiatry. But she relegates them to a very minor role here.The writing of this book is often condescending and jargon-ridden which probably makes it inaccessible to much of its intended audience. In this respect it resembles the calssic \\"Asylums\\" but it lacks Goffmann's detail and rigor.People really interested in mental health practice seem more likely to learn from journalistic accounts such as the upcoming history of McLean's or Susan Sheehan's classic \\"Is There No Place on Earth for Me?\\"."},{"Title":"Of Two Minds: An Anthropologist Looks at American Psychiatry","review":"If you want to know how to write an ethnography, this is definitely a good book to model after.

Only one, but the light bulb has to want to change.This is the one of the best books I have found on psychoanalysis, therapy, legal drugs, medical education, and so much more, including a look at personal interactions among bright, educated, dedicated people. The author, an anthropologist on the Stanford faculty, brings a lot of information and observations to the pages and paragraphs.

I was a bit perplexed when the book barely even mentioned the Final Solution against the Jews, and how it generally whitewashed Hitler's role in this and other Nazi atrocities. I didn't dwell on it at the time, and only learned later that Irving is an unabashed Hitler apologist, who has been mostly discredited as a historian, and who is prone to conspiracy theorizing and suing his critics. This book is by a credible historian that Irving sued for libel, Deborah Lipstadt, who published convincing evidence that he is a \\"holocaust denier.\\" This book covers the trial that, due to the procedures of British law, became not just a defense against libel accusations but a debate on the history of the holocaust itself.Lipstadt and her publisher emerged victorious, due to the sheer weight of the evidence from history, proving that it was not libel to make the extremely obvious claim that Irving is a \\"holocaust denier.\\" That certainly makes this book worthwhile, but there are some problems with Lipstadt's reporting on the trial. I agree with some other reviewers in that she is quite self-centered, describing how she kept second-guessing her lawyers and the judge almost every day. She frequently criticizes the judge for treating Irving's court tactics in an evenhanded or impartial fashion, as if it were not his job to follow courtroom procedures in a respectable way. Lipstadt also often complains about the unfavorable differences between British and American law, which all turns out to be little more than melodrama, because she already announced at the start of the book that she would eventually win the case.More fundamentally, Lipstadt recounts the trial testimony to such a detailed extent that this book becomes (inadvertently, I assume) a verbose condemnation of Irving's views and conclusions. This detracts from the book's supposed theme of justice, to a painfully obvious rebuttal of Irving's work. This was not entirely necessary because Irving's errors speak for themselves, as seen in the outcome of the case. There are some interesting allusions to the differences between selective interpretation (Irving) and convergence of evidence (everyone else) in the art of history, but this is mostly lost under Lisptadt's frequent self-aggrandizement about the righteousness of her struggle. Lipstadt did a great thing for truth and justice by fighting off Irving's desperate attacks, but there could have been better ways to report on this important trial. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"When Holocaust- denial first surfaced I found it shocking and incredible. I have personally known many people who lost relatives in the Holocaust. And in fact if one wishes to extend this to cousins it is rare to find Jewish families of Eastern European origin who have not lost family members. Thus the first question that always came to mind was; ' How can they possibly do this?'But then the terrible truth emerged. There are people who still support the Nazis because they share the Nazis aims, and are Nazis themselves. The Holocaust deniers are anti- Semites who would like to do away with the Jews.In this work Deborah Lipstadt tells of her trial in which she is accused of having defamed David Irving, who is the most well- known Holocaust denier in the world.She tells of the preparation for the case, and of the decision not to win on a technicality but to go to the heart of the matter i.e. to prove that Irving denied the historical reality of the Holocaust, and to prove that the Holocaust in fact did happen.In the end Lipstadt won the case, and Irving was discredited as a historian . The whole enterprise of ' Holocaust denial' was revealed to be a scholarly sham.However Lipstadt has no illusions about this putting an end to Holocaust denial, or the continued efforts of anti- Semites to harm the Jewish people.I was not at all surprised to find a long piece of Holocaust- denial on this Amazon review site by one reviewer who denied the Nazis ever planned the destruction of the Jewish people This planning first took place at the Wannsee conference. The Wanssee conference is defined by Wikipedia as follows: \\"The Wannsee Conference was the discussion by a group of Nazi officials about the \\"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\\" (Endl&ouml;sung der Judenfrage). It took place on January 20, 1942 in the Wannsee Villa overlooking the Wannsee lake in southwestern Berlin and would lead to the Holocaust.\\"Evil persists in the world. And as the writer Jill Malter says, also on this Amazon site, it is to Deborah Lipstadt's tremendous credit that she had the courage to fight and resist it.For the battle against the Evil of the Nazis and their supporters is an ongoing one, which unfortunately will probably have to continue for years to come."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"Deborah Lipstadt's story of her prosecution for libel by David Irving, a British author, Hitler apologist, and Holocaust denier, is inspirational on several levels. First, as an historian, I was glad to see the rules true historians live by being used to unmask a man who distorted history. Secondly, it was elevating to witness Lipstadt's courage and fidelity to her faith, her family, and to the truth through years of tension and weeks of witnessing painful testimony at her trial. Third, I was impressed by the commitment so many people gave to helping Lipstadt prevail against Irving: the lawyers who agreed to work pro bono or at reduced rates, the publishers who stood by her when it would have been much easier to apologize to Irving and bail out of the trial, the countless people who opened their checkbooks to finance the enormously expensive undertaking, and the many others who encouraged her like taxi drivers, hotel owners, and Holocaust survivors who came to thank her for standing up for the truth. Finally, this book is encouraging because it demonstrates that no matter how evil and well funded a lie can be, with diligence and determination the truth can be revealed.Most descriptions of trials, particularly one so detailed as this, become too dry for any but lawyers and other courtroom aficionados to appreciate. History on Trial, despite the intricacies of the legal proceedings, is never dull and always fascinating."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"It is rare that a book, and a non-fiction book at that, can make you laugh and cry on the same page. Deborah Lipstadt, professor of Jewish Studies at Emory University, succeeds in doing this with her moving and brilliant account of her \\"day\\" in court with David Irving.Irving a noted British historian had sued Professor Lipstadt because she had called him a Holocaust denier in her book Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.The recounts the formation of the defense superteam which included QC Richard Rampton and Anthony Julius, Princess Diana's divorce lawyer.We are taken on a long but exciting journey from Atlanta to Auschwitz and then on to the Law Courts in London, and fell the emotional peaks and troughs as Deborah Lipstadt realises how different and how favourable to the plantiff are Britain's libel laws. She explains with clarity the fact that expert witnesses in the UK owe their allegiance to the court and are not hired guns. She is worried that her experts will show too much deference to Irving's reputation but as the team led by Cambridge Professor Richard Evans delve into the body of Irving's work they become more convinced of the rightness and righteousness of her defense. Evans 700 page report is damning in its criticsm of Irving.The day by day account of the trial is fascinating as Rampton and Irving duel verbally, and when one laughs usually at Irving's behaviour one is brought back down to earth at the thought of the terrible loss of life.At one point Irving states that he feels queasy when he sees blacks playing for England's cricket team. I therefore assumed that Chariots of Fire was not his favourite movie.Irving's assertion that the Jews brought antisemitism and the Holocaust on themselves, gives one a feeling of deja vu when one thinks of some peoples reaction to 9/11.I have had the privilege of meeting Holocaust survivors, a British officer who entered Belsen, and a British soldier imprisoned in Auschwitz, if they were alive today they would be thanking Deborah Lipstadt for her brave fight and for writing this book, which should be on the reading list of every school and university in the UK and USA."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"Historian Deborah Lipstadt, in her 1993 bookDenying the Holocaust : The Growing Assault on Truth and Memorylabeled historian David Irving a Holocaust denier. In 1995, Irving sued Lipstadt and her British publisher, Penguin, in the British courts, in which legal system the defendant (Lipstadt) had to prove that she told the truth rather than (as in the U.S. system) the plaintiff (Irving) prove that she lied.In 2007, I attended a lecture by Deborah in which she summarized her 5-year experience defending her original claim. The story is also told in her 2005 book, HISTORY ON TRIAL. Having previously made sobering visits to the concentration camp sites at Dachau, Mauthausen and Auschwitz, I felt this book to be required reading.HISTORY ON TRIAL is 305 pages long, 328 if you add \\"Acknowledgments\\" and \\"Notes\\". The core of the narrative, and the most interesting part for me, is the 187-page \\"Trial\\" section wherein the high points of the testimonies and cross-examinations during the 10-week trial at London's Royal Courts of Justice in 2000 are summarized. For any reader of historical non-fiction, what should prove instructive is the revelation how Irving, renowned for his books on Adolph Hitler, the Third Reich, and the European theater of World War II, distorted facts on a multitude of occasions in order to paint Hitler in a more favorable light, specifically, to present that the Fuehrer had no knowledge of the Holocaust and that the systematic killing of Jews was not directed from Berlin. He did this, apparently, to endear himself to contemporary white supremacist organizations. That Irving himself expressed racist and anti-Semitic sentiments, and that he was indeed a Holocaust denier, were the judgments of the court. And, moreover, the verdict was upheld on subsequent appeal.The valuable lesson to be learned, the one for which this book needs to be read, is that historical works can't necessarily be taken at face value no matter what the reputation of their authors or the excellence of their presentations.The old axiom has it that a physician who treats himself, or a lawyer who represents himself, is a fool. If that be the case, then Irving, who represented himself before Judge Charles Gray and is himself not a lawyer, is perhaps one of the biggest fools on Earth. As described by Lipstadt - and, again, we must remember the lesson about the selective presentation of facts - Irving demonstrates via his words spoken in court what an insidiously devious and disingenuous historian he's capable of being. A lawyer representing this plaintiff might've accomplished some damage control. But, then, this book's lesson would've been diluted to the readers' loss.This will anger those readers of this review who idolize Deborah, but I'm going to suggest that she wasn't the best chronicler of this case. For the same reason that Irving shouldn't have represented himself, Lipstadt should've perhaps left the telling of the story, even after the fact, to one with some emotional distance from it. Her passionate involvement caused me to become increasingly annoyed with her. After all, Lipstadt didn't select the English solicitor, Anthony Julius, whose law firm team prepared her defense; Julius approached her. Lipstadt didn't pay for the legal services; the cost was covered by donations from sympathizers. Lipstadt didn't select the barrister, Richard Rampton, who presented her case in court; Anthony and Penguin did. Her contribution to the defense's pre-trial preparation was, at least as described, minimal at best. Lipstadt didn't testify on her own behalf; she was advised not to. Indeed, except for one short verbal outburst in court in response to something said by the plaintiff, she remained totally silent throughout. Occasionally in the narrative, she expresses discomfiture over Judge Gray's evenhandedness, a great naivete about the British legal system, doubt about the wisdom of Rampton's tactics before the bar, and hand-wringing angst that her own professional reputation would be besmirched by Irving's counter claims. By the end of the book, I began to wonder if she had the requisite mettle for the whole tussle. Luckily, Julius and Rampton did. Yet, after Gray read his verdict, it was, to Deborah, her battle and her triumph. Not until the Acknowledgments, which many readers may be tempted to skip, did she give due credit to Rampton, Julius, and the rest of the defense team. The 5-year ordeal was all about her, apparently, and this self-centeredness became tiresome.Despite the flaws of HISTORY ON TRIAL, I'm awarding four stars for it's value in reminding us that great crimes against humanity, regardless of the time, place, and perpetrator, cannot, indeed must not, be forgotten or denied. The collective conscience must remain unimpaired."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"To read mactans' review of the book with its glowing quotes by the trial judge (see his review with quotes from the judge), one would think that Irving won his suit. He didn't. Just as Irving selects bits of source documents and claims they absolve Hitler and the Nazis of the atrocities they are accused of, mactan gives only part of the story. Remember, Irving sued Lipstadt. He not only wanted damages, he wanted HER BOOK REMOVED FROM CIRCULATION. Talk about a dangerous precedent. Lipstadt did not say that Irving should not partake of his first amendment rights. As far as I know, she did not call for his books to be removed from library and bookshelves. Irving apologists want to frame the case as a dangerous attempt to sqaush a valid interpretation of history. Coming to different conclusions based on historical source material is not the issue here- misrepresenting source material to support a pre-existing bias or prejudice is. The same is true for book reviews."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"There are a good many publications today, almost amounting to an industry, trying to deny or mitigate the Nazi atrocities of World War II. Generally, they take one of three forms: a denial of the holocaust or at least a denial of its generally recognized magnitude; a denial that Hitler or the Nazi leadership knew what was going on; and a claim that others committed similar atrocities or contributed to the holocaust. David Irving was involved in all three avenues, and when Professor Deborah Lipstadt mentioned him, in her earlier work 'Denying the Holocaust', as one of the most dangerous spokespersons of the denial movement, he slapped a libel suit on her.This book is the story of the resulting court case. It unravels step by step the dodgy claims of holocaust deniers. It is a fascinating story, not only because it is Deborah Lipstadt's own personal account, but also because of the contributions of some of the foremost historical and technical experts, and the assistance from a first class legal team. Those who lived through the war years will probably want to buy or read it, but I believe that all people who were born after the war should have a copy of it on their bookshelves to arm themselves against attempts to distort the historical record."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"That Holocaust denial thrives today is depressing (and troubling) in the extreme. That for so many years an insidiously subtle form of it spilled from the pen of a celebrated historian -- David Irving -- is shocking. Those who criticize Lipstadt and her legal team for putting scholarship on trial are quick to forget that it was Irving himself who initiated the law suit. In order to prove the libel accusation against her false, Lipstadt and team did precisely what British law requires a defendant to do: justify her claims about the plaintiff. Marshaling the tools of responsible scholarship to the task, they did just that, along the way revealing Irving not only as a grossly negligent historian but a deliberately manipulative one. Not once, but on three separate occasions the British courts found Lipstadt innocent of the charges against her and justified in her published claims about Irving. The libel suit that Irving brought against Lipstadt had nothing to do with defending his freedom of speech, and everything to do with denying her her own. Lipstadt's victory in the British courts was a victory for freedom of speech and a triumph of reasoned arguments against irrational ones. Lipstadt tells the story of this trial and the court-room drama surrounding it in great and fascinating detail. History on Trial is a first-rate and very important book."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"This is a wonderful book, in that it is both a history of the Holocaust, a history of the holocaust denial advocates, and a personal history of Deborah Lipstadt's trial as a defendant in a libel action by David Irving. As you can see by the review posted, David Irving was a British so called historian, who was well regarded as a historian of the Hitler period. In every instance he shaded his conclusions in favor of Hitler, and Germany in the period of WWII. He also was one who claimed there was no Jewish Holocaust, and had a wide following in the holocaust denial movement around the world. Deborah Lipstadt mentioned David Irving in the her book on holocaust denial. David Irving sued her in England for libel, and this book is the history of that trial, and the years leading up to the trial. I have recently heard Dr. Lipstadt in Dallas discussing the trial and the events surrounding the trial. Dr. Lipstadt won that tial. The story, the book, and Dr. Lipstadt are impressive. That there are still holocaust deniers even today is chilling. One must read this book to understand what Dr. Lipstadt faced, and what she had done for all of us in winning this trial."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"Even though I was among the many who virtually followed this trial five years ago, devouring the media reports, transcripts and the thoroughly devastating judgment against the plaintiff, who has a penchant for launching libel suits against those who do not think as highly of his work as he does, this book was still very much a page turner for me - and I enjoyed every single one!Those who are not familiar with the case - or with the so-called \\"arguments\\" put forth by Holocaust deniers - will find History on Trial to be a good introduction to the charlatans who wrap themselves in the flag of freedom of speech in order to promote their lies and distortions."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"Excellent book!Places the Holocaust deniers and minimizers in their deceptive realm."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"Deborah Lipstadt is an outstanding and courageous scholar. When she wrote her book, Denying the Holcaust, she dissected the work of David Irving, a bigot masquerading as an historian. Irving sued her and her publisher for libel in a British court in which the burden of proof in a libel case is on the defendant. Dr. Lipstadt desribes in great, and at times, horrifying detail her the five years spent in preparaton for the trial and the trial itself. She and Penquin Publishers won, and the judgment forced Irving into bankruptcy. The lesson to be learned is that the only way to combat evil is to confront it. The writing is so vivid and chilling, that at times I had to put the book down for a few moments to regain some sense of composure. We owe a debt to Professor Lipstadt for her dedication to the truth, meticulous scholarship, and bravery."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"A fairly detailed account of the author's lawsuit when she was sued by the Holocaust denier, David Irving. In addition to Irving's suspect scholarship, he also comes across as an enormous jerk.I think this would be a nice supplement to the Errol Morris documentary, Mr. Death: The Rise & Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr.My only complaint has to do with Lipstadt's \\"Israel can do no wrong\\" point of view. Worshippers of Chomsky should probably stay away."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"Having read Richard Evans' \\"Lying About Hitler\\" and D.D. Guttenplan's \\"The Holocaust on Trial\\" I was looking forward to this first-hand account of the Irving trial by Ms. Lipstadt. But this account falls somewhat flat compared to these earlier works. There is something off-putting about the tone of the book, as she comes across as humorless and self-centered, without much self-awareness, not promising in a first-person memoir, and the book could have been much better edited. From the beginning, Ms. Lipsdadt seems to relish ordering her underlings around, and even has her grad students gathering material for her next book proposal. The book downplays the part played by Yehuda Bauer, who urged Lipsdadt to beef up the material on Irving in her book; her compliance instigated the suit. There are a few howlers also, such as \\"despite the fact that three publishers were vying for my manuscript on American press coverage of the Holocaust, UCLA denied me tenure.\\" (p.16) (By this standard, perhaps John Grisham or Danielle Steel should be tenured professors somewhere) Ms. Lipstadt did not say a word at the central event, the Irving trial in London, and her position as a figurehead sadly comes through clearly. What exactly did all those trips to London accomplsh, except running up the tab? Her British publisher, Penguin, who footed the multi-million dollar tab for her defense, deserves more credit for their contribution, and the author seems stingy and ungrateful here. (Evans and Guttenplan tell how as many as 40 attorneys were working on this case at one time). And do we really need to know her exercise regimen and that she worked out daily during the trial? While she deserves credit for standing up to Irving, it is clear that the heavy lifting was done by her attorneys, mainly Anthony Julius and James Libson. Ms. Lipstadt does get in some well-deserved licks against John Keegan, whose support of Irving and his books (especially \\"Hitler's War\\", the history of WW2 Hitler would have written) is so reprehensible that it should cause a radical reestimation and downward revision of everything he has ever written on the war. For a nuanced account of the historical meaning of the trial, one has to turn to Evans. The lack of any serious attempt to give the author's experience historic context is the central flaw of this book, which is evident after reading Evans. Also, Guttenplan gives a better journalistic account. And while I realize she has to flog the book, does she really have to go on the Bill O'Reilly show to do it? But for those really interested in Holocaust denial, it is worth a read."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"\\"History on Trial' is a well written, fast paced, riveting courtroom drama. But it is much more than that. It puts the nail in the coffin of Holocaust denial. It does that in two ways. It does so first of all with forensic evidence and historical documents. Secondly, it does so by exposing the soul of the deniers.David Irving as a respected historian must certainly be considered the top of the class of deniers. To watch him squirm, weasel, distort, falsify, and weave a web of propaganda in order to promote his agenda is to totally discredit the entire denial industry. There is no honest search for historical truth here.On a personal note, being ignorant of the evidence, I was sucked in to giving the deniers a respectful hearing. I knew that Hitler and his Nazi regime were capable of doing everything they were accused of doing. This to me was the ultimate issue. The gruesome inhumanity, while sickening, was only an historic detail which confirmed what I already knew. The historic question was to what extent did they actually do it and to what extent was it a planned effort of the regime.To anyone not living in a cave the establishment - mainstream media, academia, etcetera -- view was clear, at least in the good old days when the establishment wasn't anti-Semitic. Anything bad you wanted to believe about the Nazis was true. My contempt for establishment propagandizing made me even more receptive to contrary views.I gave the deniers as well as their detractors a superficial hearing, and from this lazy perspective the debate seemed to be a matter of he said, she said. However, I kept my antennas up. When I learned of the deniers defeat in a British court and that a book had been written about it, I knew that this was a book I had to have.\\"History on Trial' lived up to my expectations and more. As for the deniers, to quote Nathaniel Branden, no door is shut so tight as one that was once open.Thank you, Professor Lipstadt, for taking the scary step of battling the deniers in court. I thank the attorneys, the expert witnesses, and the entire defense team for their impressive efforts. I thank all those whose financial support made a defense possible. And I thank Professor Lipstadt again for writing her account of the trial without which I would still be in relative ignorance about the debate."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"I just read this book, but I'm buying it to have a personal copy which I can annotate. Anyone at all interested in understanding Holocaust denial should have both this book and the book that brought this trial about:Denying the Holocaust : The Growing Assault on Truth and MemoryFor those that don't know the story: Deborah Lipstadt -- a professor of Jewish studies and Holocaust Studies at Emory University -- wrote Denying the Holocaust (in 1991 IIRC) to detail what she saw as the dangerous movement of Holocaust Denial. In the late 80s, early 90s Holocaust Denial was adopting a different approach, attempting to give itself legitimacy by co-opting elements of legitimate research (such as calling itself 'revisionism') and trying to dress itself up with the trappings, but not the substance, of historical research, claiming that all it wanted to do was 'ask questions' about the Holocaust. (all of which were of the 'have you stopped beating your wife' sort)Her purpose was to expose them for the charlatans they are, to expose their 'history' as sham, to show their arguments as tendentious nonsense built on a racist uber-premise. The book is devastating critique of the intellectual dishonesty of Holocaust Denial. She then commented that among those who seem to have siddled up to or wended their way into denial was David Irving, who, at that time had some rep as an amateur historian. For this reason she thought him more dangerous that most, since he actually had some credibility and wasn't _completely_ absurd, like, say, Zundel (author of _The Hitler we Loved and Why_).David Irving sued for libel in the U.K., where the law _greatly_ favors the plaintiff, in that all the plaintiff must do is show that the book does actually damage his reputation materially (i.e. he looses money). After that it's up to the defendant to answer the charges in some way. One of those ways is to prove that the claims in the book are true. But it's the defendant's responsibility to make that proof. One of Lipstadt's assertions was that the Irving's errors in history can't be simple mistakes, they must have been intentional.Proving there are errors isn't hard, proving that they were intentional misrepresentations of the historical evidence is quite a bit harder, Irving, after all, could win merely by making plausible claims that he'd just made a mistake.History on Trial is a 1st person chronicle of Prof. Lipstadt's experiences from the moment Irving filed the suit through 5 years to the end, when Irving loses his 2nd appeal. It's fascinating both for the facts of the case and watching Irving get demolished at the leisurely pace of a book reading -- so that one can stop and go over each passage with relish -- but also for the sense of the journey Lipstadt takes. She shares with us her worries about how the case is going, agonizes about whether she should testify, worries that the lawyers for Penguin might settle, frets that the judge is giving Irving too much leeway or that her lawyers don't see the trial in the larger perspective of mainting the truth of memory. For instance, early on in the book Lipstadt and the head lawyer, Rampton, go to Auschwitz and talk with one of the defense's expert witnesses, Robert Jan van Pelt. In the course of their talk Rampton hammers away at Robert Jan about history's claims about Auschwtiz and Lipstadt fumes (privately) about how Rampton seems more like a 'revisionist' than someone on her side. Only when van Pelt gets on the stand (years later, in fact) and Irving starts haranging him does she come to understand (and says so later to Rampton) that Rampton was just getting him ready for cross examination.Perhaps most daunting, she must endure the questioning (and sometimes near hostility) of members of her professional circles and some fellow Jews who think that defending in this trial is going to give deniers the forum they've always wanted and many times must do this silently, particularly during the trial itself.And then there are the scenes when she sees or meets a survivor of the Holocaust outside the courtroom or in one of her travels in preparation for the trial, some of whom interact with her only by showing the number tattooed on their forearm.Fascinating stuff and to watch Irving go down in flames of his own devising makes it doubly sweet. In some of the exchanges where he's driven to acknowledge that this or that bold assertion from this or that book made with such gusto is completely wrong _and_ that he should have known at the time that it was wrong (well, he never really admits this, but it's clear in the context) whereupon he seeks to minimize it by claiming 'Oh, you know, this isn't a very important statement' kept reminding me of a little child caught in a lie. And we _all_ see it.As a result of his gross miscalculation Irving is now thoroughly discredited as an historian and so should be the whole of Holocaust denial, but, alas, to paraphrase the Bible: 'the fools will always be with us.'"},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"Having read two excellent works on Irving vs. Lipstadt (one by a journalist, another by a professor who served as an expert witness), I decided to read this book, which was the first written by one of the two main characters of the trial. Very briefly, I can only say that it was a bitter disappointment. Professor Lipstadt fails to shed any new light on the case, filling up the book with all sorts of irrelevant details. Instead of providing, say, a historiographic or philosophical account of her battle with Irving, all she does is to recount - in mind-numbing detail - her trips across the Atlantic, her bewilderment with British court procedure and her reactions to events in court.I struggled to finish this book and would recommend instead \\"The Holocaust on trial\\" by DD Guttenplan or \\"Telling lies about Hitler\\" by Richard Evans, both of whom have more interesting things to tell us - and in mercifully shorter works."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"I see that another reviewer called this book \\"Tedious.\\" I don't agree; I reflected as I read that it could have been a dry recounting of fact, but it wasn't; I found it exciting and couldn't wait to see what happened next. Deborah's wit and ability to articulate the various stages in an authentic and lively way made it not only an important work but interesting to read.I can't count the times I smacked my forehead and blasphemed at Irving's stupidity and bizarreness. Um, ultimately uncle Adolf was NOT an antisemite but the best friend the Jews had?? No doubt the pustules that continue to support him will cook up word-soups in an effort to salvage him from this, but he is exposed for what he is.It was hard to get my head around why a man who told deliberate lies would sue somebody thus risking his lies being exposed; that seemed counter-intuitive to me. But it became apparent through reading the book that Irving is a couple of sausage rolls short of a packed lunch. This case portrays a man who is delusional about his own greatness; he sees himself as a messiah of sorts and perhaps believed that he would get away with the twaddle he peddles. To say nothing of his view of himself as a poor, beleagured martyr/victim of those nasty, greedy, conspiratorial Jews. I may cry.From a personal point of view: He should rot in a very warm place for his treatment of Holocaust survivors - gleeful spiteful treatment that he's actually proud of. Scumbag. He shot himself well and truly in the foot this time.Utterly recommended."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"As interested as I was and am in the topic of Prof. Lipstadt's book, I nonetheless found myself slogging through it and thinking, \\"This is a fascinating article for The New Yorker that has been made into a 350-page book. If I wanted a transcript of the trial.....\\" At the same time, even readers familiar with post-WWII anti-semitism will find themselves open-mouthed at the things some people will write or say into a microphone. For all of her confidence in her own ability as a professional historian, Deborah Lipstadt seems never to have developed a corresponding confidence in the legal abilities of the attorneys who argued her case in court and she makes clear the difficulty she had in deferring to their professional judgement.The strategy and argumentation are fascinating. As with all modern books, even those written by very fine writers, \\"History On Trial\\" could have used one more read by a sharp-eyed editor."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Aside from the satisfaction of reading about how David Irving shot himself in the foot, Lipstadt's account of her libel trial (it can't be said often enough that she, and not Irving, was the defendant and that she paid a very significant personal price for her victory) is well written and provides lots of valuable information about the court case. Lipstadt's accounts of the widespread support she received from members of the public are particularly interesting, and illustrate what was at stake in the trial - if Irving had somehow either won or drawn, the extensive media coverage the trial received would have meant that his appalling views would have gained extensive coverage and a degree of respectability. Instead, Lipstadt rightfully points out that while the historical validity of the Holocaust wasn't ever at stake, her victory publicly discredited the main pillars of Holocaust denial at the time.While the book provides interesting accounts of how the defence developed their strategy and conducted their side of the trial, I was disappointed that Lipstadt didn't go into greater detail on these topics given that she was one of the few people to see them through from start to finish. For example, she doesn't really explain how her lawyers integrated their legal strategy with the need to present a historical argument to prove that Irving was writing falsehoods. On the other hand, Lipstadt's portrayal of Irving is particularly devastating; rather than directly criticise him, she simply recounts his actions, the evidence presented by the expert witnesses and final judgement. The end result is that Irving is revealed to be a political extremist and liar while Lipstadt retains her dignity by not directly engaging his claims.All up, this is a fascinating book which combines a useful insight into historical methods with a well-told courtroom drama."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"Professor Lipstadt's account of her trial for libel brought by disgraced writer David Irving manages to be full of suspense even though I knew what the judgement was. She describes the origins of the lawsuit, the months of build-up to the trial, the trial itself, and the judgement, which vindicated her of libel, and showed David Irving to be more than a Holocaust denier, but a liar and anti-semite amongst other things. The fear that although they might win, she and Penguin books would not win absolutely, is well described. I did not find Lipstadt to be humorless, just serious about what were a harrowing few years of her life. The pace of the book is excellent, it is well written and clear, and the insights into the difference between English and American law are thought-provoking. The book also shows that the British \\"old-boy\\" system is still alive and well for some people, notably Keegan with his odious writing in the Daily Telegraph, but refreshingly not so in the defence's team nor in the judge. The reactions from survivors and plain Brits - taxi drivers, restaurant patrons, hotel employees, are a heart-warming counter to this. Professor Lipstadt is remarkably restrained in her descriptions of Irving, merely letting his words and actions, as well as the judgement, get across what he is like, which is quite sufficient.There is a lot to learn from this book, not least importantly that one must be very careful about believing what one reads in newspapers and books. Many of the journalists writing about the trial made basic mistakes and put them in print, and the C-Span debacle has made it clear that even when money is not a motive, a tv channel purporting to be independent of ratings may want to entertain rather than inform."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"definitely a quick and entertaining read. I started reading when I got on a bus at 1 PM, and finished the book at about 6 or 7 (despite napping for an hour or so in the middle of a journey).Other reviewers have adequately discussed this book's coverage of the Irving/Lipstadt trial: but I was also interested in learning about the toll litigation can take on the time and energy of even a victorious party.After reading this book, I am definitely more supportive than before of American libel law (which typically places the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show falsity, and provides that public figures can only recover if they show that their opponent was truly reckless): Britian's pro-plaintiff libel law, by encouraging libel suits, caused both Mr. Irving and Ms. Lipstadt to subject themselves to levels of scrutiny that I suspect few scholarly reputations could survive.One minor point: I wish Lipstadt had included some of the relevant documents (in particular, Irving's initial complaint) in the appendix so readers could follow exactly what the parties needed to prove."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"Want a true life legal thriller that reads like fiction? Want a plot so outlandish that it is hard to remember that it is real? Something that will make you think, laugh, get angry, and make you proud, all in the same story?Well, here it is. This is an acocunt of the case whereby Deborah Lipstadt was asked to prove in a British court of law that the Holocaust happened!The plaintiff: David Irving - a British historian who makes claims such as that no gassings took place in Auschwitz and that Hitler was unaware of the \\"final solution.\\" The defendant: Deborah Lipstadt - an American historian sued by Irving for writing a book that, in its pages, takes Irving to task for practicing bad history. Irving sued for libel and, per the backwards legal system of Britian, put the burden of proof on Lipstadt to prove that libel DID NOT occur. The only way to do this? Prove that the things Irving has said about the Holocaust are not only untrue, but that Irving willfully distorted the facts. She must, in other words, prove the Holocaust.This book is Lipstadt's first-hand account of the trial. In so reading, we gradually witness Irving's \\"history\\" being held under a microscope by various witnesses who meticulously demonstrate Irving's less-than-honest methods of \\"history.\\" We watch how Irving quotes only very select passages from documents (and not others), mistranslates words, phrases, and dates, discredits disfavorable evidence as bogus (while being all too ready to accept more 'favorable' evidence without question), etc.What this all leads to is one doozy of a circumstantial case that Irving's \\"mistakes and errors\\" were deliberate misrepresentations. As the prosecution liked to put it, mistakes are mistakes, but when 500 mistakes all move towards one and only one conclusoion - exculpation of Hitler - one can be sure that they are \\"calculated mistakes.\\" (At one comically sad point in the book, historian Richard Evans says something to this effect whiloe being cross-examined by Irving. Irving, seemingly oblivious to the indictment, comments something like, \\"You mean, like a waiter who consistently gives back wrong change, always in his favor?\\" He had no idea he was indicting himself!)The book is of interest, then, in two different ways. First, it is strangly entertaiing for such a grave subject. (The Scopes trial has nohting on Irving/Lipstadt.)Lipstadt does a great job telling the story. Second, it is of interest to all who care about history. We get to see how history is done, and how history is not to be done. In so many words, we witness the difference between academic historians and con-artistic ideologues.As this trial recieved remarkably scant attention in the states, it is fun to read of what was a \\"front page\\" trial in Britian. We had OJ - they had Irving v. Lipstadt. So, if you are ever in a position to read a gripping true-life courtroom drama, skip the books on the OJ trial, and read Lipstadt's \\"History on Trial.\\" The truth IS stranger than fiction (even the fiction David Irving calls the truth.)"},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"After the trial was over an editorial cartoon appeared in the Daily Telegraph that showed a man holding up a book entitled \\"That Libel Trial Never Happened\\", by David Irving. After reading about the trial you can easily picture Mr. Irving making such a denial. Deborah Lipstadt was involved in a libel suit brought against her by David Irving who claimed his character was defamed by her calling him, in essence, a Holocaust denier.The book gives us a courtroom seat for the entire trial in which Irving represented himself. While Ms. Lipstadt exhibited anxiety about the outcome, the reader of the book will probably be shaking his/her head at what seemed to be a total farce. Mr. Irving was constantly confronted with inaccuracies, incorrect data, and suppression of important facts in the books that he wrote. His response most frequently was that he had made innocent mistakes, that he was up late working and in his tired state he made trivial mistakes. He made many speeches to ultra right wing groups, and denied that he knew anything about the organizations. He denied that he was racist, and stated that he had hired \\"colored\\" people, and then talked in a belittling way about them.The judge decides in favor of Ms. Lipstadt, and soundly criticizes Mr. Irving, although he does make a few favorable remarks about him at the very beginning of his long decision. Mr. Irving made three appeals of the decision, all of which were denied.The book is well written and quite suspenseful even though you know how it will end. It is also interesting to read some of the other reviews of this book which are obviously written by other holocaust deniers. One reviewer presents only the initial positive remarks of the judge, and seems to be a denier of the bulk of the very long decision. One other reviewer comments that this book brings nothing new to the story and mentions two other books, one by Professor Evans who testified at the trial. Admittedly if you have read these books first Ms. Lipstadt's might seem superfluous, but I thought this book was excellent, and highly recommend it.British libel trials are interesting affairs that are in direct contrast to American libel laws. If you find this book as fascinating as I did you might want to read this book:\\"McLibel: Burger Culture on Trial\\" by John Vidal. This book is about a libel suit brought by McDonalds against a couple of ordinary citizens who passed out leaflets that were critical of the McDonald's operation. It is an interesting coverage of a trial that turned out to be the longest libel trial in British history."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"There are varying degrees of published untruth. One can accidentally cite what turns out to be a lie that has slipped into the international information supply. One can simply \\"forget\\" to search through works that might refute one's thesis. One can cite dubious claims, recklessly disregarding the inconsistencies between them and plenty of other information. But in the case of David Irving, the problem is fraud, where there is actual falsification of the historical record.Now, any work can be used in part to taunt others. But it seems to me that in the case of denying what happened to so many Jews in World War II, a primary goal must be to taunt people. Too many people are too aware of the truth for deceit to be the whole plan. The liars know they are lying, and they know that many others know it as well.So I wondered what would happen in this trial. Could liars truly get away with anything? And the answer in this case was no.It's important to realize that David Irving was not the defendant in some sort of case to censor his lies. If that had been the situation, some folks would have raised issues of freedom of speech. However, Irving was actually suing Lipstadt for defamation. If anyone's right to free speech was threatened, it was Lipstadt's.As one who strongly opposes antischolarly lies, I found this book very interesting. And I was not surprised to see how bad an impression Irving made in court. After Irving lost, even the Guardian had as a headline, \\"Irving: Confined to History as a Racist Liar.\\"Lipstadt explains that the actual falsifiers of history are not the issue. \\"Though the battle against our opponents is exceptionally important, the opponents themselves are not. Their arguments make as much sense as flat-earth theory. However, in dramatic contrast to flat-earthers, they can cause tremendous pain and damage.\\" And we see some of that in the reactions of some of the survivors of death camps.I wondered if Lipstadt would make any mention of the stunning number of lies that are in print about the Middle East. She did. Lipstadt naturally mentioned Holocaust denial on the part of Mahmoud Abbas and Abdel Aziz Rantisi. But she also noted, um, Nobel Laureate Yasir Arafat's denial of any connection between the Jewish people and the land of Israel. As well as the incresed status of various blood libel myths and the \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\\" In addition, she explains that one of Arafat's fellow Nobel Laureates, Jose Saramago, compared Arabs in the Levant with Jews at Auschwitz. And that Tom Paulin called Yeshan Jews \\"Nazis and racists\\" who \\"ought to be shot dead.\\"Now, what is to be done with the liars? Must they be refuted? Lipstadt says yes. And she says it is important to leave them dressed \\"in the jester's costume.\\" I agree. At some point, the entire scholarly endeavor of our civilization will be in jeopardy if we can't pass proper judgment on such absurd lies.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"In 1993 Deborah Lipstadt published a book on Holocaust Denial that called David Irving, a man who was respected as a Hitler scholar, a Holocaust denier. In response David Irving sued Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin, for libel. Deborah and her team (Richard Rampton, Anthony Julius, James Libson, Heather, Michaela, Richard Evans, Robert Jan van Pelt, Christopher Bowning, Peter Longerich and Hajo Funke) mounted a vigorous defense. To prevent Deborah Lipstadt's book from being taken off the shelves, they had to prove that Irving was a racist and a liar who denied the Holocaust because he hates Jews and admires Hitler. This is the story of how they proved their case.It is a page-turner of a story. It is an engrossing account of court-room drama and, at the same time, a wonderful story of how historical research ought to be done. What it is not is an \\"even and balanced account\\" which gives Lipstadt's \\"side\\" and Irving's \\"side\\" equal airtime. It is not the book's intention to be that; it is a deeply personal and passionate book and an attempt to briefly document that Irving was a liar and that his work is composed of malicious lies. And it is this moral clarity that (above all) makes this book so valuable and so engrossing.Which is not to say that the book is without its faults. Deborah Lipstadt states often how difficult it was for her to say farewell to her team. The last two chapters of this book (unfortunately) bear this out. For they are (in essence) a prolonged and fond farewell to her team. Reading them reminded me of the many (slightly awkward) occasions when friends and relatives and I stood at the door, making awkward small-talk because we had to leave but didn't want to. Had Deborah Lipstadt compressed those two chapters into one, this book would have (in my opinion) been much better.Despite this one minor flaw, I heartily recommend this work to anyone interested in one of the most important cases of our time."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"There have been many good books on the Irving vs. Lipstadt trial. But this book, despite being written by the defendant, is not one of them.Lipstadt is extremely self-centered. Almost every page, in effect, has the following format: \\"The judge (or Irving or defense councel Rampton or the witness) said X, and I felt Y and Z and W and...\\"; or \\"I have seen so-and-so pass a note to...\\"; \\"I saw smiles in the public gallery...\\", etc. The description is not so much of the trial as it is of Lipstandt's emotional roller coaster and trivial observations, which makes for very vapid reading.Worse, Lipstadt obviously simply does not know how the law works, which means that the relation between her all-important emotions and reality is tenuous, at best. For example, she is \\"outraged\\" that the judge talks about the \\"alleged\\" gas chambers. Over lunch, Rampton, the defense counsel, patiently explains to her the judge is not a secret holocaust denier, but since Irving claimed the gas chambers did not exist as part of his legal defense, the judge must not publically say anything that shows he made up his mind about their reality before the verdict. Lipstadt accepts this--but a few pages later is \\"worried\\" again that the judge had treated Irving politely, once more confusing legal formalities with agreement.A good illustration of Lipstandt's annoying self-centerdness is on p. 93-94. During lunch break, she sees an acquitance weeping and his friend mentioning her to come over. She did not want to do this, since she \\"only had an hour for lunch\\" and \\"did not want to get involved\\". But his friend insisted, so Deborah discovered, in the conversation, that this acquitance's father knew her own grandfather in Europe. Then, of course, she suddenly DOES want to talk to him in more detail (after suffering yet another emotional turmoil: \\"Now I was overcome by emotion. Gustav Lipstadt was my grandfather...\\") but HE tells her to go to lunch with her counsels instead of comforting him, since \\"that is more important\\". The contrast between the two of them could not be more stiking.Finally, there is the issue of simple sloppiness. Why did this book take so long? We get a hint from various quotes she uses: Rampton said \\"low [sic] and behold\\", or mentioned \\"these gangers [sic]\\". Both the misspellings and the \\"sic\\" are in Lipstadt's book. But how could Rampton SAY \\"low and behold\\" or \\"gangers\\" (for \\"gangsters\\")? Clearly, this is a typo not in what Rampton SAID, but in the official TRIAL TRANSCRIPT, where the court clerk misprinted \\"low\\" for \\"low\\", etc.Obviously, despite being written as a direct \\"eyewitness account\\", Lipstadt wrote this book not from her notes during the trial (she never mentions taking any of substance) but--years later--by sitting around with the official trial transcripts and trying to recall what she felt and what she saw every day as it happened. While this is surely easier for an egoist like Lipstadt than for most people, it still makes one wonder how accurate her recollections are.No, for a good book about this trial, do not look for this book. Instead, you'd be far better than the unemotional (but devastating) book by one of the defense witnesses, Prof. Richard Evans, LYING ABOUT HITLER. There, without self-centered navel-gazing or emotional outbursts, Evans shows in great detail both how he reached the conclusion that Irving deliberately manipulated his research for antisemitic, pro-nazi reasons, and how the truth about it came out in the trial which rightly destroyed Irving's reputation. Or just read the court transcripts, available in many places, where the judge does the same thing. Lipstadt simply adds nothing to that but vapid hysterionics."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"This is a very well written, detailed account of a court case in which a person, who writes and speaks positively about Hitler and denies that the Holocaust took place, sues for libel an American historian who has written accurately about him. It deals with fears (from the American historian's perspective)that come with facing a trial and the strength of the good people who are doing the \\"right thing\\". I think it is an important book because of the terrible history (man's inhumanity) that is reviewed and, as important, the necessary reminder of the extremes some people will go to distort history and the truth. It is a good reminder that decent people can not standby when others do harm."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"It is interesting to read the other reviews of this book and see that few reviewers felt neutral about it. Some loved it, believing it to be the work of a determined, principled person fighting against evil. Others hated it, considering it to be a boring, self-centered account of the trial, and another piece of libel against David Irving.Well, I have to say that I am in the first camp. I regard this as a very fine book by a very fine person who was fighting an important battle on behalf of all of us, Jews and non-Jews alike.It is a very personal book. If you want an impersonal and purely objective account of the issues at stake, there are other sources. But it seems to me that a personal book is precisely what this subject requires.Pulling unarmed and harmless men, women, old people, children, and infants out of their houses and shooting them or throwing them into gas chambers is a very personal act. Covering it up and lying to convince people it didn't happen is also a personal act. Both of those acts cry out for accountability.Dr. Lipstadt sat in a courtroom and listened to Irving deny that the Holocaust happened. By just turning her head she could see elderly people in the gallery with numbers tattood on their arms who had watched this happen to their own families. What was at stake was not a technical issue regarding percentages of hydrogen cyanide in cement, or the interpretation of dark spots on aerial photos, it was whether some of the most massive crimes in human history actually occurred. It was about whether the truth about a man who lied to deny and cover up those crimes would be allowed to be published.Irving sued Lipstadt to censor her. He demanded that the publishers withdraw her book from publication. He insisted that he was telling the truth and she was not. He threatened other publishers and actually succeeded in censoring a number of other writers, keeping their books from being published, or forcing them to be edited, out of fear of his starting more lawsuits.Lipstadt and her brilliant legal and research team proved that it was Irving who was lying and that it was Lipstadt who had told the truth.I'm very glad that she stood up to him. I'm very glad that Penguin, and Emory University, and the Jewish community backed her. I'm very glad that she proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was Irving who lied and not her. And I'm very glad that she wrote this very lucid and moving account of the experience."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"This a a very insightful and well written book. It exposes the reader to many new and unfamiliar British court proceedings. It sheds light on a very controversial topic, Holocaust Deniers. It questions what it means to be an \\"ethical historian\\". This book also highlights much of the drama and excitement of the libel case. Strongly recommended for anyone who enjoys history/ anything to do with law."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"Written by the author of BEYOND BELIEF, who went too far in criticizing a fellow writer in 1993, culminating in a trial for which she had to pay dearly. In her book, DENYING THE HOLOCAUST, she called David Irving, a respected writer, 'one of the most dangerous spokesmen of the denial movement' and he sued her for slander. That was his right according to the Constitution of the United States. This is about that trial.She should have known there'd be repercussions. No surprize about that! Some people the freedom of speech and expression too far. Some women just don't learn and make the same mistakes over and over. I am one of them, and I do vocalize my strong opinions. But, in the past three years, I've learned how to say \\"I'm sorry\\" -- too late.She had to raise 1.5 million dollars for her defense. You'd think that would make her think twice of learn to keep some opinions to herself, no matter how strong they are. Actually, they don't mean anything to others, as they are simply 'opinions' and not facts. I have some family members who will 'win at any cost.' I've learned to go back and apologize if I have offended someone, but it was a hard lesson -- not easily learned or accomplished. She paid big bucks to secure the services of Princess Diana's divorce lawyer, Anthony Julius. The case was that big. I'd say the woman was pretty scared to go to those extremes. She looks more like Sarah Ferguson than Diana.A lot (too much really) has been written about the holocaust and Auschwitz because of Anne Frank's diary. To uncover new evidence at this late date just won't happen. It was a tragedy, but it's over; it's in the past. Some people won't 'let dead dogs lie' -- a local perservationist group (mostly UT people) stir up trouble all the time. They couldn't save a local 'historical' house a far piece out from downtown (the historic area) located on a golf course. But they are still badgering the city council, for the publicity!Gas chambers were not unique to Germany. We had them in our prisons, after the gallows. Ethel Rosenberg was the first woman in America to be legally 'gased.\\" Now, they use a more 'humane' type of execution (is there such a thing?) by legal injection.It has been proven that Hitler's genocide of the Jewish people is just that. He wanted a 'pure' race. He is the precursor of the modern KKK, who believes in white power. There is no way to exonerate Hitler. He was not misguided -- he was evil, and that's why he chose to commit suicide when he was caught.We all have 'fighting words' especially rednecks, billbilly, white trash, polok, ignoramus, niggers, etc. A Jester's costume is for a fool.

Dr. Lipstadt stomped the holocaust denier David Irving into the ground, and we can all be thankful of it. My only comments are (i) it is a pity that Dr. Lipstadt's initial work, upon which Irving sued, was not well written, and (ii) Lipstadt diplomatically downplays the fact that Emory University, where she is employed, contributed only a paltry amount to her defense. This is perhaps indicative that Emory's traditional attitude towards Jews has not really changed."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"A great book! It is an interesting and revieling how a historian can get away with distorting facts for so long and also that he just jumped to conclusions instead of looking at a lot of evidence to back up what he thought. Deborah E. Lipstadt along with a group of people who are defending her aginst David Irving help the world get inside his head."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"There is nothing ideologues like better than a rousing food fight--hurling epitaphs at each other with reckless abandon--endlessly seeking to score a better direct hit, and fearing only that a monitor will arrive to put an end to their foolishness. David Irving's life-long career as a pre-eminent and controversial WW-II historian on Nazi leadership is such a battle. Although he as written 30 books on WW-II, and unearthed an incredible amount of fresh information of the subject, he has also attracted formidable ideological foes, intent not merely on crushing him in intellectual battle, but on discrediting him in every possible personal area. He must not only be declared a liar, a psychopath, and evil, but none of his oft ground-breaking work can be shown the slightest regard. Most of all, he must be financially ruined and permanently silenced.One sterling example is Irving's Wikipedia bio--a slick, professionally crafted hatchet-job with not a single unalloyed compliment. It is guarded day and night by invisible zealots who immediately remove the slightest softening alteration. In a summary box, Irving is not listed as being a \\"WW-II historian\\" but for \\"Holocaust denial and negationist historical writing.\\" Whew!\\"History on trial\\" joins this chorous, but does so out in the open. It does so by takings \\"text-proofing\\" to a high art--amassing a large corpus of Irving's many errors, exaggerations and equivocations--and scrupulously leaving out any exculpatory evidence. This is an easy trick when applied to David Irving whose historical beliefs have sashayed in a highly ambivalent trajectory. But without a counter-balance, such \\"scholarship\\" is next to worthless.The two major aspects of David Irving's career as an historian are these:1. He is an indefatigable researcher who has sought-out and discovered an astonishing trove of inside details about the Third Reich leadership and its actions. His ability in this regard is unparalleled. Yet this talent is never alluded to in a positive light by Ms Lipstadt.2. He has clearly developed a high regard--an affection even--for many of the odious Nazi leadership. This affection has occasionally caused him to be a bit too quick to spring to their defense.Irving's occasional special pleadings were only altered or retracted--and usually with some reluctance--when overwhelming counter-evidence was produced. But altered they eventually were. However, to his enemies his original sin can never be forgiven. To continue today, as Ms Lipstadt does, to accuse Irving of being a \\"Holocaust denier\\" falls into the same black hole of dirty tricks as repeatedly claiming that Mel Gibson is one--in spite of his repeated explicit public affirmations that the Holocaust occurred, or that President Bush knew about the lack of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction when no one else in the world did either. To ideologues, an evocative epitaph is far too satisfying to let go just because it has been utterly disproven.Irving terms his opponents \\"the Holocaust industry,\\" primarily religious zealots to whom the Holocaust has become the central tenet of their neo-Judaism. The other major transgression in the eyes of this group is any positive utterance about their Devil-in-Chief, Adolf Hitler. In many countries it has become legally impossible to hold a free discussion about Adolf Hitler or the holocaust, without breaking speech laws--especially in Germany and France (and, of course, in Israel). Although not yet illegal in the U.S., it has become socially and professionally unacceptable to evince any doubt on the extent, motivation and blame of the Holocaust. Ms Lipstadt's charge--that Irving was a \\"Holocaust denier\\" was deliberate hurled--not as a provable claim, but precisely in order to get the legal system to shut Irvine up, to lock him up and, if possible, to bankrupt him. Ah, yes, scholarship at its finest.The central issues of Irving's persecution were never raised as legal issues in his trial. Irving did describe in some appalling detail how Ms Lopstadt's accusations resulted in jail time and bankruptcy. Many long-time publishers of his 30 books suddenly refused to work with him. The London Sunday Times welched on a translation contract, its editor citing incredible pressure to shed himself of anything to do with Irving. Pressure from whom was never questioned at the trial, much less answered. The final insult was that Ms Lipstadt refused to confront her accuser by taking the stand herself, making a mockery of the books title \\"My day in court.\\"The questions that must finally be asked is why we need the legal system to determine whether David Irving \\"denies the holocaust.\\" Has the Scopes trial taught us nothing? Why, in the academic realm of history, do intense religious convictions so effortlessly supersede scholarly debate? What the result of Ms Lipstadt's court room victory has brought to our attention once more (if we will only listen) is that unelected religious bigots continue to successfully force their ideology on the public with impunity. In countries that pretend to be run democratically, this is a sorry state of affairs."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"The following are his true feelings...QUESTION: I ask you this question because I know that you have been plagued and hounded around the United States specifically on this issue of the Holocaust.

I described the Holocaust years ago as the most fantastic outburst of insanity in human history, so much so that if we even agree to discuss the matter we demean ourselves. Those statements and numerous others like them are in print, but they're basically irrelevant because you have to understand that this is part of a Stalinist-style technique to silence critics of the holy state and therefore the truth is entirely irrelevant, you just tell as many lies as you can and hope that some of the mud will stick. It's a standard technique used by the Stalinist parties, by the Nazis and by these guys."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"This first-hand account of Ms. Lipstadt's trial was illuminating and compelling straight through to its satisfying end."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"_History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier_ by Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt is supposed to be an account of her experiences with the historian David Irving in court after being sued by him. Let me begin by saying that I believe the Holocaust did occur and accept the \\"convergence of evidence\\" proof as the correct one. However, what I hate to see is this tragic event used as a political weapon. Professor Lipstadt wrote a book (_Denying the Holocaust_) in which she basically lumped all far right and far left theorists in with Holocaust deniers. Among others she included Noam Chomsky, Patrick Buchanan, revisionist historian Harry Elmer Barnes, and the Libertarian party (described by her as a \\"fringe group\\") in with Holocaust deniers. She also called for these individuals to be publicly excoriated for their alleged denial and to face stiffer public penalties for doing so. In this present book describing the trial, she also describes Mel Gibson (not his father mind you!) and Norman Finkelstein as potential deniers. One of these \\"vipers\\" who she referred to as a denier was David Irving, an autodidact historian with a somewhat dubious history. Many of Irving's historical claims are highly dubious and as this book shows in many points he is a denier. However, the question remains as to whether Irving has a right to express these views in any forum at all. I believe the answer to this question to be absolutely. There are two reasons for this. First, he may actually believe what he writes to be true, in which case he is merely describing historical events as he sees them. And secondly, there is the freedom of speech issue. Currently, Irving is in a prison in Europe after being arrested for publicly denying the Holocaust. What the politically correct have failed to realize is that not only have they made a martyr out of Irving and his ilk, but they have re-inforced the conspiracist worldview that sees the government as largely controlled by totalitarian politically correct forces. To put it simply, the tragedy of the Holocaust is being used as a means for political gain by the ultra-politically correct. Judging from what I've read of the case, it appears that Professor Lipstadt went after Irving, calling for stiffer public penalties for Holocaust deniers, and leading a movement to drive them underground. While Irving's behavior was certainly despicable (particularly as concerns his litigious record and his tendencies to publicly abuse survivors), after reading this book I cannot say that Professor Lipstadt's behavior was any less despicable. In any event, Irving sued Lipstadt and her publishing company Penguin for libel in England claiming that they were part of a worldwide conspiracy to suppress the truth. The rest of this book is a rather boring (actually) detailed account and debunking of Irving's historical theories in court. Irving comes across as a charlatan who fiddles with historical records as he sees fit. On the other hand, Lipstadt comes across as an incorrigible politically correct activist who sees anti-Semitism, racism, and prejudice everywhere. Lipstadt spends a good part of this book defending her Jewishness, making side comments about her inner state and vapid appeals to emotion, and commenting on the alleged anti-Semitism in the various plays and books she sees and reads while involved in the trial. One has to wonder after reading Lipstadt's book if there is such a thing as legitimate criticism of the Jews, if the Jews are not above criticism, and if all criticism of Jews, Jewish organizations, or Israel is anti-Semitism. Nevertheless, I believe she has the right to publish her views in the same way that Irving has the right to publish his. What is despicable though is that a courtroom was required to rule on a matter of history and to rule so far as to the correct historical interpretation. Ultimately Irving was driven underground after having lost and was forced to pay the court fees driving him into bankruptcy. Subsequently he was arrested in Austria for his denial and is currently serving a prison sentence. The ultimate result of all of this is that while Lipstadt was vindicated and allowed to precede with the continued publication of her rather nauseous works (as is her right of course) it will lead to a situation where historians become afraid to take unpopular or controversial views on historical matters. Revisionism is a legitimate enterprise and while Holocaust denial may be highly malignant, not all revisionism is denial. It is likely that in the future this situation will present a slippery slope where mainstream historical interpretation comes to be enforced in the courts and stiff penalties exist for those historians who do not toe the line (shades of 1984). While Lipstadt certainly has the right to publish her views and the case was likely decided correctly on that point, the ultimate result of the situation has been a despicable one on all sides."},{"Title":"History on Trial : My Day in Court with David Irving","review":"I have no idea what she was trying to accomplish, other than the despicable deeds she did after temporarily \\"winning\\" in court and seizing all Irving's possessions...of which many irreplaceable pieces of history are lost, most likely destroyed or stolen.

However, any historian, journalist, or writer in general could be found to have an equal levelof faults in their works.Irving is one of the integral historians of WW2 and Nazism. His research has probably brought more new evidence and datato light than any single historian of this era. The bibliography of any work of note on this period in history will contain references to Irving's work. The vast amounts of data, and the unique and varied nature of his sources, have made his contribution priceless.Lipstadt criticises his fluctuating figures, on, say the victims of Dresden. Yes, his estimates have varied, but then history in general is prone to evolution, rarely are such figures maintained as 100% accurate as decades pass. Especially the field Irving works in - what with the cold war, massive amoutns of integral material laid hidden for years, even decades.I would also state the statistics of Auschwitz victims have fallen from 6 million to less than 1 million in the last 50 years, very gradually. This represents much wider change than Irving's figures, and illustrates the evolution of historical analysis.The scariest part of this whole book/trial is that the expert historians who testified against Irving were paid 500,00. Very, very sinister. History, indeed, on trial. And if you're reading of it differs from what it's supposed, prepare to face annihalation. Remember Salman Rushdie and Iran?

In this one, she takes your finished product and helps you market and support it. I found the chapters on market research, display construction, and salesmanship the most helpful of all. With pictures of real displays and selling environments on almost every page, the reader cannot help but come away with a bounty of ideas and plans for their own display.Besides being informative, this book is easy to read and gives multiple real-life experiences in order to better connect to the reader.

He find that the Arctic is \\"rich with metaphor, with adumbration\\" (p. xxix).There are three themes at the center of his narrative: \\"the influence of the arctic landscape on the human imagination. How a desire to put a landscape to use shapes our evaluation of it. And, confronted by an unknown landscape, what happens to our sense of wealth. What does it mean to grow rich?\\" (p. 13). In the end Lopez thinks that the land is like poetry, \\"it is inexplicably coherent, it is transcendent in its meaning, and it has the power to elevate a consideration of human life\\" (p. 274).This is a wonderfully evocative set of observations about Arctic and its place in the \\"Weltanschauung\\" of Western Civilization."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"I bought this book while in the tourist center at McKinley National Park in Alaska because of the chapter on Polar Bears (someone at the desk recommended it to me).

Reading Arctic Dreams is like going on a journey to the Arctic in an airplane, equipped with a microscope, where in general you get a broad picture, but on certain topics (narwhals, polar bears, etc) you have a living speciman to study. And the writing is never mundane. It reads as a narration, as though you were sitting around a campfire while Lopez talks of the arctic. There are enough facts to educate without being a burden, and enough of Lopez's voice to carry the imagination to remote arctic islands, or on an early expedition, or simply to a prarie to watch the arctic fox.

I've read a ton of books on the Arctic, and this is one of the best.Each chapter encompasses a different part of the Arctic: to name a few, polar bears, narwhals, muskoxen, migration patterns, ice and light, Pingkok Island...every chapter, every word, every phrase in this book sticks. You cannot read this book without imagining an intensely beautiful place. The book also contains large chunks of Arctic history, of which Lopez seems to be a huge fan. He refers to expeditions, scientists, discoveries, famous explorers and researchers of the North, and also speaks of everyday people, everyday encounters, and thoughts and feelings all people experience at one point or another. The book is written with a combination of frankness and fascination that is difficult to describe. The book's chapters also touch on many different places in the North, from Alaska to Banks Island to Baffin Island to Greenland, Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, Kendall Island, and many more. The book is a story of an enormous part of the world, combining history, philosophy, science, literature, sociology, and a great deal of personal reflection.Maybe only someone completely obsessed with the Arctic could enjoy the book so completely. Maybe not. I've read some other reviews, and people who have read the book simply to learn something new have enjoyed it just as much as avid fans of the Arctic.

Lopez not only has the insights that make the Arctic come alive, but he expresses those insights in the most elegant prose. Arctic Dreams was published 20 years ago, and while the science needs updating (an Arctic scientist recently shared with me), the rest of the book is timeless. Who knew there were so many kinds of ice? Not only does the author describe the \\"land\\", but he describes the culture of the people whose lives are intertwined with the land, as well as the influences and politics that have changed their way of life forever. He explores the language needs of the people who work to survive in their often harsh environment. Those languages are primarily verb rich as opposed to English which is noun based. It took me a long time to read the whole book because often I would stop to ponder something I had just read. I have bought at least 20 copies over the years to give to friends and relatives. I still return to the book to reread passages or favorite chapters. Anyone interested in the Arctic would love this book.

The book reads much like a journeyman, the personal experiences mingling with sections outlining the cultural and historic (shamanistic to Cook and Peary), species and subspecie, the flora and fauna cirques, terminal moraines, and frazil of the crystal land. In many ways it also reads like a guidebook to the unknown, a sort of latter day spin-off to the wonderous adventure sagas on travel and exploration which played a critical part in books (and National Geographic) and other series' of the earlier part of the twentieth century. At still another level it presents a narrative which manages to economically convey the historic and environmental aspects which are arranged as if for magazine specials (of note are the lists of Specific Names and Places in the appendices sect.); concise, substantive and memorable.

One of the most fascinating tangents the author takes, for example, whilst contemplating the terror and wonder of an encounter with icebergs, is the comparison with cathedrals, leading to an analysis of the Luminist school of painting in late Nineteenth Century America, wending back around finally with a brief overview of Western architecture in general, concluding that, \\"The erection of the cathedrals was the last wild stride European man made before falling back into the confines of his intellect.\\" Controversial? Indeed. But boring or listless? Never.There are so many profound and lyrical passages describing so much about life - and death - in the regions of Ultima Thule, its inhabitants and explorers, past and present, its history and its rigours that I'm tempted to write a review of each chapter here, thus boring the prospective reader to no end. I'll simply conclude with one of the ensorcelling sentences from the book that kept this reader turning page after page to the last syllable of recorded arctic dream::\\"The outcry of birds, the bullet-whirr of their passing wings, the splashing of water, is, like the falling light, unending.\\"So are the rewards of losing oneself in this book."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"This is a beautifully written book, which has become my favorite mid-night reader, when I can't sleep.

Over 400 pages later I have a lot more information, and I now understand that I don't really have a clue. The history, archeology, cultures, ecosystems, land and ice forms are all much more complex than most are likely to imagine.Ice itself is infinitely complex. There are various kinds of sea ice, glacial ice, ice lenses in the soil, frozen soil, land ice, ice that forms shelves between land and sea. The ice changes in physical properties depending on the salt content of the water, how long it has been frozen, and many other factors that all affect the plants, animals, and people that are part of the arctic landscape. The arctic food chain actually depends on ice. Of this food chain Lopez states \\"The algae at the bottom of this food web are called \\"epontic\\" algae, the algae of the sea ice.\\" He goes on to say that, \\"It is the ice . . . that holds this life together.\\"While Lopez does not make a strong case for the effects that the arctic food chain has on the entire planet, it does not take a great leap to come to this understanding. Most animals that depend on the arctic are transitory visitors. They spend spring and summer feasting on pollen, insects, algae, or other creatures that live on these seasonal resources. They may depend on this bounty for nesting and raising young, or in other cases they may use the arctic as a feeding station for long migrations. These migrating animals tie the arctic food web to the landscapes and food chains that many of us inhabit and depend on. The nutrients that are produced by the algae living on sea ice make their way around the world in the movements of animals and ocean currents. Lopez doesn't dwell on climate change or the melting of the arctic. However, this seems to be a something we should all be concerned about.Anyone who is interested in understanding the planet, and our history as social and political creatures, will appreciate this book. I found some of the information I have been introduced to in other books strengthened and deepened with this reading. In \\"Collapse, How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" the author, Jared Diamond, discusses our ability to change and adapt as key to our survival. This is also reflected in Arctic Dreams, where Lopez discusses the failure of Arctic explorers to adapt and learn from Native people. The result of this failure to change resulted in repeated large scale tragedies--with hundreds of men lost, frostbitten, suffering from starvation, and sometimes even cannibalism.*Lopez also explores ground relating to the history of the \\"discovery\\" of the Western Hemisphere. I first read about Europeans fishing along Eastern North America's coast line before North America's \\"discovery\\" in \\"Cape Cod,\\" by Henry David Thoreau. Lopez covers this subject, and may even use the same documentation as Thoreau. However, he lingers longer and deepens our understanding. The ice crystals in the northern atmosphere, at times, create reflections of land masses that are below the horizon. During these events, land that is normally beyond our view becomes visible. Northern mariners, of all nationalities, have utilized these phenomena to find \\"new\\" land and fishing grounds. Lopez also explains that only the European elite class was considered capable of making \\"discoveries.\\" Peasant fisherman, wanderers, or early settlers were expected to get out of the way so the elite could have their way--some things just don't seem to change. **Arctic Dreams is beautiful written. The prose sings, illuminates, and educates. We are treated to first hand stories about musk ox and polar bear, as well as the results of scientific studies that look into these and other arctic creatures. The arctic is reflected back to us from indigenous inhabitants, explorers, and those who plunder resources. The collision between these forces has a huge bearing on the arctic, and perhaps, on all of us.\\"Arctic Dreams, Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape,\\" by Barry Lopez, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1986~~~~~~* When you're ready to change--both for yourself and the planet--see my book \\"Food Security & Sustainability for the Times Ahead\\".** You will find reviews of \\"Collapse\\" and \\"Cape Cod\\" in my Facebook notes as well as on Amazon.com.~~~~~Note to Native readers: Barry Lopez calls all far north indigenous people \\"Eskimos.\\" I thought this was a little odd, until I read the end notes (after I had read the rest of the text). In these notes he explains that the people do not like to be called Eskimos. I was a little horrified that he knew better, yet chose to promote this term. He knew the people--with whom he camped, ate, and hunted, and that he also called \\"friend\\"--would be offended. I do highly recommend this book, just keep in mind that the author considers himself white, and it shows.~~~~~For permission to post or publish outside Facebook or Amazon.com please contact me at: harvest95546@yahoo.com All my reviews are available--with permission--to post or publish on other sites or in print based publications."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"I'm not sure just where the desire comes in here unless it's to promote or develop the reader's desire to see the Arctic for her- himself, but the imagination is the reader's. It's challenged and quickened. This book is an experience.Have you ever played the parlor game where you're supposed to tell which animal you'd prefer to be reincarnated as, and why? I'd never come up with a satisfactory animal, but I'd never thought of the Polar bear.I'd like to be a Polar bear. Their winter dens sound lovely and I can imagine cradling a cub in my arms, leaning back against an ice floe and gazing off across the Arctic Sea. I'd love wearing the translucent white fur coat. (I wouldn't want to deprive an animal of one, but I'd love to grow my own.) Swimming has always been a favorite activity of mine, too, and with the fur coat I don't suppose I'd mind the ice water!It's an amazing thing to empathize with an animal!Lopez's descriptions of the arctic ice and seasons, the people, the history and cultures, all are enchanting. It's a wonderfully magical world, so different from the lands and peoples of the rest of the world. Lopez carves that world into our imaginations as skillfully as the ice sculptor renders his tools.Summer is the perfect time to read this one; especially one of the hottest summers on record!"},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"This book is a lyrical reflection on the oneness of nature and mankind's troubled relationship with it. It is recommended for anyone contemplating a journey to the higher latitudes. However, as a history of arctic exploration it is sadly flawed. The two chapters on early journeys of discovery and the quest for the northwest passage are chronologically jumbled. Furthermore, the inexplicable and virtually complete neglect of Amundson - including his learning from Eskimos - leaves one wondering what other omissions may have tilted the balance of Lopez's otherwise thought-provoking writing."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Some passages in this book are beautifully written. I will agree there's not much of an arc to the whole thing and if you wanted to you could skip about the middle third and not miss much other than some encyclopedic goings on.The author also feels the need to mystify \\"Eskimos.\\" I understand he was truly impressed with some of these people, but his belief that \\"Eskimos\\" have some sort of genetic ability to estimate torsion, torque curves and whatever out of a bunch of rocks and bones is laughable at best. By devoting a couple of lines to issues of alcohol and violence in these communities the author neglects a very serious and pressing issue for these Arctic people.As well, if you're Canadian, you should be prepared for a book-long undertone of pro-American flag waving propaganda. Mr. Lopez adores Peary, but saves more than a few paragraphs for how ignorant and short sighted Canadians are, while most of the time ignoring that it could be a country at all. He finds it rather funny to illegally enter the country along the Yukon border. It was my impression such comedy was not entertained along the southern border of the authors' country.This book might better be titled \\"American Dreams of Mystical Eskimos.\\""},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Barry Lopez's Arctic Dreams is a fascinating, poetic trip through the Arctic landscape, its people and sturdy animals. I loved reading this book from the comfort of my armchair."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"I have read numerous book on the Arctic, and this one, by far, is the worst. The reviews I'd read spoke of this sparking a love for the Arctic and inspiring them to learn more about the beauty of the Artic. I'd have to say I can't imagine how they got that. I could barely keep my eyes open trying to read this. The mind-numbing detail with which Lopez describes the latitudinal changes of light and soils and such is simply overbearing and excessive. This book inspired me only to put it down and read something else."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"when i ordered arctic dreams i thought it would include the european arctic. i am going to svalbard this summer. so it doesn't meet my needs. however, i plan to eventually read it as it talks about other arctic adventures."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"I would, sincerely, rather scrape linoleum tile off of a concrete slab than read any more Barry Lopez."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"is Lopez's denial (by neglect) of the work of Gontran De Poncins, the last competent observer of the Eskimo."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"I've read a lot of nature writing--from Thoreau, Muir, Dillard etc. Lopez is the keenest observer and the most lyrical writer. (not to slight Muir, incidentally, but 19th century lyricism is hard for some to get used to...).I've been a backcountry ranger for 28 years and, I like to think, have an appreciation for wilderness and observation of the natural world. Lopez is able to describe what I see."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Funny that a book about the Arctic would be on my &quot;Desert Island&quot; list, but this is one of the most effecting things I've read in my life. It's one thing to write a book about a region that explains it to the reader. It's quite another thing to write a book about a region that truly makes you feel as if you are there, that you understand it, that you &quot;get it&quot;. The Eskimos have something like 25 words for snow. They can draw incredibly detailed maps of coastlines, from memory. On and on, the people and places are introduced to you, like visitors to your home, and you really begin to understand what it is to live in such a cold, beautiful place. The story of one Eskimo hunter will never leave me: he was hunting, and somehow became stranded on a broken off piece of ice. It floated away, with him on it, into the mist. All he had was his knife, made of bone. His friends searched for him, to no avail, and he was given up for dead. But he came back, years later, in a kayak he'd made, fully outfitted with warm clothes he'd also made, fat and happy and completely in tune with his environment, absolutely as at home there as the polar bear. He could make everything he needed, just from what this supposedly &quot;barren&quot; wasteland provided. That may not sound like much, but put yourself in his shoes (or mukluks) and you'll begin to feel the cold and the quiet close in around you.That's what this book does for you. It puts you there."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"&quot;Arctic Dreams&quot; was recommended to me by a friend before I went on an Alaskan adventure a few years ago. This book expanded my vision of nature, and turned me on to the exquisite writing of Barry Lopez, who won the 1986 National Book Award for this classic work on the wild regions of the far north. &quot;Arctic Dreams&quot; is an extraordinary celebration of Arctic life and landscape which takes the reader on a journey to places rarely visited by man. Lopez' narrative does have a dreamlike quality, not only in its descriptions of nature at its most surreal, but in the absolute beauty of the writing itself. He does indeed capture the foreign reality of Arctic life, and death, with the loving care of an artist who places each brushstroke carefully on a canvas, bent on bringing the vision before him to others.Mr. Lopez made a number of extended trips to Siberia, Greenland, and northern Canada, including Baffin Island, to observe the flora and fauna of the region - polar bears, killer whales, caribou, narwhals - as well as the spectacular Arctic landscape. He experienced eerie encounters with the aurora borealis, massive migrating icebergs, solar and lunar light, halos and coronas. And he experienced both the potential for catastrophic danger and the remarkable beauty that the Arctic land and sea offers. &quot;Spring storms can sweep hundreds of thousands of helpless infant harp seals into the sea&quot; - juxtaposed with, &quot;A tiny flower blooms in a field of snow touched by the sun's benevolent light.&quot; Through Mr. Lopez' eyes the breathtaking experience of the Arctic landscape and the people who inhabit it become palpably real. I was particularly moved by his intimate and compassionate descriptions of the indigenous people of this region, who so aptly illustrate how mankind is capable of living in harmony with his surroundings. Lopez' prose and his conclusions make the strongest argument possible to work for the ecological health of our planet, for the sake of life itself, and for the health of our imagination and sense of wonder at the magnificent.As mankind grows closer to conquering the earth's last frontiers, the issue of exploitation and encroachment becomes greater. For anyone who advocates preserving the few remaining wild areas on our planet, &quot;Arctic Dreams&quot; is a welcome gift and a source of motivation. It also provides an extraordinary read, and, perhaps, an awakening to those who have shown little interest in earth's most mysterious places.This is a magical book that will enchant and awe the reader. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Bravo, Barry Lopez!JANA"},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Of all the books I've read on the artcic and antarctic, this stands out for its absolute precision of description. To see a landscape with Lopez' eyes, you would have to spend a lot of time looking, and absorbing what you saw, until you knew every inch of it with your eyes shut. So it's appropriate that when he describes things, the descriptions take time to write, they are precise, and thorough, and need to be read slowly. Any less would not convey the strangeness and unfamiliarity of the place. Lopez reminded me that many times, a day's aimless wandering about, just thinking about what you see, has as great a value as a day seeing the sights.My edition has no photos, which is appropriate as the verbal description is superb. If you read this book, keep the internet handy, to use search engines to find photos of the places he and things he writes about. It's like having a limitless dictionary to hand, and with subject matter as unfamiliar as this, it helps tremendously. One could say that the book was 25 years ahead of its time."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"This is not just a great book about the Artic, but a handbook for how to move through and observe wilderness and areas of unspoiled natural beauty. Lopez knows more about the interdependence of the human and natural worlds than any other writer I know."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"An account of the American Arctic based on the author's own travels and a survey of the biology, ecology and history of the region. There is a tree-hugging, save-the-endangered-species,motif. (Don't get me wrong -I love trees and whales and things). He is rather solemn and philosophical with a lot of fine writing about the wonders of nature lifting us above the mundane. Sometimes he falls into the traps of fine writing, such as impressive long lists of plants, birds and animals, and misuse of words such as \\"mesic\\" and \\"adumbrate\\". It is a mine of information which I suppose is mostly accurate although I hadn't heard before that Walsingham was a duke or that Vitus Bering was a Dutchman.I had mixed feelings aout his attiude towards the Eskimos. His account idealizes the nomadic hunting existence and it is sometimes unclear whether he is talking about present-day Inuit or drawing upon older accounts. He only once mentions alcohol as a problem and does not mention disputes with other native Americans, even when desribing Hearne's travels.The description is largely limited to America and the bibliography has no Russian sources. He often uses Inuit words but his review of Arctic prehistory draws only on archeological evidence and is weak on linguistics and says nothing about the Chukchi language and Asian-American language links. DNA and blood groups are not mentioned.I wouldn't make all those niggling criticisms about what got left out if the book did not set itself a high standard of comprehensiveness. It's virtually a one volume encyclopedia of the Arctic full of fascinating facts, vivid firsthand accounts, and splendid writing.By the way, one arctic question's been bugging me since I was ten years old (the teacher didn't know the answer then and Lopez doesn't have it). What time is it at the North Pole?"},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"It's been some years ago now that I read Arctic Dreams. I found Lopez's writing powerful and gripping; I had to read more of his work and soon did. His use of the desert as a metaphor for the arctic brought to mind not only human desire to experience and transform landscapes, but also the sense of mystery that we attach to the environment--mystery that compels us to make known the unknown, whether through myth or exploration, and mystery that drives us to wax nostalgic when those landscapes are already comprehended and inexorably altered. Before the U.S. Civil War, some maps showed the Great Plains as the &quot;Great American Desert.&quot; Within a decade, that land and its peoples had been transfigured in popular imaginations from a mythology of mystery to one of discovery and settlement. There is much to be gained from Lopez's deeply personal engagement with the Arctic and the ways his experience informs his elucidation of others' attempts, successful and not, to imagine, discover, conquer, and finally yield to this austere geography. In doing so, Lopez manages not to lose track of the sense of wonder and myth that nearly wells up from the landscape itself."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Arctic Dreams is an extraordinary book, immediately a classic work of its genre, environmental nonfiction. Chapters focus on muskoxen, polar bears, narwhal, the migration of birds and of caribou, the otherworldly temporal states and unusual lighting and light-bending phenomenon of the northern polar regions, the mental and perceptual states of the northland's human residents and visitors, and the history of European and American/Canadian exploration, and exploitation, of the arctic. Lopez examines the artic with a careful and attentive eye, recognizing its subtleties and mysteries and not demanding that they be reduced to something that the reader will feel he has brought fully within his or her understanding. The writing is appropriate to the subject in view; alert, unhurried, and deliberate.\\"One of our long-lived cultural differences with the Eskimo has been over whether to accept the land as it is or to exert the will to change it into something else. The great task of life for the traditional Eskimo is still to achieve congruence with a reality that is already given. The given reality, the real landscape, is 'horror within magnificence, absurdity within intelligibility, suffering within joy,' in the words of Albert Schweitzer. We do not esteem as highly these lessons in paradox. We hold in higher regard the land's tractability, its alterability. We believe the conditions of the earth can be changed to ensure human happiness, to provide jobs and to create material wealth and ease. Each culture, then, finds a different sort of apotheosis, of epiphany, and comfort in the land.\\" (from the epilogue)On page 406 of my 1986 edition, Lopez writes, \\"The European culture from which the ancestors of many of us came has yet to . . . understand the wisdom, preserved in North America, that lies in the richness and sanctity of a wild landscape, what it can mean in the unfolding of human life, the staying of a troubled human spirit.\\" If there is a 'short list' of great environmental nonfiction, this book is on it."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"I especially liked his account of polar bears, harp seals and whales and their intermingling relationships. His description of how he perceived his surroundings made me feel as if I was there! In fact, it made me book a 10-day trip to Alaska in order to escape the stresses of city-living for a while! I was somewhat surprised by the chapter on Eskimos and a thorough discussion of their origin since I had expected this book to be a travelogue at best. Of course, it is much more. The chapter on Ice and Light, for instance, is outstanding and has probably the best description I have read on the Northern Lights (or Aurora Borealis)!!!"},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Barry Lopez probably does not think of himself as a salesman but his book, &quot;Artic Dreams: Imagination &amp; Desire in a Northern Landscape&quot; sold me on the artic.

Did I smoke in the stands? Yes. Did I smoke in the car? Of course. No harm done. I was oblivious that a smoking ban could happen ever!Being in the funeral business, I have come to the conclusion that people go when it is their time and that perhaps there are no accidents. Some folks are old, some are young and many are in between. Or perhaps that's just my own justification for so much that does not always seem to make any sense at all.Your book was truly inspiring and my son who is now 26 is reading it - not because he is a smoker because he isn't. He just likes to know the truth.The part of your book that really concerned me most was the exposure of our youth to pedophiles and date rapes. And how many will choose not to go to college because campuses are smoke free? Things were so much safer before the ban.Thank you for finding me out there in cyberspace months ago posting on the Cleveland Morning Journal. I so appreciate the work that you are doing. Have you ever thought about going on Utube to speak the about the bans?Sincerely, Becky Rogers"},{"Title":"Dissecting Antismokers' Brains","review":"Have read all of your book and now reading the appendixes.It is a very useful tool with all that information collected and presented thus..well done!I found it quite a difficult book to put down..so you have a good writing style as well..I do not read books easily!!"},{"Title":"Dissecting Antismokers' Brains","review":"I have some personal and professional experience with anti-smoking groups, as the founder of the Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, creator of their American Spirit product, and as the author of several 'If you're gonna smoke it, grow your own!\\" books, and I can tell you that Michael is right on target with this fact-filled, eminently readable book. None of this movement is about anti-smoking - it is about political and economic power over the masses, pure and not-so-simple. And if anyone thinks that Michael's book is about supporting the so-called 'tobacco industry' they either haven't read it or they haven't a clue about who controls what in America and the rest of the world.In some ways this book is about far more than revealing the truth about the shrill, confused and self-righteous 'anti-smoking' movement - it is about almost all 'movements' that are created specifically to manipulate people into believing a carefully crafted set of lies in order to exercise mind control over these poor dupes. What Michael has done is to reveal not only the network and motivation behind this movement, and also to document in a clear, calm, almost ironic voice how breathtakingly stupid they actually are in spite of their 'victories', but he has also given us - if you will read between the lines - a vivid picture of how organized criminals go about the process of taking over people's brains in almost every facet of modern life.Read this to be informed; read this because it will change the way you see the world; and most of all read this book because it is so much fun using Michael's carefully documented facts and arguments to confuse and confound the anti-smokers you know. If you enjoy raising the blood pressure of those who have been turned into idiots by the anti-smoking mob, this is the only tool you'll need. Now if Michael would just write a book on organized religion - oh, wait - all you have to do is to substitute \\"organized religion\\" for \\"anti-smoking\\" throughout this book and that's pretty much what he has already done."},{"Title":"Dissecting Antismokers' Brains","review":"Using sound science, reason and humor, Michael J. McFadden discusses the modern anti-tobacco movement and its rationale in a convincing, passionate way. No matter how you feel about this issue, you should read this book. After doing so, you will realize that the whole story is not otherwise being told. Prominent figures in the anti-tobacco movement (such as Stanton Glantz and John Banzhaf) do NOT want you to read this book. Get it and find out why."},{"Title":"Dissecting Antismokers' Brains","review":"This book was a real find for me. At last - someone who challenges the junk science and the appeals to irrational fear that has characterized many campaigns against second-hand smoke! I had long felt that second-hand smoke in a typical restaurant or bar just COULDN'T be nearly as dangerous as those promoting current smoking bans claim. McFadden confirms that feeling and presents facts to back up his position. He writes with an even-handed, rational style that gives the reader confidence he has no ax to grind and no affiliation with Big Tobacco.McFadden covers a lot of ground in this very lively, readable book. He starts with a consideration of the personality types who have become invested in increasing smoking bans and who use falsified figures accordingly. The largest number of these people have merely uncritically accepted the assertions they've heard repeated in the media over the years about the horrendous dangers of even miniscule amounts of second-hand smoke. For their benefit and for the benefit of us all, McFadden goes back to many of the original studies and shows how the figures have been twisted and exaggerated, until they actually seem to prove exactly the opposite of what they really indicate.He goes on to analyze some of the faulty arguing techniques the anti-smokers use to make their case. He shows how they redefine terms, for example reclassifying college seniors as \\"children,\\" in order to make their case more appealing. He also shows how they assume correlation to indicate causation, and how they also either mistakenly or purposefully make the fallacious argument of post hoc, ergo propter hoc (if it happens after, it must happen because of). So they declare the strict smoking bans they put in place in California have resulted in steep decreases in cancer - shortly after the bans were instituted. In making this congratulatory announcement, they neglect the fact that cancer usually takes decades to develop.McFadden ends the book with a series of interesting appendices, including a list of resources that can be used to learn more about the subject and to link up with others wanting to set the record straight after years of anti-smoking lobby dis-information.There are a few things I might have put on my wish-list for this book. First of all, I wish McFadden had found another title. \\"Dissecting Antismokers' Brains\\" is obviously a dig at the host of over-the-top public service ads that anti-smokers have sponsored, in which various body organs of dead smokers are autopsied to show - yuk, how gross! However, this turn-about-is-fair-play title just ends up being obscure and clumsy. I'm afraid the awkwardness of the title might make it hard for a lot of potential readers to find this book.Then I wish McFadden had taken a few pages to explain to laymen some of the basics of interpreting statistics. Many of the books I've read by contrarian doctors who want to statistically illustrate the futility of routine medical testing - do a good job telling the reader how statistical \\"levels of confidence\\" are arrived at and what constitutes \\"significance\\" in a finding. McFadden unfortunately doesn't provide this review.Also, while McFadden does a good job calling anti-smokers' on the false linkages they make between second-hand smoke and cancer - he doesn't spend as much time addressing any links that anti-smokers might make between other conditions such as asthma attacks and barroom smoke. However he does cite an amazing study that found children of smokers have LESS asthma than children of non-smokers. So we can draw our own conclusions.Overall, McFadden's book is an important and moving appeal to all of us not to let our personal freedoms get eroded by one repressive ban after another."},{"Title":"Dissecting Antismokers' Brains","review":"I went into this book knowing only what I have seen on TV, heard on Radio and read in the news.

I'd recommend this book to anyone who's started to cock his head in skepticism as the claims about exposure to passing wisps of smoke become more and more improbable, and more akin to witchcraft testimony in Salem than to sound objective science.And, since stones have been cast by a previous poster...

This book would be a great tool for college courses in such subjects as sociology, political science, debate or logic.

In fact, I ordered 10 more to give out to those I know that may be interested.It was very timely for me as our city (Oshkosh, WI) has recently been pushed into a smoking ban due to a group of antismokers comprised of most of the nine personality types that you describe. Though I do not smoke, I find this threat upon our freedoms truly frightening. The website www.freedom-of-choice.com summarizes this book more extensively with quotes and a more indepth analysis.

Siepmann, MD, Editor-in-ChiefJournal of Theoretics"},{"Title":"Dissecting Antismokers' Brains","review":"This book has changed my life dramatically. I was deceived by all the misinformation surrounding SHS even though I realized that things just did not add up, I had no proof.Thanks to Dissecting Antismokers' Brains I now feel totally vindicated and the sense of guilt from this pleasure is pretty much erased. The book is straight forward, thoughtful and well orgnaized. It states all the facts which are easily verified and when you are finished you find yourself wanting more.When non-smokers read this book they, rightfully so, are outraged to discover that they have been used as pawns in a power stuggle by an elite group of people who are making millions from this. Factor in drug companies making millions from nicotine replacement products and most media outlets threatened with monetary loss if anything positive can be said about SHS and you have the biggest social lie of this generation.What is happening right now in the free world is nothing short of criminal, akin to organized crime at it's best. Antismoking groups have no real evidence against SHS, just half-truths and outright lies through manipulation. This is racketeering on a world wide scale and most are unaware of this. The newly approved smoking treaty which just came into effect now holds third world countries as hostages who must comply or else. This is extortion and a violation of basic human rights!We are all victims of these groups whose main goals are power and money but the biggest victims of all are our children. While money, time, media hype and other resources have been wasted on the BIG LIE the use of drugs and alcohol has sky rocketed in young people, STD rates continue to soar and poverty continues to rise. Antismoking groups are apathetic to these REAL problems while continuing to manufacture false data to reap in even more money. These are taxpayers dollars being wasted while freedom of choice is being stripped away.Finally, for those of you wondering, I am independant of any tobacco companies or other interest groups in this area. I have never met Michael nor have I even had a conversation with him. This book stands on it's own merits, more than I can say for anything published by the antismokers. Read it, you will be amazed and you will even get a few chuckles from his light humour injected throughout. When you are finished send it to someone with some real political clout, someone who will ask the hard questions and expose these criminals for who they really are."},{"Title":"Dissecting Antismokers' Brains","review":"He attacks the spin and propaganda used by those trying to eradicate smoking from the face of the earth and while doing so he takes pains to avoid falling into the trap of using the same methods himself: his style is simple and direct, no fancy pictures or mind-games, just facts supporting his arguments.Overall his book is incredibly readable for the amount of information it packs into its 370 pages: you'll almost feel at times like you're reading a page-turning novel rather than a serious work of non-fiction aimed at a modern social problem. In an email exchange I had with him while writing this review, Mr. McFadden declared his belief that, if he could get copies of the book into every college course dealing with the social debate over smoking, and a copy sitting on the bar of every tavern threatened with a smoking ban, the outrage felt by those readers would provide the impetus needed to fight what has become a very powerful lobby.After reading Dissecting Antismokers' Brains I think I would have to agree with the author on that point."},{"Title":"Dissecting Antismokers' Brains","review":"A year ago I gave one of our local commissioners, a huge smoke hater himself, a copy of Michael McFadden's book \\"Dissecting the Anti Smokers Brain.\\" Our local politicians, ignoring our predictions of what would happen, passed a local ban anyway.

With the anti-smoking movement in full swing and growing more radical with a push toward smoking bans in private dwellings, parks, and cars McFadden provides a badly needed critique of the evidence on ETS and the not-so-holy anti-smoking crusade. I would recommend McFadden's book to those Americans who are concerned about how \\"social engineering\\" movements can use shaky science to attack private property rights.

Highly recommended if you're curious about the whole smoking controversy and want to see a different perspective than most of what you get out there.

Mia graduated college in 1994 and married her college boyfriend, Christian Corey. After that, Mia and her team went to Sweden to defend their world cup title. IN 1998, she was named America's best female athlete.My book, On the Field With Mia Hamm, gave me lots of information about Mia. The cover page is green with a colored picture of her running down the field with the ball. This book is organized into chapters and that made it a lot easier to sort the information about Mia.

Unlike Pepys, Evelyn was a strait-laced fellow, so we get no juicy stories of his amours. He hardly speaks of his wife and consequently never mentions any arguments they might have had. He tells few personal anecdotes. He also has little to say about the great plague year or the great fire of London.

I've been gardening for about twenty years and have read and done much in landscape and garden design. If your looking for a book about concepts, not specific plants this is the best one I've come across. It will NOT make you into a garden designer if you don't already have a working knowledge of basic design concepts. [To further clarify it does not go into long discussions on UNIVERSAL principles of garden design, it does however give great design perspective insight into each specific plan and feature.] What it will do is stimulate your design ideas based on your potential applications of a given design theme.The book has many colorful three dimensional renderings and two dimensional plans. They are categorized into complete gardens and garden features.The complete gardens are based on theme's such as cottage, kitchen, family, plant enthusiast, disabled, water, Japanese, etc. Each plan has renderings and a plan, a short &quot;design philosophy&quot; discussion, a plant selection thought process, unique features identified, and design variations. The design variations are great for stimulating ideas on ways to adapt a given style of garden to different lot constraints (ie. long and narrow, corner, or triangle lot). The garden features section walks you through the styles, materials, and techniques for things such as water features, rock gardens, pergolas, walls, steps, herb gardens, etc. There are great color photo examples, different design sketches, and a discussion of design considerations.The book also includes a plant directory of the most common plants in the included plans. Some will be familiar and some won't since this book was written in the U.K. But the plants list is not the main attraction here.I highly recommend this book to everyone who is enthusiastic about designing their gardens as a whole and not just a mish-mash of disparate plants. A must for every serious garden library."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Garden Designer","review":"Having looked at many, many landscaping books, I can honestly say this one is among the best. The pictures are beautiful yet practical and feasible. Lots of practical suggestions help modify for your own yard."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Garden Designer","review":"This is an impressive publication- a beautifully illustrated manual for the garden designer. The vast amount of talent stored between the covers of this book is what one would expect landscape architects to have developed before they receive their diplomas. The very ambitious home owner who is comfortable working with a back hoe and some help will also enjoy following this guideThe author is a respected and renowned garden designer. The essence of the advice he conveys to the student reader is that a garden is akin to a small park. What will make such a setting enjoyable is the path laid out by the designer to discover its contents. To create that experience, Mr. Newbury relies on the wandering, curving line that cleverly converts any small plot of land into an enchanting garden. This concept is repeated throughout the book, for practically every style of garden imaginable. The reader comes away understanding that a garden is about movement and travel both for the eye and the body. It is also about the importance of discovery and the need for camouflage.For those landscapes that require a shed, a greenhouse, or a compost heap, the plans supplied by the author demonstrate how all of these features are tucked away ingeniously in locations that do not detract from the overall beauty of the property. One may create a garden using any of the one hundred ideas in this book and never notice these elements, no matter how small the garden.The focus of the book is a collection of 15 basic styles of gardens that include a cottage garden, water garden and roof garden. Once the reader has selected a desired style, there are choices within that style. For example, if one would like to install a cottage garden, one may select a layout for a traditional treatment, a contemporary style or a version for a small urban back yard. Each of these choices comes with complete plans for their realization. These plans includeAn over all view of the garden as seen from a deck.An aerial blue print containing symbols and shapes to identify individual features to be installed in the garden.A planting guide for the major plants to be used.A plant list that is numerically cross-referenced to the planting guide.A three dimensional view of the completed garden.Four variations of the aerial blueprint that accommodate differences in the sizes and shapes of individual properties.This meticulous attention to detail is repeated 36 times before this section is complete. So thorough is the presentation that it also includes plans of gardens for the disabled.Like most prominent garden designers, the author relies heavily on trees, ornamental shrubs, paths and borders to flesh out the structure of the gardens. The use of perennials is limited. For those clients who prefer more flowers, the plans leave room for modifications after establishing the overall structure and design.The secondary section of the book deals with the placement of hardscapes and garden features such as pools, patio, pergolas and pots. While some technical information is supplied, this section presupposes that the reader is familiar with most of the technology and engineering necessary for their installation. This section, therefore, is not a how-to-install-it manual. Instead, it is a guide on how to install it beautifully.The final portion of the book contains an abbreviated list of recommended plants. The list is understandably short because designers tend to edit their options in order to remain efficient. Those plants that deliver the best results are included.Clearly, the author has used similar plants successfully in his projects because they work best with the garden designs he provides. The seasoned designer may chose to modify this list. For the neophyte, it is a reliable place to start.Creating a new garden or overhauling an old one may be overwhelming for the uninitiated and even formidable for an experienced designer. However, with this beautifully illustrated color manual, as a guide, those challenges become easier.Allan Becker reviews books on garden topics for [...] and for his garden blog, allanbecker-[...]"},{"Title":"Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia Deluxe 2005, Labcoat Pocket Edition","review":"This has been a handy reference guide for my son.

Mechanical plots, dull characters, uninteresting and implausible mystery solutions. In one of them, I intuited the murdered from the beginning because s/he was given too much &quot;air time&quot; when s/he was introduced - a common giveaway for untalented mystery writers. I feared that Maron had run out of ideas and was just churning out books for the money.Happily, &quot;Slow Dollar&quot; more than restores my faith. As is typical with Maron, the point is less the mystery than the characters. As others have indicated, the new characters in &quot;Slow Dollar&quot; are delightfully drawn and wonderfully real. They add more depth to the incredibly complex relationships within Deborah's family.And I absolutely, positively LOVED the new relationship with Dwight. Yes, I consider myself to be on a first-name basis with these people; they are that real to me.Thank you, Margaret Maron, from this grateful reader. You're back on track."},{"Title":"Slow Dollar (SIGNED)","review":"Deborah Knott, youngest of twelve children and only daughter of ex-bootlegger Kezzie Knott, is a circuit judge in rural North Carolina. On the bench, she's compassionate but firm; off the bench, she manages to avoid both marriage and speeding tickets -- barely.A carnival comes to Deborah's own Colleton, County, North Carolina. Deborah and assorted cousins are enjoying the rides when the carnival owner's elder son is found murdered.Deborah's personal and professional lives are intertwined as she helps her old friend, Sheriff Dwight Bryant, investigate the crime. The mystery is not a whodunit and many readers won't care when the villain is revealed. The strength of the book comes from strong writing, three-dimensional characters and the North Carolina rural setting.As usual, Deborah's young cousins teeter on the edge of the law while her assorted brothers and sisters-in-law carry on family traditions of southern hospitality. And as Deborah faces re-election, she regrets her checkered history of relationships and considers a surprising proposition from someone close to her.Slow Dollar evokes an unsentimental but loving picture of the Old South. Like the author, Deborah grew up in North Carolina, lived &quot;up north&quot; and returned home. She respects the heritage of the south while defying its traditions in her own life.And the series is as warm and delicious as a southern baked biscuit with melted butter -- after you've consumed one, you're eager for the next. The Knott family might try Deborah's patience but they manage to be warm and supportive without degenerating into sentimental syrup. If you're new to the series, read a few of the earlier volumes first -- you'll enjoy this one even more."},{"Title":"Slow Dollar (SIGNED)","review":"When the carnival comes to Dobbs, Deborah has already met the owner. Two drunken fools damaged one of her rides and Deborah was the judge to hear the case. More trouble occurs in Dobbs. The eldest son of the owner is found dead, by Deborah, at the Dozer with a mouth full of quarters. While investigating the case, she finds that Tallahassee Ames, the part owner of the carnival is really, her niece, Olivia. She hasn't seen Olivia since she was a small child, but promised her late mother to always treat her as family. Too bad Olivia's father doesn't feel the same way, since it was his grandson that was murdered. Deborah is also changing her relationship with Dwight Bryant.This is one of the best novels of the series. Ms. Maron is always at her best when she involves Deborah's huge family and its different characters in the story. A new family member is always welcome and Tally and her family add color to an already colorful brood. Deborah's new relationship with Dwight makes me wonder why nothing ever happened before. I can't wait to find out what happens in the next book."},{"Title":"Slow Dollar (SIGNED)","review":"Judge Deborah Knott, her incredible family and their southern-fried lives are a big part of what makes this series so satisfying to me. I love the way she values her friends and families and her home, warts and all. This book was a great addition to Deborah's story and the story of her beloved Colleton County. I was glad to see the developments in her personal life -- after all the ups and downs of this area of Deborah's life, I wished this book had devoted a little more time to this part of the storyline. Nevertheless, this was a satisfying book in its plot line and its rich cast of characters."},{"Title":"Slow Dollar (SIGNED)","review":"This is one of the few mystery series going today that, even with this, the 9th entry, just keeps getting better. There has been only one book (Killer Market) in this series that I found to be even a bit lacking and that is quite unusual in a series that has gone on this long. In this episode, Judge Deborah Knott goes to the local carnival with her friends and discovers a dead body. As she works to solve the murder with her friend Dwight, we are exposed to more of her large family, but it really never gets confusing. Maron manages to make it clear who belongs to whom, even with the added relatives that this tale brings into the picture. The mystery is interesting and hard to solve and, just as importantly, there is progress in Deborah's personal life that is very satisfying to read. I know that Maron's next book is a stand-alone (neither a Knott nor a Harald book...will she ever write more Sigrid Harald books?) but I will definitely buy it. I just hope she returns to North Carolina soon."},{"Title":"Slow Dollar (SIGNED)","review":"Judge Deborah Knott's complicated and extensive family structure gets even more complex in this, her 9th outing for Maron's compelling tales in North Carolina. Suddenly, new and formerly unknown family members are popping out of the woodwork when the carnival comes to Dobbs, and with the new kin comes one bloody death and fear of more.Maron has put together an entertaining tale, full of character, that sends Judge Knott back to remember her childhood, and introduces Tally Ames, a complex woman proud to be \\"a carnie\\".There's a relationship surprise in the book, as Maron introduces a romance of sorts between Deb'rah and long-time friend Dwight Bryant, one that Maron fans have been expecting and hoping for for a long time. So, while weaving a delicious mystery, the author once again succeeds in giving us a sweet tale, full of the comfort of the south, and kin, and small town loves and friendships."},{"Title":"Slow Dollar (SIGNED)","review":"Judge Deborah Knott suspects something odd about the carnival that has come to her small North Carolina town, but she doesn't expect murder. When someone kills a young man associated with the carnival and stuffs his mouth full of quarters, the town shrugs--they weren't local. But Deborah learns of a local connection--and suspects that the death involves more than a simple fight among carnies.Author Margaret Maron writes convincingly of the carnival life and even more convincingly about small-town North Carolina where family is key, where farming is still a way of life, and where single women and single men continue the eternal dance of attraction and fear. Deborah Knott is an engaging and compelling character.

In this latest installment, Judge Knott presides at a case where four young men have vandalized a game owned by Tallahassee Ames, who is part owner of a carnival which is playing in town. Very shortly thereafter,Tallahassee's son is killed while Deborah is at the carnival. As she does some investigating, Deborah discovers that she is related to Tally and to her son, Braz. She pursues the investigation while trying to develop a relationship with Tally, a sometimes tricky balancing act. Deborah's large extended family, consisting of 11 older brothers and their families, provides background and several interesting characters for this book. Braz and his step-father had bought up the contents of several storage areas which had been auctioned off, so there were several angry people trying to get their property back who had a motive for killing Braz. The book contains a lot of information about living in and running a carnival, and even contains a glossary of carnival terms. It is nicely paced and even contains a little romance, which should combine to be very pleasing to both old and new Maron fans."},{"Title":"Slow Dollar (SIGNED)","review":"Cozy mysteries are really of two types: Novels in the traditional cozy style whose main emphasis is a mystery and its resolution (e.g., Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers) and novels in the more modern cozy format, whose main emphasis is on social interactions (primarily between family, friends, and coworkers) with the mystery being a smaller component of the exposition. This is definitely a cozy in the latter form. Remove the additional social interactions, and this mystery could be presented in a novella or even a short story, although not as interestingly.If you find modern cozies appealing, you will certainly find this an interesting book. Here, self-assured Judge Deborah Knott finds a dead worker while visiting the annual Harvest Festival Carnival. The reason for this death and the identity of the killer is the primary mystery. The preface provides a family tree of the Knott family, which is absolutely needed, as the Knotts are a large family, many of whom are presented in this novel. Readers will find themselves frequently referencing this chart to keep track of Knott family members. Fortunately, the number of carnival workers and additional characters is relatively small, but it may still pay to keep some brief notes of who they are as you read. There is also an informative addendum with a glossary of carnival terms, e.g., \\"cutting up jackpots\\", \\"plush\\", \\"rake \`em and scrape \`em\\" that are used in the novel.I felt the story started somewhat slowly, but it quickly caught my interest, and as events unfolded it became harder to put down. Although the story is told in the first person, in terms that will probably appeal mostly to female readers, e.g., there are probably more descriptions of Judge Knott's clothing choices than would interest male readers, this novel should none-the-less appeal to both sexes.The novel reads quickly and easily, and provides a very enjoyable way to relax."},{"Title":"Slow Dollar (SIGNED)","review":"#9 of the Deborah Knott series- The \\"carny\\" comes to town and with it a murder.

I couldn't put down Margaret Maron's mystery novel, Slow Dollar. I loved the way she introduced me to the Carnival Slang with her glossary in the back of the book. Slow Dollar is an intriguing plot with a murder taken place in a Traveling Carnival. Her protagonist Judge Deborah Knott a quick witted North Carolina Judge, who visits a ragtag carnival and discovers a murder most foul. Judge Deborah attends opening night at the annual Harvest Festival as a Judge in a yam contest. The night before the contest she strolls through the midway and encounters her past with the sights and smells of the Carnival. Half the Colleton County has come out to ride the Tilt-O-Whirl and Ferris wheel, throw quarters at a plate pitch. A Cacophony of music, clacking machines, and hucksters greether. The air is sweetly redolent of hot grease, fried dough, grilled meats and spun sugar...one whiff is all it takes to send Judge Deborah Knott straight back to her childhood, holding her mother's hand, riding on the shoulders of one of her eleven brothers, or clinging to her daddy's pants leg, bedazzled by the bright and colorful chasing lights.With a murder on the midway Deborah discovers more than a body. Deborah's discovery of her family connection to the murder victim has unleashed dark secrets of her large family, that without meaning to Deborah brings to light in her quest to solve this murder as family loyalties war with judicial responsibilities. I love her new love interest in Dwight. I actually know a North Carolina couple who started their engagement in exactly the same way as Deborah and Dwight have done. Maybe North Carolina knows something the rest of us could emulate. A marriage not of hot passion but of long term respect and enduring love that goes from a small spark to a roaring inferno of emotion and love.

This background, plus the theological training which enabled her to be on the staff of The Church of The Savior in Washington, D.C. in 1971 when this timeless book was written, give the richness of an open mind and an open heart to her valuable insights into the human struggle to become whole. Her dedication of the book to her twin Dick, \`whose divided self keeps me close to suffering' brings a personal urgency to her study. The premise that we all consist of many selves is illustrated by her own life as well as numerous references to authors, poets, psychiatrists, religious and politicians. Intended to be a working book, one is given exercises and time frames and encouraged to share with a partner or a group to be optimally effective. I return to the exercises, and the book again and again, as my many selves evolve and merge. O'Connor quoting Thomas Kelly, \`There is a divine Abyss within us all, a holy Infinite Center, a Heart, a Life who speaks in us and through us to the world...we have not counted this Holy Thing within us to be the most precious thing in the world. We have not surrendered all else, to attend to it alone...'Viktor E. Frankel, quoted from his book, The Doctor and the Soul. \`I asked both my fellow prisoners whether the question was really what we expected from life. Was it not, rather, what life was expecting from us?' I believe that if we love the Lord our God (divine Abyss, holy Infinite Center, unnamable Name) with all our heart, soul, and strength (single-minded surrender), we'll discover what life expects from us and we'll be enabled to love our neighbor as ourselves. No small thing, as Elizabeth O'Connor has so aptly demonstrated in this fine study of human nature."},{"Title":"Our many selves","review":"I have just finished reading this book \\"again.\\" I found it while unpacking some boxes that I had stored. On the front page, in my father's handwriting, are the words, \\"To my son, from Dad, November 7, 1974\\" - that was 35 years ago and he is deceased now, but I thank him for giving me this precious jewel so long ago. At age 20 I read it without much comprehension, but this time was different. Although it is a workbook designed to be used in a small group or with a partner I found it quite impressive standing on its own. O'Connor covers a lot of ground but her writing, and those she frequently quotes, on the subjects of the fractured self, the different ways we avoid recognition of our many selves, the suffering we endure as a result and the practice of \\"self-observation\\" are just as relevant in 2009 as they were in 1974. The first part of the book explores the meaning of the fractured self, and I love how she uses quotes and essays from the widely known and the obscure to lay the issue at our feet. The readings were at times so powerful, and sometimes so difficult, that I found myself reading them over and over again. Next, she addresses how and why we suppress those disparate parts of ourselves we find unacceptable. As I worked through these chapters and exercises honestly, and in humility to the extent I am capable, I began to have a new understanding of my \\"self,\\" and that these unaccepted parts are not gone merely because I have suppressed them. They appear on the faces of other people as I \\"project\\" those unwanted feelings and desires on those around me, and that sometimes what I project (disown) onto others comes true. The last part of the book focuses on human suffering and the various mental gymnastics we engage in to avoid acceptance of our suffering and what causes it. She then turns to the practice of self-observation as a way to move from destructive suffering to a more creative suffering. Now I see clearly how the role of \\"the observing self\\" and the practice of self-observation are essential to uncover the mental messages we have all recorded to some degree over our lifetime. Those messages, when re-played unconsiously, cause everything from depression and anxiety to post traumatic stress disorder and possibly other mental illnesses. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to those who want a Christ centered approach to the exploration of their soul that will enable them to dig beneath the debris of the fractured self caused by unaccepted pain and loss and show the way to healing and wholeness.

This book was meant to provide background information on social movements, how they come about, the importance and direction of new movements.Boggs is very informative and knows his stuff. Unfortunately, the chapters are so dense, repetitive, and aimed at someone who is beyond an undergraduate level that it was more of a pain than anything else to read the book. I feel like he could have said everything he needed to say in a way that was far easier to understand and comprehend. I had to give a presentation on a chapter in my class, and it was downright confusing to even attempt to summarize what he said. the main concepts were fine, but he jumps around the chapter in explaining stuff, reiterates what he's already said, and then explains something in a way that is far more complicated than it needs to be. Some of his sentences make me wonder if he sat next to a thesaurus and just found the most complicated word he could for something so that the sentence would sound more \\"sophisticated\\"So, reading the book does give you a new view on social movements and it helps you understand them a lot. However, it's quite a boring read and I feel Boggs should attempt to aim at educating his audience rather than talking over their head.

I had heard of ibn Fadlan mostly through my studies of Turkish as though ibn Fadlan is best known for giving one of the earliest accounts of the Viking people he is also known for giving account of the Bulgar's and other Turkic peoples of the Volga. So when I heard that his historical journey had been put into novel form I was to say the least a little bit distrustful.Well I shouldn't have been! The author has done a wonderful job of taking a historical figure and weaving a unique story around him. Our ibn Fadlan in this book is sent to the Volga as an emissary of the Caliph after having an affair with a married woman. Sent in disgrace on a mission it was assumed he would be unlikely to return from he meets up with Viking traders who on the death of their king receive a messenger who requests they return to fend off an ancient enemy who is again terrorising the lands. After consulting with a \\"wise woman\\" It is decided that 13 should return, one of these however should be a foreigner and unfortunately for ibn Fadlan he is conveniently picked as that said forigner. So begins his journey north to fight along side men whose language he barely knew, whose customs he found foul to say the least and whose religion he could only barely comprehend. This book is a real page turner. Made into a film (The 13th Warrior) There are a few minor differences in the book (For example the mention of \\"Sea monsters\\" (Whales) In the book) In the book they consult with Dwarves rather than the \\"Angel of Death\\" and ibn Fadlan throughout the book could only make out parts of the Viking language and still needed a translator (In the film he managed to pick the language up) Also I felt in the book he didnt come across as much of an incompetent as he did in the film.All in all this is a really enjoyable read. I would say it is in no way intended to be taken seriously (Some people have assumed that this is in fact ibn Fadlans book) But rather as a wonderful exciting novel. The author has done a great job even supplying so called \\"Historical notes\\" To the book to give it a little extra authenticity. It all just adds to it.I found it a great read and recommend it."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Eaters of the Dead is a dark and exciting tale which is filled with interesting culture and intense combat. The basic plot is about an Arab who is required to join a group of Vikings on a mission to save their lands from a mysterious tribe of ruthless cannibals known as the \\"Wendol\\". It's written in the first-person, and it's actually only semi-fictional, it's based on the manuscript of an actual Arab historical figure, Ibn Fadlan. The fact that it's written in first-person makes it much more interesting, because we are treated with Fadlan's intrepretations of the Norse ways. The book is very deep when it comes to Viking lore, I was astonished with the ways of the Vikings, their views on life, death, and their profound sense of courage and purpose. All the while, the reader also learns quite a bit about Arabic culture because Fadlan compares Viking philosophies with his own both in his conversations with the Vikings and in his thoughts. The book has an atmosphere that the reader can really \\"feel\\", even the outlandish descriptions in portions of the book still seem to come off as believable. Moreover, Fadlan really develops as a character, we witness the profound influence the Norse culture has on him, he becomes more courageous and overcomes some of his biggest fears in this book, his journey turns him into a hero! The mystery of the Wendol still has me wondering, based on Fadlan's descriptions, and a little research I did after the book, I personally believe they were an isolated tribe of Neanderthals (that survived extinction), but you can read Eaters of the Dead and decide for yourself!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Eaters of the Dead is a retelling of the classic Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf. Michael Crichton succeeds in presenting this story in a new and interesting way. Told from the perspective of an Arab who ends up joining Beowulf's party to hunt the terrifying monster who has been ravaging the Norse, this tale offers a captivating perspective. It certainly would help to be at least moderately familiar with the classic Beowulf before reading this; at the least, it will help you to better appreciate it. This story is evidently based on an actual account by the Arab ibn Fadlan; it is difficult to determine where the factual ends and the fictional begins. This is high on my list of \\"favorite books to curl up with on chilly winter nights.\\""},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Fascinating. According to the author's \\"factual note\\" at the end, the first three chapters of this book are indeed the manuscript of Ibn Fadlan, relating his experiences with the Northmen in A.D. 922. The tale that's spun from this beginning is fiction, but Crichton manages to mimic Fadlan's style so well that I found the transition seamless.Who might the \\"wendol\\" of Northern legend have been, in truth? Crichton bases his story on one theoretical answer to that question. This richly detailed little book (compared to the lengths of his later works) took me along on Ibn Fadlan's adventure, and made me believe it real for as long as I stayed immersed. That's the best compliment I can give to any author."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"After reading the book, I am not sure I want to see the movie. It was so vivid it almost made me vomit. I learned that the Klingons of Star Trek are sissies comparied to Vikings. But the book convinced me that the account was true, so I feel it is a &quot;must read&quot;."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Even after hearing Michael Crichton's commentary on the abridged audio version of this book, I was left wondering just how much is true and how much is embellishment. Apparently, the narrator, Ibn Fadlan, was real enough and did travel to the Northlands around the time period when this novel is set, but Crichton wrote the novel on a bet that he could make an entertaining story out of Beowulf. Personally, I thought Beowulf to be pretty entertaining on its own (even in 11th grade, when I read it), but this adaptation is also a good read. The movie later made from the novel, &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; with Antonio Banderas as Ibn Fadlan is remarkably true to the story, then again, maybe not so remarkably when you note that Michael Crichton was a producer. At any rate, a good novel that can be enjoyed by almost anyone!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"He took a real person, an Arab courtier, and the courtier's text to make a better version of the epic poem Beowulf. Slowly Crichton exposes us to 10th Century Vikings and their ways via the poor Arab courtier who ends up going to fight the monsters in the mist. To add even more mystery and spice, Crichton gives use clear clues on WHO the monsters are. A mixture of history, myth, and plain GOOD writing.Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"The 13th Warrior, by Michael Crichton, is actually a reprint of the author's 1976 book, Eaters of the Dead, which probably enjoyed a revival with the advent of the 1999 movie. Although the book doesn't have the narrative strength that some of his later works do, it still bears the hallmark of the exceptional and extensive research that mark all of his work. (The gentleman was educated at Harvard University, graduating summa cum laude...and Phi Beta Kappa in 1964 and graduating from that institution's medical school in 1969). This edition of the work includes a postscript on the factual information behind the story which I found fascinating. I had seen the movie and enjoyed it, which is why I decided to read the book. The postscript told me something that I had not realized in watching the film, but which made sense upon reflection, namely that the tale is an \\"eyewitness\\" account of the myth of Beowulf. In short, the narration attempts to strip the embroidery of the ages from what might possibly have been an historical event. Early Islamic travelers like Ibn Fadlan, Ibn Jubayr, and Ibn Battuta did in fact leave transcripts of their experiences in the far flung reaches of the world, much like the stories of the later Italian adventurer Marco Polo. The style of Crichton's book carries much of the flavor of these manuscripts, making it very plausible. Furthermore, archaeological work has recently brought to light the extensive trade connections of the Norsemen or Vikings and illustrated the degree to which Europe had begun to turn to the north for trade and cultural leadership after the fall of the Roman Empire. It would be interesting to see what Mr. Crichton could do with the Icelandic sagas or the myth of the Trojan War. A very entertaining book, but probably more so for those of us who enjoy a little education with our fiction."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I surprisingly found this book fascinating. I don't ususally get into the viking type genre - if there is one, but I really enjoyed this book and have reccommended it often. It was just an all around fascinating read, especially since I had previously read the excerts that Chrichton worked from by the real Arab traveler. I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I'm not a Michael Crichton fan, however I did find this book to be very interesting in its exploration of the world that existed a thousand years ago. The unique methodology used by Crichton involves combining elements of actual accounts written, presumably, by Ibn Fadlan (an Arabic-speaking courtier, who travelled far and wide and lived to write about his interesting travels) and creating a continuation that is fictional and speculative, but still very entertaining. One must be careful not to take such works as actual snapshots of history however. What is useful to note is that Ibn Fadlan attempts to be a very objective observer, who lapses into cultural display of disgust when confronted by some of the habits of the Norsemen, but he represents what many a modern man's reaction. At the time, the Arabs had forged a vast empire stretching from southern Europe to the borders of India and China, and they had created a civilization that fused together elements of Greco-Roman hellenism, Persian influences, and various regional contributions to create a universal state that was as inclusive as the Roman Empire (at the end) and Alexander the Great's vision of a single human nation. The result of such enlightenment was a renaissance that helped shape the more long-lasting European Renaissance as the Arabs preserved Greek learning and imported Indian mathematics and developed theories of their own about astronomy, physics, mathematics, and sociology. Ibn Fadlan's account gives us a glimpse of the little known civilization of the Norsemen of ancient Scandanavia, who raided as far south as the Caspian and Black Seas and were noted for their ferocity in warfare and their seemingly &quot;uncouthe&quot; mannerisms. Michael Crichton deserves credit for venturing into somewhat uncharted territory and making it work."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Contrary to what has been said by many of the reviewers here, this book is in fact based on a real manuscript by the Arab traveller ibn Fadlan in the tenth century who made his way from the Caliphate to the shores of the Volga to treat with the Bulgar kingdom which was then ensconced there (apparently to entice the Bulgars away from their Khazar overlords who were then enemies of the Arab empire). This ambassador of the Caliph faithfully recorded much of what he saw among the barbarians, including encounters with the Oghuz Turks and the Norsemen who were then frequent travellers along the rivers of what would one day become Russia. (In fact some thinking has it that the Norse, in the guise of \\"Rus\\" -- eytemology unclear -- actually gave their name, along with their ruling princes, to Russia since the first major Russian state, Kievan Rus, was ruled by princes of viking heritage, with the help of second and third generation viking adventurers serving them as mercenaries.) But Crichton's book is not just a reprint of ibn Fadlan's manuscript (which is available, in English, in various scholarly tomes). Crichton enlarged upon the tale he found and appended an apparently fictional second half which takes ibn Fadlan north, in the company of his new-found Norse comrades, to the viking lands, there to face a shadowy menace of unknown origins. In this second half, Crichton blended historical speculation with the Beowulf tale in Old English (the chief of the viking crew which inducts ibn Fadlan is called \\"Buliwyf\\") to suggest an ending to ibn Fadlan's adventures which surely never happened. But it's done quite nicely, hard to tell where the real tale ends and the author's fictional enterprise begins, and it keeps you reading right to the final moments. It's not a particularly stirring tale, rather dry in fact, but it's thought provoking and well-paced and a wonderfully interesting way to do an historical novel. The movie (THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR) unfortunately struck me as a mite simplistic but it did a very nice job of putting viking flesh on the narrative's bones so I wasn't sorry I went to see it.By the way, there are a whole slew of good books out there for those into vikings and historical adventure, including a brand new one by Jeff Janoda called SAGA: A NOVEL OF MEDIEVAL ICELAND which details the events surrounding an intriguing episode in Eyrbyggja Saga (one of the most renowned of the original Norse sagas). It tells the story of a great feud between two chieftains over a little piece of forested land in an Iceland in which wood had become as precious as gold. THE GOLDEN WARRIOR by Hope Muntz (about Harold and William and the struggle for the English throne in the mid-eleventh century) is another. Others worthy of your time include ERIC BRIGHTEYES by H. Rider Haggard, STYRBIORN THE STRONG by E. R. Eddison, and THE LONG SHIPS by Frans Bengtsson. And, if you're still game for more, there's even one I did, THE KING OF VINLAND'S SAGA, a tale of Norsemen in North America circa AD 1050.SWMauthor ofThe King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Usually I read the book first, then see the movie. Not this time. I was not disappointed.&quot;The 13th Warrior,&quot; movie starring Antonio Bandaras stays very faithful to the book by Michael Crichton. Both are based on a true story taken from the writings of an Arab courtier Ahmad Ibn Fadlan who, back in A.D. 921, was sent by the Caliph of Bagdad to be an ambassador to the King of the Bulgars.Ibn Fadlan had the bad luck to have caught the eye of a beautiful Arab woman who was the young wife of an old and very rich merchant. The merchant complained to the Caliph and wanted Ibn Fadlan banished to some far off and hostile land. While on his way to his new post, this highly refined, educated Arab poet encounters a band of Viking warriors and gets caught up in a horrific quest traveling to Scandinavia with them to save the people of a remote kingdom from a terrifying enemy. The movie and the book give a wonderful look at the contrasts of these two utterly different cultures. Bandaras delivers a stellar performance as the Arab scholar trying to maintain his dignity under some extraordinarily difficult circumstances. Ibn Fadlan finds the Vikings' crude, vulgar, violent and sometimes blatantly sexual customs and personal habits almost more than he can endure, but he does so with a quiet and sometimes comical dignity that makes him all the more likeable. He comes to respect and even like these giant Northmen, especially their brave leader Buliwyf. Once Ibn Fadlan and the Northmen begin their journey together, the action is almost nonstop.The book is done in Ibn Fadlan's voice in narrative style. It is a rather matter-of-fact diary of his travels. But don't let that deter you. It is a fascinating read and one of the earliest and most accurate eye-witness accounts of ancient Viking life. The greatest shock comes at the end of the book when we finally get a detailed description of &quot;the Eaters of the Dead.&quot; I hope Crichton is planning a sequal about this remarkable and resourceful Arab poet, Ahmad Ibn Fadlan."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Eaters of the dead takes place around 922 A.D. The Caliph of Baghdad sends a court member named Ahmad Ibn Fadlan to deliver a message to the King of Bulgars. During his journey, Fadlan stays at a Viking village. Then a lone warrior comes from the North and tells of a terror that kills the Vikings in the night under the cover of night and the mist. Fadlan is then enlisted to fight this horror, against his will. He protests, but to no avail. He journeys to the North with 12 other warriors to Rothgar's Kingdom and helps to defend it form the attacks by the barbaric mist warriors. Then, the group goes on the offensive to slay the mother.Ibn Fadlan makes this book more interesting and fun to read because he is the total opposite of the Vikings, with whom he stays. He is apalled by their barbaric customs because he is a civilized Arab and the Norsemen are uncivilized. Throughout the story these contrasts are evident. This book proceeds without talking about one subject for too long. I never got bored and there is never a break in the action. The suspense also never stops. I would definitely recommend this book because it gives a great look into the Viking culture while being very entertaing. You won't be able to put it down. Crichton's writing is very fast paced, so this is a great read on a good subject."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"First released in 1976, 'Eaters Of The Dead' was one of my first Michael Crichton books. I have been an avid Crichton fan since that time. Later, in the 1990's, a film was made called 'The 13th Warrior', which remained true to the book and yet added some wonderful flavor and fantastic visuals to a novel I still remembered as terrific. Though based heavily on the rediscovered manuscripts and references of the real Ibn Fadlan, Crichton clearly tells us the book is considered as fiction and was/is marketed as fiction.Ibn Fadlan was sent away from Bagdad by the Caliph, on the word of a jealous husband who's wife Fadlan had tampered with, to become Ambassador to the King of the Bulgars far to the north. On his journey, he is waylaid by a band of Norsemen and selected to join them on a journey to aid King Rothgar against an unspeakable evil that appears in the cold northern mists.Traveling with Buliwyf, a man soon to become king of his own court, and a group of twelve hearty Norsemen including the light-hearted Herger who speaks enough Latin to act as translator, Fadlan is taken further north with a band of men the fastidious Arab considers to be unclean barbarians. Fadlan becomes immersed in their savage lifestyles, killing for sport and rutting in public, even gaining some respect for their superstitious ways and bawdy, rugged beliefs.King Rothgar's lands are being attacked by the Wendol, a Neanderthal-type, cave-dwelling clan who takes the heads of their enemies and eats their flesh. It is up to the thirteen warriors to rid King Rothgar of his dangerous enemies.'Eaters Of The Dead' is a riveting tale, with enough footnotes and factual base to make it a realistic peek at the ancient Norsemen and a quick, exciting read. When the book was re-released, Crichton added (in 1992) some interesting, factual notes on the Wendol, possible origins of the people described by Ibn Fadlan back in 921 AD.Buy the book. Buy the movie. 'Eaters Of The Dead' (AKA The 13th Warrior) is the best Viking tale you can find anywhere, in my humble opinion. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Yes people, as I am sure those who read it know allready that this is Michael's retelling of a centuries old story and one of the most important epic poems in the early english language. Why does noone recognize it for what it is instead of some dumb warrior adventure? Within the first 10 seconds of the movie trailer I knew at was Beowulf, and very excited at seeing it receive a film treatment. As a young reader I was fascinated and entranced by the Beowulf tale, and find Michael does a fantastic job selling it from another point of veiw and literary style. I think we all know Michael is a scholar and not a hack writer! He spent a great deal of time researching background so as to create interesting parallels. So please lets at least give him the literary credit that he deseves instead of cheering it as a fantastic adventure on it's own.Oh, yes I liked the book :)"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Think of Michael Crichton, and you're likely to think of his more techno-thriller mega-hits (all of which have been made into blockbuster movies), some of which might beg the question of how well he can REALLY write. Ponder no more. EATERS OF THE DEAD is a brilliant tour de force exploring the legend of Beowulf through the eyes of an Arab travelling into Viking lands in the 10th century. Crichton weaves actual historical fact seamlessly with myth and legend to create an &quot;eye witness&quot; account of a ferocious battle between warriors en route to Valhalla and monsters of the mist. This is one of the few books made into a film (released under the title &quot;THE 13TH WARRIOR&quot;) where the film actually improves upon what is already a gem of a book. Read the book, then rent the movie. John McTiernan's masterful direction, and the incredibly spooky locations make this tale of superstition and terror a great ride (and it's one of the best performances Antonio Banderas has ever given - he wisely chose to be part of a stellar ensemble cast). Book: A- Movie: A+"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Michael Chricton does an unbelievable job making this book read so entertaining, considering the story happened so long ago and was translated many times. Even though there are footnotes throughout the book it still flows smoothly and still makes sense! You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"One of Michael Crichton's earlier works, this entrancing tale is part history, part mystery, and all-out adventure. A masterful blend of fact, fiction, and opinion, Crichton skillfully recants the story of Ibn Fadlan, an ambassador to the Caliph of Bagdad as he journeys North in A.D. 922. Join Fadlan as he accompanies Buliwyf, a legendary Viking chieftan, on his return home to Scandinavia. Buliwyf and his clan must battle the &quot;Wendol&quot;, or &quot;monsters of the mist&quot;, who threaten to destroy the Norse homeland. With Eaters of the Dead, Crichton has created an entertaining interpretation of an ancient manuscript, captivating the reader with Ibn's hilarious caricatures of Viking life. True to Crichton form, there is a twist to the tale, resulting in an ending that packs a powerful punch.This books literally contains the &quot;stuff that legends are made of.&quot; Read for yourself and find out"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Eaters of the Dead (now retitled The 13th Warrior) is unlike anything else you'll read by Michael Crichton. This short book is written in the style of an ancient manuscript. It is the journal of Ibn Fadlan, a representative from the Court of the Caliph of Bagdad, who is sent as ambassador to the King of Saqaliba as punishment for his indiscretion with the young wife of a wealthy merchant. Fadlan never reaches his destination. Instead, he meets a group of Viking warriors who take him with them on their heroic mission to rid a Northen Kingdom of the monsters of the mist. Part history, part Beowolf, part Grendel, part Crichton's imagination, this is an interesting story told by a master storyteller. However, it borrows far too much from other stories (like Beowolf and Grendel) and the style (which includes lengthy footnotes in very small print) becomes tiresome after a while. It's an interesting quick read, but it's also far from Crichton's best."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"If you like short novels, I can't recommend this one enough. I read it in one sitting due to the constant action.

I found that this book is action-packed and very fundemental. There were many interesting parts in this book lik when Mr. Crichton explains about the Tus. I thought that the writing was very artistic. Crichton wrote like someone would in 922 A.D. and I found that very cool. Then, I decided to read it again. The second time was just as good because you miss so much the first time. So, I would recommend this book to anyone who likes interesting, artistic, and action-packed books.

Compared to the clunky, commercial &quot;Sphere&quot; and &quot;Congo&quot; offerings, &quot;Eaters&quot; is a work that pours forth the impressive passion and power this author can bring to his craft when he writes to tell a story rather than merely sell a story. If your mind can reach beyond the fifteen second news spot, if your understanding of the human adventure soars beyond Sociology 103, take a turn at this rich, rewarding journey into the unknown.

Far beyond a merely &quot;male-bonding&quot; blood-and-guts Viking adventure this is a moving story of friendship reaching across cultures and religions--&quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; has the intellectual generosity that marks the best of Crighton's books. I hope this quality is not lost in the up-and-and coming film, but hiring the director of &quot;Die Hard&quot; for the cinematic version of this novel is not encouraging."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Eaters of the Dead is not only an excellent book for what it contains, but also for what it is.

Try Jurassic Park or Airframe for a first time Crichton read."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Around 922, ibn Fadlan really did write a diary of his experience with the norsemen. However, we must remember that Crichton is writing historical &quot;fiction&quot; and has made a &quot;fictional&quot; story out of ibn Fadlan's actual work. Crichton's book should not be taken as a factual account of what Fadlan wrote - to see the real thing as it was in the eyes of a foreigner to the north - read ibn Fadlan. To enjoy a good story about the same thing, read Crichton - it was interesting - but it was fiction."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I wouldn't read this book for fun, but I would encourage reading it for any school assignment, as I did. Crichton has written better (Rising Sun, Lost World, etc.)"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Michael Crichton has taken a real 10th century manuscript depicting Ibn Fadlan's journeys into the northern country of the Rus, and worked it into a rousing adventure story. His text follows the original so closely at times that it doesn't read as smoothly as a modern novel, and has therefore been misunderstood by a number of readers. Nonetheless, those interested in an anthropologically-oriented volume showing the culture clash between Arab and Norse, with a great deal of adventure and bloody battles thrown in, will enjoy the book. It becomes clear during reading that the story familiar to Europeans and Americans in Beowulf is present here. Despite some claims, this does NOT appear to have been inserted by Crichton - professional historians had already noted this connection in the original Ibn Fadlan manuscript and written on it in professional journals. Another example of supposedly European literature originating in earlier Arab manuscripts."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"The fact that many seem to be continuing the myth that the novel has any historical basis is laughable.

Eaters of the Dead is about a Arab minstrel named Ahamad ibn-Fadlan (there's a much longer name in the book) leaves his city of Baghdad as ordered by the King, and sets off on a long journey to the Northlands. I really liked this book. The action scenes were short, but there were many. A nice combination of real stories and Beowulf, the famous poem. Rothgar and Ahamad are my favorite charecters.

While Crichton's transcription is at times slow paced, it is important to remember who and what his source was; an Arab intelligence agent reporting everything he saw and experienced for his leadership in Baghdad. The most significant and unusual part of the account itself regards the 'monsters of the mist' and who (or what) they may have been. No good explanations come to mind, with one possible exception. Neanderthals!

What many readers didn't like about it is exactly what I liked. That it really seemed like just a translation from an old text. Crichton keeps you guessing if the original text really existed, or if he completely made up the whole thing. Similar to Jurassic Park and Andromeda Strain where some of the books in the bibliography are written by characters in the story. And of course the story itself was wonderful.

And both, I believe, are set in or near Denmark. (&quot;There's something rotten in Denmark&quot;, to misquote Shakespeare.) What is the story here? Is this ancient manuscript of Ibn Fadlan real, or is Crichton, (an author whom I greatly admire, BTW,) ripping off the old Beowulf legend, whether consciously or subconsciously? To carry the parallel even further, the hairy, man-like monsters Crichton/Fadlan describes are very similar to how John Gardner described Grendel in the book of the same name (Grendel.)

The similarities go on and on.Would anyone like to tell me these are coincidences? If Crichton was not familiar with the Beowulf story when he wrote Eaters of the Dead, then this bard's tale must have been recorded somewhere besides in Beowulf, the oldest known English manuscript. Perhaps it is a legend that runs throughout several cultures. Proper names can, albeit slightly altered, translate from one language to another.Now that the movie is coming out (no doubt destined to be another smash hit) Mr. Crichton, please tell us the truth.

His protagonist, Fadlan, is a documented and verified chronicler of 10th century Arabic society whose writings are sought and taught by historians the world over.

If you found the book tedious or burdensome to get through, try going back to the original sources; you'll learn the meaning of the word &quot;burdensome.&quot; Overall, Crichton's work tends to favor technical jargon and limps along with regard to literary merit.

The first three chapters are based on an actual 10th century manuscript while the rest is loosely based on the legend of Beowulf and the Hall of Heorot.

The narrative ends with a description of the final battle between the Northmen and a group of extremely savage people or almost-people called the Wendol, which is basically the story of Beowulf retold from a new perspective.This is one of Crichton's shorter novels, barely more than a novella, but it seems about the right length for the story it tells. Too many authors pad out their stories with extraneous material just to create the impression that they're giving you more than they really are. All in all, a good read if you enjoy historical adventures and don't mind a deliberately dry writing style."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I loved this book. Michael Crichton does an AMAZING job retelling the story of Beowulf. One of my favorite books I've read, but this is not an actual manuscript and not a true story. (Mr. Crichton has said he wrote it on a bet that he could retell Beowulf - making it interesting.) He uses the historical figure of Ibn Fadlan as the (basis) character in his novel, but the story is not anything Fadlan wrote. Please get your facts straight."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Let me begin by saying this is not a true story. While the name of the Arab may appear in history, nothing else follows suit. Just think about it; neadrathal men at war with Vikings?! This is, in fact, a genuis retelling of Beowulf using a trick invented by HP Lovecraft.A ways back Lovecraft wrote the &quot;Necronomicon.&quot; It is his version of the Simarillion or Elder God's Bible, a book dealing with the Ancient Ones from his Cthulu short-stories. If you've read those stories you immediately recognize it as such. But Lovecraft, rather than name himself the author, made up a &quot;Mad Arab&quot; and said that this Mad Arab was the true author, and Lovecraft was just translating it. Clever, funny, but a problem because there are a lot of teenagers out there picking up the Necronomicon and believing it's real cause they have never picked up a Lovecraft Cthulu book.Showing his wit, Michael Crichton actually lists the Necronomicon as &quot;Recommended Reading&quot; in the appendix next to several books on Viking culture.What Michael Crichton was doing, as another pointed out, was to present the events of Beowulf in a faux-factual form. He presents what happens as real things, from the viewpoint of an Arab who saw Bulwyf (Beowulf) battle the Wendol (Grendel). From the sleeping-trap to the recovered arm to the wurm to the mother wendol, everything that happens in this book mirrors events in Beowulf. Don't view this as stealing, however. This isn't Robert Jordan stealing from Frank Herbert (shudder). This is the most clever remake of the famous epic poem since &quot;Grendel,&quot; a story told from the viewpoint of the famous monster.It's a good read all on it's own, with enough facts to make it seem real. It's even more enjoyable to fans of Beowulf, who can admire how well Crichton changed the poem and made a lone Grendel and his mother into an army of primitave, unevolved men."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Eaters of the dead is a truly spectacular book. It keeps the reader on the edge with detail while still getting an interesting plot out. Not too many authors can do such a thing. Michael Crichton is simply an amazing author. Every book of his that I have read, I have finished in less than 2 weeks. I just simply cannot put them down. Ibn Fadlon is a devout Muslim who is sent on a mission to the King of Bulgars. On his mission he encounters some Viking warriors. Ibn, believing in his Muslim ways, disapproves in how the men act and take care of themselves, but its rather fascinating reading on how he likes and dislikes many of the other ways of the Vikings. The best part of the book, is the ending, it is simply remarkable. This book contains factual information while still not becoming boring. I also like the footnotes that Crichton puts on the bottom of some pages. There are some words that I have never heard before and telling the reader what they mean is very helpful in the understanding of this book. The only thing that I don't like about this book is that it doesn't develop many characters. You really only get to know one of them. I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in history and the customs of the Vikings, and has the stomach to read some grueling details."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I don't understand why everyone is so wrapped up in whether this book is fact or fiction. That's the beauty of it. Some is fact, some is fiction, and it leaves the reader guessing as to which is which. Those who believe that this whole story is fact - I feel sorry for you - should go and read the epic poem of Beowulf (one of the earliest classics of the English language). Those who want to nitpick about which parts are real, and which fantasy - I feel sorry for you too - who really cares? If people want to think that this book is real, let them. Ignorance is bliss, remember? I thought the book itself was done very well, and Crichton really did exactly what he set out to accomplish - blur reality with fantasy."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Right, quite clearly - the first 3 chapters of this book are based on a 10th century manuscript.The rest is wholly fictional. Ibn Fadlan observed and commented on Scandinavian merchants on the Volga. He didn't go anywhere with them, fight anything, or meet Neanderthals.Even if you know nothing of Ibn Fadlan, Crichton himself is quite clear on this point."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I had only read one M. Crichton book before, Rising Sun, and I had loved that book. So going into this I had high expectations and I was severely disappointed. I realize that he was trying to piece together actual documented events and that must be very difficult, but I found the overall work to be poorly developed and lacking in substance despite the copious footnotes."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I usually really enjoy his books. This one leaves a lot to be desired. Not very interesting, plodding and difficult to read. Certainly NOT up to his usual standard of exciting fast moving and enjoyable reads.Was very disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This is an amazing and surprisingly good story packed with action (it starts slowly). I have recommended this book to many friends."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Great Read, just be sure to read the Introduction so you understand exactly what & why Chriton wrote the book. Otherwise you may get caught in missunderstanding."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"After finding out that the film \\"the 13th warrior\\" was based on this book I decided to read it and I would have to say that it's far better than the book. read and I finished pretty The story is about an Arab named Ibn Fadlan who has to join a group of Vikings and fight an ancient evil which is bothering a small kingdom. Through the eyes of Ibn you learn about the Viking way of life and how they differ from the Arabs. This story is supposed to be the actual events that lead to the mythic story of Beowulf which is a lot more obvious in the book than in the film version.The book isn't long and I was able to get through it quickly and there are a bunch of footnotes through the book which I thought was a nice touch and made it seem more like an authentic manuscript than a made up story. There is also an introduction about how people view the Vikings and at the end of the story the author tell what inspired him to write this book. If you like the movie, Beowulf or Viking stuff in general then I would recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Its good. In corporating history and science, he did a great job. Superb!!! I hope there's a sequel for it.... (^-^)"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I stumbled upon \\"The 13th Warrior\\"/\\"Eaters of the Dead\\" while browsing in a seaside used bookstore. I was quickly immersed in the narrative. It's very different from the typical Crichton - more historical fiction/fantasy than sci-fi - and even his style is different, mimicking the choppy cadences of translated Arabic. The story, in which a Islamic ambassador from Baghdad finds himself traveling with a Viking crew to rescue its people from an ancient menace, is enthralling. Crichton, with typical attention to detail, embellishes his tale with academic footnotes, blurring the line between fact and fiction for even the most attentive reader (yours truly included). I was tickled to find at the end that Crichton's story is based upon \\"Beowulf\\" (which I have to read for school this summer) - Buliwyf is Beowulf, Rothgar is Hrothgar, etc. I loved the story, but loved the ideas behind it even more. Through fiction, Crichton attempts to imagine a historic basis for the Beowulf saga, much as Heinrich Schliemann found a real Troy in his search for the truth in the \\"Iliad\\". Fascinating and thought-provoking - the hallmarks of a Crichton story."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"The Eaters of the Dead is based partly on fact and largely on imagination. Michael Crichton wrote this story on a dare. His task, rewriting Beowulf so it would be more readable for the masses. The story was then made into a movie, The 13th Warrior, which starred Antonio Banderas.The story starts with Ahmed Ibn Fadlan, a member of the royal court in Baghdad, being sent, as a punishment for involvement with a rich man's wife, to the land of the Ogurs. At the request of their ruler, for instruction in Islam. Ibn, as he is called in the book, encounters various people along the way telling us of their lifestyles and some of their &quot;filthy&quot; habits. He eventually meets &quot;Northmen&quot; or Vikings on the banks of the Volga River. (This is reportedly one of the earliest records we have of their lifestyle.) His only way to communicate with them is by speaking Latin with Herger, one of the Vikings and waiting for translation when Herger is in the mood.Ibn's party arrives just in time to see the funeral of the Viking leader and the naming of a new King, Buliwyf. A messenger arrives from the north seeking help for his village and Ibn is sent on a journey with Buliwyf and eleven other warriors to conquer an evil so horrible it cannot be named. Once the warriors arrive in the village of Rothgar they endure all sorts of challenges from dealing with the conniving Prince to conquering the Eater's of the Dead.Ahmed Ibn Fadlan kept an actual record of his journey and parts of it have been translated to English. Crichton got his main story idea from this journal. Interestingly, there are lots of footnotes in the book citing a reference or resource, which are sometimes factual and sometimes part of Crichton's imagination. (There is an afterward to the book that clears up some of those references.)I have never read Beowulf but I have read this book 3 times. It's an easy read but it is hard to keep from confusing the fiction from the fact."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"As a student in Medieval Studies and history, this is the Crichton that I love the most. The Historian Crichton. If you enjoyed the epic of Beowulf, then you will rave over Eaters of the Dead. This is based on a true story.We follow an Arab messenger traveling north from the middle east on a mission. Along the journey, he stops to stay with some northman and gets plunged into an incredible journey. The messanger starts to write about his travels and now, hundreds of years later, Crichton translates them for us.The northman are summoned to a distant land to help a fellow king in a time where his people are being killed by \\"mist monsters\\". The northman are ready to go, when they say they need a thirteenth warrior that is not of their own land. That warrior is the Arab.The way the story is told is incredible, because we get it in a first person point of view. You can feel the action and feel the battles as if you were fighting them yourself. But this is more than just a story, but a history lesson as well. The book gives us loads of info on the vikings and the ways of cannibalistic tribes which gives us a bit of a heads up leading into the story.Crichton does a hell of a translating job, and tells this story wonderfully. Although this story is not from Crichtons own head, dont pass it up. This is a perfect piece of fiction/non-fiction."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This was an excellent book it was a good history and fictionalization of viking lore."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"What makes Cricton's Eaters of the Dead fascinating is that knowing the cultures of the different characters in the book are quite historically accurate, the Vikings customs for death and burial, their \\"live for death\\" attitude, and their individual characteristics. I enjoy how diverse Fadlan's background and civilization differs so much from the Vikings, yet throughout the book they seem to find more common ground with each other."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"The author of \\"An excellent and modern retelling of the Beowulf saga\\" wrote exactly what I would have written. The book does give great action, adventure and suspense. Critchton goes into great detail about the scenes of how the eaters of the dead mutilated and mauled their victims, which were Viking women children and men, the creators did not care who or what they ate. The writers of the last two reviews did not specify this, nor tell about the creators. Without them the story would just be a bunch of cool Vikings walking around killing things. This book does give good historical background and lots of cultural information. Both critiques acknowledged this fact. This critique was really hard to write do to the fact that all the writers thought this book was the coolest thing Since Jimmy Hendrix, and I agree"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I think I would have had a better appreciation for this book if I had read Beowulf in high school or college. Even still, I enjoyed Eaters of the Dead. It moves kind of slow at times, and the writing style isn't what I'm used to from Crichton, since this is written in the style of an ancient manuscript. But the basic storyline is interesting and exciting."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"First, a note to just about every other review I've seen. This is the page for the BOOK Eaters of the Dead! WHY are you reviewing the movie here? That out of the way, I just couldn't get into this book the way I've gotten into other Crichton books. Having a first person perspective eliminated his trademark cross-cutting, and overall it was a flat and unemotional experience. Numerous things were changed in the movie, but it's no better. I'm glad that Crichton didn't write any more like this. All his other books are gems."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"While I read this book with great interest, I could not get over the fact that it was far too similar to the epic poem, 'Beowulf. I am convinced that there is some truth to Crichton's novel; Ibn Fadlan did exist, and he did live amongst the Norsemen. In fact, I have read several histories about the Vikings and the Arab's name keeps appearing, especially when he is describing the people of the North. While reading, 'Eater's of the Dead,' I can't help but notice how well it mimics the tale of 'Beowulf.' This fact alone proves that the story must be fiction; there are too many similiarities. Crichton went out of his way to make the book appear to be a true account, i.e. footnotes. Too, the book gives an excellent view on ancient Norse culture. In so far as it being real? Well, read 'Beowulf,' then tell me where Crichton got his ideas for this novel! Yet, for all of that, 'Eater's of the Dead,' seems to be a true story. Suffice it to say, I read the book and felt entirely confused. 'Beowulf' was first written in the sixth century. Fadlan's adventures occurred much later in the tenth century. Again, 'Eater's of the Dead,' is nothing but a modern rendition of 'Beowulf."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Eaters of the Dead by Michael Crichton is the fist book I'v read of his. The story cover the manuscript of Idn Fadland, a man that would come to spend some time with the Norsmen. The book tells of what Idn Fadland wrote in his manuscript, what he saw and experienced. Eaters of the Dead is a well writen book that tell what the Vikings were like. (The title cloud use some work.)"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"If you've ever seen the great movie (Thirteenth Warrior) that was based on this book, \\"Eaters of the Dead\\" will just not measure up. Maybe the structure of the book was the problem. Crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document. Maybe he was too successful with that conceit. It was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension, character development or an elevated literary style. Unfortunately, those qualities are necessary in a novel. This was mostly a bore. Don't bother."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I like a lot of Michael Crichton's books (at least before he became such a potty mouth) (my favorites are Jurassic Park and Sphere) so I figured I would give one of his older books a try. This book was easy to read and somewhat entertaining.What Michael Crichton does in this book is basically take the story of Bewolf and make it a readable condenced version. He takes a historical figure (writer at least) Ibl Fadlam (excuse the spelling) and does a \\"make believe\\" that he was there and seeing this story unfold through an outsiders eye. He does a pretty good job with this and it's kind of interesting.However, once I finished I felt that this book was just a pretty basic horror story about monsters attacking villagers who go seek help from \\"heroes\\" where a large number of the heroes die but with a lot of courage and yada yada yada they eventually rid the world/village of these evil \\"easters of the dead\\". In the meantime the heroes have lots of sex with slave girls and drink a lot of beer. There really isn't much else to this book.I would recomend getting this book from the library, it's readily available and short and there really is no need to read this book more than once."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This book had a lot of interesting information and some vivid descriptions. Unfortunately, the way it was presented made a lot of it seem boring. If it had flowed in a more interesting way, I could have easily given the book 5 stars.It is difficult to determine what is fact and what is fantasy. Even with the extensive footnotes it is sometimes hard to understand. Someone familiar with Gary Jennings and especially Raptor can see what might have been with Crichton's novel.The book has its moments though, such as when the narrator explains that as long as you realize that you should be observing a Moslem custom, you are not violating any Moslem rules by not actually observing them. Also, you feel some compassion with the narrator when he cannot pray to Allah because the Norsemen would take offense to it and when he is forced to join the Norsemen because the lucky 13th member of their party must be a foreigner.The funeral for the king was extremely interesting, with the slave girl volunteering to be killed with the dead king.All in all I think this could have been a book of epic proportions had a better and more flowing writing style been employed."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"while it was a first addition the cover was a little more worn that I thought it would be"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"The fact that Crichton tried hard to sell this a a &quot;true&quot; history darkens all the merit this book could have. Only greed can explain that, the same greed that make Crichton allowed the publication of a third-class book, &quot;FIVE PATIENTS&quot;."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"O.K. the movie was good and all, but the book? Even Crichton himself says that the book was just an 'experiment' in combining historical fact with a mythic heroic storyline (Beowulf). Every review here seems to confuse the book with the movie. The movie was well-written, cast extremely well, and just overall a great story.I read Eaters of the Dead over ten years ago and had a hard time with it (not from a reading perspective, its quite easy to read), because it didn't give enough information to be relevant. The Journal style writing without any significant dialog made it feel flat.After the movie came out, I couldn't remember all that stuff happening so I re-read it. Unfortunately I couldn't get the movie images out of my head while I was reading it, which I think is the problem with most of the reviews here.Anyway, it reads quickly, but lacks a certain depth that the movie made up for."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I thought that this was an execellently written book, but crichton could've done better. I don't reccomend one reads it. The croosing of Fadlan and Beowulf is interesting, but that's about it."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Michael Crichton (God rest his soul) was a master of page-turning fiction - especially some of his earlier work (books like The Andromeda Strain, Sphere, and Jurassic Park). Here, in Eaters of the Dead, Crichton masterfully weaves together history and legend - recounting the 10th century travels of the historical Ibn Fadlan as he travels North from Baghdad on a diplomatic mission for the Caliph. Crichton extends Fadlan's journey North to weave in the legend of Beowulf, with Fadlan relaying an eyewitness account of the adventures he soon finds himself in as a sudden companion of Beowulf (spelled Buliwyf in the novel) and his men - including battles with the horrifyingly ghoulish mist monsters (eaters of the dead). The result of this historical/fictional fusion is extremely entertaining and even edifying, for to hear Fadlan recount his impressions of those he met and the customs he encountered is truly fascinating (his attempt to find a place amongst the Northmen even produces some very funny scenes). But there is much adventure too and Crichton, as usual, handles this quite well. All in all, this is a very fun ride and one that I enthusiastically recommend."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Michael Crichton tells this story through the viewpoint of Ahmed Ibn Fadlan, a real-life historical figure who served as an ambassador from the Caliph of Baghdad to the King of the Bulgars in 922 A.D. Ibn Fadlan wrote one of the early accounts of the Rus, a group of Swedish Vikings who relocated to the Baltic region and ultimately gave their name to \\"Russia.\\" In Eaters of the Dead, Ibn Fadlan is chosen to be the thirteenth warrior on a Viking mission to save the land of Venden from a mysterious enemy that attacks from the mist. From that point on, the story mirrors the tale of Beowulf.The leader of Crichton's Vikings is a warrior aptly named Buliwyf. When they reach Venden, they are treated to feasts in the great mead hall of a Viking king named Rothgar. But at night, when the mist comes down from the mountains, Rothgar's kingdom is attacked by mysterious and brutal creatures called the wendol. The beast-like wendol, though many in number, are a clear representation of Beowulf's Grendel, and the story proceeds in the manner of the Old English poem, all the way down to a severed arm placed over the mead hall and a deadly encounter with the mother of the wendol.The story is tense and exciting, and the Vikings, observed through Ibn Fadlan's eyes, start out as savages but end up being noble warriors. Crichton succeeds in this retelling of the legend of Beowulf, but what I liked the most about the novel is the explanation he provides for the wendol. Without spoiling the ending, Crichton suggests a scientific explanation for these creatures that led me to wonder if his wendol explain the stories of trolls, goblins and other monsters that have existed in myths for thousands of years. When a novel makes me think like that, I know it's done its job well."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I've read this book several times but only now have been able to review it. I have read all of MC's books and find this one slightly underrated. As with all of his books, it is thoroughly researched and told as if it should all be taken as Gospel. Very convincing arguements. Plus, it finishes with a typical Crichton-esque revelation that uts the whole story into a historical perspective. It may take a few chapters until you hit the &#34;stride&#34; of the book and get a feel for what is going on, but once you do, you won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"it didn't have all the refinements of a polished writer which made the novel more realistic. i felt i was beside the author listening to him retell the tale and i enjoyed the historical notes which were used to backup or explain the references the author makes."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This can't really be called a typical Crichton story as it's laid out like a history lesson with alot of references to where his information came from.

I originally watched &#34;The 13th Warrior&#34; and was told that this was the book it was based upon.Ibn Fadlan is very descriptive of his encounters, though at other times a little vauge. About 2/5th of the book I think is about the journey but the rest is about his time with the Northmen and the Eaters of the Dead that they encountered. &#34;The 13th Warrior&#34; is a great movie but I honestly think the book is better on ever occassion so &#34;Eaters of the Dead&#34; is definately a favorite of mine now."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I bought this book after reading another Crichton book, Jurassic Park, and loved his writing style.

Some sixpence, but the end was not in doubt. I. Think as a glimpse into Viking life, it is fascinating."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Ever since reading Ken Follet's \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\", I often get into a mood to read a story which mixes both fact and fiction. I have read stories that take place in different centuries and different places in the world. Therefor, I read this book for three reasons:-I had not read a book about Vikings-I had not read a story that takes place in the year 922, or even in the 10th century.-Lastly, I had not read a Cricthon book since last year.This was one of those books that I've owned for sometime, always knew I'd read it, and finally did.The story tells of a man who is sent on a journey by his \\"Caliph\\". Instead of getting to where he was supposed to, he is intercepted by a group of Vikings (also called \\"Norsemen\\"), and is then selected by their leader as the 13th member of their group, and must join them on a dangerous mission.I like quite a few things about this book. Obviously, the place(s) and time period it is set in very much intrigued me. There are parts of this story when the details are a bit horrific, and things get a little gory. Being a big horror fan, I had no problem at all with this.Also, the style of the story is quite unique .It reads as a true story, as there is the narrative written by the main character which chronicles his journey, as well as footnotes later put it by another writer, as one might find in a biography. It is easy to forget that this is labeled as \\"fiction.\\" Nevertheless, whether fiction or non-fiction, it's a pretty entertaining story. It's a short, quick read, as well as an informative story.*Apparently, this story is a retelling of the story/poem Beowulf. I have never read Beowulf (though I was supposed to in high school lol), so I can't comment.*"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This was a great book.

He gets caught up with some rough norsemen and goes off to have an adventure with them. There are some excellent themes in this book, and the movie wasn't able to tell it all, of course. I got this after seeing The 13th Warrior and so appriciated the fleshing out of the tale after the movie which seems to be a clif's notes in comparison."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This book is a little difficult to get into at first.

It isn't literature, but as light entertainments go this is a superior read thanks to relentless pacing, good action scenes, and a satisfying denouement. The novel has two narrators: an academic hack and the Arab. The hack was mildly amusing but started to get on my nerves by the end. On the other hand, using the Arab's cosmopolitan voice to narrate the tale itself is an inspired device for explaining the strange ways of the Vikings to a modern audience.

It's funny how this amazing teacher managed to help it stick in my mind since then by having us do the choral of the tale of Beowulf.Imagine my amazement when I read this. It is the story of Beowulf, but it picks apart the components of legend and shows where they may have been gleaned from. It's done quite ingeniously - I must say. It's a bit of a 'graphic' story, but it has a great deal going for it, and frankly, having already had the background of Beowulf to compare it to, made it all the more pleasing. For those who have no idea who Beowulf was, well, it'll still be an enjoyable, albeit brutal book to read. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"There is a definite connection between all of Crichton's works, that is how he portrays his fiction mingled in truth. The spine of the book says that it is fiction, but once one has read it, it is very hard to determine what could possibly be fiction. This is what is so interesting about the 13th warrior. In this book, an arab named Ibn Faladan joins up with a goup of northmen, whom take him on a journey to assist another king in defeating its menace. These creatures which vex the king are ape-like. In this tale, based upon the story of Beowulf, one gets a great sense of the culture of the vikings. Also, it of course has a great plot full of battles and action. So therefore, one is reading about a great masterpiece, Beowulf, while learning about the vikings!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"i have never read something so bad"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I hafta say, Crichton is by far my favorite author.

Boy, should I have waited. I'm re-writing some of my reviews of old books that I've read, and I decided to start with this: the only novel I have ever given a one star to. Eaters of the Dead offers nothing I thought it would, the action is chessy and not convincing. The characters in the novel are dull and confusing, as is the entire novel. I really didn't get the battles or journeys to battle the Wendol. And they weren't anything special on top of that. Too bad, Eaters of the Dead could have really been something."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"What a sleeper &quot;What is this madness?&quot; I must say I was stunned when I picked this book up. I just finished Prey and thought I was going to be entertained with this book. Boy was I wrong. Just getting through the first disc was a chore.Talk about boring. It really makes me want to ask the author &quot;are you ok?&quot; &quot;Do you need a hug?&quot;"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I did enjoy reading this book but I am very angered by the way the author lied. In the introduction, he claims that this book pretty much was an accurate translation of the originial text. He mentions a number of minor details that he changed (like changing the syntax to make the meaning more understandable or indenting paragraphs) so as to give the reader the impression that he in no way changed the meaning. The book has a lot of footnotes that seems very authentic and an authentic looking bibliography as well. But then you get to the afterward and Crichton is like, &quot;Bwa ha ha ha! You fool! I made the whole story up! I made the bibliography up! I made the footnotes up! Ha ha ha ha!&quot; He even made the translator up (giving him a name that in Latin means &quot;trickery-deciet&quot;) (Of course, he stated all this more politely than that.)So know how confused I am now? I thought I was learning all this nifty stuff about Viking and Arab life and now I have no clue if any of it is true. It is based on real manuscripts, but do these real manuscripts actually mention the flesh eating people at all or is that completely made up? Were the vikings really so promiscuous? I don't even know that. That could be fiction too, since Crichton says we should view the entire novel as fiction. It's not fair to do this to people who have barely any knowledge of vikings. If he wants to write a work of fiction, that's fine, but just be honest about it. Don't out right lie to the readers. Don't make up bibliographies and footnotes. I think he must wish he was a real researcher but doesn't have the intelligence to be one. I am so mad!!!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Would love to say this is wonderful but I honestly can't. Not because the book wasn't a book I like...it had to do with it being a gift for someone else and I didn't read it. Wish I could be of more help."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"The positive reviews that litter this page make me fear for the preservation of discerning taste in literature, and I pray that the majority of said reviews were written by pranksters and children under 12. Were it not for the fact that this book was assigned as summer reading in preparation for Beowulf in 11th grade honors English class, I likely wouldn't have so much as brushed its cover, but as it is, I have read a great deal of it, and have found myself repulsed. I am a person able to read biology textbooks word for word, yet am bored to pieces by this abysmal work. I wish not to sound over critical and so I am searching my mind for something good to say about this book...well, I only had to throw it across the room once. Also, one must somehwhat appreicate Mr. Crichton's boldness in actually bringing such a piece forth to the public eye...that took courage.The main flaw of the book rests in the fact that Mr. Crichton deliberatly imitates a style that is inherantly dull, pretending that it is a translation of an anicent work, and attaining this appearance by employing flat and awkward sentence structure, as well as the constant invoking of phrases to the effect of \\"This is what happened:\\"...Any third grader knows that, \\"this is what happened\\" is poor writing, and Crichton's useage of such phrases does not strike me in any way as artful or iconoclastic in breaking with such conventions, but is more like a stupid schoolboy asking himself,\\"Let's see what I can get away with.\\" It is obvious that this book is neither a translation, nor is it well-researched. In one of the first chapters, the mian character, a Muslim, refers to others of his religion as \\"Mohammedans\\", Mohammedanism being a Western misnomer for Islam, derived from the misconception that the religon entails the worship of the prophet rather than Allah, a misocnception that is quite contrary to the actual religion and not a word this character would have used. Thus, from the beginning, it is clear that Crichton's cultural notes and anecdotes can in no way be trusted, if even this basic fact which any seocnd-rate author should have uncovered in writing a book dealing in unfamilair cultures, was overlooked. His footnotes (and mind you, faux footnotes do not bother me as a rule...if you like footnotes, try Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, who employs them with frequent hilarity)are mostly vessels for the occasional tidbit of information that may/may not have any foothold in truth as we know it, that Mr. Crichton seems to think himself clever for coming up with...the footnotes are an effective way to throw in said tidbits without actaully having to devise a way of working them into a story.Basically, the book lacks any aesthetic value, nor does it have an emotionally or intellectually provoking story or theme...it is wirtten as a bland historical piece wihtout the truth to render it with historical value. if there is a theme to this book, it may be that history is not that important unless we can find subjective value in it, but this is only someting I could dervie from the book's existance, not within the book itself, and consequently, one does not need to read it in order to gather that message from it, nor SHOULD one read it, but do quite the contray and run as far away from Mr. Crichton's \\"books\\" as possible...well, not literally (don't want to cause a mess in one's local library). Oh, I have failed to mention that the plot of this book is actually quite dull, despite whomever gets murdered ( when the main character is thouroughly disturbed,to the point of vomitting, as occurs many times in this book (often wiht the same wording too) oughtn't the reader to be at least somewhat unnerved as well?). One cares not a lick for the characcters, nor what will happen next. I quite wish the main character would drop dead...and if he says \\"verily, this is what occurred next:\\"...but the character isn't even real enough for me that I could really pretend that he is a living being able to be murdered.I feel that there is much more to criticize, yet it is hard to find fault with what isn't there, and a good deal of what is wrong with Eaters of the Dead lies not in what is in it, but rather what it lacks. There is an infinite variety of books I oculd choose over this one...many types for many people...if one likes bland facutal novels, why not seek ACTUAL bland factual books. If one likes Beowulf-based tales, why not seek out The Grendel, whihc acutally has some level of cleverness and thought behind it? When I comlained about having to read this book to a friend of mine, he referred to Crichton as a, \\"hack\\", and I think that term applies. Crichton is a hack, look away from his books dear children...his botching of English word order increasdes neither aesthetic nor meaning...there is no art...what meagre plot there is is unoriginal...In the style of Crichton, \\"This is what one should do with this book: do not read it.\\""},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Save yourself.

Not until I read the end I read that he admitted that this book is, &quot;Of course, in writing a novel, I intended to create a fantasy of my own.&quot;, a mere novel, wich story has been created from the very head of the author.But whatever it is, it gives false impressions about muslim. Such as, inthe very beginning of the book, he wrote that Ibn Fadl did zina, the premarriage sexual activity, &quot;to pass the heat of the afternoon&quot;. From that point I have loose my interest in reading the whole book, but I continued indeed. And in describing the tradition of the Turks, he made them look like abunch uncivilized, barbabaric people than the European themself. That's ridiculous. The Turks were one of the bravest muslim in history of all time, not until the very Kemal At-Turk himself destroyed the tradition of the muslim of course.One more thing I would like to complain, Michael made the Arab, whom are the bravest warrior known, look like a child compare to the vikings, and yet there's no prove concerning that fact.Mr. Michael, do I have to inform you, that even this book is only a novel, it can influence the thinking of many people (just like the bible) ? And we can all imagine, if you start telling a lie, than you are not a real writer."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This book was very good not only because of the story, but because of the characters. These barbaric vikings were brutal in battle and exceptional warriors, but they also seemed to have a side to them that the reader can care about. Ibn Fadlan depending on Herger the translator, Buliwyf showing courage through the journey while still accepting Fadlan, an outsider, into his clan, and the rest of the warriors fighting against evil and enjoying it are examples of how I gained interest in their personalities. I almost wanted to jump in and fight with them against the monsters of the mist. I don't want to give anything away, but I almost felt sorry for the vikings at the end.

Considering he is one of the hottest authors in Hollywood, how could you not. The book reviewed here, however, is none of the above; it is a more or less forgotten book called Eaters of the Dead this review is about a book written by Michael Crichton which has been used to create a movie called \\"The Thirteenth Warrior.\\" In fact, the name of the original book was\\"Eaters of the Dead.\\" What's most interesting about this book is that the reader will feel he is reading a fictional novel rather than a real life account of a Muslim ambassador reporting back to his Khalifa .\\" The Thirteenth Warrior\\" is actually a translated manuscript of guy named \\"Ahmed Ibn-Fadlan.\\" This book was supposed to be a boring translation of a boring report of a humble person but while reading it,the reader will understand that facts and fiction are all mixed up together. Even the writer, Micheal Crichton, confessed that there are fictional parts in the novel whereas the novel was supposed to be historical.Ahmed-Ibn-Fadlan leaves his country ,Mesopotemia to go to the wealthy kingdom of Bulgaria but end up with the Vikings.The leader of the band of the Vikings was \\"Buliwyf\\" who was to help King Rothgar from the eaters of the dead.Thirteenth warrior had to go to the mission and Ahmed-Ibn-Fadlan was the last one.The writer of the original document, Ahmed-Ibn-Fadlan, starts his writing informing the reader that he has been driven out of his homeland by a jealous Muslim miser who poisoined the air around the Khalif of Baghdad about Fadlan, afer knowing that Ibn-Fadlan has a secret relationship with his wife.But the real story starts when Ibn-Fadlan meets the Vikings and finds himself forced to stay with the Vikings. Ibn-Fadlan was given the task to meet the King of Bulgaria,in a country situated near today's Russia's Volga river.But throughtout the book,we read about Viking customs, traditions, myths, warfare tactics of the Vikings.Ibn-Fadlan's voice has been clear and describing in vivid details what he saw.Instead of the traditional,western,fictional story-telling way,Ibn-Fadlan uses the neutral viewpoint of the observer and reports everything he has seen in graphic details.Interesting as It may seem,Michael Crichton wrote \\"Eaters Of The Dead\\" while he was a college undergraduate,accepting the challange of a college professor about using\\"Beowulf\\"-an Anglo-Saxon epic, and the translated manuscript of Ibn-Fadlan to make his students aware about books which says a lot of important things about western civilisation but haven't been read.After studying the manuscript,which has been abruptly finished with the words \\"Now It happened\\", giving us the hint that there might have been another incident.Though this book says real things about real people,it doesn't feel boring once because when you read the novel you will find fact and fiction very close mingling freely! The historical detail is handled reasonably well, the story is fast-paced and gripping, and the contrast between the Arab/Islamic and Viking cultures is effectively exploited. The result is not a great novel, but it's an entertaining one and should appeal to those interested in the period."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"OK, this is a fun read, but Crichton is less than forthcoming about this version of the Beowulf saga.If the author really means to provide readers with a trail into literature so they can, at their discretion, make up their own minds about the veracity of Ibn Fadlan's tale, then he should be as diligent to note its amazing similarities to the Beowulf cycle of stories as he is to cite the provenance of old manuscripts or Arabic text translations. Lots of good reading mixes myth and history to make a fictional tale, but the citations that are supposed to help readers understand the tale are very selective by omission of details from the BEOWULF epic.This selective use of citations of ancient manuscripts is why I gave it two stars. I like a rangy yarn as well as the next person, but I do not care to have an author use pseudo-scholarly methods as &quot;authentication.&quot; Also, my copy is dated 1976 and there is some really great material about Neanderthalers (including two analyzed samples of their mitochondrial DNA) that has been published since. You might also want to check out paleoclimate data (this story occurs just before the Little Ice Age) and have a good atlas at hand. Crichton does provide helpful geographic information.If you are not of an historical inclination, this is an enjoyable adventure yarn."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This Michael Crighton book is an interesting story -- but it is NOT a true story.

And, does anyone seriously believe that a Viking would know Latin?"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Despite being very easy to spot the 'shift' in writing style between the two, it is still a very good book that is quite entertaining to read.

Once all were fed the went into a village. not to give it away they end up getting there goal and it all lead to the vickings. I do think you will like the book if you have time to reread and consitrate. Michael Criton truly wrote a complex novel and put alot into it. He really makes you feal as though he was a vicking himself.(he wasn't 700 A.D.)If you like the movie 13th warrior make sure you do read this because,he did change it around quite a bit.Michael Criton wrote a Great book make sure you read it!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Ibn Fadlan's original manuscript regarding the tale of an Arab ambassador on a mission to one of Europe's barbarian outposts is the basis for Chrichton's fascinating story. The character and the story line are historic fact which provides an interesting platform for this tale.Fadlan, from the cultured City of Baghad, is repelled and aghast at the practices of the Vikings he encounters in South Eastern Europe. A moralist with a strict code of appropriate behavior, he must do as ambassadors have frequently been called to do -- interact with a Viking host whose everyday behavior violates his code and moral standards.Despite their different cultures (or the Vikings lack of culture as opposed to Fadlan's relatively well-developed one), Fadlan is taken to by his hosts and joins them when they are summoned back to Scandinavia to rescue their beseiged clan. The tale includes mythic enemies and battles worthy of this medieval travelogue. Fadlan and his hosts are tested according to the savage tenor of the times as they grapple with enemies unchecked in their ferocious desire to persevere over the Norsemen.The book is a great tale and fascinating account of the times. A quick read, it is never ponderous as it dissipates some of the mists of a long ago era for modern readers"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I would encourage any fans of the action/adventure genre to give this book a read. It is well worth it.However, please do keep in mind that although the book is billed as based on the historical account of Ibn Fadlan's journey's amoung the Rus, it is a work of FICTION. In this story, Crichton mixes a little Ibn with a lot of Beowulf and his own fertile imagination. But don't take my word for it.

I also study Vikings and Viking culture on my free time, so the subject matter is curious to me. This book is a quick read; most readers can finish it in one day (if not one sitting). In the end, I must say it is a good and interesting story, especially if you like Vikings. Fact? Historical and archaeological accuracy? You decide when you read the ending. Please don't let this book or the movie define Viking culture for you.

No wasted money if you like history."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Eaters of the dead takes place around 922 A.D. The Caliph of Baghdad sends a court member named Ahmad Ibn Fadlan to deliver a message to the King of Bulgars. During his journey, Fadlan stays at a Viking village. Then a lone warrior comes from the North and tells of a terror that kills the Vikings in the night under the cover of night and the mist. Fadlan is then enlisted to fight this horror, against his will. He protests, but to no avail. He journeys to the North with 12 other warriors to Rothgar's Kingdom and helps to defend it form the attacks by the barbaric mist warriors. Then, the group goes on the offensive to slay the mother.Ibn Fadlan makes this book more interesting and fun to read because he is the total opposite of the Vikings, with whom he stays. He is apalled by their barbaric customs because he is a civilized Arab and the Norsemen are uncivilized. Throughout the story these contrasts are evident. This book proceeds without talking about one subject for too long. I never got bored and there is never a break in the action. The suspense also never stops. I would definitely recommend this book because it gives a great look into the Viking culture while being very entertaing. You won't be able to put it down. Crichton's writing is very fast paced, so this is a great read on a good subject."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This was quite an interesting book, told in the first person in an archaic style.

While at times this means that the reader is absolutely convinced that Crichton is dealing with a true historical work, leaving the reader disturbed and questioning what he or she has long assumed, at other times it means that action sequences cannot be written as the fast-paced thrill-packed scenes that we became familiar with in Crichton's other works; rather, the manuscript-approach to this novel means that all of it -- including the action sequences -- must be written as a report, a kind of re-telling of the story. For fans of Crichton's work, this book is certainly recommended; however, for those new to or unfamiliar with his other books, this would not seem to be a good starting point -- this isn't the typical page-turner that Crichton has produced recently. Nonetheless, I was still left with a certain quantity of chills at the end of the book..."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Michael Crichton, never at a loss at putting a whole new slant on the tried and true, has given us a fascinating tale that combines some of the best elements of what might have happened if Sharazad had met up with Beowulf instead of the sultan Shahriyar. In &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; (an unfortunate title if there ever was one), Crichton introduces us to Ibn Fadlan, the story's narrator, a young Arabian who has had the misfortune to capture the heart of the young and beautiful wife of a rich old merchant. Ibn Fadlan is unwillingly sent out of harm's way on a mission to the faraway kingdom of Saqaliba. En route to his destination, he meets a group of Scandinavians, led by a brawny warrior called Buliwyf (the ancient spelling of Beowulf?). Ibn Fadlan thinks the Scandinavians are beyond gross; their habits are disgusting, they're little more civilized than animals -- but he finds an affinity with Buliwyf who can communicate in the common currency of the Latin language, still alive in the 10th century when this story takes place. Buliwyf convinces Ibn Fadlan to come with him and his men to Scandinavia, where they are being terrorized by a mysterious and monstrous entity that emerges from the mists and leave carnage and bloodshed in their wake.In &quot;Beowulf&quot; this entity was, of course, Grendel, but in &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; the monster turns out to be a group of cannibalistic Neanderthals who sow terror everywhere they appear, and with good reason. As in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, there is a battle to the finish in which only one side can survive. During Ibn Fadlan's stay in the Scandinavian village, while preparing for the final confrontation, he learns a lot about his new friends and discovers that, while they may not be as cultured as his Arabian kinfolks, they are far from being the barbarians the first appeared to be.Ibn Fadlan tells us his story as entries in a journal, each one more fascinating than the next, and the ending reads like a journal broken off, for reasons we never find out. The last words are &quot;Now it happened that...&quot; What happened? Crichton's genius as a storyteller is leaving us wanting to know more about this Arabian world-traveler and what kind of subsequent adventures he met up with before he returned home -- if he ever did.Crichton, whose interests seem to be encyclopedic, based this book on a real manuscript by an Arab traveller called ibn Fadlan who in the year 921 A.D. traveled from Arabia to Bulgaria as an emissary of the Caliph. The manuscript is available in several modern translations, including English, but Crichton's book is probably a lot more fun to read. &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; was a sleeper, originally published in hardcover (I still have my copy) but it didn't take off until years later, after the release of the film &quot;The Thirteenth Warrior&quot; with Antonio Banderas playing the protagonist. In making two ancient cultures come alive for the reader, Crichton shows himself again to be a master storyteller."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Mr. Crichton has in this book shown how adaptive he can be. He deliberately adopts a different style in this book than in the others that I have read and he pulls it off excellently. The idea of writing a story that is originally an actual historical document is impressive in it's originality. The idea of using that psuedo-document as a link to a mythological legend is also impressive. The style was somewhat dry to read, and the fight with the dragon was perhaps the most mundane I have ever encountered, but overall the book was very well done. My chief complaint is that he did not spend enough time developing the Eaters into more than a caricature of Neanderthals, but he did write this book over two decades ago. The battle scenes were not very exciting in the modern sense of the reader/viewer, but were exciting that he had kept to the writing style to which he had committed when writing this story. Over all, read it. And if you can read it before you see it."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Crichton sets out to do the impossible, to recapture the truth behind the Beowulf legend in the form of a fiction narrative. He accomplishes his purpose by introducing an historical figure (Ibn Faladan) into the story as narrator. A real life Arab joins forces with a mythological Viking to do battle against the hypothetical prototypes of legendary monsters. How's that again? Oddly enough, the story works. Not quite as well as it could have, but the plot sweeps you along to Beowulf's foreordained glorious death.Contrary to his source, Crichton makes Beowulf one of the Rus (the Viking invaders of Dark Ages Russia). He has to do this to get Beowulf together with Ibn Faladan, who traveled in Russia a century or two after Beowulf's death. You can't really complain about Crichton's disrespect for his sources. After all, this IS a work of fiction."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Michael Crichton has written an outstanding novel that is rooted in both the epic Beowulf and historial documents written by the real Ibn Fadlan that have been unearthed over time. As an ambassador of the Caliph of Baghdad, the City of Peace, he encounters during his travels a group of Northmen. After staying for a time with them, a small group of them are called upon to return to their homeland to do battle with an ancient evil that is slowly destroying them. This is where the new title comes into play, for the group is comprised of twelve of the hardiest warriors of the group of Northmen, chosen by the clan's oracle, and Ibn Fadlan as the 13th Warrior. As the book puts it, &quot;The party of Buliwyf must be thirteen, and one of these must be no Northman, and so you (Ibn Fadlan) shall be the thirteenth.&quot; This ancient evil is a tribe of primitive humans who clothe themselves in the skins of bears, the creature whom they worship, and attack with the coming of the mist; they are also know to practice cannibalism, hence the original title, &quot;Eaters of the Dead.&quot; Despite his misgivings about the Northmen, Ibn Fadlan has no choice but to take up arms against this mythical enemy.For some, this book may be a difficult read, especially since Ibn Fadlan's writings go into great detail about the habits and appetites of the Northmen, such as their penchant for wenching and their bouts of drunkenness. However, these are essential to the telling of the story, as they establish the character of Ibn Fadlan as one who is much used to the cleanliness and ordered life of the City of Peace. Through the course of the book, he gradually comes to terms with the Northmen, and begins to respect them, in some cases even picking up some of their habits. One of the great parts of this book is the footnotes added by Michael Crichton about certain parts of the documents that this story was supposedly based on. It adds a definite element of realism to the story, and also will help to explain to some readers the more obscure references in the book.In all, this book chronicles not only Ibn Fadlan's travels, but also the changes wrought in him by his experiences with the Northmen. At the novel's end, his respect for them is much higher, and he goes away with not only with greater bravery himself, but also a renewed sense of piety and purpose. The end even leaves the door open for a sequel, should Crichton choose to write one, although he has indicated in the past that he doesn't really want to. But, regardless, this book stands on its own merits, and is definitely a must read, even among Crichton's other works."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Michael Crichton chronicles the travels of Ibn Fadlan in the year 922AD as he travels with a band of twelve Viking warriors on a quest to save their homeland from the terrors that live in the mists. Fadlan is an Arab who's forced to accompany the Vikings as the 13th warrior (there must be 13 warriors to fulfill the quest and one must be a non-Northman). However, as an Arab he comes from a more civilized culture and this serves as a fine device to contrast his civilized ways with the barbarisim of the Northmen. However, by the end of the quest it is Fadlan who has changed.Like all Michael Crichton novels the characters are richly drawn. The story is written as if the author is translating Fadlan's manuscript and is complete with authentic sounding footnotes. I found this worked very well as a storytelling device. It leant great authenticity to the story, even though as Crichton explains in his endnotes, it is really an attempt to show that epic poems such as Beowulf really might have had an underlying basis in fact. But that doesn't mean that this story is boring. Far from it. It's an exciting tale and I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Crichton's simple but charming and action-packed retelling of Beowulf is a first-rate light read in many respects. The characters are well drawn, the more barbaric aspects of primitive life are not flinched from, and though some found them tedious I must admit that I enjoyed the 'scholarly' material in the introduction, footnotes, and appendix. The handling of the 'dragon' was a nice touch.The fault that prevents this book from getting five stars from me, though, is that the climax is rather underwritten. After all the difficulties, terrors, and carnage inflicted by the mist-monsters it seems that the final confrontation is over too quickly.Other than that, this is a fun little book."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I enjoyed the movie (13th Warrior) and wanted to see if the book was better (as these things usually are). In this case, my surprise when that wasn't true was a pleasant one. The book was as good as the movie, but different enough to make a unique experience.I particularly enjoyed some of the insights into both Viking and Arab lifestyles that wouldn't have fit the movie very well (too expository). All things considered, I enjoyed both just about equally, with just a slight edge to the book."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"First half of book - I find Michael Crichton's The 13th Warrior to be an informative and entertaining book. There are several features that make the book enjoyable. The first feature is the introduction. The introduction provides us with valuable information about the history of the story. We are provided with a brief listing of its translations as well as background information about the original author, Ibn Fadlan, and those whom he wrote about, the Northmen a.k.a. the Vikings. The second helpful feature is Crichton's use of footnotes. The footnotes help the reader to understand problematic vocabulary and also provide historical context. The third feature that strengthens the book is Crichton's careful editing of the Fraus-Dolus translation. Crichton tells us that he removed unnecessary or rambling lines from the text, and adapted the sentence structure to that of modern English. Such editing makes the story more easily understood and enjoyed. The final feature, which I think adds the most to the story, is the incredible storytelling of Ibn Fadlan. Fadlan does a concise yet complete job of portraying nearly every aspect of daily life in all of the cultures that he encounters. In addition, he compares and contrasts each culture to his own, in an effort to learn and appreciate as much as possible about those he interacts with. Fadlan describes people, places, and events in an unbiased, serious, and detailed tone which allows the reader to form his own opinion about the story. The introduction, the footnotes, Crichton's editing, and Fadlan's masterful storytelling make The 13th Warrior informative and engaging.Second half of book - I enjoyed the second half of The 13th Warrior. In this part of the book we learn more about the Northmen culture through Ibn Fadlan's discussions with his translator Herger. These discussions are particularly informative because Ibn compares his own culture with the Northmen culture, so the reader is able to get a real sense of exactly how Ibn felt. Ibn does an excellent job of dissecting the Northmen's way of life as he sees it. He puts the reader in the shoes of the Northmen as well as himself in various stages of the story so we view certain situations from several points of view. The one aspect of this book that I enjoy and appreciate the most is Ibn's relentless pursuit of unbiased and accurate reporting. Throughout the story he reminds the reader that he viewed events first hand (i.e. \\"I saw with my own eyes...\\"), and almost constantly uses the word \\"verily\\" which means \\"in truth\\" or \\"in fact.\\" It seems as if Ibn knows that his writings will be read and studied for many years to come. In conclusion, it comes as little surprise that Ibn's work has become so celebrated."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Michael Crichton did a superb job with this one. It has not only become my favorite, but it also has increased my awareness of how literature can influence other works. I am speaking of Crichton's use of Beowulf, of course. The addition of the Arab into Viking culture is an excellent way to retell the famous epic."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Several months ago one of my cyber-friends wrote a review on \\"The 13th Warrior\\" and invited me to see the movie. After reading the book it was based on, Michel Crichton's \\"Eaters of The Dead,\\" I watched the movie.The movie was a financial disaster, losing over 100 million at the box office; I enjoyed both the movie and the book.For the most part, the movie stuck to the text; however, as always, I would recommend reading the novel first. While Crichton markets the book as fiction, it is based on the 300 year old translations of, Ahmad Ibn Fadlan's 921 A.D. eyewitness account of his travels from Bagdad to Russia and contact with the Vikings.As a result of a dare, Crichton's set out to prove that epic poem, \\"Beowulf\\" was based on actual events. The plan was to strip away fiction from fact to get to the bottom of it. Realizing that had been exposed to Ibn Fadlan's documentation of Viking life and culture. Accordingly, he put together this scholarly yet interesting story from Ibn's viewpoint.On an emissary mission assigned him by a Muslim ruler of Bagdad, Ibn came upon a group of Warrior Vikings who king had passed away. While at their camp, a Nobel messenger from King Hrothgar relayed that the King was under attack from a beastly tribe of mist demons. A soothsayer (angel of death) set in motion the selection of 12 Viking Warriors and a foreigner as the rescuers. Conscripted, Ibn reluctantly joined the 12 Warriors, led by Buliwyf to do battle with the mysterious \\"Mist Monsters\\" against all odds in an attempt to save the Kingdom.While the movie, stars Antonio Banderas, who plays the part of Ibn Fadlan and Vladimir Kulich as Buliwyf and Omar Sharif with a small part as Melchisidek, Ibn's interpreter, I recommend that you read this short, 186-page action adventure prior to watching the movie.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This has to have been one of the stranger of Chrichton's books, but you have to give him credit, he sure does know how to write a compelling story. In this one, you're not really sure where the truth ends and the fantasy begins. The reason why Crichton is one of the best is because he makes you think that you're reading something that really happened, and that you were right there along for the ride."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"The intensive study he had done on the manuscript to have retold the story of Ibn Fadlan's journey astounds me even as I read the book a third time. Can't wait for the movie too.. I would give it 6 stars actually."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This book made quite interesting reading. After debating on whether or not to read it, I am glad I did. The book weaves a tale of mystery and suspense which makes it easy read. While reading this book, one asks themself, is this really a true story? The book is SUPPOSED to be based upon actual documents written in 922 A.D., somehow though Chrichton has made this story come alive with characters and suspense. He (Chrichton), provides footnotes explaining events throughout the book, one may find this too descriptive or difficult to follow while reading, but it helps the reader understand how the passages were interpreted from the document. A problem which a reader may have with this book, however, is the pronounciation of many characters throughtout the book. A short book, it should only take a serious reader a day or two to read."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I started this book around midnight and had to finish it that night. Crichton's continuation of an ancient manuscript is awesome. Before you start to read it be sure you have enough time to finish that day."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I also came upon this book by accident, and was very suprised I had never heard of it before. Although it is a short book, I enjoyed it tremedously. I have also read rising sun, travels and jurassic park by crichton. More and more I am finding Michael to be a great author/reasearcher. It seems that he often studies the subjects he writes about in depth, especially in this case. For some reason this book reminds me of some of lovecracft's short stories, its not only the arab source for the manuscript but also the monsters at the end. All in all if you have a little imagination and enjoy fantasy type books you will like this. IMHO I think that women would not like this book as much as men might, unless you are into the graphic violence and promiscuity of the viking women. If anyone knows any other books in this vein that they enjoyed please email me. I am reading travels now and enjoying it very much."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Normally, it takes me a month to read a novel. But I couldn't put down Mr. Crichton's superb novel. Ibn Fadlan gives a very good first-person perspective and the Northmen as we modern people would see them: crude, willing, traditional. Awesome. I highly recommend it for anyone over the age of 12. Just awesome."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Micheal Crichton spins a web of intrigue as he relates the tale of Ibn Fadian. Ibn Fadian, on a mission from Bagdad, becomes much invovled with the Northmen people. Ibn finds himself becoming and believing in the Northmen customs eventhough his first experiences were horried of the Northmen. I found this book to be very readable and an intresting book as well. Unlike some books that I have read that caused me to dose off, Eaters of the Dead kept me a wake with all the action. Crichton uses great detail in composing the characters thoughts and feelings, giving you a vivid picture of what's going on. Don't let the title miss lead you, although there is violance and some gore the whole book is not. So if you want to read a 200 page book with plenty of action Eaters of the Dead by Micheal Crichtons should be a top your list."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I came upon this book by accident.

She knew I was Arab and asked me:\\"what you think of Eaters of the Dead,\\" I shacked my head showing no acquaintance of the writer or the book. She was amazed, larter in the same week, gave me a copy. I bought eight copies since that time and sent to all my friends and still keeping two different prints of them.I read some lines from the Arabic manuscripts and got to conclusion that the researcher and writer did his homework, well, in understanding how Arab Muslims were thinking at that time.I read many books dated to that time and before the time of Ibn Fadlan, in Arabic, and understand how the Muslim scholars, researchers, and explorers were thinking at that time. Michael Crichton depicted that in the most naked and elegant manner.We look up to our scholars of that time, many of them served humanity in preserving, conveying, and developing knowledge of past glorious civilizations from east and west. They were courageous and hard working researchers. They love knowledge and would sacrifice their own lives to serve it.In my opinion, I do not think of this story as a factious one, as many would think. I read many books describing historical events and stories, proved true by many sources, written in the same manner in Arabic language. At the end, every one has the right to think whatever s/he wishes.The story is knitted in a very lovely manner and can be reproduced in Arabic again from the English version, betting, it will be so smooth to Arab reader he will not notice it was translated from a foreign language. The Arabic language is so sensitive and delicate; still felt I was reading an Arabic book written by profound Arab historian and researcher.America enjoy this writer's, or let's say researcher's, ingenuity. Crichton's hard work and dedication produced a very sweet fruit, from which the original plant was nourished very complicated, very distinct, and different language and culture, in the \\"meals on wheels\\" form. Congratulations to you all this wonderful work. ..."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"JimmyPCC EnglishPeriod 3In &quot;Eaters of the Dead,&quot; by Michael Crichton, there were many interesting events.The book starts by having a representative for the Caliph of Bagdad comes and observesthe Vikings in Scandinavia. The representative name is Ahmad ibn-Fadlan and this story isbase on what he wrote in his journal about the northsmen. Ahmad goes into a Vikingcamp where there leader has just died and his predecessor Buliwyf decide to allow Ahmadto stay and observe. Then something happens and the king Rothgar send his son to tellBuliwyf that he is needed if the far country. Ahmad is chosen as one of the thirteenwarriors that will travel to this far of land and fight. Once in the land of Rothgar, Buliwyfand his men are treated to a feast, but then that night the mist rolls in and the eaters of thedead attack Rothgars hall where Buliwyf and his men detour there attack. A while laterBuliwyf decides to go and attack the eaters of the dead but find that they have left therehomes to go to the thunder caves. This is were Buliwyf and his men defeat the eater of thedead once and for all.Michael Crichton does a lot of things well in this book, such as the way he is ableto have a story going on and add facts about the Vikings custom and ways of life. Thiswas very interesting because you were getting more than just a story out of it, you gainknowledge. Having more knowledge about how Vikings live helps to build to the themebuy knowing what they were afraid of or what they valued. Because this story is base ona journal of a man, it is very will done in the fact that it never starts to be like a researchbook. a thing that could have been better were the foot notes. These often were long andconfusing by the time you were finished reading it you forgot what you had read. Theauthor could have shorten them up and made them more straight forward. The theme isclear, it is to learn more about the Vikings and not to look at them as barbarians but asdifferent kinds of people. This is shown at the end of the book when Ahmad is saddenedwhen leaving the Vikings and, instead of calling them uncivilized as he does in thebegining of the book, he realizes that they are as civilized as the Arabs, if not more.Overall this book had a very clear theme and every thing related to that."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"An easy read that kept me on the edge of my seat.

I finished the book just out of principle but I think this one is overrated.The premise takes quite a while to get under way and the characters are very comic bookish.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I wasn't really involved with the story. Didn't grab me, the style was interesting but not nearly enough."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Michael Crichton has penned an excellent rapid-paced adventure. Based on the actual diary of an Arab man traveling with the Vikings, it is sometimes difficult to believe this is a true account and not just pure fiction. Eaters of the Dead is the epic journey of one man who strives to find himself and his place in his world. The main character is richly described. His emotions and internal conflicts are laid before the reader as he witnesses the horrible habits and rituals of his foreign companions. The settings are depicted so finely, you can almost taste the darkness and smell the smoke. What is most compelling about Eaters of the Dead is how the author shows every defining moment with such clarity. All in all, a great, solid story that needs to be slowly savored! A must read!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I read this novel a long time ago (it was first published in 1976) and reread it after watching 'The Thirteenth Warrior' in 2003.Michael Crichton says he wrote it on a bet that he could make an entertaining story out of 'Beowulf'. From my perspective, he has certainly written a book that will be more accessible to most modern readers than 'Beowulf'. The assessment of entertainment value is best left to the individual reader: I am one who enjoyed it immensely.The book is set in A.D. 922. A refined Arab courtier, representative of the powerful Caliph of Bagdad, encounters a party of Viking warriors who are journeying to the barbaric North. He is asked to travel with them ...This is probably not a novel for the faint of heart or for those rendered queasy by bloodthirsty description. On the other hand, it's a good read and different in many ways from some of Dr Crichton's later work.Recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"When I saw \\"The 13th Warrior\\" is the theater, I was struck by the number of similarities it had to Beowulf. I didn't realize until a few years later that was the point of the movie. Nor did I realize then it was based on a novel by Michael Crichton.The movie and the story work well together in a simple format. An Arab courtier, after a dalliance with a married woman, is \\"promoted\\" to ambassador and sent on a doomed mission. On the way, his band encounters a band of Viking warriors. He is conscripted to journey to their homeland to fight an ancient evil, monsters in the mists. Along the way he notices the great cultural differences between himself and the Northmen. His records of the sexual prowress and daily hygine definitely stay with the reader.Despite the artful telling of the story and the true writings of Ibn Fadlan that are used as a foundation, it still can't compare to the rustic beauty of the original Beowulf poem. Nothing against a great writer like Crichton, but there are some things just best left as they are."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Michael Crichton makes use of a real man, Ibn Fadlan, who actually traveled into the heart of the Viking world in 922 AD, and from this source, he fashions a re-invention of the Beowulf legend. Taking up his modern story where the tenth-century Iraqi left his off, Creighton moves us northward across Viking-controlled Russia into a Scandinavian kingdom beset by attacks from man-like beast-monsters who rise with the night to raid homes, settlements, even fortresses, to slay any who oppose them and carry off children to a sinister demise. Fadlan become part of a band of thirteen warriors who answer the besieged kingdom's cries for help, and he and his comrades boldly investigate just who or what their foes are and how they may be stopped.(SPOILER ALERT)The so-called monsters these Dark Age humans of Denmark face are actually nothing less than the last remnant of Neanderthals, who have survived in this northern land in the shadowy forests and caves, shunning the numerically superior humans, but keeping their ancient cultural practices alive. On this, their last ground, the Neanderthal clans raid the human settlers and respond with savage violence to their incursions onto their hunting lands. Fadlan and his Viking allies meet these Neanderthals head-on and even venture down into the depths of their underworld kingdom, on a mission to kill their holy queen and destabilize the foundations of their foes' society.In this extraordinary novel there is bravery, an in-depth investigation of Viking values, culture and life, as well as depictions of combat as it was in that long-ago time. This book is no mere adventure, it is a thinking person's journey into the past, which it explores with an exhaustive, sociological thoroughness. After reading this thrilling tale, one comes away knowing much more about the Norse, the Arab view on \\"barbarian\\" Europe, and we are given Beowulf with a new slant. All in all a pretty darn good return on a six-dollar paperback."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Michael Crichton has written many good books like Jurassic Park, and The Lost World. He has written many good novels. He is also considered one of the best writers of our time.The book Eaters of the Dead is about a man of Arab decent who is sent away from his country as an ambassador to the North. On his journey he gets caught up with a group of Vikings that take him on a trip with them to the country far to the North to help another group of Vikings that are having a problem with an ancient myth. The myth is of a group of animals who eat the dead. This book tells of the hardships the group of men goes through to fight this evil myth.This book is really good, and follows very well which makes it easy to read. I would recommend that you should read the book. It is not very long and you will get through it fast."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I have read quite a few of Micheal Crichton's books and this is by far the worst. The whole book was written in an utterly boring fashion. But the real disappointment was how he handled the Beowulf story(which the book is spin off of) He took a great story and turned it into a semi-descent story adding at least three hundred pages too it all. considering that half the charcters where already made and he had the potential for a great plot the whole thing sucked. I would suggest finding a translation of the original instead."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Ingenious idea to write Beowulf from an outsider/foreign point of view. Crichton starts off strong with wonderful tense and regurgitative viewpoints that can only be describes as &quot;short&quot; and &quot;journalistic&quot;. The style is strange yet highly interesting. And then the style changes abrubtly. It's no coincidence that the first 3 chapters were paraphrased from the acutal Ibn Fadlan manuscritps and the remainder of the novel is Crichton's attempt to copy that style. Although he proceeds with the story at a furious pace, it seems to get lost in his attempt at &quot;faking&quot; this ancient prose. Like I said before, nice try....falls short of good. If you want to read something magical, based in history(?), read Beowulf and wonder at the magic of orginality, not originality trying to duplicate magic."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This is a fast paced, action driven novel that doesn't allow the reader to stop until the very end. Written (according to Michael Crichton) on a dare from a colleauge to modernize and make exciting the tale of Beowulf, the classic epic poem that apparently is difficult for some college students to understand. An arab, somewhat exiled from Bagdhad (sexual indescretion to blame) into the mysterious North Lands, home of the Vikings. In the novel this man communicates with these Norsemen through a translator and a member of the Viking group who speaks some Latin. In the horrible movie (which I awaited with high expectations) Ibn (the arab protagonist) needs no translator since he can learn the Viking dialect simply by watching and listening to the Viking's around a campfire! The movie is laughable at best, which is strange because the novel is perfect for film. The novel is much more informative, but not, as many of the various editions of this novel have touted, a true story. The action and story are entirely speculative, entirely fiction. But the fantastic quest and fights between the grendel is some of Crichton's most entertaining writing ever. This is more of a short fantasy novel. But fun reading nonetheless. For Crichton fans and fiction fans in general don't miss this book, but whatever you do don't see the movie!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This is the second Crichton novel I have ever read. I think Crichton has a good ability to find new ideas and explore them in fiction. In the early 1990's, it was genetic engineering (Jurassic Park), in &quot;Timeline&quot; it was the possibilities offered by quantum computing (I haven't heard/read anything else about this though).As other reviewers note, this novel is based on a fragmented manuscript relating the doings of an Arab who travels with and fights with Vikings in Scandinavia around the early 10th century AD. Crichton obviously did his research, as he usually does, which is evidenced by explanatory footnotes, a list of the sources he consulted and so on.As Crichton says in, &quot;A Factual Note on Eaters of the Dead,&quot; he originally set out to find out if &quot;Beowulf&quot; had any basis in historical fact, as Heinrich Schliemann did for &quot;The Iliad&quot; in the 19th century. However, the task proved too difficult. So, he decided to write a novel instead. The idea of having a foreign observer to provide a unique (hopefully objective) perspective is a good one. The discussion the Vikings have over Fadlan's monotheism is amusing, as is his interaction with the polytheistic beliefs of the Vikings.The novel has the tone of an official report, where the observer simply records the events that happen around him. There are no embellishments or flourishes. This can make the text tough going; there is little to keep the reader interested in the story. I wish Crichton had been freer in his style rather than writing what is best described as a fictional historical document.The most interesting parts of the novel were the notes, appendixes and Introduction. For example, Crichton writes in his appendixes that there is some discussion over whether the \\"eaters of the dead\\" (the \\"monsters\\" of the novel) are in fact Neanderthals. In the appendixes, Crichton says, \\"While I was writing, I felt that I was drawing the line between fact and diction clearly.... But within a few years, I could no longer be certain which passages were real, and which were made up.\\" (page 198) He ends his comment by briefly discussing post modernism, \\"I mention this because the tendency to blur the boundary between fact and fiction has become widespread in modern society... But this attitude of \`post-modern' scholars represents a more fundamental change. Some in academic life now argue seriously that there is no difference between fact and fiction, that all ways of reading text are arbitrary and personal, and that pure invention is as valid as hard research.\\" (page 198) He calls this trend, \\"... at worst, it is nasty and dangerous.\\" It is obvious that such relativism is clearly false, but this is not an appropriate place to criticize such an idea (see my review of \\"Relativism: Feet planted firmly in mid-air\\" by Gregory Koukl and Francis Beckwith).I have not yet seen the film adaptation of this novel and I'm not sure if I will or not. Clearly, the slow, report-like format of the novel could not be successfully reproduced on film. I fear that the \\"13th warrior\\" (the title of the film adaptation of this novel) is simply an action film with monsters and Vikings..."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I found Eatrs of the Dead to be a good read, but it didn't take me long to realize that the author was just retelling Beowulf &amp; changing a few of the characters. The only differences, except for the Arab, were the # of warriors, making the king's jester into a prince, turning the cave-troll Grendel into the cavemen Vendel, &amp; including the fire wirm as a Vendel attack. That shows that he got the main plot from Beowulf. What was the point of its inclusion. It was still a good read, but the fact that it wasn't an original story line kept me from giving it more than 3 stars."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Eaters of the Dead is something a little different from Crichton and if you don't like what he does here, at least it is a short book and won't waste much of your time. I am one of the ones that didn't enjoy it as much. My reason is simple and pathetic: I do not like this sort of writing style. It reminds me of authors like Charles Dickens. I have attempted and failed to read several Dickens novels and I usually end up hating any book that reminds me of him even if the writing isn't much like his. The presentation of the novel is very well-done though and makes it seem more real. It also reminded me a bit of Congo because it involves \\"dark hairy brutes.\\"In short, Eaters of the Dead gained my respect and not much else but it was still fun to read in some parts and it wasn't overly long."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This book reads well but leaves you alittle short in parts. This is the book 13th Warrior was based on worth the read in any rate"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Ibn Fadlan is a diplomat, not a warrior. His mission was to represent his people and make contact with other civilizations on their behalf. But it became so much more.Fadlan finds himself among the Northmen (aka, the Vikings), a rustic group of behemoths whose customs and way of life are as repulsive as they are odd. But, far away, their people have become plagued by a violent horde of barbarians whose behavior transcends humanity. So, twelve of the brave Northmen warriors are selected to journey to the besieged village and relieve them of this demonic threat. To Fadlan's surprise, he is also chosen. He becomes the 13th warrior and, despite his objections, joins the men on their journey.When they arrive, the greeting is robust even though some look at them with suspicion and this plays out as an inner conflict amidst the villagers and their leaders despite the looming threat from the barbarians. Then, the mist arrives, and so does the first attack. Most of the warriors survive, some with physical scars, others with mental ones. They endure a second attack and when their numbers continue to dwindle it becomes clear that an offensive strike is necessary. Fadlan's own words describe the showdown in a way that would challenge today's most proficient adventure writers.I can't deny the historical intrigue of this book, taken from the actual journal writings of Fadlan himself. Michael Crichton's best talents are his in-depth research of his topic and his ability to know when to step back and allow the story to tell itself. This book is where both talents shine. This is Fadlan's story in his own words and Crichton does a masterful job of guiding the reader by interjecting timely footnotes along the way. In fact, the story was so good it became a major motion picture that, in all honesty, didn't do the book justice. Even though violent conflict played a major role in the tale, the narrative was not dominated with its descriptions. Instead, more time was devoted to the mystique of the Northmen, the vast cultural differences between them and the narrator and the underlying dynamic that drove the conflict in which they found themselves immersed. It was a refreshing reprieve from today's typical explosions-and-death action/adventure tale.Crichton is one of this generation's best, and Eaters of the Dead is one of his top-shelf works."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"When I started reading this I only had the vaguest inclination of what the Beowulf story really was. It had everything I'd want in a story, strange characters, interesting plot, and it evoked such emotions as excitement, dread, and repulsion. I found this translation particularly interesting though because of the footnotes. The entire thing is riddled with footnotes explaining possible variations of words, different explanations and theories, etc.I think the best part of the entire story was the most unintentional aspect of it, the fact the last sentence ends after three words leaving the reader to wonder. That all being said I'd only recommend it to people with the iron stomachs needed to deal with the brutality of the ancient world as well as an inquisitive mind."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"EATERS OF THE DEAD is an excellent book about vikings and were they went to get weapons and resources.I think anyone looking for a great book about vikings should read this book by Michael Crichton.I liked this book because it was an action packed book full of excitement"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I enjoyed the movie - not a great movie - but entertaining.I like to listen to audio books at the gym and thought this would be fun.I was sadly disappointed.Many of the first tracks was irrelevant and tedious, and discussed the authenticity of the original manuscript and copies.

It was more of a lecture than an enjoyable experience. After 30 minutes of fast forwarding and skipping I put it aside. I think it's unlikely I will resume listening to it, and will keep it for an emergency on my MP3 player. I may try it again, but I'll probably end up deleting it.Good thing it was a library copy and I didn't pay for it."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"First, and I think you'll agree, Mr. Crichton has a mesmerizing way of pulling you into a story and making it so believable that only later will you say, &quot;Was that non-fiction?&quot; The skillful way he will construct quasi-factual sources is often done very well (e.g., *Andromeda Strain's*&quot; &quot;Project Scoop&quot; papers, cited in the Bibliography).HOWEVER, this can be overdone. When the author gets so wrapped up in carefully crafting background to &quot;cite,&quot; he will sometimes cross the line into the absurd (not to mention the confusing; some of us DO read non-fiction too). Mr. Crichton has done it this time.Exhibit A: the footnotes. I admit, it started out impressively. However, after a couple of half-page footnotes, and some that included Arabic characters, it hits you that this is neither fun fiction nor believable reference. It's something else... *cue Psycho music*Exhibit B: Mr. Crichton's own words in the appendix/whatever that was at the end. He admits himself that upon re-reading, he couldn't remember what he'd based on reality and what was fiction he'd made up. Sometimes that's fun. Not this time.Exhibit C: the interest in sex, the uneven descriptions that vacillate between &quot;translation-esque Middle English&quot; and modern concepts, and discussion of modern thinking (including stereotypes). It doesn't play well.Synopsis: this is a Beowulf-meets-Piers Anthony semi-fantasy sword-and-sorcery-and-perversion epic work... of mediocrity. Sorry, Mr. Crichton; I love your other novels (except for *Lost World*). =^)"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This was one the worst books I have ever read.

Having formal training in the sciences, I found his writing very intriguing...there were no other authors at the time blending popular fiction with the sciences. In later years Crichton went commercial with Disclosure, Congo, Rising Sun, etc. In my opinion his early works carried a higher quality. He was honing his craft then even with the Andromeda Strain, his first screenplay. The Eaters of the Dead has haunted me, to a small degree, over the past 20 years. But, since the fossil record clearly demonstrates the disappearance of Neanderthan and Cro-Magnon long before the 10th century AD, this story is obviously purely fiction. My bet is that Crichton himself chuckles when he thinks of his craftiness in spinning such a yarn. Taken in this, I think the true spirit, of the piece, it is a good read."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Eaters of the Dead shares Crichton's imaginative powers with other excellent novels such as &quot;The Andromeda Strain,&quot; &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; and &quot;The Lost World.&quot; However, written as an historic manuscript, Crichton locks himself into a necessarily slower-paced work. While at times this means that the reader is absolutely convinced that Crichton is dealing with a true historical work, leaving the reader disturbed and questioning what he or she has long assumed, at other times it means that action sequences cannot be written as the fast-paced thrill-packed scenes that we became familiar with in Crichton's other works; rather, the manuscript-approach to this novel means that all of it -- including the action sequences -- must be written as a report, a kind of re-telling of the story. For fans of Crichton's work, this book is certainly recommended; however, for those new to or unfamiliar with his other books, this would not seem to be a good starting point. Nonetheless, I was still left with a certain quantity of chills at the end of the book..."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"great history book.

Michael Crichton uses this time period to essentially retell the story of BEOWULF, which he felt was too boring and tedious for modern audiences. The story involves a small band of Vikings that journey northward to attack a group of monsters (whose true identity is revealed at the end of the book).This book is actually pretty interesting, but it's told in rather dry, old-fashioned prose. None of the characters really come to life -- the book reads more like an academic text than a real novel. There is a lot of historical detail in EATERS OF THE DEAD that has little to do with the story, but gives the reader some insight into the realities of life in the tenth century. If this sounds appealing to you, then this book may be worth purchasing.An enjoyable book, but definitely not Crichton's best. I recommend SPHERE instead."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"As I understand it, Crichton essentially wrote this on something of a dare: Could he re-write the Beowulf saga and make it work for modern readers?To do so, he inserts an unusal element: Ibn Fadlan. Faslan is a Muslim, who is sent on a mission to the King of Saqaliba (and not by choice, he has essentially been forced on the journey). He eventually meets a group of Scandanavians who he considers to be truuly barbaric (guess that's why they call them &quot;barbarians). For Fadlan, his new traveling companions are disgusting and horrific, but the leader of the group, Buliwyf (&quot;Beowulf&quot;), who can communicate in Latin, likes Fadlan and Buliwyf sort of adopts Fadlan, sort of like a puppy dog (probably much to Fadlan's chagrin).Fadlan then finds himself enmeshed in a journey to Scandinavia to save Buliwyf's people from the &quot;monsters of the mist.&quot; Ibn Fadlan travels north with Buliwyf and soon finds himself facing seemingly near invincible enemies who curiously always gather their dead and take them with them after a battle.This was an extremely clever take on the Beowulf legend, subtlely telling a tale that could literally have been the basis for the Beowulf saga had it actually occurred. As with many of Crichton's best works, its engrossing reading, though not necessarily great literature.As the story progresses, the Scandavians characters prove to be far less one-dimensional then they originally appeared and Fadlan gets a lesson in understanding other cultures. The explanation for what the &quot;monsters of the mist&quot; are is also a clever twist and, oddly, a believeable one.Unfortunately, the title of the book (it describes one of the more problematic habits of the monsters of the mist) probably kept more than a few readers away when this was first published, and I'm not even sure it was ever published in hardback as I've searched and never been able to find it in hardback format. The film version actually had a more enticing title: &quot;The Thirteenth Warrior.&quot;Despite the title, this is Crichton in top form and a very engrossing read."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I was intrigued when I heard that this was a true story, of sorts. After reading about it, I realized that the story is based on fact, which made it even more incredible. This is by far Chrichton's best book. It's a terrific story that's set within the pages of a diary. I read the book before the movie, but was surprised by how well the movie translated the story. It's intriguing to read this story because it feels so real. Ibn Fadlan is terrific character with a great and compelling story. I've never seen anything quite like this, and it proves that Chrichton is a very good writer, despite such menial storied as Airframe and Congo. The writing is great the ending is mysterious. It is a true work of art."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"One of the best books i ever read along my life, this book was given to me by my father when i was 13 years old, you know when you're a kid you have a more spicy imagination and when i read it i saw all the images of IBN, BULWYF and the rest clear crystal and wonder why nobody did a movie about the book...but there's the movie with Banderas, not so exciting as the book but fair enough to get the glimpse of what i read 17 years ago."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"The 13th Warrior is a fascinating book to read. It's an entertaining piece of fiction. The fact that Ibn Fadlan learns and adapts to the ways of the Northmen is very interesting. Reading this book, you get a clear perspective of the Viking culture and customs. This book portrays Vikings as being much more civilized from what everyone reads about in the history books. This story gives such a detailed description of the battles that Ibn and the rest of the warriors fought.

I've read almost all of his novels, but saved this one for last because it was hard for me to find. I enjoyed the novel, but that was mainly because of my interest in Viking culture (I studied it a bit in college and am one of the few people out there who actually enjoys reading \\"Beowulf\\"). Had I not been a fan, I think I would have been a bit put off by this novel. It is very different from his other works for several reasons. First of all, it's not based on technology and/or modern science. Anyone who has read his later works know that he tends to focus on technology and society in some way, shape, or form, but this novel is centered on a past society. Secondly, as it is partially based on a historical document (along with \\"Beowulf\\"), it is not as fast paced as his other novels. It is full of action, but the read is a bit slower than some of his others.All-in-all, I would suggest this book to anyone who enjoys a more historical or fantasy type of novel or Crichton enthusiasts. If you've NEVER read a Crichton book, don't base your opinion on his style of writing with this novel."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"a first hand account. Thats the best you can get.

If you havent seen the movie its called the thirteenth warrior and was the first dvd I ever owned and had to repace it do to over use"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Crichton's work was based on an original in CE 922, when Arab courtier Ibn Fadlan accompanies a troupe of Vikings to find and destroy mythical beasts ravaging some land. These are the eaters of the dead from which Crichton gets his title. Ibn Fadlan was appointed by the Caliph of Baghdad to the pagan Northmen of Northern Europe.Ibn Fadlan's account has been preserved in translated segments in other writers and one fairly complete Medieval Latin version. Crichton has used a compilation by a Swedish scholar in 1951, drawing together in one volume a translation of all the references and manuscripts of Ibn Fadlan's report to his Caliph after a three-year adventure with the Vikings.Ibn Fadlan's report seemed to Crichton to be a real-life basis for the Danish story of Beowulf. Crichton takes this view in developing his story, written in modern narrative style based on Ibn Fadlan's story.In the early stages of the story, we are treated to a detailed description of the people and events along the long trek from Baghdad to the far north. This is Fadlan's actual text, describing his arduous trip to the far north, where he and his large entourage are heading to the land of the Volga River Bulgars, actually a northern Viking tribe.Crichton presents a segment of Fadlan's manuscript, commenting as though he is an academic editor interpreting the text for modern readers. In this guise, Crichton provides historical and cultural background information, some of which is also part of his imaginative creation.Crichton fills in as needed with historical or textual critical commentary, and this fictionalizing fills in the story interpretation as we go. The core of the story here is Fadlan's narrative report.Star vocal performer George Guidall has been chosen to present this historical action thriller from Crichton. This Crichton story was also made into a movie called the 13th Warrior, starring Antonio Banderas. This Banderas portrayal brings even greater realism to the Crichton creation.After what Crichton describes in his afterword as the first two parts of Fadlan's manuscript, Crichton takes over the story. The author develops the fictional portion of his story along the same lines of Ibn Fadlan's original travelogue, providing detailed observations of people and places, customs and practices, and maintains a realistic dialogue much like that of the earlier two sections he actually takes from Fadlan's manuscript.This fiction has us appreciating Fadlan's often incidental observations that sweeten the story and add realism, without realizing we are now all the time fully inside Crichton's fantasy world. We have stepped seamlessly through a portal into another dimension where the story grows to full flower!Crichton as Fadlan now pulls us along with the Viking troupe and includes us in the adventure and excitement and fear experienced by Fadlan and the Vikings as they encounter not just one but a clan of these man-like monsters that are terrorizing the people.The story of Beowulf takes on new life, true to the Danish version of the story but set here within its wider cultural and historical setting. This will be an entertaining tale, and the vocal performance of the story enabled me to \\"see\\" all the action as George Guidall's voice brought this Crichton adventure to life.Crichton's extensive afterword is a welcome bonus, providing insights into his initial challenge to develop this story, out of an academic exchange with a professor of Western literature. It is intriguing to learn the steps Crichton went through to develop his strategy in implementing his story.He follows an academic commentary and footnoting format, taken to convincingly draw upon Fadlan's original real-life story. His strategy toward this historical legend is so convincing that, years later, as he himself experienced, he was caught running down references for sources that he finally realized he had made up! You will like this adventure thriller and might like Crichton's afterword just as much!This creative new approach brings us Beowulf with a new cultural perspective of the Arab adventurer."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I have to say this is probably my most favourite book. It is entertaining, interesting, funny and full of adventure."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Michael Crichton started with the barebones of a 10th Century manuscript and created a fascinating story. He borrowed elements of Beowulf, the Seven Samurai warriors (Magnificent Seven)and evolving anthropology/genetic science in his story. In the introduction he tells us how he came to write the book on a dare by a friend, and elaborates on his research. I found all of this as interesting as the story itself.The movie The 13th Warrior was poorly reviewed and poorly received by viewers, but the book despite the gruesome title is worth the read...but be prepared for the randy lifestyle of the Northmen.Other reviewers have summarized the story itself. What we rarely get to learn is how well known writers come to create the stories they do. This book enlightens."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Michael Crichton has created his best premise ever in this historical novel. The true-to-life manuscript of an Arab traveling to Viking territory a thousand years ago is just the scaffolding. The Arab is a device, showing us through his modern eyes just how strange, and also how compelling, Viking mores were to a civilized European. But that's just the means into the real story.The payoff is the second half of the story. Crichton imagines the meeting, in fairly recent historical time, between Homo Sapiens and the last enclave of surviving Neaderthals. Anthropologists can't locate any Neanderthal remains later than 22,000 years ago, but it's possible that Neanderthals still lived in remote corners of the world into historical times. What would a meeting between us and them have seemed to us?Like all of Crichton's books, the premise is better than the execution. But the tale is good enough to win me over completely."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"\\"Eaters of the Dead\\" is an interesting novel. It reads like a journal that was written in 922 A.D. by a man named Ahmad Ibn Fadlan during his mission to send a message to the King of Saqaliba. Fadlan writes about the many places and cultures he visits on his long journey, which are clearly different than his homeland of Baghdad. This part of the story is kind of interesting to read at first, but it moves rather slowly and after awhile it becomes kind of boring for most people to read. At one point, though, Fadlan meets a group of vikings and ends up being forced to join them as they embark upon a dangerous and mysterious mission. This is when the plot begins to pick up and the story becomes more riveting and entertaining. From here on out, there's a lot of suspense and action as Fadlan and the vikings help protect a local tribe from these cannibalistic people who act more like wild animals than human beings.Part of what makes this book unique is that it feels like you're reading an ancient true story with some fantasized elements sewn in throughout the second half. It seemed like Crichton had the right idea in order to make this a great book in a really unique and entertaining way, but he didn't have all the right pieces in place to make it work. It is a well written book, but for most of it the pacing is real slow and the plot and character development are kind of weak.Basically the story seems like a long and extended prologue up to the scene in which Fadlan joins the vikings in their quest. That's where the story becomes more interesting and engaging for the readers. Overall, \\"Eaters of the Dead\\" isn't one of Crichton's best novels, but it can still be respected for the approach he used, which, in some aspects, he did pull off successfully. Some will enjoy it more than others because of their taste in genre, but I don't think most people will feel disappointed in reading this short book because of the high quality of Crichton's writing. I think 3.5 stars is a more accurate rating for it, but since that wasn't an option I rounded down because of the book's slow start, which is its biggest weakness and could make some people lose interest."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Faldan's manuscript, well-known to scholars, provides one of the earliest eyewitness accounts of Viking life and culture, in C.E. 922 - too late in history to serve as the basis for Beowulf, which many authorities believe was composed a hundred and fifty years earlier.However, Michael Crichton's book provides an exciting combination of the two sources, even if he does do quite a bit of embellishing, but we could expect nothing less from the novelist. Anyone would enjoy this story about a Viking chieftain defending his country from the monsters in the mist."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"but far too short! first, let me tell you this : this is a work of *fiction*. it's based on a real manuscript (very obscure) but it was written as a story with many elements from the poem beowulf. it can be very confusing because the line between the fiction and the history was blurred that even crichton himself admits that he himself had been mislead by his own work (read his comments at the back of the book) when he tried to find a nonexistent reference. i myself at first thought this was a purely historical document and i was quite surprised when i read that he actually made most of the story up with a heavy influence of beowulf. the story is about ibn fadlan, who was sent to bulgaria as an ambassador of sorts by the caliph of baghdad. he never reach his destination as he was somewhat forced to follow the vikings he was staying with to a mission that requires the 13th man to be a foreigner. the crazy thing is he wasn't even a warrior! so off he went with these barbarics to the land of king hrothgar( i think) to face these unknown creatures which the viking feared so much. there are a lot of gory scenes and quite a lot of action and you can actually imagine yourself there at the battle field. ibn fadlan's narration is excellent as he gives no bull about his companions' very barbaric ways and it is a clear contrast from what he's used to. however it is apparent that he also respect the vikings for some of their notions on the way of life.i think that this is a good book that may get people interested in more history-based writings. it certainly managed to get my attention."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"To my great suprise I really loved this book. The earlier books of Crichton suck compared to this. People who think that Jurrassic park is better than this book have not red it very well. The historical aspect learns us lots of stuf about earlier times. Being an archaeologist it kept me reading till it was finished"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This modern retelling of the Beowulf saga is not the techno-thriller that we have come to expect from Chrichton, but instead will appeal to persons interested in historical fiction and especially in Norse mythos. If you are expecting to read another installment of Chrichton and assuming that this book will be of the same genre, then perhaps this is not the book that you should choose. However, if you are looking for a good bit of historical fiction then this book presents a very engaging story. The book allows views into both the Islamic and Norse worlds during the Middle Ages and should offer something to learn of these cultures for nearly everyone. The storyline is that of the classic Beowulf saga, where an Islamic diplomat travels to the Norse world and partakes of the adventures of a band of Norse warriors. The story is fast paced, and full of action and suspense, and easy to read. I had difficulty putting this book down (even in the car), and would recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I think that the confusion with this book arises from the fact that people don't understand what Crichton accomplished. This is a retelling of Beowulf, in a first person, narrative, entertaining form.The narrator, Ibn Fadlan, is an actual Muslim writer from the 10th century. The first 3 chapters of this book are actually from his original narrative. Crichton then moves from there in to the fictional portion, using Fadlan as a first hand observer of the events surrounding the Beowulf story.Considering how dreadful Beowulf was (admittedly mainly due to barriers of time, language and perception of what is entertaining), Crichton has accomplished a very difficult task. He has rewritten a very long, very boring epic and made it concise, easy to digest and entertaining.I hated Beowulf; I found it to be dreadful, boring and longwinded.This is a wonderful retelling of the story. I highly recommend that any lover of historical fiction read this book.If you are a fan of Crichton's more mainstream work (i.e. Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain, etc.) you may want to read a few more reviews and see if you can find a snippet of this story online as it is completely different from his other works. The closest novel of Crichton's that I could compare this to would be Timeline and even that is a stretch because Timeline involved Sci-Fi type elements where this is strictly a narrative from the 10th century.I heartily enjoyed this and was only put off by the ending which just ended. Seriously, be prepared because there is no ending. The book just stops and moves on with an appendix, a historical note and a bibliography. That was a bit annoying. I don't remember if Beowulf did the same.Still, very well done, very entertaining and very good historical fiction."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"As an Arab who is quite intersted in Norse mythology and the Vikings, this book was na amzing read. Crichton weaved the tale of fact and fiction to a threadline. This is the first time I read a book that does not criticize Islamic methods and views, but portrays them respectfully and candidly to the reader.This book is a must read for all Crichton fans and those who want to read a story written intelligently."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"EI am a Michael Crichton fan, I read all his stories I can get. However I do run into some I have trouble enjoying and I quit reading until I get over my rejection. \\"Eaters of the Dead\\" almost falls into this category. I had expected more from it, not a fact simulating blitz written in almost a diarist style, a journal kept by an observer who bcomes a participant later in time on a quest with his quasi-captors, a group of norsemen or vikings, and the writer is a muslim before the notion of equating territorial extends to nations. Religion is not a factor in the story although mention is made of the differing beliefs between the norsemen and the Arab. The differing beliefs is used as a filler to explain the differing behaviors between the Arab and the vikings, they way they enjoy life, and death.Crichton explains why he uses the style he does in writing this book. It certainly is far from his normal manner and I find it hard to believe he could do it, and pull it off so handsomely. While I was reading the book I forgot who the author was, I fell into the story as an actual journal and the signing of the entries (my term for the style) was a distraction that makes me downgrade my approval rating. Also the title, \\"Eaters Of The Dead\\" did not seem to me to be appropriate, what was the relevance? There were other instances, such as why did the vikings fear the mists? Why fear the (supposed, maybe) Neanderthals? I saw no reason for any fear, they were just another enemy, nothing supernatural nor magical to create fear. Cannibals, or even carnivorous, yes, but fearsome? No way. And eating the dead? We eat dead cattle, pigs, poultry, fish, etc.; we do not living things, not even living plants as a general rule. Crichton is dead, I can get no answer maybe some reader can supply one. And the old crone, the \\"wendol\\"? Meaningful to the eaters of the dead, but why? Questions, no answers. Not a good read."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This story is written as though it were a manuscript by Ibn Fadlan, an Arab sent by his Caliph as an ambassador to the Bulgars in 921 A.D. He ends up unwittingly recruited as one of 13 warriors headed to help the vikings of the far north. What they find there, however, is far worse that what he had set out for.I was fascinated by his account of the life of a viking. Namely their crudeness, uncleanliness, and their bizaar outlook on death. I was also impressed by their devotion and heroism toward their countrymen. This book was written as if it were a true account. Although I am skeptical of its authenticity, I found myself wanting to believe that it was true."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"It is not clear when the Neanderthals died out and some historians have speculated that the last remaining Neanderthals may be represented in some of our oldest stories and legends. Crichton takes this idea and re-intreprets the Norse Beowulf legend as a conflict between homo sapiens and homo sapiens neanderthalensis.This book starts with an adaption of an actual historical manuscript (the travels of an Arab ambassador to the Bulgars), one of the few that describes elements of Viking culture from a (for the time) culturally objective perspective. Crichton then weaves in a fictional account of the amabassador going with the Vikings to their homeland to help a Scandanavian king defend his people from the \\"eaters of the dead.\\"It is an enjoyable read, short and not overtly ornate."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I found this book a fascinating re-imagining of the Beowulf story by a master storyteller who blends fact, fiction, and myth into a highly readable and entertaining package.The first three chapters, as some have noted, is real and recounts the Caliph messenger Fadlan's journey in the 900s. The second part of the book is a wild re-imagining of the Beowulf saga as seen through the eyes and journal of the Arab messenger.As Crichton has subsequently said, he included rather pedantic footnotes throughout the text, to give credibility to the historical nature of the text that was \\"uncovered\\" which to me work wonderfully and are highly inventive.I found Fadlan's reactions and understated sense of humor and powerful observations to be very compelling, particularly the way he notes flatly some of the incredible fights and adventures he winds up participating in.In sum, the book is a disciplined writer's exercise, a quirky one-off but one that in my mind was an unexpected success."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I read some of the negative reviews and my goodness, some of these folks used such big words....way over my head! From the stand point of someone who just loves to read, rather than attempting to impress with my limited vocabulary, I must say I enjoyed the book. The story of course is taken from the epic Beowulf, and the author uses a nice slant in using a outsider to describe events, and this makes it just simply interesting. Actually, I must admit to have read this one more than once and probably will again in the future. Crichton has gone out on a limb in playing with syntax, but I found this rather \\"fun.\\" All in all I have to recommend it."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"In recent years, Michael Crichton's work has not been to my taste. This has been due entirely to his tendency to intersperse what are essentially treatises in his fiction. Indeed, there are times when the action of his stories quite literally stops as his characters engage various hypotheses and philosophical points.Wasn't it amazing how everyone seemed to have some vague grasp of chaos theory in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;? Did anyone else find the pages of dissection of gorilla communication through sign-language in &quot;Congo&quot; just a bit prosaic?However, as I have been discovering Crichton's earlier work, I find this problem virtually non-existent. He was using the &quot;mock non-fiction&quot; approach in his novels from the begining, but it felt less intrusive and simply enriched the reading experience.Case in point, &quot;Eaters of the Dead. This gem, published in 1976 (ironically, just before &quot;Congo&quot;;the change must have happened over night), is a completely successful attempt to tell the &quot;true story&quot; of the epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;.The narrative structure is based on the memoirs of one Ibn Fadlan, a courtier to the Caliph of Baghdad. Ibn Fadlan was a real person, and Crichton has blended aspects of the true memoir into his fictional novel. Ibn Fadlan is on a mission to Europe, but is sidetracked when, during a visit to the Scandinavians, he is drafted by a chief, Buliwyf, to aid the kingdom of Rathar against a fearsome tribe of cannibalistic marauders, the wendol.The strength of this novel is the writing. It reads as such documents read. Matter of fact, largely candid, with certain turns of phrase that are dated. The action sequences are quite chilling. But so are Ibn Fadlan's experiences of the Northmen's culture, as we learn what exactly went into a Viking funeral. It wasn't just burning ships.Crichton creates a fanciful tale, but manages to ground it in reality. At the same time, he is always mindful of his source material. Anyone who has read &quot;Beowulf&quot; will recognize various nods to that poem, which will enhance reading pleasure. However, one needn't a degree in English lit to appreciate this book.Overall, this novel made me feel nostalgic for a time when Crichton's main goal was telling a good story through the integration of historical fact, rather than disguising non-fiction works as novels. Definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This book shows how versatile Michael Crichton is as a writer. He can write fiction, techno-thriller, nonfiction, and, with this work, he has proved that he can write fantasy and breath new life into a classic story. Basically, The 13th Warrior is about an Arab who goes to the land of the Vikings. According to Crichton, the first four chapters or so are based on actual texts. After that, Crichton starts to bring more elements from Beowulf into the story. For you fantasy fans out there, this book has lots of great stuff: Violent Vikings, Grendel monsters, Glow-worms, Dwarves, a great storyline, interesting characters, etc. I found it interesting what Crichton says about Viking life--their beliefs, how their villages are created (especially interesting was the purpose behind the small doorways to all their buildings), how the Vikings treat women, etc. A very fascinating book, one of the very few fiction books, actually, that even talks about the Vikings. The first part may be a little slow, but you can blame that on the historical text. Crichton did such a seamless job of blending his writing style with that of the Arab's that I felt as if it were the Arab talking the whole time (or the other way around.) If you've never read the epic poem Beowulf because of the archaic language, this book is a fairly decent substitute. I say fairly because it doesn't exactly follow the real story of Beowulf at all, just borrows a few elements here and there. If you're looking for a good translation of the REAL Beowulf, try the Seamus Heaney translation as there is no archaic language, making it a really easy read. Overall, the 13th Warrior is a great fantasy novel, a fresh escape from the kill-the-dragon save-the-princess kill-the-ultimate-evil storyline."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This is a very clever re-telling and re-visioning of the BEOWULF tale. EATERS OF THE DEAD is also a return to Crichton's style in THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN. That is, Crichton's technique is to make fiction seem absolutely real -- sometimes boringly so -- and when he's good at this, he's the best. Ibn Fadlan was an actual person who did write about his travels, but remember that in THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN Crichton invented footnotes and bibliographical entries that appeared real and true, even though they weren't. The mix of historical fact with fiction, the mundane with the fantastic, is expertly done. The recent movie that is based on this book, THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR, also does that quite well. (If folks are interested in more interpretations of BEOWULF, they might want to take a look at John Gardner's GRENDEL.)"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"When you first start this book, it begins with a boring introduction to the story, explaining the historical foundation for the book. (I'm not totally convinced that this was based on history-but I'm not sure!-which is another fascinating aspect of the book.) When you get through that part, which is pretty interesting if you give it a chance, you get to the really good stuff. I'm sure you have read the other reviews and the synopsis of the book, so I will only add one other thing to help you decide if you want the book or not.The book has many levels, and I chose to focus on the relationship between Ibn Fadlan and the vikings. Underneath the obvious story lies lessons about death and life. Ibn Fadlan, a man who is afraid of death and, of course, avoids it as much as possible, is sent on a quest with men who deal with death everyday. Also, his relationship on a cultural level with the vikings. He was so much the opposite of them, and you get to see his transformation as he discovers their world.The book is beautifully written (maybe the writing is a little wierd for people since it was written as journal entries from a man who only liked to write down the facts). The only thing I didn't like was that it wasn't longer!It's a great buy and it is action-packed and very funny!warning: There are a couple of words where you need a dictionary. (but just a couple)"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"What I think is great about this book is that Crichton ties the history so well together with the story that he wrote, which is why so many people discuss &quot;is this a true story, or fiction&quot;.? It is neither, it is both, it is a mix. But the incredible thing is that he achieves exactly what he was hoping to attain, which is that he got us all to read a readaption of Beowolf, and now all of us, whether we liked to book or not, know a lot more about the Viking and the ancient Arab cultures than we did before we read it. And what is really brilliant is that he did it through the premise that the Arabs had a written language, whereas the Vikings did not. Therefore, whereas Viking sagas were passed on verbally, and hence could be changed by the person telling the story, this particular story was put in writing, assuring that it was passed down unchanged.By the way, as a woman of Norwegian blood living in Italy, I recognized some of my Viking traits in Crichton's descriptions of the Vikings - and so did my Italian husband!My compliments to Michael Crichton. From Sci Fi to ER to novels with a historical base, you never let us down."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This book is off the beaten path for Crichton. You will not find advanced technology or genetic research in here, and no one ever receives a critical fax. It is just an ancient tall tale well told, and told bluntly. It's highly cinematic, and like a camera it never blinks, especially in the harsher passages--Crichton lifts one savage thing after another up to your eyes for your personal inspection. That accomplishment is due partly to his narrator, Ibn Fadlan, a man who lived a thousand years ago, and who chronicled whatever passed in front of his eyes with cold precision. Crichton just took Fadlan's lead, maintaining a this-is-exactly-what-I-saw tone to the end.If you enjoy books to help you escape, this is one of them. Read it and imagine life as it must have been, the mad fears and beliefs people held dearly back then. Remember reading The Hobbit for the first time? For me, Eaters has attained that rank. Plus, in my opinion, it has one of the best last lines (of the text) of any book, Crichton or otherwise."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Ahmad Ibn Fadlan, a representative of the ruler of Baghdad, is traveling up the Volga River on a diplomatic mission in the year 922 (although the &quot;Encyclopedia Britanicca&quot; says 921). He soon meets a Viking chief, Buliwyf, who is attempting to return to his homeland to fight beings or monsters who are apparently attempting to conquer his land. The author is obviously structuring his book on the epic of &quot;Beowulf&quot; (but, the historical Beowulf lived in the sixth century, not the tenth). The book shows some nice interplay between two widely different cultures. In a way, I viewed the second half of the novel not so much as a version of &quot;Beowulf,&quot; but simply as a conflict between the Vikings and a strange Neolithic people (possibly the last of the Neanderthals?). Although not appreciated by many of Dr. Crichton's fans (as witnessed by many of the earlier comments), I really enjoyed this work of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Contrary to what has been said by many of the reviewers below, this book is in fact based on a real manuscript by the Arab traveller ibn Fadlan in the tenth century who made his way from the Caliphate to the shores of the Volga to treat with the Bulgar kingdom which was then ensconced there (apparently to entice the Bulgars away from their Khazar overlords who were then enemies of the Arab empire). This ambassador of the Caliph faithfully recorded much of what he saw there, among the barbarians, including encounters with the Oghuz Turks and the Norsemen who were then frequent travellers along the rivers of what would one day become Russia. (In fact some thinking has it that the Norse, in the guise of &quot;Rus&quot; -- eytemology unclear -- actually gave their name, along with their ruling princes, to Russia since the first major Russian state, Kievan Rus, was ruled by princes of viking heritage, with the help of second and third generation viking adventurers serving them as mercenaries.) But Crichton's book is not just a reprint of ibn Fadlan's manuscript (which is available, in English, in various scholarly tomes). Crichton enlarged upon the tale he found and appended an apparently fictional second half which takes ibn Fadlan north, in the company of his new-found Norse comrades, to the viking lands, there to face a shadowy menace of unknown origins. In this second half, Crichton blended historical speculation with the Beowulf tale in Old English (the chief of the viking crew which inducts ibn Fadlan is called &quot;Buliwyf&quot;) to suggest an ending to ibn Fadlan's adventures which surely never happened. But it's done quite nicely, hard to tell where the real tale ends and the author's fictional enterprise begins, and it keeps you reading right to the final moments. It's not a particularly stirring tale but it's thought provoking and well-paced and a wonderfully interesting way to do an historical novel. Am looking forward to the movie, THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR (named after the reason the vikings insist on bringing their fastidious Arab guest along for the ride), to see how it was done. The tale is simple enough for this sort of treatment so it should make a bang-up film for those of us into adventure and the viking thing. Due out in mid-August of '99. -- S. W. Mirsky"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"In an afterword of the novel Eaters of the Dead, published in 1976, author Michael Crichton explains that the book was conceived on a dare. A friend proposed to teach a college course called \\"The Great Bores,\\" based on the essential writings of western civilization. His friend asserted that these texts were so tedious that no one willingly read them anymore, and the first of the great bores he would address was the epic poem Beowulf. Crichton disagreed, arguing that Beowulf was an exciting, dramatic story and that he could prove it.Crichton began working from the assumption that Beowulf, like other epic poems and pieces of mythology, may have some basis in fact. By peeling away the poetic invention and embellishment of hundreds of years of oral retelling, Crichton suggests that we may return to a kernel of human experience. The result is a modern psuedo-historical fantasy about the original events that inspired the story of Beowulf.But Crichton refuses to let on. He enhances his illusion by writing the novel from the point of view of a comtemporary eye witness of the events. Rather than inventing this person, the author goes further by \\"discovering \\" the eyewitness narrative in the manuscript of Ahmad ibn Fadlan, an Arab sent by the Caliph of Bagdad in the year 921 as part of an embassy to the Volga Bulgars. His account of the journey provides one of the earliest descriptions of Vikings.Crichton begins his book with an introduction intended to familiarize the reader with all of the many translations of Ibn Faldlan's manuscript, along with their backgrounds and respective merits. So convincing is Crichton's invention that I found myself completely perplexed as to what was true and what was not. And lest his readers begin to suspect something, Crichton makes sure to fill his entire book with lengthy footnotes to further legitimize the narrative.The story begins with Ibn Fadlan's aformentioned mission to northwest Russia. Upon encountering a band of Northmen, he is forced to join them in a quest to destroy a myserious scourge of mist monsters terrorizing the their homeland. These Wendol, as they Northmen call them, turn out to be a surviving relict of Neanderthals who feed on the flesh of their victims(which is far more interesting than the cave people of the film adaptation, The 13th Warrior) .As an Arab during the 10th century, when the civilization of Islam was by far the most advanced culture on Earth, Ibn Fadlan's perspective serves as an ideal doorway for the modern reader to enter this strange world of Vikings. His descriptions of the lands, people and cultures are detailed and vivid. The reader immediately shares his horror and disgust with the vulgar and barbaric world of the Northmen.Despite his role as a simple chronicler, Ibn Fadlan emerges as a real character. In the course of the story, he grows from a pampered and fearful ambassador to a courageous warrior willing to fight to the death for his Norse companions. More subtle and interesting is the way he begins to embrace their way of life during his journey.The plot moves at a brisk pace without feeling shallow. And in only 250 pages, Crichton manages produce equal amounts of action, suspense, horror as well as humor and genuine sorrow. All told, Eaters of the Dead is a clever and thoroughly enjoyable adventure story that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I probably enjoyed Beowulf as much as anyone else that I have ever met. Therefore, it is no mistake that I also loved Eaters of the Dead. The language was very simple and matter of fact - an angle that Crichton probably wouldn't have followed had he not been working from an actual ancient manuscript written in the same way. However, it quickly evolves into an intense, developed plot with very complete characters and situations. Like most of the other reviews that I have read, the Beowulf parallels also fed my interest. I am not sure that anyone noted this: the underwater cave entrance is similar to the home of Grendel's mother in the myth. In fact, that whole section of the book (with the exception of the sheer ease in which the mother was killed) closely parallels the fight scene. I believe that Crichton did an excellent job demonstrating Ibn Fablan's original text while presenting the power of change and imagination that comes from generations of oral tradition. I have read Eaters of the Dead several times already (being only a teenager, it seems like the book I always pick when going on family road trips!) and I plan to continue pulling it off the shelf for as long as I live. One concern, though: I have trouble seeing Antonio Banderas as Ibn Fadlan?! Can he pull of an Arab role? Either way, I am certain that the movie will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Perhaps one of the greater books of all time. Every aspect of the novel shaped into perfection. It's a delight for all readers and listeners with a uneasy mythical theme that made it a real pageturner. This is it man ..... History!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Haven't gotten through it yet, but accidentally stumbled on the description at the end. It's apparently fiction, based on an actual manuscript by an Eastern historian named ibn Fadlan. To clear up some of the &quot;wow, it's so similar to Beowulf&quot; postings. If you read the followup that's in the paperback, YES IT IS, and it's supposed to be. Following the premise that many great tales are based on a set of real events, he set out to de-construct and reverse-engineer Beowulf. His first premise was to try work backwards. To take Beowulf and try to to remove the fiction until a realistic tale was left. This apparently seemed too difficult. He then decided to work from the start. To create a tale that could theoretically evolve into Beowulf. Michael Chrichton always does his research to spin a tale which (while embellished), contains many technically correct aspects to make it believeable and he has again done so. He uses an actual historian and creates a tale supposedly written by him. Not unlike Braveheart, he fills in the gaps and imagines things as they would have been with great believability!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I thought &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot;, was a well written book. I felt as though talking through Ibn Fadlan and using his seriousness towards everything, did what Micheal wanted, gave it a scary aspect because it felt true."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I bought this book on the assumption it was entirely fictional. When I discovered in the foreword that a portion was based on some historical factual journal, I was fascinated. I think the mix of fact and fiction, without a clear separation between the two, makes for an exciting and thought-provoking story. Exactly where fact and fiction separate in ancient history is pretty much up for grabs anyway, isn't it?"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"EATERS OF THE DEAD is good, but it's quite a departure for Crichton. It will be interesting to see what kind of movie it will make (that will be released soon). I recently read a Crichton-like novel (in its lay-out more than its subject matter): THE SHAPE: A NOVEL OF INTERNATIONAL SUSPENSE by Craig Furnas, and it is fantastic. I'd read that before this. But EATERS OF THE DEAD is interesting. I have to give Crichton credit for taking a chance on this book, since it deals with viking-days, which certainly is not standard Crichton-fare. His publisher was probably none-to-happy when he turned in the manuscript. Do you think Grisham's would be happy if his next book was about Eskimos hundreds of years ago? So I give Cricton an extra point for taking a chance."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This is the first book written by Michael Crichton that I have read.

A gift of writing comperable to William Shakesphere."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This book was great, but not as great as some of his others.

All MC really did was gather the translated texts and arange it in a novel-like fashion (if you read the foreword you would have realized this). The book, quite simply, was awesome. A bit dull in the begining yes, hard to understand at times (I found the Oxford Dictionary quite usefull in looking up terms like &quot;pedastry&quot;), and not for those with a weak stomach as well. I only found two possible flaws in Ibn Fanlan's descriptions (the forked tonques of the &quot;Sea Monsters&quot; which I beleive to be whales) and the general hairiness of the &quot;Eaters Of The Dead&quot;.

I might as well as read a school history text.thumbs down."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Eaters of the Dead by Michael Crichton is a very entertaining read. This book has the page-turning ability of all of Crichton's other books. However, this book does not have the scientific background that some of his other books do.This book tells the story of Ibn Fadlan. He is the ambassidor of Baghdad, \\"the city of peace\\" (ironic?), to Bulgars. For Fadlan to reach Fadlan, he must cross Viking territory. When Fadlan meets Buliwyf's tribe, he finds that he can not reach Bulgars. The Vikings require a 13th warrior for a journey of theirs. In Viking tradition, the 13th warrior must be differant from the others. The rest of the story tells of Ibn Fadlan's adventures with the Vikings.I found out that this is based on the story of Beowolf. Crichton took on a bet with a friend of his who was teaching \\"the bores of history\\" (their first book would be Beowolf) that he could make Beowolf exciting and came up with this book. He obviously won the bet.The main character Ibn Fadlan was a real person, but lived 150 years after Beowolf. So this book is fiction. The first three chapters of this book are pretty much the manuscript of Ibn Fadlan. After that Crichton makes the story more interesting.I would recommend this book to other because it is very interesting and includes the elements that make Crichton's novels so readable."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Loosely based on writings found that were by an Arab scholar about his interactions with a band of Viking warriors during the time period when the Norsemen were at their raping and pillaging best that morphs into a story with a lot of similarities to Beowulf. Not for the history purist or for people who want to sanitize the Vikings image (like has been done in some circles with the Celts), just a good fun to read Viking adventure story."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This book is presented as an account of an Arab traveler taken along a quest with Vikings around a thousand years ago. Crichton does a good job of presenting the text as an historical account and in many ways this reads as an interesting historical narrative of true events. The story is a fairly quick read and I think any that enjoy action/adventure stories set in the distant past would like it.Because of the footnotes and eyewitness type narrative done in a fictional novel, it's hard to know what customs and beliefs presented are actual and what are totally made up. It all reads as true to life, and I suppose that is what makes it so interesting. I'm going to guess that Crichtons presentation of customs and rituals such as the one in which the Viking men can and do take any of the slave woman at will, often several times a day, is completely made up, a males fantasy indeed, however it makes for interesting reading and I'm sure it's intertwined with some customs that are actually factual.I saw the movie when it first came out, and that fact didn't diminish the reading of the novel. I'd also like to point out that, unlike Timeline, in which Crichton takes characters back in time in a time traveling machine, this book supposes an eyewitness account of a foreigner traveling to distant lands back at the time the adventure happened and that Crichton merely translated the story for us from several scholarly texts. I liked this approach better as it wasn't as fantastic or as hard to shallow.In any case, while this book is hardly classical literature, it's a fun read and I give it a good recommendation."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I liked th book th 13 Warrior alot.

Their aare lot's of fights and I wanted to read faster to find out how it ends. I was tempted to read the ending but didn't.I could actually picture the charecters in this story.

Crichton tries to write the events of the epic poem Beowulf in a believeable manner. And for a man who has made the eventual rise of dinosaurs believable to we skeptics (no tropical savanna locked in glacial ice necessary), he pulls this stunt off as well. He presents the information from the perspective of Ibn Fadlan, an emmissary from Babylon. With footnotes and such (and the fact that Ibn Fadlan was a real travel historian), the book is confusing until you realize that almost all of it is entirely made up.It is a fascinating view of the Norsemen and times. So what makes this novel science fiction rather than historical fiction? Crichton's basis for \\"Grendel.\\" I won't ruin the surprise, but, again, its highly plausible and entertaining. Posits some possible and believable origins for the Beowulf epic."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This is the first book by Michael Crichton that I have read, and I loved it. In the book, basically, an Arab man in about 925 AD was forced to become an ambassador to a foreign country, and shortly after arrival, is captured by Vikings. With the Vikings, he goes on a mission to save a village that is being plundered by a civilization of cantabiles. This was a really good book that I would recommend to all who enjoy action.I would give it a 9/10."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I admit that I struggled with whether or not I was reading fiction or nonfiction when I first encountered this novel. Actually, I thought that I was reading fiction based on actual research. Considering the scholarly listing of sources in the back of the book I do not think that I was being too gullible. After all, there actually was a 10th century Arab traveler by the name of Ibn Fadlan.Then I noticed that the story was sounding more and more like Beowulf. In fact, it was like a cross between _Lord of the Rings_ and Beowulf- complete with weapon-forging dwarves in caves. I finally realized that this was what Crichton was trying to do. He was creating a plausible historical verification for the events that occur in Beowulf seen through the eyes of an outside observer. And he did it very well.At first I found the picture presented of the Vikings to be disgusting. They are presented with no redeeming features at all i.e. dirty, uncouth, treacherous, drunken, lascivious pigs. But then slowly, as they travel on their heros' journey to the far north the characters slowly seem to be transformed. Traits such as humor, honor, and courage begin to show through. This continues until the leader of the party (Buliwyn) appears finally not only as the most classical of questing heroes, but also as the resurrected image of Odin himself.One other thing little thing, the monsters of the mist being portrayed as cannibalistic, warlike Neanderthals seems a bit far fetched. After all, it seems that the Neanderthalers were a gentle folk who were probably exterminated by Homo sapiens that were not all that dissimilar from the Vikings...."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This is one of his shortest novels, but IMO perhaps the best. The narrative is taut, the excitement and suspense unrelenting, and the historical detail rich and vivid. He combines three worlds all equally strange to most readers - the Vikings of the Dark Ages, the world of medieval Islam, and the bizarre prehistoric rootedness of the Eaters. Several alien worlds superimposed, and done most impressivley. Far better than the film."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I don't know about anyone else but this was one of the best books I have ever read. I had seen the movie before I read the book and their both great, but I'm going to have to go with the movie on this one. Those battle scenes in the movie were unbelievable. My favorite part of the book and movie were when the warriors went into the Wendol's cave and slaughtered their mother and then ran for their lives as the beasts swarmed in on them. Before I read this book I wasn't a big reader of Micheal Crichton, but after reading this book I don't see how you couldn't be one. This book was the best thing since &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Well I hope everyone enjoyed my review. Bye!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Michael Crichton wrote a winner with this one and the screen adaptation, which I own on VHS, was very good and overlooked. --Along the lines of Braveheart; great view of european and scandinavian &quot;culture&quot; about 1000 AD, as seen through the eyes of an Arab who wrote of his travels. It is based on a true story from his account of adventures with the Vikings. The story is much enjoyed in both forms by those I suggest it to. Now I have added to my formats, the DVD version. A great addition."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"\\"Eaters of the Dead\\" is about a 10th Century Arab Muslim named Ibn Fadlan, who goes on a mission to deliver a message up in the northlands by the King of Saqaliba from the \\"City of Peace.\\" Fadlan gets sidetracked and finds himself among a bunch of Vikings. He observes the Viking way of life and finds much of it offensive, because it goes against his beliefs. Fadlan and the Vikings go around the northland on adventures. They come to a city and protect the village from the \\"Mist Creatures\\" who tear off people's heads and take them away.This is an excellent book which shows what culture shock would be for a 10th Century Muslim in the \\"Barbaric\\" northland. I highly recommend this and I give it five stars."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Very entertaining book! Like most great fantasy it's captivating once you get through the first 20 pages. I thouroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Contrary to what has been said by many of the reviewers below, this book is in fact based on a real manuscript by the Arab traveller ibn Fadlan in the tenth century who made his way from the Caliphate to the shores of the Volga to treat with the Bulgar kingdom which was then ensconced there (apparently to entice the Bulgars away from their Khazar overlords who were then enemies of the Arab empire). This ambassador of the Caliph faithfully recorded much of what he saw there, among the barbarians, including encounters with the Oghuz Turks and the Norsemen who were then frequent travellers along the rivers of what would one day become Russia. (In fact some thinking has it that the Norse, in the guise of &quot;Rus&quot; -- eytemology unclear -- actually gave their name, along with their ruling princes, to Russia since the first major Russian state, Kievan Rus, was ruled by princes of viking heritage, with the help of second and third generation viking adventurers serving them as mercenaries.) But Crichton's book is not just a reprint of ibn Fadlan's manuscript (which is available, in English, in various scholarly tomes). Crichton enlarged upon the tale he found and appended an apparently fictional second half which takes ibn Fadlan north, in the company of his new-found Norse comrades, to the viking lands, there to face a shadowy menace of unknown origins. In this second half, Crichton blended historical speculation with the Beowulf tale in Old English (the chief of the viking crew which inducts ibn Fadlan is called &quot;Buliwyf&quot;) to suggest an ending to ibn Fadlan's adventures which surely never happened. But it's done quite nicely, hard to tell where the real tale ends and the author's fictional enterprise begins, and it keeps you reading right to the final moments. It's not a particularly stirring tale but it's thought provoking and well-paced and a wonderfully interesting way to do an historical novel. Am looking forward to the movie, THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR (named after the reason the vikings insist on bringing their fastidious Arab guest along for the ride), to see how it was done. The tale is simple enough for this sort of treatment so it should make a bang-up film for those of us into adventure and the viking thing. Due out in mid-August of '99. -- S. W. Mirsky"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"About fifteen years ago a Star Trek enthusiast gave me his copy of \\"Eaters of the Dead\\". \\"If you like the Klingons,\\" he said, \\"you'll LOVE this!\\" Indeed, the Viking warriors of this novel are the veritable templates of the alien warriors of Ford's \\"The Final Reflection\\". Having seen \\"The Thirteenth Warrior\\", I had an urge to reread the novel which inspired the video. I'm glad I did! \\"Eaters of the Dead\\" is even better than I remembered it, a fast-paced adventure that takes only a few hours to finish. It's a masterful retelling of the Beowulf saga, cleverly combined with the manuscripts of Ibn Fadlan, a historically authentic person. Ibn Fadlan was an Arab aristocrat who resided amongst the Rus' in 921 and recorded many of their rituals, most famously a chieftain's longboat-funeral on the Volga. Although Ibn Fadlan never actually journeyed with the Northmen, Crichton's idea of a cultured Muslim's immersion in a fierce heathen society makes for an enjoyable contrast in characters. Crichton's plentful footnotes detailing the Arab and Rus' perspective convey a feeling of realism to what is basically a fantasy adventure. And after having recently endured the Christian-supremicist propaganda of \\"Vladimir the Russian Viking\\", it was a great treat to read a story which accords respect to Paganism and Islam. So much so, I'll forgive the goofy concept of Neanderthals as antagonists. After all, Crichton is the author who gave us the cloned dinosaurs of \\"Jurassic Park\\" -- so I suppose, why not also a Clan of the CaveBear surviving into the Heroic Age? The film stays fairly true to the novel, with a decent performance by Antonio Banderas as the reluctant, but ultimately heroic, thirteenth warrior."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"An Arab ambassador finds himself shanghaied into service with a band of Viking warriors on a mission to confront the \\"monsters of the mist\\" that have been terrorizing the villages of northern Scandinavia in an adventure set 1,000 years in the past. Michael Crichton has produced an exciting pastiche of historical narrative combining documents written by an actual Arab traveler with his own imaginative speculations on the origins of the epic poem Beowulf. Disregard the reviewers who found this novel boring. There are not very many conversations, so I suppose they were put off by having to read so many paragraphs of five lines or more. This is a brutal, fast-moving story and a quick read."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"If you would like to learn more about how people from another place and time lived and thought, then this would be a good adventure for you. If your looking for a fast paced novel with sound byte lines and sub-plots then you will find this book boring. This is more to real life than a mere novel. When I read this I had to laugh for I saw the same reaction by the arab Ibn Fadlan here as Senica the Roman had in his essay on the Germans. But, does not human interaction and shock make life interesting? Often reading very old text can be tiresome but, Crighton makes this trip more fun to the Regular guy or gal by editing out mundane list of villages Fadlan traveled through on his way to meeting the vikings. And, Crighton makes his translation easer to read. You may asks \\"How do we know this narrative is credible?\\" And, we have no absolute knowledge on this. However, I found this narrative to be much more candid than other old works i've read. Fadlan avoided supernatural exagerations in his account. This candid approach makes this story more interesting to me."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"In the afterword, Michael Crichton writes that this novel arose out of a dare - that anyone could, and would willingly immerse themselves in the world of Beowulf. The novel wrestles with two very intriguing ideas. First that Beowulf was based on actual events (and he actually mentions Heinrich Schliemann, who believed the Iliad was true, and thus helped prove Troy's existence). The second, that the battles described in Beowulf were actually battles between the Cro-Magnon Vikings and a tribe of Neanderthals. To tell his story, he has as his narrator and hero Ibn Fadlan, an Arab traveller who had journeyed among the Vikings in Russia in 921 A.D. He uses the extant writings of Ibn Fadlan to begin the story and describe Viking life, even though he lived at a later time then when Beowulf originated. And all of this would make for some interesting, if rather dry, reading but for one thing: Crichton can write. He lays out a story-line that is both economical and compelling. He says that the first three chapters are rewritten from Ibn Fadlan's manuscript, but for this clue, one could not easily discern where Ibn Fadlan ends and where Crichton begins."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Eaters of the Dead, as I've said, is my second favorite book ever! I first saw this book when it had a skull and a viking helmet on the cover and I thought it looked awesome, I had read a couple of Crichton books before at that time and liked them and so I bought the book. I sat down and started reading and I was entranced at the detail and writing style of this book. At first I thought it was real because it read like a real Manuscript written in A.D. 922! But then I realized that Crichton did that on purpose so it would scare you and keep you hooked. I've read this book three times now and it never loses its magic, and the movie was good too (although it should have been longer.) This is a must-read!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Eaters of the Dead is a very good book. It is very descriptive. The book describes everything in detail. It describes every battle to the last period. If you have a weak stomach or don't like blood of anything of that nature, I suggest that you don't read this book. The book is about a man named ibn-Fadlan, who was simply bringing a message from kingdom to kingdom, when he ran into a group of Vikings. He was eventually forced to travel with the Vikings. His travels take him far from his objective, but into many other adventures. Among his adventures, he must battle the horrific and vicious &quot;mist-monsters,&quot; and destroy their &quot;mother.&quot; After all of his adventures, he went through a drastic change, he became an excellent warrior."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I love this book AND the movie, titled 'The 13th Warrior.' This is a tale of heroism and courage. We need more stories like this. Neither the book, nor the movie make concessions to political correctness. We aren't bombarded with ludicrous portrayals of women cleaving men apart with swords. The heroes don't apologize for destroying a malevolent and backward foe. The band of Vikings are actually (well, mostly) Vikings, not a worldwide crew of Benetton models. If only for these reasons, this book and movie are by far the best of Crichton's stories. I recommend this as a quick and decisive antidote to our normal poisonous fare of relativism."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This was my first Crichton Book. Don't let the title put you off. It is a facinating story with a great deal of information about Nordic and Arab culture, attitudes, and history. It started just a little slow, but quickly engulfs you into a great story. It is every bit as good as any adventure story around.For those who are interested in anthropology, there is also some very interesting perspectives about human evolution."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Eaters Of The Dead is definitely my favourite book of all time. This is without doubt Michael Crichton's best work.The story is about an Arab traveller, Ahmed Ibh Fadlan. The ruler of the ancient Baghdad sends him to Notrhern lands as an ambassador, because he is suspected of love affair, with the wife of an important man in the City of Peace.On his way, he arrives to the Northmen's vilage, where an old king has just died. One day, a young boy arrives, sending a message from the Vikings' home land, that they are under the attack of a man-eating monster. According to a numerogical superstition, 13 warriors must travell there, one of them must be no North man. So Ibn Fadlan must travell to the Northland, along with a new king Buliwyf.After many days, they arrive there. They are greeted with a feast, but they must already prepare to fight the monster. After first attack, they follow the monsters back to it's caves, where they kill their mother. But during this fight Buliwyf is poissoned. They return to the town and they must prepare for the vengeance of the monsters. They succeed in protecting the town, but their king, Buliwyf dies. They are all regarded as heroes and they all stay there, with the exception of Ibn Fadlan, who must return back, so that he will continue his journey as ambassador.This is a great adventurous, historical novel. It is based on actual manuscripts of an Arab traveller. It is also based on the story of an old English epic, Beowulf."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"At first I was skeptical about this Crichton novel. I was concerned that a re-telling and enhancement of an ancient tale would be dull, difficult to follow, and un-nerving. However, I was pulled into the story and found myself mystified, entrigued, and full of thought. It made me wonder about life for those people; while at the same time keeping me rivited to the plot."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"You're never quite sure what the Vikings are up against and that makes the story an eerie adventure into the unknown. I enjoyed the contrasting viewpoints between Ibn Fadlan, an Arab observer (Holy, Clean and Couth) and the lusty crew of Vikings. (Charmingly Crude) While Ibn Fadlan clearly would never want to be a Viking he tells their story with such honesty that many readers will find that they too wish they could have been among them.Crichton mixes history, folklore and epic quest together so well that there is no way to know where history ends and Crichton begins, especially in those wonderful footnotes."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Once I started reading Eaters of the Dead, I couldn't stop. It was a fascinating look into Viking culture and had a simple, but involving plot. I was a bit dissapointed to find that only half of the book was true, but it was still great."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This is very different from most of Crighton's other books and I liked it best of all. But then, I didn't like Sphere or Congo, or some of his others. He is a good writer as Eaters of the Dead and Travels prove, but he is a little too much in love with Hollywood."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"As a scholar of archaeology and anthropology,i,truly liked this novel.It is a pure historical adventure with great characters that comes to life as one reads it.It is also a well written eye witness account.As an history and legend and even anthropology lover,i would like to say again that this book is great!Thanks to Mr Crihton."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Ibn Fadlan is a Scribe in Super Hero tights and Michael Crichton brings him to you!!!

I am a Tolkein addict, but Eaters of the dead is such an intense, accurate journey into Norse culture that everytime I read it I can't seem to put it down. It's also a change from Crichton's usual novels, illustrating that he is full of imagination and ingenuity. Keep writing Michael, or we'll all be quite bored!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I personally think Michael Crichton was brave to write this book. When he said to his publishers, &quot;I want to present an old manuscript about the vikings to a mass audience,&quot; they couldn't have been to thrilled. The publishers, after all, list the book as &quot;fiction&quot; when it is actually historical nonfiction. I'm partial to history, and that Crichton presents this in a readable form is a real treat. My own novel THE SHAPE: A NOVEL OF INTERNATIONAL SUSPENSE has history in the beginning and end (check it out for yourself!), and to see Crichton commit a whole book to historical fact is a thrill. (But then Crichton wrote a book about Jasper Johns. Crichton's got a brain in his head, no doubt)."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This is quite possibly Crichton's best book. He makes it seem so real that when he went back to revise and add on, he had troble telling which footnotes were true and which were his own creation! This book had me beliving that it was true until the author's notes at the end!."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I enjoyed the movie so much that I wanted to read the book. I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This is not your typical Michael Crichton thriller but good nevertheless. Crichton is famous for writing documentary-style fiction, but this takes his approach to a whole other level. Besides his usual methods of describing every little thing, etc., he evens goes so far as to include a lengthy preface, an about the author section (the story is told through the eyes of Ibn Fadlan, who was an actual person but never made contact with Vikings), and even footnotes. Unlike most of his books, there is no extreme suspense; no matter how bad the situation gets, you know how it will end because it is told in the first person about the past. That said, it is still very entertaining. It comes recommended, but read some other Crichton books first."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Simply amazing. I have long been interested in the past. A passion of mine is studying the history of many cultures. This work, brought me onto the Vikings, which before now, I had little interest in. For anybody who is interested in history as I am, it is another movie that shows historically accurate potrails. I have found little about this story other than movie/book based, so I can't say how much is actually FACT and which is FALSE. Either way it is educational. I wish I could find out which parts are in fact based on FACT. But this does not hinder my simply enjoying this book and the movie that goes along with it."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"It took a while, but I finally got into Crichton's &quot;eaters of the dead&quot; and enjoyed it. Sure, Beowulf predates the 10th century vikings in the story, but I give him high marks for his interesting synthesis of an old manuscript and an older epic legend.A real drag to the story flow was the overuse of footnotes. Since liberties were taken with time and facts, why not incorporate the footnotes into the main body of the story and keep it flowing? Crichton does have an eye for action.I cannot imagine this story as a movie starring Antonio Banderas, however it was a good, mercifully short read. They can't all be Andromeda Strain."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"First of all, to the guy who claimed the book was merely a translation and not an original work, he needs to go back and finish it. That's part of the game! This book was very entertaining, if a bit weak at the end. I actually felt the movie tweaked the ending for the better, which was a surprise.Don't believe what your friends tell you, think for yourself. This book and the movie that was made from it are both worth your time, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This book is way better than the movie. I saw the movie(The thirteenth warrior) and believe me, it was one of the worst movies of the year. Antonio Banderas reeks. The book is great, accept, there are a few things that I did not like. The book had too much historicle information, which you had to read about on the bottom of the page. Why didn't Michael Criton take MOST of this garbage out? Another thing I saw wrong with the book was the lack of description in the battle scenes. There just wasn't enough destription of the battles, just a few sentences. Other than that, the book is great. I should say that the facts that Ibn Fadlan learns about the Northmen is much more interesting and entertaining than the battles(which are dull because they aren't described well)Despite how bad the movie is, it has it's advantages, Great battle scenes, blood and gore, great scene in the Thunder caves, Great characters. So if you want great action and that alone, watch the movie. If you want plot and story, realism and no Antonio Banderas wearing Mascara than read the book. If you want bad acting, mostly by the main character, and a good action movie that COULD HAVE been a great movie epic than watch the movie."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"The author here has accomplished a convincing fraud for the unwary reader. Eaters of the Dead purports to be \\"The Manuscript of Ibn Fadlan, Relating His Experiences with the Northmen in A.D. 922\\". And so the introduction, bracketed inserts, footnotes, appendix, and bibliography would have you believe this book was compiled from other fragmentary manuscripts that the author had pieced together into a seamless whole. Wrong! In reality it is a fictional novel, based on the epic poem Beowulf, the origin of which he explains only at the very end. If it were a novel it could probably have been done better. Still it was thoroughly convincing for what it professed to be and learning it was fictional only created the greatest disappointment I've ever felt after reading a book, making me want to throw it into the nearest waste basket. Even so, it does contain plenty of accurate details about the Viking way of life as any historically based novel should attempt to do, but I'm sure much of its fascination will be lost if you know beforehand that it is mostly of the author's imagination. The story concerns a kingdom that is being assailed by an attacking hoard. Buliwyf and his warriors attempt to fend off the mist monsters who are the eaters of the dead. By the way there was a real Arab named Ibn Fadlan who did spend time amidst the Vikings and the first three chapters of this novel borrow heavily from his actual manuscript."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"After reading many of Mr. Crichton's works, I found that this book was truely disapointing. I had trouble reading it, and had to look up practically every other word in the dictionary. After the first thirty pages, I felt like putting it down, but resisted. Now, I kind of wish that I had. It got a little bit easier to read, and the plot developed more after about 45 pages, but that was not even close to being enough to make it one of my favorites. I do realize, however, that there may be many readers out there who enjoy reading a novel with Shakespereian style writing (is that even a word?) and I do recomend it for them. It just was not really &quot;My cup of Tea&quot; as they say."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"The Movie was very entertaining, the book was very dry and slow reading, Please DO NOT take this book, or the movie as a true showing of the life of the Muslam, or the Viking. In Michael Crichton's postscript, he states that it's a work of fiction. In an interview, he said he was attempting to bring the legend of Beowolf to life. Read the book if you like, but enjoy the movie."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"What a great story! For anyone who may have seen The Thirteenth Warrior, this is a \\"must-read\\"!!!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"As a loyal Crichton fan, I'd have to say I was very dissapointed and at times disgusted with this book. It was extremely fake and pointless, not to mention dull and boring.

I found Eaters of the dead to be far from Crichton's best because it lacks the usual suspense and unpredictability that is found in almost all of Crichton books. If Eaters of the Dead was entirely non-fiction it would have been better but Crichton used enough of his own idea's to have it published as a work of fiction. Unlike usual Crichton books Eaters of the Dead is boring until he reaches the north lands where it is still fairly unexciting, this is proved in the part when Ibn Faladan is almost killed in Turkey and it reads like the rest of the book as there is no sense of urgency or fear if Crichton was going to change some facts in the book (I'm still not sure what is fact and what is fiction) he should have added dialog or something to make that scene more exciting even if it isn't part of the main plot. Even the battle scenes lack excitement with no real details or description. My favorite scene is from descending the cliff to the fight with the mother of the Wendol and even that is too fast or the scene where Ibn Faladan sees the whales because that is the most descriptive scene in the whole book. Whereas most Michael Crichton's books score five out-of five stars for the reasons above I gave Eaters of the Dead one star. A word of advice to Crichton is if your going to do non-fiction add nothing fictitious to it.

In the dessert the men cross numerous vikings including the visous clan and ended up in an all out war.

Once all were fed the went into a village. not to give it away they end up getting there goal and it all lead to the vickings. I do think you will like the book if you have time to reread and consitrate. Michael Criton truly wrote a complex novel and put alot into it. He really makes you feal as though he was a vicking himself.(he wasn't 700 A.D.)If you like the movie 13th warrior make sure you do read this because,he did change it around quite a bit.Michael Criton wrote a Great book make sure you read it!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE GREAT REVIEWS FOR THIS BOOK. IT WAS NOT RIVITING, IT DID NOT KEEP ME READING, I JUST WANTED TO FINISH IT TO BE DONE WITH IT. I ALWAYS LIKE MICHAEL CRICHTON'S STORIES BUT THIS ONE WAS WEAK. THE ONLY THING I GOT OUT OF THIS WAS A LITTLE HISTORY AND THAT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING. WHAT DID I MISS?"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"The concept of the book is very interesting: taking a thousand year old manuscript of a royal Arab messenger (Ibn Fadlan), from a region of the world (Baghdad) that, at the time, was the center of refined culture, art &amp; architecture and higher learning; and describing a race, culture and climate (the Vikings) that were virtually unknown to the world. Shocking as the Viking way of life was to a foreigner, the ultimate shock was in the transformation of this Arab, and his acceptance into the brotherhood of the Viking war machine and their encounter with a race known only through its chilling terror and destruction of the Vikings when they attack under cover of &quot;the mist&quot;.While Crichton has taken artistic license in the character development and dialogue of this novel, he has footnoted Ibn Fadlan's actual 10th-century manuscript into the novel and woven a well told tale of war atrocities, unreal ritual brutalities, and wanton sexual encounters.This little known novel towers above his popular stuff: Jurassic Park and The Lost World (which are, by comparison, unreadable). Highly recommended because of its perceived authenticity and that it really is different."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"The riveting exploits of the erudite and refined Arab ambassador are the basis for what is Crichton's best work as it is based upon actual events! Many of a core of academic Arabic-speakers ranging from Muslim Spain and Muslim Sicily to Iraq (before the Mongol devastation)were carrying on the Greco-Roman tradition of exploration and compilation of scientific knowledge. Ahmad Ibn-Fadlan gives his honest views of the societies and tribes he encounters. Many are known to us today through archaeological evidence found in the Caucasus, Russia, Ukraine, and Scandanavia. What is revealing is the universal legacy of Latin (along with Greek and sometimes Persian) that remained an important language that many in the Muslim world learned and even the so-called barbarians of the extremities of outside of the Mediterannean world were exposed to this important language. The advanced civilization of the Arabic-speaking world at the time is our only link both to the Greco-Roman past (as many Greeks and Romans were converted to Islam and thus &quot;arabized&quot;) and gives us insights into the little known history of the Vikings. Ibn-Fadlan is an example an excellent observor with an open mind and the ability to describe his environment and indeed the people with superb detail. There is little hint of derision as Fadlan is forced to join a band of Vikings and he often marvels them with his ability to &quot;draw sound&quot; and he in turn comes to admire this band of stalwart warriors. The Vikings superstitions are noted by Fadlan, again with little derision and much skepticism. Though child-like in their naivete, the Vikings become Fadlan's comrades as they face various adversaries together. This is amongst the most fruitful attempts to novelize actual historical events and Crichton manages to convey Fadlan's true feelings about the entire matter, mainly fear of death, while giving us glimpses of a world we know little about."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"If you're used to the normal Crichton, you might not like this book (as seems to be a wide feeling from all the one star reviews below). This is not a page-turning thriller. It is three chapters of an an actual text an Arab wrote about his adventures with the Vikings...after which Crichton continues the tale as a fictional story he made up, but using the same writing style as that of the Arab scholar. So it is three chapters of an historical document grafted onto a fictional novel. And as someone who is very interested in cultures, I found this book a fascinating glimpse into the Viking culture from the perspective of a foreigner (an Arab). The writing style is perhaps a bit unnatural in that it reads rather awkardly as old texts tend to. But if you're the type interested in history, other cultures, and a book that shows that the Vikings were more civilized than history gives them credit for, I think you'll like this book."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This is a facinating and engrossing book!At first glance, it looks like another great weaving of history and fiction by Michael Crichton. This book makes a plausible case for the idea that the events recorded in Beowulf are perhaps based more in fact than in legend (ie, mythology). Perhaps the encounters of Beowulf and his Norsemen with the &quot;monster&quot; Grendel and his kin were in fact encounters with Neanderthals. Some anthropologists think that isolated groups of Neanderthals could have existed in remote parts of Europe into the middle ages. Also, many anthropologists think that Neanderthals were cannibals. This, of course, leads to fascinating speculations. If primitive man could survive (in isolation) into the middle ages, could he have survived (in isolation, of course) into our century? What about tales of the Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, etc.? The Eaters of the Dead make one long for another Crichton book of this genre!One word of caution, however!! The title will generate strong rections from many people! I was snug in my seat on a long flight, happily reading this book when a flight attendant walked by. That lovely lady grabbed my wrist, jerked the book out of my hand, and demanded: &quot;WHAT ARE YOU READING?!!!&quot; I patiently tried to explain that the book is a novelization of Beowulf, a literary classic. She looked at me as if to say: &quot;Yeah, right.&quot; Then she did say before walking off: &quot;You don't look like the kind of man who would read stuff like that!&quot; While I found her reaction amusing, I did notice that she kept an eye on me during the rest of the flight!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"&quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot;. The title turns off people very quickly. I have read and reread this paperback many times. I almost hate carrying it around with me because people who peek at the cover usually comment on how disgusting the book must be. When they see Crichton's name they can't believe he wrote such a thing. Usually if I can take the time to explain the Beowulf connection they soften. Most people have never read Beowulf (I have) but know enough about the poem to recognize the similarities in &quot;Eaters&quot;. I am sure Crichton is as familiar with the &quot;Beowulf&quot; poem as he is with Ibn Fadlan's manuscript of his time with the Vikings. I love the way he retells the classic story. His non-fiction approach makes the reader wish the story were more than an embellishment of the 1000 year old tale. I found myself looking for Ibn Fadlan's manuscript to try to read more about this facinating story. I highly recommend &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot;. If you love or even just interested in the &quot;Beowulf&quot; legend this book is excellent! Michael Crichton is a genius!

Like all Crichton books, it keeps your interest clear to the end! I would recommend it to anyone who likes Michael Crichton books, or to anyone who likes thrillers!"},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This is a version of Beowulf with a twist: Crichton adds a chronicler/reporter to the cast of characters who is also an outsider. So we get a sort of embedded reporters account of the Beowulf story. This book is a kind of translation of Beowulf for those not much into literature and poetry which is the majority of people. If you want a good translation in the poetic verse format that is closer to the original I recommend Burton Raffel's. I find verse and poetry to be a much deeper and more full of information with brevity, than this and other modern day prose retellings. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed reading this book, I'm a big Crichton fan in general and enjoyed the new elements that Crichton added. It's more informative, like a news story, but not close to the art of the original Beowulf."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This was the inspiration for the movie, The 13th Warrior.

OTHER WISE THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"After reading this book(Korean translation) and watching Beowulf(starred by Christopher Lambert) and The 13th Warrior(starred by Antonio Bandaras)--- all with the same story --- I got more interested in what the original epic of Beowulf reads. About 20 years ago I read a story of Danish hero and now I see it was the Beowulf story. The impression I got then was so strong -- partly because of the splendid illustrations-- and now I'm glad I can get the epic from the web freely, though I wanted a nicely bound copy and ordered it at Amazon.com. I even wish to learn the old English to read it in the original tongue, though it may be much boring. So, this book is a nice and exciting, and feasible retelling of Beowulf, anyway."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This book is an excellent story about a Muslim who unwillingly comes on an expedition with 12 vikings to kill some monsters. Vikings revere the number 13, and their prohecies say that in order to kill the monsters, the 13th warrior must be a foreigner. I thought this book was pretty good, but it had only a few flaws. It was a little slow-moving at parts, and we never know what happens after he leaves for home. But the imagery this book creates is very good."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"Too many people are hung-up on whether the contents of this book are true or made up as some big hoax. Either way Michael Crichton tells a great story. His choice of writing style makes the story more believable. Crichton stays true to his style of fast paced action and it is difficult to place this book down, once it is opened. Crichton uses explicit descriptions of orgies, sacrifices and battles wounds through-out the book. These descriptions are a necessary part of the book, for it gives the reader the full picture of the lifestyle of the Vikings.I read this book, prior to viewing the movie _The 13th Warrior_ and I re-read it afterwards. As the old clich&eacute; line goes: \\"I prefer the book to the movie.\\" The book focuses on the daily life and routines of the Vikings, through the eyes of an outsider who considers their actions \\"truly barbaric.\\"This outsider is a representative from Baghdad on a mission from his king. On his mission he meets the \\"barbarians\\" and becomes entangled in a mission to stop the evil that comes to destroy villages and the people of the North."},{"Title":"Eaters Of The Dead","review":"This is very reminiscent of Beowulf.

I still don't know where the author draws that line. The style of writing (sometimes painfully detailed scientific footnotes) would lead you to believe this is a meticulously researched scientific document and if I wasn't told otherwise I'd still believe it.

I read these books consecutively and they could easily had been packaged as one six hundred pager.This is not Lonesome Dove in several ways. Where any of the four Lonesome Dove books could be read as a stand-alone, I don't think The Wandering Hill would make any sense to someone who had not first read Sin Killer. McMurtry is also writing this series as a sort of Black Comedy. The characters are less well developed, the plot just conveniently happens and there is scant background or development. Just action and happenings.As for the Black Comedy, think of an R-rated version of the old TV show &quot;The Adams Family.&quot; Quirky characters abound, led by a loony father, unreal supporting characters and a strong female who by far possesses the most intense drive and assertiveness of any of the lot.In this book, the Berrybenders and hangers-on -- reduced by Indian attacks, self-inflicted wounds, attempted familycide and the elements -- winter on the Yellowstone River before heading South toward Santa Fe.Various Indians come into play and the fearsome &quot;The Partezon&quot; looms on the edge of the story, ready to strike havoc like Blue Duck or Mox Mox in McMurtry's other westerns. Historical figures are also woven into the plot, including Lewes and Clark's French guide Charbonneau to Kit Carson and other mountain men. The central part of the story remains the wily Tasmine, oldest of the Berrybender children and Jim Snow, aka &quot;The Sin Killer&quot; an American mountain man who alternates between remaining the wild loner of the range and being Mr. Tasmine Berrybender now that he has fathered a child by his amazing English bride - a woman he can't begin to fathom and who astounds him at every turn.This series remains quite a ride. The action -- much of involving fornication or rutting (as the characters put it) -- comes quickly and certainly page after page. Although thin with somewhat weakly drawn characters, McMurtry can still tell a good story."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"Larry McMurtry has written some stunning books, particularly in the western genre. This is not one of them. His unmistakeable style was present but he seems to be trying to parody himself--unsucessfully. I read the first book and didn't like it much, and only read this one in a pinch. At times the sections were boring and I ended up skimming over several pages.For me I need to find a character to like. Since the characters in this series are mostly vain, self-satisfied and brutish it was impossible to find anyone admirable or likeable. So therefore the rather thin plot of a group of people on a hunt through the American wilderness did not engage me. A disappointment!"},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"I had not read the first in McMurtry's Berrybender Narratives, so this book came as a complete surprise, and I have to say that it stands alone as a Western masterpiece. I don't even know where to begin to adequately describe his colorful characters, both Indian and European, and the way the tale simply bubbles along like one of the streams in the story.In a nutshell, the book begins with a very pregnant Tasmin and her \\"bad boy\\" taciturn mountain man husband in an uneasy situation. She talks to much, he doesn't talk at all. And here he is in the middle of the very voluble Berrybenders, from the old Lord who is now missing a leg, several fingers and heaven knows what else (but thankfully not, as he says, his \\"favorite appendage\\"), to the extremely foppish and whiney Bobbety (the son), to over-the-top younger sister Mary.And then there is Cook, who stands ready to provide double duty as midwife; and the laundress Millicent, who has caught more than Lord Berrybender's eye.There are tragedies and the stark reality of frontier life is certainly not glossed over, but the humor and just blank good humor of the book is entertaining in the extreme. I'm looking forward to catching up with the entire series."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"So what happens when you place an aristocratic British family and their servants, a bunch of mountain men, and various Indian tribes together in the American west?

Can Tasmin tame her dark husband, the Sin Killer, or will the harsh life of the plains tame her? Will Lord Berrybender ever get the servants and women to stop being so american and start following his orders again? Will any of them make it out of the west alive? These questions kept me turning the pages of this book 2 of the Berrybender Narratives even though I never read Book 1.This story is not about cowboys and indians.

By the end of this second installment in the series, Tasmin is well-established as one of the great McMurtry characters, and the supporting cast of various mountain men and Indians, and the hilarious Lord Berrybender, offer much entertainment.

I read all of the LD sequels; each diminished from the original.It was exciting, then, to read The Sin Killer, because it seemed as though McMurtry had cleared the decks, was freshly inspired and was attacking the subject of the West from a whole new vantage point. Now, with The Wandering Hill, I think he's written his best books in many years. I think he has done better than this with his dialogue and his characterizations (always his strongest suit) and the indistinguishable sprawling cast seems mainly to provide the writer with cannon fodder-people to kill to spare the main characters. (Some of the cast members remind me of red-shirted Star Trek security guys who won't survive the adventure.) Having said that, a satisfying package is here. I don't like waiting another two years for two more books, but I'll snap them up as soon as they're released. Good job to Larry McMurtry."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"\\"The Wandering Hill\\" is the 30th book by Larry McMurtry that I have read. His best work was his early books through \\"Lonesome Dove\\". Since his heart attack, he seems to have lost his ability to write about \\"normal\\" people, preferring, instead, a cast of zany characters with a token normal person or two. I have not cared for this outrageous personnel and keep reading his latest books out of some sort of sense of loyalty. I was disappointed with the cast of the Berrybender's first novel, \\"Sin Killer\\", but read \\"The Wandering Hill\\" because it takes place a few miles from my home. Indeed, the visiting nobility (Berrybenders aside) are familiar names to local historians but their activities in the book don't match those of local lore.I was getting frustrated with these crazy, obnoxious folks when it occurred to me that McMurtry is resurrecting the old Western \\"Dime Novel\\". The basic outline is there; use famous names to get the reader's attention but make up everything else. The Dime Novel idea that the more outlandish the story the better also fits right into McMurtry's style of late. What I can't figure out is whether or not Larry McMurtry is doing this on purpose (as some sort of tribute to that \\"genre\\") or has his talent evaporated to this level.The essential problem with McMurtry, of late, is that his works lack depth. The \\"action\\" in these recent Westerns seem like what you'd get if Sergio Leone was directing the Keystone Cops. McMurtry's strength, for me, was always the relationships his characters had with one another. We were generally glad to meet up with the same characters in future novels. We start to get some of that quality of work in \\"The Wandering Hill\\" in the last 50-60 pages but it wasn't enough. Since they've left my neck of the woods, I don't care to meet up with the Berrybenders again."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"Hard to put down once you start reading. Another first class novel by Larry McMurtry - my favorite author"},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"If you enjoyed The Sin Killer, you're wondering what happened to the many people left in cliff hangar situations. The Wandering Hill will answer all of those questions and leave you with new cliff hangars to keep you plowing forward into By Sorrow's River, book 3 in the Berrybender saga.If you haven't read The Sin Killer, please do go back. This will be a two star book without background to make you more interested in the characters.The Wandering Hill refers to a Native American belief that a certain hill is filled with devils that will attack anyone who comes too near. Naturally, that means the wandering hill threatens danger . . . if not death. The omen turns out to be prescient in this story.At the end of The Sin Killer, the Berrybender party was headed for a trading post to winter after their steamship was stuck in the frozen Missouri. Lord Berrybender's valet was enjoying life as a presumed Buffalo man (a god-like creature to the Native Americans) with two fat wives to keep him warm.The Wandering Hill is a more sober and tragic story. Tasmin Berrybender and her husband, Jim Snow (the Sin Killer), try to adapt to married life as Tasmin carries their first child. Tasmin finds Jim's rebukes for swearing no less annoying than in The Sin Killer . . . and she eventually fortifies herself to do something about it. Jim finds Tasmin's constant need to ask philosophical questions nearly drives him mad. He finds Tasmin a poor substitute for a squaw wife except when it comes to \\"rutting\\". He continues to dislike indoor life, and they settle into a drafty tent for the winter. Tasmin finds herself wondering what she really wants from marriage.The Buffalo man meets a terrible end at the hands of the Partezon, a Sioux chief. Mary develops a weird relationship with an older man that seems intended for comic relief while making fun of Old World \\"sophistication\\".Lord Berrybender becomes even more easily offended and strikes out in ever more dangerous ways. He becomes even more a figure of ridicule in this book than in The Sin Killer.New characters are added to this picaresque chronicle as more mountain men join the group at the trading post, we meet more Native Americans andThe story reaches a climax when the trading post comes under unexpected attack.This book is much darker than The Sin Killer . . . and not nearly as humorous. Much like a long winter spent on the plains, it's a little on the boring side. The occasional humorous flap and joke are much appreciated . . . but there really isn't enough of either."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"The Larry McMurtry of \\"Lonesome Dove\\" renown delivers on his promise of great storytelling in this second volume of the Berrybender narratives. As master of the bizarre in characterization, McMurtry takes the mountain men tales of real life characters like a young Kit Carson and laces them around the lives of the fictional English noble, Lord Albany Berrybender and his children and servants, and presents a rousingly good story.In fact, picking up where \\"Sin Killer\\" left off, this book leads the reader into the next phase of exploration along the Yellowstone River in 1833, with the likes of the son of Sacajawea and his father, a Scots noble, a Dutch botanist, the artist George Catlin, a German prince, and a most unlikely cast of frontiersmen and Indians.The lustful romance between Tasmin Berrybender and her spouse Jim Snow, the Sin Killer, center the story, but they are just a part of the whole. There is not a dull character in the lot. Each Berrybender, and there are still a lot of them remaining, is a unique rounder. The mountain men live up to their legendary mythos. And the Indian nations exhibit the curious position of those being victimized by the ensuing white man invasion. Their reactions represent a spectrum of violence, manipulation, and partial coexistence. But Indians and the beasts of the wild keep the level of suspense ever present. Even the superstitious belief in the impending doom from sighting a wandering hill, foreshadows the possible danger lurking around each part of the journey.This vivid cast of larger-than-life beings, lives life to the fullest in the most earthy manner, exhibiting quirks that parallel the folks appearing on talk shows of today. Despite a severely hampered and diminishing physical being, Lord Berrybender commands his entourage on this great \\"safari\\" into the American northwest, as he wastes the virginal plains of its four-legged bounty, and uses up all things of the flesh and of nature to sate his own boundless mania.One can only imagine this story put to film. For it would be unforgettable, indeed. The cast truly rivals those of the earlier \\"Lonesome Dove\\" saga. And one can hardly wait for McMurtry to publish the third tome of the set. Excellent adventure, unforgettable characters, fascinating plot."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"Wandering Hill is the second novel in a series detailing the adventures of the rich, aristocratic, and eccentric Berrybender family, travelling across the Great Plains toward Santa Fe. The time is the early 1830s, and the naive English troup encounters many memorable characters, including Kit Carson, the painter George Catlin, a fearsome Sioux war chief named Partezon, and an assortment of quirky mountain men. The story is part unromanticized view of old West and part satire of the English class system, with the pompous Lord Berrybender dragging his family and retainers through one dangerous situation after another while doggedly seeking out more game to hunt and kill.At the core of the novels is the love triangle between beautiful, brash Tasmin Berrybender, her ferocious frontiersman husband Jim Snow, and fur trapper Pomp Charbonneau. Tasmin's stormy relationship with her wandering husband is part bittersweet romance, part soap opera. I saw some similarities with the love triangle in Gone With the Wind: Tasmin is reminiscent of the feisty Scarlet O'Hara, Jim Snow shares Rhett Butler's sexual appeal and hint of danger, and Pomp-like the cerebral Ashley Wilkes-is a man of cool temperament that our heroine has difficulty rousing to passion.McMurtry spins a great yarn, although I felt the characters in this series were more shallowly drawn than in some of his other novels. Nevertheless, I couldn't stop reading because I had to know what became of them. (And in typical McMurtry style, their fates are often bizarre.) I also feel McMurtry has gotten in a bit of a rut depicting Native Americans, who seem (in his novels) to approach situations with all the mental sophistication of 11-year old boys. Many secondary characters are recognizable historical figures, but it's sometimes frustrating to not know where fact leaves off and fiction begins. I'm not sure why McMurtry didn't simply create some fictional names, rather than have real-world people meet historically inaccurate fates. For example, it's interesting to note that the real Scotsman, William Drummond Stewart, actually returned home (with a small herd of buffalo) in the late 1830s to be laird of his manor. He died in 1871, leaving the family estates to an illegitimate son whose mother was a Dallas saloon keeper. A fun read, but take everything with a grain of salt!"},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"Do yourself a favor and read these four books in order; they make much more sense that way.

He hires on some guides and heads out into the wilderness full of Indian tribes who may or may not welcome them, animals that may or may not attack them, and challenging weather conditions that may or may not kill them. The contrasts between the well bred British and the mountain men are stark at first, but the differences don't seem so great after they have all experienced disease, winter, drought, and attacks together. I call this \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" because many of these characters are bigger than life and comical in their eccentricities. This is not a criticism; it makes the characters lively and entertaining. I enjoyed this series very much."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"Some people have indelible styles which either attract or disgust the reader. I think McMurtry is one such author.His topics are the stuff that he apparently knows - America's hardest Americans. The frontiersmen, who came upon our plains which only Indians before walked, are the topic. The untamed lands were covered with buffalo herds, beavers and more. But, as stated in this novel, the numbers dwindled with the trappers' successes, and the frontier was agonizingly and far-too-quickly becoming a memory.This apparently is part of a series, but anyone can pick this up without having read the prior novel. The Berrybender clan of this book delivers British pompousness against the mountain backdrop. Their haughtiness contrasts well against the simple but survival mentality of white men called Sin Killer and more by the Indians.Although this is fictional work, it may seem more nonfictional as historical figures are woven into the plot's fabric: e.g. Lewis and Clark's Charbonneau and American hero Kit Carson. I am not sure their characters are accurately portrayed, but I assume the author would attempt to match their qualities as he could best do.McMurtry is more than a cowboy-book author. He wrote great novels and the film adaptations of his best works,Hud(from the novelHorseman, Pass By), the Peter Bogdanovich-directedThe Last Picture Show; James L. Brooks'sTerms of Endearment: A Novel, and his Pulitzer-prize winningLonesome Dove. With the exception of last named work, all of the novels concern 20th century Texas or south. This book and its accompanying works focus upon the grandparents' or great grandparents' generation of these novels' famous characters.I have noticed some criticism of this book by some readers. And, if one seeks to compare this novel to Terms or Last Picture or Lonesome - you would be disappointed. But, that contrast does not deliver failure. This is a lesser book when compared to a great book.If one were to criticize this author - readTelegraph Days. That is inferior. But, it - like this novel - is a well-above-average cowboy book. And, when I pick up novels like this, I expect something less. I know that cowboy literature is not Shakespeare - not even the equivalent to some of McMurtry's better known novels. And, for that reason I enjoyed this novel and will read the other Berrybender novels."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"This is the second in the Berrybender series and like the first, my impression of it changed dramatically and I'm not sure when or why. In both this book and in Sinkiller, my feeling throughout that it was too episodic in nature as to almost be disjointed and the characters were so unlikeable, I didn't care what happened to them anyway. In this installment as in the first, however, by the end I found I was enjoying the book and contemplating the next installment. The greatest advice I can give about this book is that if you start it, finish it. It truly needs to be evaluated in its entirety."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"I skippedSin Killer: A Novel (The Berrybender Narratives)(the first in the series) and started with this book, the follow-on in the series (perhaps I'll go back and pick up the first at some point -- though I'm largely undecided). Second in a a four part series, this one seemed slow to me right off and I could have put it down a dozen times, I thought, because the narrative seemed to lack a driving force, a reason for me to keep reading. It was largely a strung-together series of loosely linked episodes, recounted from the perspectives of the various characters in the cast. And yet I didn't put it down and, finally, ended up reading it in a single day. It isn't a long book and it lacks the sense of great tragedy and the pathos of McMurtry'sLonesome Dove: A Novel, the Western tale that stands out for me among all McMurtry's works in the genre. But this one had something.The Wandering Hill follows the doings and, of course, the wanderings of the Berrybender clan, consisting of the English Lord Albany Berrybender and his horde of offspring and servants as they wend their way west to sate the old man's comically clumsy tastes for adventure and satisfaction in all things (from good claret to women to shooting at whatever moves). The main character around whom much of the narrative is built, however, and to whom we return again and again despite the many excursions into others' points of view, is Lady Tasmin Berrybender, the feisty and self-willed eldest daughter of Lord Berrybender. Tasmin having married a wild untameable mountain man in the earlier volume, Jim Snow, known among friend and foe alike as the Sin Killer, now must struggle to adjust to the choice of mate she has made for herself.Jim Snow is the product of a brutal and lonely childhood, taken and raised first by Indians and later by a harsh Christian preacher who, after adopting him out of \\"charity,\\" proceeded to beat the hell out of him to expunge the devil. Impartially administering the same treatment to his actual kin, including his wife, and to his various parishioners, the preacher was apparently struck down and deep fried by a bolt of lightning which left Jim's adopted ma deranged and Jim, himself, imprinted with an aversion to sin and prone to fits of sacred fury when confronted by it. But Jim has only a limited education and his knowledge of the bible and its nuances reflect that. Still he is a good man, when not in one of his sin killing rages, and something of a heart throb for the Lady Tasmin to boot, leading her to passionate desire for her man, when he isn't smacking her around for a somewhat foul mouth. (The matter of his strict enforcement of respectable language preys on the lady and will lead to her own vengeful response by book's end.)Delighting in her lovemaking with the handsome, magnetic Sin Killer, Tasmin is also estranged from him because of his bewildering penchant for violence, even with her. Against the backdrop of these two people and their efforts to find one another within the strange marriage they have made, we're given the world of the mountainmen and the plainsmen in the 1830's American West as it might have been. The actors include famous Westerners like Jim Bridger, Kit Carson, Toussaint Charbonneau, George Caitlin (the Western painter) and many more.The events in which the Berrybender party -- replete with butlers, cooks, laundresses, gunsmiths and so on (many having died off by the time this volume's installment occurs) -- participate seem to have been lifted from the annals of real Western history though the Berrybenders appear to be invented additions. This second installment of the Berrybenders in the West opens to find them stranded at a trading post in the dead of winter somewhere off the Missouri River, Lord Berrybender having lost a leg and his wife (the Lady Constance) in the earlier tale but not having forsaken his lustful ways or his willful misuse and abuse of the people around him. Lady Tasmin, for her part, is busy trying to accommodate herself to Jim Snow's ways as the whole party waits out the winter.In the early going the story seemed a mite disjointed but, as McMurtry moves us skillfully from one actor's perspective to another, the tale grows together and the characters become real and compelling. How they manage to face so much seemingly senseless violence and the harshness of the frontier ultimately carries the tale forward.Instead of going back downriver with the spring thaw, after having barely survived the frozen river, the selfishly incompetent libertine, Lord Berrybender, decides to push on in hopes of shooting at more big game (a bad shot he rarely, if ever, hits anything he's actually aiming at), despite the losses his party has already endured. Jim Snow and Kit Carson agree to take the Berrybenders west and south to Santa Fe (still Mexican territory in those days) with an eye toward putting them on a vessel out of New Orleans to take them home to Europe. Babies are born over the winter and the proximity of the men and women, in the close quarters of the trading post (and, later, on the journey west), lead to all manner of complications and liaisons, which only promise to increase in complexity in future installments. In the meantime Indian attacks and the vagaries of the wilderness continue to prove daunting obstacles, even to as hardy a bunch of holy fools as the Berrybenders.As with many of McMurtry's Westerns we're treated here to an array of grotesques, from crazy old Greasy Lake, the Indian medicine man and prophet (even his own people can't stand him), to the white-hating Sioux war chief, The Partezon, and the heedless Ute chief Walkura who is finally pushed to action near the book's end by the irritating ravings of Greasy Lake, leading to an abortive Indian raid that will mean the end for some of the characters and the unaccountable survival of others. With McMurtry's Western tales death often comes suddenly, out of the blue and, at times, with terrible violence. But almost always there is an eerie matter-of-factness to it all, leaving us speechless before the doings of the heedless universe.And so it is with The Wandering Hill. Taking its title from a mythical mound peopled by ancient devils which the Western tribes imagine moves about the countryside and whose apparition signals terrible things to come for those who see it, this image forms the focal point of the latter part of the book. A number of the characters in the tale have the unfortunate experience of seeing the mysterious mound, with its lone tree upon its summit, although few are sure that they have -- except for old Greasy Lake (he gets his name from the foul smelling grease he smears on his flesh to ward off mosquitos). He thinks he has seen the wandering hill more frequently than others and, believing in its significance more fervently than most, he is finally moved to report the matter to Chief Walkura and the Ute council, leading to a violent and largely senseless denouement.The Wandering Hill grew on me as I read it and while it lacks the resonance Lonesome Dove had, so did the various prequels, and the sequel, McMurtry wrote to THAT book. After all, a great masterwork doesn't come along everyday, especially to the same writer. But The Wandering Hill is a fine addition to McMurtry's Western opus; the characters are interesting and subtly drawn on a scale and with a dimension that warrants the continuation of their tale.Stuart W. Mirskyauthor ofThe King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"This is the second in a series of novels about the Berrybender family's adventures in the American West during the mid-19th century. I especially enjoyed listening to the CD version as each part is read in the character's voice, and this book is full of characters. It is especially entertaining to watch the father pursue his two main loves: hunting buffalo and young women. Its not for the faint of heart, with graphic violence and raw language."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"This book will make very little sense to you if you haven't yet read Sin Killer. The second of the Berrybender series is just as exciting as the first. I feel that McMurtry is unfairly compared to Lonesome Dove in every other work he does. This is not Lonesome Dove and should not be compared to it. It goes without saying that LD is his best (although Zeke and Ned is my favorite) but it certainly is far from his only work.Without skipping a beat the story of the eccentric, odd, and always entertaining Berrybender clan picks up where the first left off. New and unexpected story lines continue to impress and entertain me as they always do. This series has a direct link to our present as well. Making it abundantly clear that every persons actions affect others in positive and negative ways and lest we forget we are all linked together one way or another.A great series that should not be overlooked."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"This book picks up right where &quot;Sin Killer&quot; left off. Literally. I read these books consecutively and they could easily had been packaged as one six hundred pager.This is not &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; in several ways. Where any of the four Lonesome Dove books could be read as a stand-alone, I don't think The &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; would make any sense to someone who had not first read Sin Killer. McMurtry is also writing this series as a sort of Black Comedy. The characters are less well developed, the plot just conveniently happens and there is scant background or development. Just action and happenings.As for the Black Comedy, think of an R-rated version of the old TV show &quot;The Adams Family.&quot; Quirky characters abound, led by a loony father, unreal supporting characters and a strong female who by far possesses the most intense drive and assertiveness of any of the lot.In this book, the Berrybenders and hangers-on -- reduced by Indian attacks, self-inflicted wounds, attempted familycide and the elements -- winter on the Yellowstone River before heading South toward Santa Fe.Various Indians come into play and the fearsome &quot;The Partezon&quot; looms on the edge of the story, ready to strike havoc like Blue Duck or Mox Mox in McMurtry's other stories. Historical figures are also woven into the plot from Lewes and Clark's French guide Charbonneau to Kit Carson and other mountain men. The central part of the story remains the wily Tasmine, oldest of the Berrybender children and Jim Snow, aka &quot;The Sin Killer&quot; an American mountain man who alternates between remaining the wild loner of the range and Mr. Tasmine Berrybender now that he has fathered a child by his amazing English bride - a woman he can't begin to fathom and who astounds him at every turn.This series remains quite a ride. The action -- much of involving fornication or rutting (as the characters put it) -- comes quickly and certainly page after page. Although thin with somewhat weakly drawn characters, McMurtry can still tell a good story."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"Larry McMurtry's The Wandering Hill is the second installment of his proposed tetralogy following a wealthy English family and their trek to the west in the 1830's. Whereas the first novel, Sin Killer, started slow and revealed a zany, action-packed tone, Hill charges straight out of the gates but mellows eventually to attach the reader closer to the glorious characters. This tetralogy is essentially one giant novel that will equal Lonesome Dove in characters and story. The writing combines subtle humor, fast-paced action, and startling violence that brings the reader directly into the savage world. If you have read Sin Killer, pick up The Wandering Hill immediately. If you haven't read Sin Killer, pick up both books and lose yourself in the exciting yet tragic world McMurtry has created."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"By his own reckoning, Larry McMurtry is past his literary prime. Nearly 12 years after a heart bypass surgery plunged him into an abyss of depression, and 17 years beyond his Pulitzer Prize-winning magnum opus, &#65533;Lonesome Dove,&#65533; McMurtry has not evaded that single harshest criticism of his fiction: His own. He knows he&#65533;s not in top form and he admits it.In his autobiographical &#65533;Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen,&#65533; he revealed two things, one intentional, one not: He considers himself only a shadow of what he once was, the greatest western novelist of his generation. The second, unintentional revelation? His non-fiction of the past decade has far surpassed his fiction.Comes now &#65533;The Wandering Hill,&#65533; sequel to &#65533;Sin Killer&#65533; and second in a four-part series about a the eccentric and dysfunctional Berrybender family and its motley coterie -- British nobles in search of adventure, big-game hunting and sex -- as they explore the virgin West of the 1830s.For historical-fiction readers, and especially for fans of the Lewis and Clark era, McMurtry populates this book with supporting characters straight out of Western legend: real-life mountain men Kit Carson, Jim Bridger, Tom Fitzpatrick and Hugh Glass, Scottish adventurer William Drummond Stewart, frontier artists George Catlin and Karl Bodmer, trader William Ashley, and Pomp Charbonneau, the son of Sacagawea.Partly because &#65533;The Wandering Hill&#65533; ends, in effect, only halfway through the saga, its denouement is underwhelming. The Berrybender adventures are plucked from various unrelated historical accounts. Considered separately, they illustrate the moments of terror the frontier likely held, but the trip often seems as aimless as the Berrybenders&#65533; journey through unexplored territory.It&#65533;s difficult to know whether the Berrybenders are ultimately headed to a geographical Eden or some abstract encounter with destiny, or both. One might look at this saga as a kind of western serial, but &#65533;The Wandering Hill&#65533; doesn&#65533;t close at the edge of a cliff, rather on less dramatic footing.If McMurtry&#65533;s &#65533;tetralogy&#65533; follows its pre-ordained literary path -- a tetralogy is four related literary works, traditionally three tragedies followed by a comedy -- the destination might be more interesting than the journey. &#65533;Sin Killer&#65533; and &#65533;The Wandering Hill,&#65533; with their promise of more to come, feel a lot like historical fluff floating on a wayward breeze.Like Larry McMurtry himself, the Berrybender narratives pale by comparison to earlier greatness. Tasmin Berrybender is no Gus McCrae and Jim Snow is no Sam the Lion."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"Larry McMurtry's The Wandering Hill is quite an enjoyable tale, not quite as good as Sin Killer, but still excellent. I wouldn't however recommend Wandering Hill to anyone who didn't enjoy Sin Killer, nor would I recommend it to anyone who only wants to read another Lonesome Dove. The Berrybender Narratives are a group of novels unto themselves, not really like anything else McMurtry has ever done. McMurtry's excellent writing is still there and the novel will certainly make you chuckle. Sin Killer had a more thematically pulled together feel, while The Wandering Hill does wander, as it were, a bit more. We meet up with the Berrybenders and there varied entourage at a trading post in the American west in the 1830s. Tasmin and her husband Jim, have a bit of a spat and he takes off into the wilderness, leaving a pregnant Tasmin to fend for herself. Lord Berrybender is still his same eccentric self and the rest of the characters are equally as nutty. Some bits of the writing isn't quite as strong as it should be, but all in all, this is still a strong novel and worth reading if it is what you are looking for."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"You can read this as a stand-alone book, but I think it's better if you read it as it's intended: the second in a 4-book series, The Berrybender Narratives. It's a comic melodrama, typical of some of McMurtry's best stuff, that grabs up some unwashed heathens from the mountains and some arrogant English nobs, stirs them altogether on the banks of the Yellowstone River in the middle of the 1800s, and then stands back to watch with high glee as they try to get everything straightened out. Think of it as an American Western soap opera, and you won't be far wrong.Enjoy it; it's not great literature, but it's a great read."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"I am really trying to like this trilogy--thus this was the reason I forged headlong into the second book of the Berrybender family. I was not disappointed. The Berrybender family is what made the American West WILD.This erstwhile second tome continues the wandering of the Berrybender family finding them at a trading post waiting for spring to arrive so they can again go on their trip across through the old American West (their Wild West). As usual, they are arguing with each other and with others - the others being an assorted of local fur trappers and renegades. Tasmin is waiting for her child to be born while her father, having most of his appendages shot off (except the important one) thereby becoming mad as a hatter.Along with this, Mary and Bobbety get randy in their own right continuing the insatisable sexual appetities of the Berrybender family into the next generation.This book is not at all like Lonesome Dove, but more like a farcical rendition of Lonesome Dove. Read it, and enjoy the Wild West through the eyes of the Berrybender family."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"The story continues with the Berrybender clan, one of the most interesting and dysfunctional groups ever tackled by the famed western author, Larry McMurtry.On a par with Book 1: Sin Killer, The Wandering Hill continues the well-written story of the plains of the frontier complete with Kit Carson. I can't wait for book 3."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"Throughout most of this book it seemed like a four star effort, not quite up to the hilarious standard set by Sin Killer, the first in this series. The Wandering Hill is not hilarious. It's a good action story with interesting and very unusual characters.The final chapter of the book is what earns that final fifth star. It is an awesome scene involving Pomp Charboneau, Tasmin Berrybender, and Pomp's deceased mother Sacagawea. I could see it in a movie, bringing tears to everyone's eyes, including Tasmin's.There is a sort of humor in death. Larry McMurtry kills his characters off more than just occasionally, and those he doesn't kill he will often maim. One of the oddest scenes I've ever read involves Lord Berrybender, his son Bobbetty, and a fork in the father's hand. Poor Bobbetty really gets it in this story, harmless and silly though the teenager is. He seems like a nice enough kid to me, completely unsuited to the wild, but having lots of fun, come what may.Tasmin is still the star of the book, as she was in Sin Killer. She's amazing.I'm really glad I discovered this series. Sin Killer just showed up in a drawer. I don't know who bought it or how it got there. It had been sitting there for a long time, maybe years."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"This second book in the Berrybender Narratives is even wackier and woolier than the first book.I read Sin Killer over a year ago,see my review dated November 30,2003.I purposedly decided to wait till I had the other three books before continuing.I am glad I made this decision because there are so many characters and stories involved ,that if too much time passes the story will get too foggy,at least for me.I strongly recommend that one reads them in order and read them as close together as you can.Also,the multitude of characters makes it necessary to keep a \\"scorebook\\".Larry helps by giving a list of characters in the front of each book.I tagged it and added notes as I read the book.All these characters are going to be great when the time comes,and it will,to turn the books into a movie or TV series.I am sure it will be every bit as good as Lonesome Dove.As you read this book,never mind what's coming in the next chapter,of which there are 60,this book moves so fast,you never know what to expect in the next paragraph.It's a very fast paced read,with lots of great lines and statements.However,every so often Larry throws in some word to keep us on our toes.For instance:lachryymosepudendumbastinadoedOverall,McMurtry at his best!"},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"In THE WANDERING HILL,Volume Two of the four volumes of the Berrybender narratives, McMurtry begins to polish and sculpt his delicious cavalcade of characters out of the American West. (Don't start here though. Begin by reading THE SIN KILLER and continue through the 4 books in order. The story is vast as the western sky, an odyssey, and it requires the length and breadth of all four books to get \\"home\\".) The cast includes an oscillating number of the unpredictable, aristocratic Berrybender family; Jim Snow (the Sin Killer); and a thoroughly entertaining parade of European explorers, mountain men and Indians. This series is \\"compare and contrast\\" gone wild: Old World/New World, nature/civilization, human/animal, male/female, adult/child, wild/domesticated, free/enslaved, alive/dead, young/old, European/American, white/Indian, crazy/sane, servant/master, safety/danger, historical fact/myth, tragedy/comedy and so on. McMurtry has neatly sandwiched genuine historical characters (who develop quite complex fictional personalities) and events of the 1830's into this western salad. I recommend THE WANDERING HILL for its entertainment value as well as its delineation of personalities that survive and thrive (or not) in the New World. While Cormac McCarty's ALL THE PRETTY HORSES illustrates the solitary visual beauty of man and nature in the American West, McMurtry's gift in The Berrybender Narratives is the clash and complexity of colliding souls and civilizations. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"This book will be a dissapointment to Lonesome Dove fans. I did not see character development to speak of, action was absent, plot was thin, and after 400 pages, I was still waiting for some excitement.

As in Sin Killer, the humor runs deep, and so do the references to violent and gory acts on the western plains of 1833. The clan of English Lord Berrybender continues its time in the wild west, with daughter Tasmin the central figure and married to the Sin Killer, Jim Snow. She bears a child and faces his famous emotional outbursts with a very sharp tongue and English gentry outlook not familiar or comfortable to Jim. Also preset are trappers Kit Carson and Jim Bridger, painter George Catlin, Charbonneau of Lewis and Clark fame and the son, Pomp, he ostensibly had with Sacajawea, and others who may or may not have really existed, including many Indians (Blue Thunder existed, but Greasy Lake or Little Onion? Who knows?). Then there's the Wandering Hill of the title, a mythical moving hill that's an omen of death to Indian cultures. There's lots of action here, more than a smattering of humor, some quite bawdy, much on cultural and male/female relationships, and enough historical figures and what seems to be historically accurate detail to make this a lot of fun. Next, coming soon, book three, By Sorrow's River."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"This is quite a vivid depiction of life on the frontier and the contrast between the wealthy, spoiled Europeans, the frontier men who fed and protected the Europeans and the Indians.

It is an interesting read though."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"The Wandering Hill is part two of a four-part series chronicaling the adventures of the aristocratic, English Berrybender family exploring the American West in the 1830's on a steamship on the Missouri River. Lord Berrybender is accompanied by his gluttonous wife and six of his 14 legitimate children. The series is historical fiction in that it incorporates actual people such as Kit Carson, Jim Bridges, yet the tales are so fanciful that history is left in the dust.Outrageous is the best general characterization of these stories. The adventures and their characters seem larger than life and more colorful than neon. Not for the faint of heart, unexpected, random, senseless and disturbing atrocities, injuries, and deaths litter these tales, with a side of lots of \\"rutting.\\" The majority of the initial primary characters do not survive to see bookfour4 of the series.Yet, the stories grabbed me. I went through the series like popcorn, wanting to see what amazing events would occur to the crazy Berrybenders and their growing entourage. The series is intense, rollercoastering through every facet of human emotion and many aspects of abnormal psychology. Nothing dull in these books. The frequent connections to actual historical persons and events keep the tales interesting and grounded, despite the continuum of bizarre incidents. Not for everyone, but I liked it."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"This is one book I could put down. Seems like every paragraph was in some way related to sex. Who was wanting who or who had who. Didn't appear a plot to the entire book. Save your money and don't but this stinker."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"I want to give this 4 stars but a computer glitch is preventing it!Once again, as is the case in most McMurtry books, I was entranced by the characters in The Wandering Hill and by McMurtry's ability to tell a story or in this case many stories intertwined. Each person is described uniquely and the situations involving the people are consistent with the characters being portrayed. This makes for a realistic read in spite of the seemingly shocking and often perceived unrealistic events. Since the world being portrayed is somewhat unknown to the modern reader, we quickly accept the situations and find ourselves sympathizing and smiling with the people involved. This makes for a page-turner with an urge to know what is about to happen. Funny, tragic, energetic, entertaining, and personal, The Wandering Hill has something for everyone.Yet, I was disturbed by the lack of purpose (one could argue that the people's lives in the West is the purpose) to their journey as well as the maddening lack of moral or political statements. I continue to appreciate this trait of McMurtry's writing, but also desire to read a tale that makes some kind of moral judgment about human behavior. Still, a fun read in all respects."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"As entertaining as Sin Killer, I couln't put it down."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"Aimless wandering seems to be the theme of THE WANDERING HILL, and it suffers for it.First off, the &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; is a small, conical mound, topped by a single tree, inhabited by large-headed devils who, according to plains-Indian legend, loose deadly grass-bladed arrows at passersby. The devils have the ability to move the hill from place to place via the wind, and its appearance is Heap Bad Medicine. Yeah, ok, but it's not given such significant play that it's worth getting excited about. Trust me.This novel is the second in the Berrybender series, the first being SIN KILLER. Berrybender is Lord Albany Berrybender, an Englishmen who's come to the Great Plains of the 1830s to hunt accompanied by his wife Constance, six of their fourteen brats, the talking parrot Prince Talleyrand, and a rabble of servants, all traveling up the Yellowstone River by steamboat. By THE WANDERING HILL, Constance, one of the offspring, and several employees are dead or missing. The eldest of Berrybender's children along for the ride, daughter Tasmin, has married the Sin Killer, aka Jim Snow, a young, closed-mouthed, and excessively God-fearing trapper whose attitude towards his new wife, outside of their lovemaking, is boorish at best.The biggest problem with the Berrybender series to date, and THE WANDERING HILL in particular, is that there's no strong unifying thread to the storyline. In McMurtry's magnificent LONESOME DOVE, there were also many subplots to be sure, but all eventually tied into Gus McCrae's and Woodrow Call's cattle drive from South Texas to Montana. In the Berrybender saga, we have only the intent of Lord Albany to continue on with his hunting expedition, which is proving to be a weak nail on which to hang the continuing story. In THE WANDERING HILL, they don't get far at all. Having left the confines of the riverboat, the Berrybender party spends over half the book at an Indian trading post, where Tasmin and Venetia Kennet, the group's cellist, have babies. Then, after some aimless wandering about, they subsequently all set off to an annual trapper rendezvous in the Rocky Mountain foothills.THE WANDERING HILL even lacks a decent villain. In LONESOME DOVE, it was Blue Duck, a murderous half-breed. In SIN KILLER, it was Draga, a psychopathic, old, Aleut-Russian squaw who'd made it down to the Lower Forty-Eight. In this book, there's only relatively passing reference to The Partezon, a vicious Sioux chief on the rampage with a war party. Otherwise, the biggest danger is posed by the sudden appearance of several thousand stampeding buffalo. Yawn.Since the overall direction of storyline is unremarkable, the reader must find limited enjoyment in the depiction of the various characters. And pickings are slim when it comes to engaging personae. Tasmin, the Lord's strong-willed, resilient daughter, is the most appealing of all. Next is perhaps Kit Carson, who, at this stage of his legendary career, is a tongue-tied, shy youth prone to complaining about minor hardships. Then there's the precocious, four-year old Kate Berrybender, who manages to win the heart of Jim Snow, who is, in my opinion, too much of a jerk to be a heroic figure. Lord Berrybender himself is so disagreeable a person that I wish he'd just die off or get killed. No such luck.One newly introduced character whom I hope gets a larger role in the next book, BY SORROW'S RIVER, is the Sin Killer's inscrutable and too young Ute wife, Little Onion.Despite my ambivalent feelings towards this second volume in the series, I'm certain that I'll continue reading to the end because of the plucky Tasmin. If a film is ever made of the Berrybender narratives, then I'd recommend Cate Blanchett for the role.This series isn't Larry McMurtry at his best, but it's adequate diversion for the beach or the morning train commute."},{"Title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"This book was a waste of time. I kept hoping it would get better, that some purpose or plot would develop -- but nothing. The writing is juvenille and embarrassingly obvious.

The victim's seventeen years old girlfriend Amy Sterling becomes concerned about him because he never made it to the police station. Amy thinks nasty peer Zeb Mulroney, who she dated until she saw his abusive side, kidnapped Nate, but no one believes her as the evidence including two eye witnesses from the school points to his cousin Buck.Amy's mother Lucinda persuades former El Paso cop, her tenant and lover Devon Gray to investigate. Reluctantly he does to pacify the teen as much as he also likes her and her mother. Accompanied by the two females who have given him a reason to live, Devon searches the nearby mountain roads for the missing lad. However, unbeknownst to him or the local police Zeb is the mastermind behind the abduction as he plans to hurt Nate for going out with his girl.This is an intriguing regional thriller that moves on several paths to include a minor police procedural, a major private investigation, and a chilling abuse of the victim by his kidnappers. The story line grips the audience who wonder what Zeb will do next, but it is the deep cast to include a young drifter that turns ENDLESS RIVER into a fine Texas thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Life Under a Leaky Roof","review":"I picked this book up on a whim without knowing much about it, and I'm glad I did! You don't have to be a do-it-yourself wizard or even a homeowner to appreciate the insights in this book. The book's title implies that the book is about houses, but the subject matter is really oriented around family--if you are part of or have ever been part of a pleasantly dysfunctional family, you will recognize truths about yourself.The book is a collection of very short and informally written humorous essays. David Owen writes with a lot of heart and I often found myself laughing out loud. It was hard to put this book down! The stories are consistently humorous without being sarcastic or biting--and the reason they're so funny is that I can recognize aspects of myself and the people I know in every one of them. The author has put his finger on the pulse of everyday things, and has found truth and goodness there.This book is an excellent, heartwarming, and funny expose of the foibles and ridiculous tendencies that make us human; I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Salmon and His People: Fish and Fishing in Nez Perce Culture","review":"Books about fish customarily fall into two categories: biology texts that treat the animals like biochemical systems and fishing books that treat them like cunning prey (the better to rationalize the angler's heroism). &quot;Salmon and His People&quot; is another kind of book entirely-a complex look at how the salmon has figured in Nez Perce tribal origin stories, tribal history, tribal religion, tribal stewardship, and how the animal has fared under the dubious stewardship of the Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and National Marine Fisheries Service.The voices telling this complicated story are multiple, as are the perspectives: tribal storytellers, biologists, fishermen, children, policymakers. Salmon is not treated as an isolated creature but is instead viewed within a finely wrought network of other water animals.I cannot praise the ambition and achievement of this book highly enough. Because the Nez Perce view the fate of the salmon as part of a regionwide environmental disaster, &quot;Salmon and His People&quot; also becomes an elegy for that lost river, the free-flowing Columbia. Several recent books (Blaine Harden's &quot;A River Lost,&quot; Wm. Dietrich's &quot;Northwest Passage,&quot; Richard White's &quot;The Organic Machine&quot;) have addressed the devastation of the Columbia and its fisheries, but none of these is as heartful and creaturely an account of what the damming of the Columbia has meant to the peoples and animals of the river. The Nez Perce are particularly qualified to write an account of the Columbia's devastation because their lands are upstream of most of the eighteen dams on the mainstem Columbia and Snake, and much of their section of the river lies within the Hanford Reach, that unhappy zone once occupied by the federal government's plutonium-production plants. (The Hanford Reach is also the only undammed section of the Columbia River.)Beautifully illustrated with color plates on almost every page (the registration could be better), &quot;Salmon and His People&quot; will challenge most readers to think about fish more deeply. The book is the second in a series of Nez Perce nature guides; it was written by Dan Landeen, environmental specialist for the tribe, and Allen Pinkham, a tribal elder and former chairman of the Nez Perce Tribe Executive Committee, and published by Lewis-Clark State College's Confluence Press.I have no connection to the Nez Perce Tribe or the Confluence Press. I write for fishing magazines, and in my experience this is a singular book."},{"Title":"Salmon and His People: Fish and Fishing in Nez Perce Culture","review":"This book deserves the highest praise for its integration of local knowledge with academic fisheries biology. It provides an excellent guide to Columbia River fish. That alone is worth the price of the book. The real \\"meat\\" of the book, though, are the Nez Perce testimonies: myths, folktales, personal reminiscences, views on local fish politics, and just plain good old-timer stories. We are reminded that the Native people often say in poetic or symbolic form what biologists say in academic polysyllables. Whether Coyote's encounter with beavers or excessive offtake of a fluctuating population is to blame, everybody knows that you can't catch too many fish or there won't be any more. The Native people add the critically important dimension of respect for the fish. You won't protect what you don't respect. That is why the politicians and even biologists so often fail to preserve the fisheries, even with the best intentions and the fisheries science--they lack that critical realization.The book brings out the tragedy of damming the Columbia River. Hydropower is cheap only because nobody factors in the real costs, especially the hundreds of millions of fish a year lost to the economy.This book is pure delight. I haven't enjoyed reading a book in a while, or learned so much."},{"Title":"Chilton's motorcycle electrical systems","review":"Not exactly a novel.

If you like it, you will probably like the book, but if you don't, you probably won't:&quot;An altered level of arousal (awareness) with acute onset may be caused by various factors (i.e. structural arousal alteration, metabolic arousal alteration, psychogenic arousal alteration). Structural causes are divided according to whether the original location of the pathologic condition is above or below the tentorial plate. Pathologic processes include infectious, vascular, neoplastic, traumatic, congenital (developmental), degenerative, polygenic, and metabolic causes. Metabolic causes are further divided into hypoxia, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, drugs, and toxins (both endogenous and exogenous). All the systemic diseases that eventually produce nervous system dysfunction are part of this metabolic category. Alterations in arousal range from slight drowsiness to coma&quot; (page 356)."},{"Title":"Understanding Pathophysiology","review":"This book was required reading by one of my current classes.

In my opinion, it is the best of all the Alan Gregory series and I have read them all. It's not for those who have trouble with names and who have short memory spans.

I most definitely recommend it to all."},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"I believe Stephen White is the most under-rated/unknown mystery author in America today. He hits hard, fast and realistic. Alan Gregory is BELIEVABLE. The plots, set up and general story movement is outstanding. This one's a winner -- as are all of White's books."},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"Boulder psychiatrist Dr. Alan Gregory is a bit melancholy as he attends the funeral of Dr. Arnold Dresser, who died from a fall while climbing Maroon Peak near Aspen. Alan and Arnold were trained at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and stayed in touch though they were never close friends. After the funeral, Alan returns home to take his spouse, Lauren Crowder, who suffers with multiple sclerosis, out to lunch. At the restaurant, a funeral attendee, Dr. A.J. Simes, intrudes on Alan and Lauren when she provides them with privileged information that someone plans to kill Alan and has murdered Arnold.Alan soon learns that the staff, students, and management who shared Alan's residency are being killed. Apparently, only he and his former lover Dr. Sawyer Sackett are left from the class of \`82. No motives and no evidence exists. Alan, Sawyer, and Lauren know they must uncover a serial killer before they end up in harm's way. &lt;PThe Alan Gregory thrillers are some of the best psychological suspense tales on the market today. However, the seventh book, MANNER OF DEATH, is the best novel to date because Stephen White injects jocularity without defacing the critical conditions that confront the lead trio. Mr. White paints a frightening yet promising picture of psychology that adds to the tale. Even higher authorities than this reviewer would tell readers that the Gregory mysteries are all worth reading, but especially this newest entry.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"Clinical psychologist-cum-sleuth Dr. Alan Gregory returns, this time facing a nameless, faceless entity who is stalking him. Why? No one really knows, but all of the fellow clinicians and physicians Gregory trained with are dead...except one. And she happens to be his ex-lover, whom Gregory's wife, ADA Lauren, knows nothing about. Along for the ride again is prickly detective Sam and a pair of ex-FBI agents who are the only ones who believe the stalker is real. But how do you pursue a criminal whose identity remains shrouded in mystery? One who changes his M.O. so frequently, a pattern cannot be established. One thing is certain, however. His vicious cycle of murder is rapidly increasing.Full of great action sequences and thoughtful musings, this novel perpetuates White as one of the great psychological/medical thrill writers of the past 10 years. Not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"The book gets off to a good start with a plot that has promise. So, you plunge into the book hoping that the promise delivers. White has an ability to keep you involved with a fast-moving plot. But as the book goes on, you start to tire and start flipping pages. Because things get more unbelieveable and the characters -- all of whom are of above-average intelligence -- begin to do incredibly stupid things which, of course, get them into trouble. But White's biggest sin is that he takes away the fun of a thriller. When you get to the end you find that the denouement has little to do with most of the earlier part of book, which leaves the reader terribly unsatisfied. Oh well, at least White did not use this book to pound the reader over the head with one of his boring pet peeves, like his hatred for Mormons or managed health care people. White could be a great writer if only he'd spend a little more time developing plots and characters that are realistic and creating real suspense. His books are like music that has melody and harmony, but no rhythm. He could do a lot better."},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"Like all Stephen White's Books this one is exciting and gets your attention right away. The dynamics of the story seemed to carry me along. The only compliant was the ending was a little flat. But some of his books have done that before. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"Stephen White is one of my favorite authors. I buy his books in hardback (a rarity for me), but this one I would have wished I waited for the paperback. Did anyone else notice Alan's (Stephen's) obsession with peeing???

This fast paced suspense filled thriller is mystery writing at its best."},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"This was my first Stephen White book and probably my last (based upon other reviews that has said that this is his best book to date).While the writing style is good (i.e., things flow together), in this book he didn't do what it takes to build a suspensful novel whatsoever. The fact that the killer is after the main chacacter seems to be a sidebar rather than the mainline.Also, at times, the characterization seems to be inconsistent. Sometimes the main character is cracking jokes in his head which you get to read but then in similar situations he's all business with the same people -- this made it difficult for me to identify with the characters when they seemed to have different personality traits with each chapter. It might come down to the fact that the author is trying to throw a little sardonic humor in but some of the other areas are being edited out?I'll try one more older novel (I picked up a lot of his works at garage sales) but if it's like this one, they are all going."},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"This series of books are a great read, I recommend starting from the beginning so you get the history of the main character"},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"EXCELLENT PLOT; I LIVED IN BOULDER...VERY FACTUAL; LOVED THE SUSPENSE; GREAT JOB STEPHEN; WILL WATCH FOR YOUR NEXT THRILLER AND WILL BUY IT."},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"I've now read almost all of the Alan Gregory series, and have liked most of them. This one didn't do it for me. White has said that the next Gregory novel will be the last, and I think that's a wise choice on his part.I particularly didn't like his character development of the ultimate villain, probably because he chose to develop that character in just a few pages at the end of the book.On a side note, if you're new to Stephen White, I suggest you try to read this series in order. White has a nasty habit, in his later books, of lengthy references to characters and events from earlier books. Yes, some authors do that, but White seems to do it more than most, and I find it annoying."},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"Love it, I am catching up mid-series.

As it goes, somebody is trying to kill Dr. Gregory and an old flame from his past.After completing this 7th addition to the series, I deemed Stephen Whites newest characters, Simes and Custer, fairly useless as far as investigators go. Their contribution in solving the mystery was minimal to say the least.

We also learn of a former love interest for a then young Alan Gregory, and the impact that dealing with her will have on his current marriage with Lauren.

Think Grisham with a graduate-level psychology degree."},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"Other than that, I found \\"Manner of Death\\" a dull read. I found the characterization shallow, the interrelationships between the characters unbelievable, and the premise for the murders -- and who the murderer is -- hard to buy into. There is no suspense to speak of, except for a short scene involving a private plane. If it weren't for the fact it is set in Boulder, CO, I would not have finished it."},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"Regardless of what some of the naysayers write about this novel here at Amazon, this book is a true mystery and a thriller all wrapped up in a neat and tidy package. Once again, Stephen White has done an outstanding job of providing a dilemma for Dr. Alan Gregory and the people he loves.In this installment in what has rapidly become a very popular series, Dr. White reprises all of the characters fans of these books expect to meet again within the covers. White also introduces the legend of D.B Cooper into the storyline, not as a foil or complication, but as an inherent part of the plot and as a possible explanation for the murders and other mysterious deaths that are part of this story.Oh yes, there are killings galore in this novel. The author makes use of a past love for Alan Gregory and does a masterful job in his use of flashbacks to explain where Alan Gregory was in 1982 (long before he met his wife Lauren, or Sam Purdy or even his first wife). His first love came while he was a psychology intern at the teaching hospital in Denver. It was there that he met Dr. (MD) Sawyer Sackett. The love affair that developed ended badly and Sawyer left without notice or apology. It has taken years for Dr. Gregory to get over her and when we flash back to the present, Alan and his wife are forced to confront the possibility that a former patient may have been killing off all of the staff members who treated him so many years before.Not too far into this story, Alan is informed that one of his former colleagues has died under suspicious circumstances. Upon further investigation, he becomes aware that there hasn't been just one death among his former interns and residents, but many. In a comical scene in a restaurant, Alan and Lauren meet two former FBI agents who were retained by the most recently deceased Dr. Arnie Dresser's mother to discover if there was foul play. They believe there was and in almost all of the cases. They have plausible explanations, but almost no hard evidence and cannot seem to interest the FBI or local law enforcement agencies because the locales are so far apart and the M.O.s so different.Throughout this fast paced and gripping thriller, White does an exceptional job of keeping the tension high and the fear factor elevated. Every time Alan or Sawyer leaves home, the hotel, the office or wherever, the reader finds himself wondering if the killer will strike right then and there. Although there are a couple of really close calls, especially for Alan, he must also come to grips with his unresolved feelings for his former lover, Sawyer.Sawyer is one of those well developed characters that White uses as a foil for Alan Gregory. In her case, the author only provides enough information to keep the reader moving forward. When he finally reveals &quot;her dark secret,&quot; I was so stunned, shocked and saddened that I finally understood why she could not and would not get close to Alan back in 1982. White handles that scene very well and with a high degree of empathy and compassion and he does that through the eyes of Dr. Alan Gregory.In addition to Sawyer Sackett, White also introduces the two former FBI agents, A.J. Simes and Milton Custer. A.J. is also a Ph.d. in Psychology and was a profiler for the FBI before a medical disability forced her retirement. Custer, a former field agent retired after 25 years and became a consultant. Alan's wife Lauren, notices some of the symptoms A.J. is suffering from and tells Alan that A.J. too, is suffering from MS. White shows us her symptoms just as he does Lauren's. Throughout the story, despite her annoying mannerisms, we hope that A.J. and Custer really do have Alan and Lauren's best interests in mind. We hope they really are &quot;the good guys.&quot;Even with new characters, where would an Alan Gregory mystery be without his erstwhile sidekick Sam Purdy? Well, Sam's here, too and this time, suffering the effects of a temporary lay-up due to kidney stones. As he recovers and realizes he's going crazy on sick-leave, he stays by Alan's side as the home teams tries to solve this most vexing of puzzles.The use of the legend of D.B. Cooper adds a certain 1970s cultural appeal to the entire story and Stephen White provides a plausible possible answer to who the actual skyjacker might have been. Throughout this book, I kept wondering if that little plot gimmick would lead to something and was pleased to see that the author left the answer somewhat ambiguous.Contrary to what others may have said, MANNER OF DEATH is as good as any of the other Alan Gregory novels to date. Although I started the series out of order, I have never once been disappointed by any of these stories. I hope Dr. Stephen White keeps Alan, Lauren, Sam, Adrienne, Jonas and Emily around for many books in the future. Each time I open one of these novels, I feel like I am visiting with friends and that's what makes these books so enjoyable and comfortable.Paul Connors"},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"Denver Post reviewer Carol Kreck stated in her review that &quot;Stephen White's 'Manner of Death' pulls readers along like a steam train. Don't crack this thing unless there's nothing else to do, because once started, nothing else is going to get done.&quot; I couldn't agree more, so I set aside a Sunday and read the book in one sitting, which makes it easier to keep track of names. I have read all Stephen White's mysteries and like them very much: Alan Gregory is a likeable, believable hero as is his wife Lauren. I was dismayed to read the Kirkus review above and find that it contains &quot;spoilers&quot;: events that don't happen until more than 200 pages into the book.

No wonder Sawyer dumped him."},{"Title":"Manner of Death (Alan Gregory)","review":"As a former stalker of a woman who is now my wife, I am happy to say that Stephen White captures the moment beautifully, and suggest its study for anyone seeking that perfect, unattainable person who strolls by only once in a lifetime."},{"Title":"Opal 8 1/2 X 11 (Gemstone Collection)","review":"ALl of the gemstones journals are perfect for those who are serious about journaling.

It didn't give me much advice. Most of the things in this book were about how to survive LIZZIE'S school, LIZZIE'S teachers, and LIZZIE'S classmates. This book gives only advice on 3 classes: Social Studies, Music, and Language. If you're going to talk about school subjects, talk about all of them. The study skills were stupid, some of them were: Don't study at the bowling alley, don't study with your crush, and be sure you have all your study materials. Everybody already knows this stuff."},{"Title":"Lizzie McGuire Survival Guide to School (Lizzie McGuire (Unnumbered))","review":"If you're really looking for a guide to school, I don't know if you'd consider this helpful.
