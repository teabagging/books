It's The Brothers Karamazov, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. After reading another of Dostoyevsky's novels, Crime and Punishment, a while ago, and thoroughly loving it, I had to get this one, for I had heard it was his best work. And I can't disagree. To sum up the premise quickly, the novel takes place in Russia circa 1890, and tells the story of four brothers who become involved in the murder of their own father. That is the most basic summary of the plot I can give; but it doesn't even begin to give you an idea of the territory covered in this massive, sprawling novel. (Over 700 pages of great literature.) There are other things going on besides this murder, and eventually the novel is about so much more than this.This novel has possibly some of the best characterization I've ever seen for any book, period. This is not an exaggeration. First, the four brothers are each given their own distinct personality and background (even though they are brothers they come from different pasts) and become some of the most developed, recognizable, and memorable characters I've ever encountered. In addition, the father is one of the most pathetic, funny, and evil characters in literature. But even then, Dostoyevsky does not stop. There are probably ten or fifteen secondary characters that appear a lot, and even more third-tier figures that don't have much time in the book but are still memorable. This is because whenever a new character is introduced, the author devotes at least a couple of full, developed passages telling the reader about the person, and reveals even more through the many conversations and speeches people have. Remarkably, there are never any repetetive characters. Dostoyevsky manages to create a new, unique, living, breathing person out of every character.This is also one of the most thematically inclusive books I've ever read, one with such depth. Thanks to the incredible characters and well thought-out plot, the novel discusses a whole range of themes. Dostoyevsky must have been a philosopher or psychologist just as much as he was a writer. Through his characters he expounds on the idea that people have the uncanny ability to harbor opposite and contrasting values within themselves at the same time. Good and evil exist side by side in the hearts of men. Dostoyevsky also shows us that some people are never happy because they don't want to be, and that this fact makes them happy. As long as they are unhappy in their own way, they remain happy, even if they know it's not to their advantage.Dostoyevsky was so ahead of his time with this novel- his deep knowledge of humanity is so evident. Years before Freud, he develops the idea of punishment as a way to alleviate guilt and love as a way to cure shame, or as he puts it, &quot;self-laceration.&quot; He was probably one of the very first to fully implement into his characters the concept of the split personality. At one point, one of the characters has a conversation with his alter-ego, fully aware that he doesn't exist. It's so impressive, it really puts some modern stuff into perspective.Death, love, forgiveness, immortality, religion, God, the Devil, all of these things are more than briefly touched upon in the course of this narrative. At one point, a character remarks, &quot;I don't know whether God created Man or Man created God, but if the Devil exists, he was created in Man's image.&quot; In one chapter, Christ comes back to earth and is challenged and shunned by the religious community. The Devil himself even appears as a person to discuss philosophy and religion with one of the characters. When he's asked, &quot;How are you able to take on human form?&quot; the Devil replies, &quot;Nothing human is beyond me.&quot; Powerful, chilling moments like these fill the book.There are so many moments of pure, unfiltered humanity in this novel, it's as if the author's whole life is bleeding through in the pages. When he creates an evil character, we believe in him, and when he creates the opposite- a truly pure figure- we believe in him, as well. In fact, this book has one of the most believably good characters of all stories. Dostoyevsky plunges the depths of man's soul, and what he brings up is sometimes scary, sometimes beautiful. If there are any stories out there that can come close to showing us the meaning of life, The Brothers Karamazov is one of them."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"Anyone interested in the central question facing mankind will find \`The Brothers Karamazov' an essential guide. That question--on man's capacity for responsibility and the proper role of the state and religion--is posed throughout the story in dialogue and events, and is framed neatly in a 20-page section where Ivan presents a poem titled \`The Grand Inquisitor' to his brother Alyosha. The chapter that bears that title (Book V, Chapter V) is a masterpiece in itself and should be studied for its narrative technique alone. But the ideas it presents are so immense, so mind-blowing and inspirational, that literary criticism is not sufficient.Indeed, \`The Brothers Karamazov' should not be classed merely as a novel--it is a book of philosophy, theology, psychology, and sociology as well that ranks with the greatest documents in those disciplines. There is a fictitious plot, of course, and the characters in the story are some of the most interesting in all of literature, so it is rightly praised as a novel. But the modern reader looking for a plot of twists and romantic intrigues is bound to disappointment. Dostoevsky does not stir up drama through the placement of unexpected developments or improbable character traits. Instead, he relies on the inherent needs and wants of all men to make vivid his story.The amount of dialogue may be shocking (tedious) to one accustomed to the modern show-don't-tell policy in storytelling. Today, novelists and screenwriters let a character's actions speak for them--it is quicker and provides a much more convincing impression. It also limits the kind of ideas that are posed in the story to simple, prosaic ones like \`she likes him' or \`he wants to defeat him.' By contrast, Dostoevsky allows the characters to speak for themselves, which creates a much longer and subtler exposition, but also frees the ideas to be vast and monumental.What is the fundamental nature of socialism? What are the uses of the church in finding purpose? In finding salvation? Why is there suffering? What is the meaning of death? Read the brothers' dialogues and contemplate.Dostoevsky's own philosophy is seen in the protagonist, Alyosha. This is so despite the fact that the author ably covers every perspective on every topic presented in the book, and one can hardly find a positive assertion throughout. If there is one, it rests in the overall effect of the words and actions, a concept Dostoevsky articulated in a personal correspondence--it is that \\"Man is a mystery; if you spend your entire life trying to puzzle it out, then do not say that you have wasted your time.\\"A word about the translations: The title of Book IV has been translated differently in every version I have seen (other chapter titles are also inconsistent, but Book IV is seemingly the most difficult to agree on). The original Russian is \`Nadryvy,' which literally translates to \`Ruptures,' though no translations I have seen use \`Ruptures.' The word is used throughout the book to convey the motif of \`pressures' or \`strained conditions about to break.' The various options I have seen for this title are \`Lacerations' (Garnett), \`Strains' (Pevear & Volkhonsky), \`Torment' (MacAndrew), \`Crises' (Avsey), and \`Crack-Ups' (McDuff). Given this is a central theme, the potential reader might look into which translation he prefers before buying. Apropos, the Princess Alexandra Kropotkin print version bears the Garnett translation, as does the Frederick Davidson audio recording."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"My three criteria for Great Book candidates are that they must be deep intellectually, stunning in character development, and beautifully written. This book is unequaled in all three ways. It states the argument against the existence of God based on evil, and the appeal of worldliness, as well as I've ever seen, then epitomizes those ideas in characters and plot, and then does pretty well developing counterarguments on all those levels. The Magic Mountain and Dr. Faustus by Thomas Mann, lots of Sartre and Camus, and actually quite a few other novels, personify but don't particularly argue ideas [very well, at least]; Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, on the other hand, is powerful and catchy and does argue, but her favored characters are mostly one-dimensional facets of her philosophy, which is so extreme that her envisioned opponents end up being straw men. The accuracy of her images of opposed views cannot be defended seriously.Dostoyevsky's characters are archetypes, but with multiple dimensions and realism, who engage in real conversation and resultant temptations to waver [though not as deeply as Bakhtin claims]. Dostoyevsky gives a rounded description before each main character appears, but then the character, in dialogue, bursts into a colorful reality.The writing is complex and yet gripping--reading it in high school was pretty hard, but then picking it up in college, I could not put it down, except to rest. It sometimes seems to wander but is constantly building, and its digressions turn out to be amazing constructions.I've come back to my Constance Garnett translation again and again. I've only read pieces of one or two others [and I cannot read Russian], but Garnett seems as skillful and consistent as any in expressing [seemingly] Dostoyevsky's views and vision of the Russian soul. That soul does contain, regrettably, anti-semitism, anti-catholicism, nationalism, and anti-modernism, and Dostoyevsky transmitted them all. But, except for the anti-modernism, which he argues forcefully, these views obnoxiously mar the book but aren't essential to its amazing argument or structure. Compared with the fine books on many 10 or 100 best lists, this one is a sun competing with floodlights."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"&quot;Love to throw yourself on the earth and kiss it! Kiss the earth and love it with an unceasing, consuming love. Love all men, love everything! Water the earth with the tears of your joy and love those tears. Don't be ashamed of your ecstasy, prize it.&quot;Thus ended the paragraph that saved my life from Book VI of Constance Garnett's translation of The Brothers Karamazov. Read unintentionally in tandem with the fourth movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony it wreaked upon me a transvaluation of all values. This also happened to some of my students at Shimer College where I teach both the Constance Garnett and the Pevear/Volokhonsky translations. I urge my students who love the book to read BOTH translations. Constance Garnett's poetic grasp of Dostoyevsky's language (with occasionally antiquated twists of phrase) assumes the worldview of the nineteenth century, which is the century in which Dostoyevsky wrote. Her first translation appeared in about 1912.She lovingly captures the cadences of Father Zosima's voice. This wise elder's words are at the heart of this book. I have never understood why his chapter, &quot;The Russian Monk&quot; has not been excerpted and widely read as &quot;The Grand Inquisitor&quot; which precedes it. Poverty, injustice, cruelty, and the suffering of innocents can only be transformed by love--and beauty. This book, a murder mystery interwoven with four love-triangles, exploring dysfunctional families, the nature of God, erotic lacerations, forgiveness, the devil, and the Russian soul can give you the equipment you need to cope with life's agonies, to go through suffering and into joy.Hurrah for Karamazov!"},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"Fyodor Dostoevsky believed that the Russian people were specially marked by God to endure great suffering in order to prepare them to show the truths of Christ's religion to humanity. He did not accept the notions of material progress and scientific rationalism that were coming out of the \\"Enlightened\\" West and felt that such ideas would lead only to spiritual bankruptness and immorality. Dostoevsky articulated these viewpoints and sought to project his vision of what the Russian national identity should be in his masterpiece, \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\".As Dostoevsky himself revealed in the story, the three legitimate sons of Fyodor Pavlovich each represented different aspects of the Russian identity:1. Dmitriy Fyodorovich was the uncontrollable and irrational brother who could commit acts of senseless violence and engage in extreme debauchery, but despite all of that, aspired to goodness and felt remorse at all of the bad things he had done.2. Ivan Fyodorovich was the educated brother who espoused the rationalism and cynicism of the West and who claimed to have renounced God. Despite that, he still had not lost his \\"Russian-ness\\" and he himself did not believe in what he preached and still had troubling doubts about the existence of God.3. Alexei Fyodorovich (Alyosha) was the devout brother who aspired to live in a monastery under the guidance of his spiritual father figure, Father Zossima. Alyosha represented all that was beautiful and holy about the Russian Orthodox faith.Each of these three brothers underwent a crisis in faith that was brought about by the death of their father, either directly or indirectly (as in the case of Alyosha). In each situation, each brother finally came to terms with the suffering that had been placed upon them and accepted responsibility for their actions, or indeed, for all men's actions.I thought Dostoevsky's description of this painful process of spiritual transformation brought on by suffering and anguish was mesmerizing, because I was able to relate to it in some small way. Indeed, considering the responses of many of the other customer reviewers here, I would say that my reaction was not unusual.I would suggest that reading \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" could actually lead you to reevaluate your life principles and manner of relating to people (at least it did for me). I wil not go so far to say that this book changed my life (as some reviewers here have claimed), but at least it made me think, and for that reason this book is wonderful. It's funny how such a transcendent book as this, which has something to say to everybody, was originally written as propaganda for Russian nationalism."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"Mark Twain once said that a classic is a book that no oneever reads. Unfortunately, the Brothers Karamozov may be aclassic of those proportions. Many are intimidated by thebulk of an 800-1000 page book when they see the oversizedspine on the shelf and neglect to meet some of the mostinteresting characters to ever be captured on paper.The Brothers Karamozov is possibly one of the most over-analyzedRussian novels (with the possible exception of War and Peace)since it was written in the 19th century, and yet, at itsheart it has some of the most interesting plots and charactersin any language. Consider for a moment three brothers--one apious, bright divinity student, one an intellectual, brazencapitalist, and one a dirty illegimate half wit. Now throwin an ogre of a father, and you can imagine what the dinnerconversation might be like. Do yourself a favor and forgetthe symbolism, the types and anti-types, etc. and get to knowthese people. Also, forget that you were supposed tohave read this book in college and just pick it up foryourself. Dostoevsky's mastery of mood and setting makeits popularity among scholars understandable. Yet its serializedplot-line and suspense-filled action will more than satisfyany Stephen King reader or soap opera fanatic."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"There's really no point in arguing that this anything but a really great novel. It is an epic work, with an almost epic length as well; an the exploration of the relations between three (actually four, if the illegitimate house-servant is included) brothers, the sons of a selfish, greedy, conniving, morally and physically repugnant father. In many ways, \\"Brothers Karamazov\\" can probably be viewed as a reflection of Russian intellectual/spiritual culture in the 19th century, and perhaps even beyond. Like his other works, this book also contains Dostoevsky's literary musings on the state of Russian society as he saw it. Even so, this is also weighty book: in a fashion similar to Tolstoy, Dostoevsky was quite obsessed with the concept of personal redemption, the moral catharsis (or \`moral bath' as Tolstoy called it in \\"War &amp; Peace\\"), atonement for sins, etc. and this, together with his religious mysticism (and the accompanying good vs. evil symbolism), can become quite tiresome at times. Dostoevsky was a very conservative Christian tormented by his own vices and a virulent opponent of Western European Enlightenment ideals (he viewed them as a threat to Russian culture and the Russian soul), and this is often reflected in \\"Brothers Karamazov.\\" Personally, I think the best parts of the book are when Dostoevsky explores the mindsets of his various characters, creating a very psychologically tense atmosphere. Also, his portrayals of the interactions and conflicts between his various characters is superb. In this sense, it is similar to \\"Crime and Punishment,\\" which is a better book - simply because it tends to focus more on one major theme. Thus, after reading \\"Crime and Punishment\\" one can easily be left with the impression that the \\"Brothers Karamazov\\" is a slight case of overkill in some aspects. However, on its own it is nonetheless a great book and definitely worth reading - although due consideration should be given to its historical context, meaning the place and time in which it was written (tsarist Russia in the 19th century)."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"This is a long and difficult book, but very interesting. It is an excellent book, but still not my favorite of Dostoyevsky's. This reads like a murder mystery, and there are also lots of philosophical and religious undertones. I would say that this is a good translation and the book includes some helpful tips to get through the story. Honestly, one of the harder things for me was figuring out who was being talked about because everyone had about 3 nicknames.

He rejected everything, Laws, Conscience, Faith, but above all, Future Life. He died; he expected to go straight to darkness and death and he found a future life before him.

That is...You must excuse me, I am just repeating what I heard, it's only a legend...He was sentenced to walk a quadrillion miles in the dark. And when he has finished that quadrillion, the gates of heaven will be opened to him and he'll be forgiven...\\"I was astonished by the impact left upon me by the depth of the characters that Dostoevsky created in this novel. There are so many conflicting elements from all the characters, so much suffering in the face of adversity, and yet faith is not entirely lost. There is a huge struggle between appraisal of God and rejection of Him within the characters of this book, each representing different aspects of this struggle. Dmitri, the passionate and instinctive drunkard, who represents the banal animal nature within us all, becomes a changed man due to his staring adversity in the face. Ivan, the cold and God-rejecting intellectual, struggles internally with his values of morality and mysticism. Smerdyakov, the cunning and cruel epileptic, maintains a mask of pathetic cowardice to those above him, whose neurotic behavior eventually leads him to inner conviction. Alyosha, the good-natured monastic student, faces the trials surrounding the deaths of his loved ones.The suffering of the characters in this book leads to so many ups and downs, bliss and insanity, that it's truly a rollercoaster. An innocent man finds the true spirit of God in the face of being found guilty for murder, a confused man finds the Devil incarnated in all the worst aspects of himself in the face of secretly hoping to find God but never quite attaining it, and who could forget Fyodor Karamazov, the most loathsome character in the entire story (aside from perhaps Smerdyakov)? He lavishes himself with riches and neglects his children who are most in his image.All these characters' personalities and struggles embody the essence of what it means to be human--the duality, as the prosecutor at the trial explained it, of being both honorable and base. There is a never ending conflict between the Karamazov within us all."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"Just finished this classic novel- it was well worth the time.

What I found, though, is a well-crafted novel about a highly dysfunctional family and their interactions with each other and the rest of the world. Its an interesting insight into how people can get so messed up, and also how even the worst people have impulses of goodness, kindness and generosity. It is also interesting to see how there can be so many different personality types in one family and how that dynamic creates a strange sort of balance in family life. I also really enjoyed seeing something of the legal process of Russia in that time period. All in all, I thought the book was an enjoyable read that didn't drag on longer than it needed to, and really didn't have any slow or irrelevant sections.

It needs to be unraveled, and if you spend your whole life unraveling it, don't say that you've wasted time. I am studying that mystery because I want to be a human being.\\" In Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov he unravels the very nature man: his passion, his intellect, and his soul. In his novel, Dostoevsky explores man's most primitive questions: Does God exist? What is hell? Why do we suffer? No other novel is as deeply intertwined with human existence as The Brothers Karamazov. Modern civilization has been crafted by philosophy, psychology, literature, and religion. The Brothers Karamazov can be considered a masterpiece in each.With characters ranging from sensual Dmitri, idealistic Alyosha, and intellectual Ivan, Dostoevsky reveals to the reader the very essence of man. In each brother, a dimensional extremity of man is illustrated. As the novel unravels, the reader becomes engulfed in the psychological struggle between the extremities. Will Ivan's love of life help deviate him from his dependence on his Euclidean mind? Does Dmitri's desire for his father's murder signal guilt, or is it outweighed by his moral innocence?Grand themes are presented throughout the novel ranging from religious hypocrisy to servanthood. Ivan Karamazov's character is fully illustrated in \\"The Grand Inquisitor,\\" the renowned chapter of the novel, often circulated as an independent essay. Because Ivan can't accept the existence of God if suffering exists in the world, the Grand Inquisitor is born. On the other extreme, Alyosha, and his mentor Father Zossima, seem to represent rival philosophies. Unlike Ivan and his Grand Inquisitor, Father Zossima and Alyosha believe that the world is essentially good. They believe that suffering is only the result of man's failure to love. \\"What is hell?\\" Father Zossima asks, \\"I maintain that it is the ability of being unable to love.\\"With the murder of their father, each brother is confronted by his own internal struggle. Alyosha's ideals force him to accept part of the blame for his father's death. Ivan's struggles with existence drive him to insanity, and Dmitri's guilty verdict reaffirms his faith. Ivan had once said, \\"Even if parallel lines do meet and I see it myself, I shall see it and say that they've met, but still I won't accept it.\\" Now Dmitri exclaims, \\"I see the sun, and if I don't see the sun, I know it's there. And there's a whole life in that, in knowing that the sun is there.\\"In sum, to call Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov anything but a work of genius would be an injustice. The Brothers Karamazov seems to explore every corner of human existence. However, Dostoevsky's quest for truth does not end with this novel, but begins. The book, which was originally meant to be the first of a trilogy, seems to call the reader to response. Dostoevsky's quest for truth becomes our own. Dostoevsky now calls us to unravel the mystery of man for ourselves.An additional note--the Barnes & Noble edition offers very insightful information as well as great footnotes and references. Constance Garnett is my preferred translator for Dostoevsky."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"When I started reading the Brothers Karamazov, I thought I was prepared.

Horrah for Karamazov!"},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"If Charles Dickens's novels are a romanticization of Victorian England, then Dostoevsky's must be a realization of 19th Century Russia. &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; not only sheds light on Czarist Russian life, society, and religion, but also succeeds in completely captivating the reader with its vivid characterization and dynamic plotting. Like Dostoevsky's other novels, it is a study in man's motivations for good and evil, his potential for corruption, and his glory in salvation. Each character, scene, and event in the novel seems to relay a principle that religion provides the structure for society, for better or worse.The novel chronicles the fragmented Karamazov family, who live in a small Russian town. The father, Fyodor, is a hedonistic, boorish landowner, twice a widower, who has his eye on a young lady named Grushenka. He has four sons: The oldest is Dmitri, an ex-military officer, a passionate, desperate, violent young man who is like his father in many ways; for one thing, he also is madly in love with Grushenka. There is Dmitri's half-brother Ivan, intellectual and studious, but morbid and cynical, and whose motto is &quot;everything is lawful.&quot; There is Ivan's gentle, magnanimous brother Alyosha who is an initiate monk and whom Ivan likes to provoke with his iconoclastic discourse. Finally, there is the illegitimate Smerdyakov, a morose and cruel young man who works as Fyodor's cook. None of the brothers has a particularly loving relationship with their father or with each other.Each brother has a personal devil and an angel. Dmitri's devil is Grushenka; his angel is a young lady named Katerina to whom he is engaged, both connubially and financially. Alyosha's devil is a divinity student named Rakitin, who exploits the misfortunes of the Karamazovs; his angel is his mentor, Father Zossima, who represents religious solace. Ivan's angel is his brother Alyosha; his devil is his own conscience, with whom he converses in one unforgettable chapter. Smerdyakov's devil and angel are the same person: his father, the only person who has ever entrusted him. It is interesting to observe how each brother's devil and angel influence his actions and thoughts and provide conflict throughout the novel.One night, Fyodor is murdered, and Dmitri, who has the most urgent motive, is accused of the crime. This could be considered the central event of the novel, but it is not the event on which the novel's profundity rests. What is profound is the series of psychological mind games that the brothers play with each other both before and after the murder; they could be any trashy family on a modern TV talk show, but they have Shakespearean complexity and depth in the way they express their anguish and weave their webs of deceit.The novel ends with a seemingly positive notion about death and the joy in the remnants of life; in the very last scene, the stirring speech that Alyosha delivers after a young friend's funeral could have been Dostoevsky's own requiem. This is a staunchly uncompromising novel, refusing to provide any easy answers and forcing the reader to look inside his own heart for the source of good and evil."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"For all the people who thought this book was too long, I would like to draw your attention to the Product Info section that Amazon so nicely provides.

Constance Garnett's translation is Victorian. Garnett may well have thought that she was improving on Dostoevsky's cluttered and lumbering prose, but she did not. Garnett was the first person to translate many of the classic Russian novels (by Dostoevsky and Tolstoy) into English, and it is rare that the early translations of classic works are good. When buying a translation, if there is an option, you are overwhelmingly better off buying the most recent possible. Luckily, Dostoevksy does not now lack for translators, and the Brothers K is *at least* five stars when better translated. Nabokov &amp; others have derided Dostoevksy for his deep and tormented characters and soul-bareing conversations. However, it is pointless to criticize Dostoevsky for not having shared in the form-enfatuation of the 20th century and not having joined the race of style that started three decades after his death. Dostoevsky most concerned himself with his characters. And for him, real evaluation occurs in extreme conditions and conflicting values. He helps himself to these circumstances with none of the frugality of many modern novelists. Although many judge The Brothers as Dostoevsky's greatest novel, it is not the most Dostoevskian of his great novels. That would be The Devils, where the strange workings of his characters and the originality of his social insight are most clearly and uncomfortably evident."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"Dostoyevksy has the ability to wrap plot around philosphy as few authors can. The Brothers Karamazov is more philosophy than plot, more ideas than action. Anyone who thinks that he or she is a stubborn, immovable atheist should read this book.

Dostoevsky argues, sometimes covertly, for the essential tie between morality (conscience) and God. The famous quote, &quot;If God does not exist, everything is permitted,&quot; assumes that without an objective moral God, everything is objectively amoral (even if subjective morals exist). To me, the novel shows how some (not necessarily all) professing atheists try to philosophically justify their actions that would otherwise be considered immoral. The way they justify their immorality is to subjectivize (relativize) all morality thereby making everything, including murder, inherently amoral. The problem with this approach is that the protest against evil becomes subjective and objectively collapses. Absolute good (God) defines absolute evil. Without God, absolute evil can't exist and Ivan's examples of human cruelty lose their force by becoming objectively excusable types of behavior. Dostoevsky also brilliantly shows the bankruptcy of human courts of justice. We the readers know that Dmitri is innocent of the death of his father, but the evidence makes him look guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt... If there is no just God and life after death (immortality), then we're stuck with human injustice masquerading as justice and no hope of the wrongs in this life being righted in the next. Aside from these Christian topics, the brilliance of Dostoevsky's work is that many atheists such as Camus, Sartre, Nietzsche and Freud have found this work a masterpiece. Dostoevsky showed that saints can look like sinners and sinners can look like saints and we are left wondering who is actually innocent or guilty of what.

To me the characters were not described very well and the dialogue seemed forced, at times incoherent(why is everyone having convulsions?)It seems Dostoyevsky did not have any strength left to make the dialogue interesting. People would lapse into fits for no reason and hallucinate constantly, it made you just want to get to the more philosophical sections. The personal interactions were mainly confusing and frustrating, many times I wanted to throw the book in the garbage. 75% of this book consisted of the characters going back and forth to each others houses talking about god knows what(you lose interest and lose track of who's who eventually and they all sound the same). This book was a definite chore-read, I did not suspect this having read \\"crime and punishment\\" beforehand, a book I was very impressed with. The only part I did enjoy were Dostoyevsky's questions about morality, which are always satisfying and informative. It is possible that Dostoyevsky's illness in later life reflects the poor effort of this book. I think that because it was his last, people assume that it was his greatest.

It contains some very memorable scenes described in excellent detail by Mr. Dos. Also, despite its long size, it is a rather easy read, because the language is quite straight forward, the philosophy is rather simple, and the plot progresses at a casual rate.

Not so much because Dostoyevsky was not a craftsman. His narrator is everywhere, including places he couldn't possibly be: people's minds, scenes, etc.) I accepted that the book was written before the revolution of literary technique, but I couldn't accept that the book is way too long. Many incidents don't seem necessary; and characters make speech after very tiring speech.Even more disappointing was that I couldn't relate to the characters. They just didn't seem real; and the main character, Alyosha, is too much of a goody-two-shoes to be interesting. In addition, he never initiates any action.

The language isn't easy to read, and the plot unapologetically meanders through sub-plots and side-stories. This isn't a \\"beach book\\".

Since I read it twenty years before, I have sometimes remembered Ivan's second story to reconsider what it really means, even if his first episode has become to mean little.

As always Dostoyevsky is an absolutely brilliant master. The breadth and depth are at times stupefying and you wonder how it can all tie together. This is just where he shines, however, in that this is more than a novel it's an exposition on the human condition. Many times the narrator insouciantly goes into a storm of pontification and, while it's a conversation the characters are having, it really doesn't move the plot along-- instead these ruminations delve into the psyche and ask pondering questions that at times supersede the main plot and sublimate it into a secondary glory. Much more can't be said without giving away the ending so I will leave it to future readers' enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"While treating the whole gamut of our human existence in the first half of his novel, Dostoevsky seems to put that very existence--our human nature--on trial in the second half of his volume. The three legitimate brothers of Fyodor Dostoevsky--Dmitri, Ivan and Alyosha--and the illegitimate brother, Smerdyakov, together serve as a microcosm for our human existence. Their personalities, disorders, personal demons, frailties and kindnesses remind us of our own--and together they form the full spectrum of possibility for us.Dmitri cries out, after having been arrested for parricide, cries out to Alyosha, \\"A New man has risen up in me...I exist!...And there is a whole life in that, in knowing that the sun is there,\\" (540-541). Wow. This comment by a man who has been involved in bullying, lust, fear and jealousy is now able to realize the best part of himself. And this is perhaps one of Dostoevsky's many great accomplishments with the novel. That Dmitri cannot become just a villain, easy to hate and disgusting to all, reveals also who we are. In many ways, we conduct ourselves in frail fashion--committing acts in the immediate present for which we mourn in the not-too-distant future. And yet, how many of us get to this point--where we can authentically claim that we are new, and that we are satisfied to know that our life is real, that we can see and feel the sun?On the other hand, we have Alyosha, whose battle lies mainly within. Unlike Dmitri and his father, Fyodor, Alyosha has not led a life of debauchery, sleeping with many women, drinking himself to the hilt. Instead, his has been one of action. Alyosha's great temptation is to learn to speak with his own voice, to rise to the moment that calls out to him. He is both uniquely spiritual and uniquely human. We might say of Alyosha that no other character in our literature (and here I mean all literature, not regionalized) has ever reached so close a rendering to Jesus as Alyosha. And Dostoevsky's driving force becomes clear with Alyosha's final speech to the young boys gather around him after Ilusha's tragic and fateful death. He says with power to his young students, \\"Some good, sacred memory preserved from childhood, is perhaps the best education\\" (700). When we can recall ourselves at our best--enraptured by kindness, full to the brim with a gratitude evidenced by joy--we then lend ourselves power to act in the present. Everywhere in this novel we see depictions of men who struggle and fail, falling prey to their own secret or open desires towards the unhealthy and the cruel. However, redemption lies most powerfully in this final moment that Alyosha spends with the very boys who once tormented poor Ilusha. He says that he loves them, will always remember them, and he exhorts them to remember who they are--in their deepest cores, in their heart of hearts. The boys listen and weep with his spoken words, and the reader immediately senses that this is it: this is the moment of triumph when all that has passed comes to what it may yield in the future. Russia, it seems Dostoevsky is saying, will thrive and move and lives as long as each singular human can remember himself or herself at her best--a moment of kindness, a moment of unbridled love, connection, belief. Alyosha powerfully reveals this possibility in himself, and then passes it along to the young boys who have gathered around him physically and spiritually.The fate of Ivan and Smeryakov is tragic. Both men succumb to the personal demons that haunt them--and both struggle intensely with the fate of their own brains. Ivan is a thinker, and his mind unravels itself with what is and is not possible. Dostoevsky seems to claim that life cannot be lived this way: there must come a point when we choose not to think but to act, and that act must be one of loving our neighbor. Ivan does perform this final act on behalf of his brother Dmitri, but it may be too late for himself, as his brain has already run the gamut of controlling and dominating his life. Smeryakov's fate is similar, though his own personal demons have pushed him to suicide. Neither character has been able to find a peacefulness, because both have attempted to come upon it violently, combating life with their intellect and finding it to be a riddle they cannot discover. Dostoevsky claims with The Brothers Karamazov that life can only be accessed authentically when we listen to our own souls, act accordingly, and love our neighbors. This is not religion, but rather the very definition of love, and the author's prescription for what might have, and still might, save Russia. And all of us, too."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"Other reviews comment on the strength of this book, comparing it to religious texts in its power. Though I have never followed religion or supersticions, Dostoevsky has challenged my beliefs, for surely no human (but maybe a deity or an E.T.??) could write such an unspeakably admirable work, one so brain-popping in its breadth of thought. Nearly every page is a marvel, and -whereas in many other novels the climax holds the one packet of wisdom-, through-out this book there are passages that, even in translation, can do little else but boggle the reader, so powerful are the words and the impressions that they form."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"This is a review for the kindle edition specifically and not a reflection on this wonderful novel.

Dostoevsky gives life the meaning the human race has been waiting for. I realise it all sounds so pompous and even flagrant and i'm startled and horrified by the way this criticism started - but this once sworn atheist who is writing the criticism now believes in god after reading it. I am not Objective. The mere existence of so elated an idea as dostoevsky presents us to, is a diety - for it gives way and meaning to all human existence. Dostoevsky's characters are mesmerising - the fight between the titans of existence is in full motion thorugh out the story. I have read the dostoevsky has intended to write a trilogy of Karamazov and that this was the first part - i feel that if he would have continued he would have completely divulged the meaning of human existence in this world.

The author came up with so many great ideas and characters that are so real to life even in their complex emotions and rationales that we relate to the characters as if we are in their heads. In the end, not only do we have a great story, we are also left with a beautifully written work of political, psychological, sociological, ethical and psychological thought that is very true not only to Russia, but to other lands and peoples as well.The greatest soul writer of all times and great contributor to human psychology successfully created a beautiful and amazing dynamism between the Karamazov brothers that has been the core of many stories after involving siblings. There is the unreliable father, the old Fyodor Karamazov whose life dominates his sons and whose death casts a huge shadow on their future.Sensual Alyosha who is the youngest of the Karamazov brothers is the main character of the story, and he is noted for his strong faith in god and humanity, deep kindness and sense of sacrifice.Ivan the atheist has a sharp mind and is the critical analyzer who seeks for meaning in everything. He is skeptical and dwells more on rationale in his dealing with people and issues. In the end, his intellectual mind misleads him and opens the doors to the nightmares in his life.Dmitry is the sensitive brother who has a strong consideration for anything living, Smerdyakov their half-brother, is the cunning illegitimate son of old Fyodor Karamazov and works as Fyodor's servant.The characters of the brothers and the events of their lives made for the complex and fascinating story of exceptional proportions, where faith, meekness, atheism, indifference and slavery to negative instincts and impulses are often in conflict. Faith and atheism or disbelief in God is taken to epic proportions in Ivan's encounter with the devil.Dostoevsky stated that, \\"when there is no God, all is permitted.\\". That assertion is reinforced in books like The Union Moujik, The Idiot, Crime and Punishment. The absence of God or lack of faith in man makes it possible for man to thrive in his worst animal instincts. Even when man starts with good intentions, the absence of faith usually derails him to the point where the good intentions are overshadowed by the negative effects of his actions. My conclusion is that this is a rare masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"The Brothers Karamozov ReviewThe crime: someone murdered Fyodor Karamozov, the wanton, irritable, and sadistic patriarch.The punishments: Smerdyakov, the illegitimate son, committed suicide after killing his father. Dmitri, the eldest son, passionate and immoderate like his father, whom the court found guilty of the murder, was condemned to Siberia. Ivan, the second son, who was \\"enlightened\\" and rational, struggled with the guilt of convincing his half-brother Smerdyakov that since God didn't exist, everything, including patricide, was permitted.But as the dying monk Zosima had revealed and Dmitri soon realized, everyone was complicit in and thus implicated for the crime, since, for Dostoevsky, the web of sin entangled young and old to the extend that even children suffered from their peers' sadism.Through his dream of the hungry and suffering children, Dmitri realized his guilt in the desire, that mustard seed in his mind, to kill his father and therefore willingly took upon the punishment for the crime he didn't commit. In doing so, he assumed a Christ-figure, accepting punishment for another's crime.The Legend of the Grand Inquisitor revealed Ivan's enlightened rationalism for a humanistic dystopia, the socialist utopia that Dostoevsky condemned. Only when, in a hallucination, the \\"devil\\"--Ivan's dark side-- revealed the parable of the learned atheist and thus rationalism's arid futility did Ivan realized his guilt in rationalizing patricide and prodding Smerdyakov to commit it.And Smerdyakov, who mirrored Ivan's unconsciousness and who carried the latter's reasoning to the logical conclusion, like Judas, would not have the chance to repent or atone for his crime. In the end, Dmitri assumed his punishment.Through the tormented consciousness of Dmitri, Ivan, Smerdyakov and other characters, Dostoevsky grabbled with morality in an enlightened but Godless world, a world that he could not accept."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"Top ten among must read.

Despite its over-dramatic, Victorian prose style (I'm talking Constance Garnett translation here), The Brothers Karamazov is a strongly plotted family/court drama with characters who seem real, maybe not by their conflated speeches (Constance Garnett translation again) but certainly in their actions. Never before have I been so enraptured in listening to overly wordy conversations (again, Constance Garnett. I mean this as praise) about a murder and its trial that, quite frankly, I know the end result of. Still, the plot moves forward naturally, as if knowledge of its ending has no impact on its power (which it doesn't).But then, the first half. almost four hundred pages (not exactly half, ok) of characters telling you their exact opinions on Christian religion without sparing any detail. The worst example of this is probably the Grand Inquisitor chapter, in which Ivan tells of a poem he wrote but didn't exactly write but would like to, then describes its meaning.That said, if you like the first book, you'll like the whole thing.

I couldn't wait to come and praise it, to tell how wonderful it is, how believable the characters are, how enjoyable it is to watch them go through their lives...But now I'm nervous. I've finished the book and for as much as I loved it at page 200, I've loved it that much more by the time I reached page 729. Hurray for the Karamazov's indeed!First, let me tell you briefly what it is about: there are four brothers, each of which can be summed up in two words, though their personalities all cross each others lines, conjoined by their fathers blood; Alyosha is pious and kind, Ivan is intelligent and reserved, Dmitri is passionate and prideful, and Smerdyakov is resentful and sly...these four get caught up the plot to execute their father, Fyodor Karamazov, though not in concert with one another. Each of them strains against the others, trying to exert his own personality on the situation and to \`save' himself, though each has a different idea of what this means. To Dmitri, for example, it means simply to not be a thief (though to be a scoundrel is okay). To Alyosha it means to serve others as best is possible, though this is more of a mandate handed to him than something pricked out by his own conscious.And it is this word that leads me to not be able to praise this book enough: conscious. Each character has one, though they come off in different ways, manifested as different behaviors. As I said, Dmitri is okay with being a scoundrel, just not a thief- his conscious forbids it expressly. Manifestations such as this and the play between the various personalities give the novel it's taut structure; there is no page that is a waste to read, no side-track that is to be skipped over (especially \`The Grand Inquisitor' chapter, which is a 30 page anecdote that will leave you breathless, wondering how the essence of kind-hearted Christianity could be summed up so magnificently- and this comes from an atheist!). As a whole this gives the novel itself a conscious all it's own- it stops being something that is read and begins to take a life that demands that the reader use his own consciousness to decide where he/she stands on the issues raised (salvation, duty, honor...).Let me step back from that for a minute and explain it better: there is a series put out by Britannica called \`the Great Books' and in this series Dostoevsky has a volume. When I first heard of these books I could not help but to wonder who Dostoevsky was and why he was included. I read some of his other books and found that they were not only entertaining but were literary tour-de-forces; Dostoevsky is not to be taken lightly and cannot be praised enough for his contributions to world literature.Now, after reading this book, I wonder why he did not command more volumes than just the one (though that one is this novel). This book was, by far, the best novel I have ever had the pleasure to read in my entire life. It is a complete piece of art from the first page to the last, constructed from (stealing from the afterward, as it quoted the Russian literary critic Nikolay Mikhailovsky) \`a sick, cruel talent' that has an unflinching, unapologetic ability to look deep into mankind's soul and find something that few other novelists/artists can: the truth.Perhaps it took Dostoevsky all this life to find that. Perhaps he had to send a few Raskolnikovs to prison and put a few Mishkins beside their Nastasyas before he could finally hit upon this final truth- the summation of this book, as is given to us in the last two pages by one of the only good-hearted, believable characters in literature: Alyosha Karamazov (and I'll not ruin what that truth is to you). If that is so, then he is to be praised for always seeking after it, for taking his entire life to find it (this was his last novel)...and you, the potential reader of this book, should take time to pause and learn what this man can teach you. It is a long trip...but it is a worthwhile one.Bottom line: There are some books that everyone should be made to read for the distillation of society and truths that the writer has managed to convey to the world; this is one of those books. It is a novel about Russia, by a Russian who loved his country dearly, but that is pertinent to us all.PS- If you want to get the full impact of this novel, you may want to start with Dostoevsky's \`Notes from the Underground'. That novella expounds the philosophy behind this novel, that salvation can be achieved through suffering, doing so a bit more clearly. That introduction should help to ease you into this book.-LP"},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"The Brothers Karamazov is said to be the greatest and last novel written by Fyodor Dostoevsky. In reading the novel, one discovers why so. The novel is set in nineteenth century Russia, and deals with the story of three brothers, Dmitri, Ivan and Alyosha, and the events surrounding the murder of their father Fyodor Kamarazov. The father is a drunkard baffoon, who spares no thoughts or money to his sons, and leads a life of sexual exploits, orgies and drunken revelry. Dmitri, born to Fyodor's first wife, returns to his hometown to seek money from his father, but gets enchanted by Grushenka, who his father lusts for and threatens to win over by the poer of his money. The sensual Dmitri, a former captain of the army, was earlier bethrothed to beautiful Katrina, who he wishes to leave in wake of his intense passion for Grushenka. The brother Ivan, an intellectual stars in the three most famous chapters of the book: Rebellion, the Grand Inquisitor and the Devil; where Dostovesky presents arguments against existence of God and discusses the genesis and futility of evil; the three chapters that on their own could have made the name of the Dostovesky as famous as it is. Ivan formulates arguments that both amaze and befuddle the reader and the reader finds himself tormented by the existential, ethical and theological questions that surface everywhere in the novel. Ivan falls for Katrina.Dostovesky calls Alyosha the hero of the novel. Alyosha is an idealist, a believer, a charming young fellow who would was all set on becoming a monk, till his mentor and guide Father Zossima asked him to return to the worldly life. The landscape is full of a range of other characters: Grigory and his wife Marya, devoted servants of Fyodor, who bring up an illegitimate, epileptic son of Fyodor, called Smerdyakov; the wealthy townswoman Madame Hohlakov, whose near cripple daughter Lise is engaged to Alyosha for some period of time; Rakitin, a character who full of big talk and shallow personality and two kids Koyla and Illusha.The novel centers around the events leading to and after the murder of Fyodor, whereby Dostovesky creates a highly engaging and yet pretty verbose analysis of the crime, parricide, providing his deep psychological analysis of characters and endless references from Christian texts. The last few chapters where he weaves courtroom drama provides the right climax to this highly challenging piece of work.The brilliance of Dostovesky is in making his reader undergo the same fever, same fervour that a criminal is faced with. The depth of portrayal is such that one is continuously full of the characters and the questions that surround their existence: for these questions are eternal questions that confound the reader. While the story is a gripping tale of murder and courtroom drama, the meat of the novel in the three chapters mentioned, in the discussions about what is right and wrong, in the presentation of various facades of human nature and human passion, in arguments for and against parricide, in the dealing of Alyosha with Illusha and Koyla. The last chapter, where Illusha loses his life, culminates a series of heartwrenching events, and this particular chapter is perhaps one of the best pieces arousing pathos in literature. The reader is just washed by the torrent of sorrow, and in a certain sense, Dostovesky succeeds in leading the reader through a sort of catharisis, ending in certain tears and an understanding that Christ-like love and purity of soul symbolized by Illusha and Alyosha is bound to prevail, to save our soul and society.The novel is also an excellent read in terms of insights it offers into the ethical, social and philosophical ideas present in Russia towards the end of nineteenth century. In that respect, it presents a case study of the undercurrents in the Russian society, the seeds and spread of socialism and well as the nature and depth of belief in church, miracles and God. The novel is also a part-time love story, where the flaring passions are so intense as to drive characters to the brink of madness, to the edge of chaos, to extremes of happiness and sorrow.Reading Dostovesky is like undergoing catharisis, tortuous and painful, and precisely so he is a must read for everyone who ventures into deeper questions surrounding the humanity."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"It's somehwat misleading to refer to the &quot;Brothers K.&quot; as a novel. In fact, Dostoevsky's magnum opus is by turns a metaphysical revelation, a terse and deeply emotional thriller and, perhaps most of all, a treatise on God and religion. The symbolism, right down to the very number of brothers (3...the most important number in the bible), is pervasive in the work, almost leaving the reader to feel quite often in the dark. Words like powerful, sensual, illuminating casually leap to mind when considering &quot;Brothers K.&quot; on a whole.My skills as a reviewer are sorely lacking so I could never do even the remotest justice to such a book. Still, after reading &quot;Brothers K.&quot; I feel compelled to give voice to the powerful admiration I developed for the work. Such feelings are likely to well up in anyone who gives the book a careful and thoughtful read.Unequivocally, the Constance Garnett translation found in Matlaw's Norton Critical Edition is par exellence.The only disappointment one may encounter in their experience with the &quot;Brothers K.&quot; is when they learn that this was Dostoevsky's last work. Read only good books, such as this one!"},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"I think Dostoyevsky was and will be the best author the world can ever see... and &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, his last novel, is one of his master pieces. In fact, if you asked me, I would name all of his novels a master piece! Whatever, &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; is there for you to discover the secrets of life itself. Whether you believe in God or not, whether you are Christian or Moslem or Jewish, there are so many things you can find about you and the realities of life! The story basically answers all of the questions in your mind you have asked yourself but were somewhat suspicious to find any answer... but this book tells you all the answers - and with more than only one point of view! Religion, love, friendship, murder, hatret... whatever you are looking forward to finding out in a story - the life itself, in short - is included in this great novel. It for sure is no time spent for nonsense. Moreover, it teaches you a great deal about finding the real &quot;you in yourself&quot;. An excellent book! I doubt any other author will ever be able to reach the powerful writing of Dostoyevsky. Read it, and see how right i am!"},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"Dostoevsky delves into his characters like few writers have the gift of doing. One grows very fond of sweet, compassionate Alyosha, crazed, heartbroken Dmitri, and cynical, intellectual Ivan, despite all of their flaws. This book is not exciting or engaging in the modern sense. No car chases or gun fights, but it is a very revealing novel that will leave you feeling inspired, broken, and everything in between. I wish I could adequitely find the words to describe how important this work is, although it does start rather slowly. By the way, I'm not a 40 year old uptight russian scholar. I'm a twenty year old punk rocker in a small town. Dostoevsky is just that good."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"I have read the Constance Garnett translation of \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" three times since I was a sophomore in high school, and it is still far superior to the latest translation that I read recently. I know Constance Garnett has had her detractors (i.e. Vladimir Nabokov & Joseph Brodsky), but the passion and poetry of language seems much more unaffected in Ms. Garnett's translation.Enough though about translations, when I read \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" as a 15 year old, it changed my life. I could hardly hold onto the book with the adrenaline coursing through to nearly bursting my finger tips upon consuming pages of epiphany after epiphany.Perhaps generations since are raised assuming their right to the freedom of questioning and pursuing an independent investigation of truth, but in the late '60s this was not necessarily understood by a good dogmatically religious boy in Chicago. I was so fortunate that this right was inured in me through my steadfast scrutiny of the 800 pages of \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\". And still to this day, some 40 years later, I feel it is the greatest novel ever written. Through the years it is the closest that I have ever had of the meaning of life and grace confided to me."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"The Brothers Karamazov is a magnificent piece of literature. Anyone the least bit familiar with Fyodor Dostoevsky will easily spot his hand at work here, which means some familiar ground for readers of other works by the author. This is not at all negative, however; this volume overflows with illuminating, thought-provoking Dostoevsky ideas.The Constance Garnett translation is somewhat awkward; I find Garnett overly monotonous and convoluted. Though Dostoevsky is no quick nor casual read, his text was certainly confused in some of Garnett's meandering passages. I feel other translators do a more concise and entertaining job, while keeping the same ideas intact, though I've only briefly read other translations.To give evidence to my critique, the notes on translation in the back of my text indicate some issues, including the title itself! Instead of &quot;The Brothers Karamazov,&quot; the book should probably be &quot;The Karamazov Brothers.&quot; As editor Ralph E. Matlaw states, &quot;we do not refer to 'the brothers Kennedy',&quot; and I'll mention &quot;the sisters Hilton.&quot; On the bright side, I feel the strange title makes the book feel more &quot;foreign&quot; and exotic.Matlaw also states Garnett doesn't just confuse the reader with some language, but actually simplifies and cleans up other language, turning at least one character into a more polished version than Doestoevsky probably intended. Thankfully, Garnett's peculiarities become familiar and comfortable. Overall, this book is sufficiently readable.Of note to first-time Dostoevsky readers is the extreme number of characters quickly introduced near the beginning of the book, with the traditional cavalcade of Russian names, surnames, and nicknames. This is no deficiency of the translator, but rather a difficulty inherent with the source text.Fans of Dostoevsky may simply be wondering: is this worth the time to read? After taking in all 700+ pages, I can answer a resounding yes. Ideas introduced in earlier works are here fleshed out into living, breathing, bleeding human beings. I feel the characters are some of the most real I've ever encountered in literature. The variety in people eases the reader's process of identifying with a character; I identified with multiple throughout the book.For those being introduced to Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment may be better, simply because Karamazov has a slow, disorienting beginning. However, if you enjoy the Russian master, you will relish in the delight of Karamazov."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"The Brothers Karamzov was published in 1880 by Fyodor Dostoyvesky (1821-1881). It is the the greatest of his novels. The BK is also considered one of the best novels ever written.The lengthy book (nearly 1000 densely written pages!)is many things:a. A mystery story. Who murdered the old lecherous Fyodor Karamazov?b. A theological inquiry into theodicy and the purpose for life. Most notable chapters are \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\" and \\"The Devil.\\"c. A classic Christian story of sin, redemption and humankind's hope for eternal life.d. A psychological study of the various types of human personality. Dostoevsky is the best psychological novelist in Russian letters.e. A political discourse on the future of Russia in the late 19th century. We see such topics as nihilism, atheism, the role of the state and Russian social structure discussed.Was old man Karamazov murdered by his sons?a. Dmitri-a military man who is wild as the wild. He is torn between his love for the wealthy Katerina and the village Circe Grushenka. He hates his father. He represents sensuality in human life.b. Ivan-the coldly intellectual son who is an atheist. He believes that in a world without God all things are possible.c. Smerdyakov-the illegitimate epileptic son by old Karamazov's first wife who was the village idiot!He is one of the most repulsive characters in fiction!d. Alyosha-He is the Christ-like son who lives in a monastery with the saintly Father Zossima. Alyosha will leave the monastery to share the gospel of love and understanding in society.The novel has long passages of philisophy and religious thoughts by the characters. The court scenes dealiing with the murder of old Karamazov are exciting. Several chapters dealing with Alyosha's loving care of a dying child are as moving as anything in Dickens.The book is not easy reading. I have read it five times always gaining a new insight into the human soul and condition. It will live forever.Hooray for Karamazov!!!!"},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"This novel is, in my opinion, the finest novel ever written. The themes are universal, to a degree that they not only hold-up over a century later, even for an American reader like myself, but seem to speak directly and prophetically to the chaos and conflict of modern times. Even the great works of Tolstoy - a superb novelist and contemporary of Dostoyevsky's - in spite of their magnificent scope and brilliant historical detail, seem at times dated, dogmatic, and naive in contrast with the brilliant insight of The Brothers Karamazov.As a result of the vast social convulsions in the century since the book's publication, few of the great 19th century writers are able to reach out through time and address both current concerns and the universal questions of human existance with the unflinching honesty and authority of Dostoyevski.The father and four brothers in the novel are indeed archetypes, but so intimately drawn that they walk and breath on the page as living people - and furthermore, for better or worse, they are people of irrepressible passion - people who confront the moral and social calamity of their lives with a remarkable courage and a vital gusto. Even when that passion becomes confused and twisted, or passes beyond into actual depravity, they are never beaten into apathy under the unrelenting bleakness of a collapsing social order and a failing imperial state . . .And here I must say a few words about Dostoyevski's engrossing and devastatingly realistic portrait of his times. He has sometimes been accused of being an insufferable romantic - of creating charactors that are fantastic - of writing a kind of surrealistic distortion of existance that is employed merely for lurrid effect. But if one goes through the book line by line it turns out that the opposite is true. It is his unflinshing refusal to embelish or prettify the world his charactors inhabit that gives his work it's disorienting quality. He forces us to take off our rose-colored glasses and see his world as he see's it, and this fierce vision is not for everyone, but those able to enter it may take away an understanding of life's meaning beyond estimation.Because, in spite of the patricide, the unrelenting grimness and the omnipresent cold and deprivation that permeate this novel (and much of his other work) Dostoyevski is determined to leave us with an appreciation of the incredible power and endurance of the human spirit, a renewed vision of the wonder of human life, and finally a conviction that neither the three surviving brothers nor we ourselves have passed beyond redemption.Footnote: Also, in my opinion, the Constance Garnett edition is still the finest English translation."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"I don't even know how or where to start a review on a work as monumental and transcendental as Fyodor Dostoyevsky's stunning masterpiece \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\", so I'm not going to pretend I can encapsulate in a review its all-encompassing magnitude, depth and complexities. To all fellow Amazon users out there: if you haven't read \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\", you should consider yourself lucky that you've yet to experience one of the most important literary works and one of the most intellectually, emotionally, philosophically and spiritually profound works of art ever created. Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche, Franz Kafka...some of the most creative and deepest thinkers of the past couple of centuries all have agreed on the magnificence of this work and there's a reason for it:\\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" will deeply challenge pretty much everything that is at the very core of your soul. It's impossible to come away from reading this novel and not have your understanding of the human condition and your very soul to be expanded and deepened. The most essential concerns of mankind and deepest questions of life are to be found in this book (God and its existence or non-existence, morality, free will, faith, religion and state, reason, madness, lust, responsibility and a myriad of other crucial themes) and Dostoyevsky's visionary and genius exploration of them will take the reader on a true journey of deep introspection. Kurt Vonnegut stated in one of his books that everything one needed to know about life is in \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" and for my own experience I think he's right.I cannot recommend \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" enough.

It is so rare that you can read a novel and see reflections of yourself as well as being so true and exacting as far human nature is concerned. This novel will make you ask questions of yourself. Do reflect those positive values expressed by Dostoyevsky? Am I a good person? Does pride get in the way of person being truly happy or do many of us live as tormented damned souls who &quot;live on their vindictive pride like a starving man in the desert sucking blood out of his own body&quot; as he puts it? The point of the book is that in order to have happiness and peace you must have love and love can only be achieved by accepting the love of Christ, and worldly cynacism and pride are barriers that separate us from divine love.

This novel is a masterpiece of literature and of philosophy. Dostoyevsky offers one of the most fervent apologetics for Orthodox Christianity, one of the most moving descriptions of the content of the Orthodox Faith, one of the most stirring defenses of its necessity, and one of the most cogent -- in fact, the most cogent -- refutations of modern atheism ever written, and he does all of this while telling an engaging story about a murder mystery. Dostoyevsky masterfully and beautifully combines the spiritual traditions of the Russian Orthodox Church, the theology of St. Isaac of Syria, his personal life experiences, the teachings of the Fathers of the Optina Monastery, and an amazing storytelling ability to make this book what it is -- a prophecy of the 20th century, one of the greatest books ever written, and my personal favorite book."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"This, like other classic works, is meant to be savored rather than devoured.

But it is not an ironic coincidence since Dostoyevsky literature is pervaded with three perpetual themes: the craving for faith, nature for freedom, and origin of evil. And The Brothers Karamazov, as the pinnacle of Dostoyevsky's career, is an amazing combination of all the elements that contribute to the intrigues of psychology and religion.The plot evolves around the murder of a depraved landowner, Fyodor Karamazov. The trial itself takes place later in the book with the three sons of Karamazov playing seemingly afflicting roles. It is not accurate to assume each brother's position according to the three themes; simply, each brother represents a unique combination of all three themes with incoherent reactions and consequences. Alyosha is identified as the hero of the novel, and he is the Dostoyevsky's final attempt to personify Christ. Ivan, the second son, is a revolutionary intellectual who more or less symbolizes Dostoyevsky's ideal of &quot;craving for faith&quot;. Acting as Raskolnikov's counterpart, Ivan is Dostoyevsky's attempt to refute the rising radical idealism. It is Dmitri's passion for two women that ultimately triggers the catastrophe. Nature of freedom is truly manifested in this unhappy man desperately trying to regenerate. Held in comparison with Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov dares to manifest the two abysses of human nature with somewhat less realistic and more surreal characters. The plot itself evolves around life's many paradox; for example, the elder himself once led a notorious career; and Dostoyevsky paints a not-so-promising picture of church, overwhelmed with dark oppression. Also, instead of one female character that symbolizes love and religion, Dmitri's sin is only justified through the love of two completely different women. Ironic enough, neither women possess Sonya's divine serenity. Katerina, Dmitri's former betrothed, loves him out of gratitude, and when her convinced love is ruthlessly rejected, she seeks revenge and helplessly falls for Ivan. Grushenka, a player figure that continuously tempts Fyodor and Dmitri's passion, sees herself as the cause to the calamity since many believe Dmitri's motive of murder to be jealousy. But nonetheless, Dostoyevsky strives for balance and sense of truth that is usually found in the middle of extremities. And just as the Devil recites from Terence's comedy Heautontimoroumenous (The Self-torturer), &quot;Satan sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto&quot; (I am a man, and nothing human is alien to me), The Brothers Karamazov captures the struggle we are only too familiar with, and frames forever &quot;those moments when the lie becomes the truth&quot;."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"This is my favorite book of all time.

Most parts of this long novel are fairly interesting, although it seems to be slow going at times.Doestoevsky presents two brothers with opposing ideas on how the world works and how those ideas influence Russian society. Alexey follows the Orthodox Church and its beliefs and seems to do well by them, whereas Ivan is tortured by his disbelief in God and the absurdity of the world. He may just be angry at God, rather than an atheist; he is a person who does not like how God has arranged things. Dostoyevsky seems to favor Alexey's Christianity over Ivan's secular ideas because he puts Alexey in better light.Alexey's dream is the standard Christian one in which all people become equal, holy, and loving in their submission to the will of Christ. Alexey represents a religious Russian that finds the way to live life is by the Church's teachings.Alexey is accused of being a sensualist because he is a Karamazov; \\"birth and heredity\\" has shaped him. The socialist Rakitin states, \\"You're a sensualist from your father, a crazy saint from your mother.\\" Alexey goes on to prove that his saintliness overcomes whatever sensuality he might have. He refuses to see the sensual Grushenka, even though she says that she will \\"pull his cassock off\\". Alexey represents a Russian who rejects the sensuality that a secular liberal may give into.Unlike his brother Ivan, Alexey shows his sensitive nature and insight into people he helps. When Ivan coldly states that one reptile will devour another if Dmitri kills the father, Alexey exclaims \\"God forbid!\\" Alexey later questions Ivan as to whether he or any man has the right to decide who should live. Ivan states that it is natural to wish for his father's death and he has a right to do so. Alexey also cries over his father being beaten by Dmitri and Dmitri's insensitivity to it. When he gets bitten by Ilusha, Alexey asks the boy why he was bitten, rather than get angry with him. He thinks that he must have wronged him in some way. Alexey is incapable of passive love because if he loves someone, he wants to help them. He realizes that the captain is too proud to take the money offered him and is ashamed of his initial delight. Alexey attempts to help him again rather than lose patience. He does not have contempt for the man, but states that all are like him. Alexey is a religious Russian who finds an outlet for his kindness and sensitivity by following the Christian way of life.Alexey does not say much, but he does record the beliefs of his mentor, Father Zossima, who believes that fulfilling desires is fruitless and one would do better to live according to brotherly solidarity and humanitarian service.Ivan, on the other hand, asserts that all things are lawful if there is no immortality: \\"There is no virtue if there no immortality\\", he states. He is an uneasy atheist claiming that natural law is based on the belief in immortality and if the belief is destroyed then love and life will be destroyed along with it and the laws should be changed to the opposite of what they are now. Like other Russian secular liberals, he is at odds with the moral teachings of the church because he claims not to believe in God.Ivan struggles to justify his life with his belief in absurdity and atheism. Ivan states that he still has a thirst for life that no disillusionment can destroy. Even though he does not believe in the chaotic disorder of the world and is disillusioned with it; he still wants to live and does not consider the thirst for life base. Alexey states that he should love life even if he finds no logic in it and then he will find a meaning in it later. Ivan will not depend on sensuality to get through his life the way his father has done. Ivan changes his mind and says that he does not believe in the world God created, but may believe in God. His mind is an earthly mind and cannot understand unearthly things or the absurdity of suffering in this life. Like a secular liberal, he struggles to find meaning in life after he has rejected religious meanings that explain life.Ivan makes the argument that suffering is absurd and unjustified as it afflicts the innocent; the world does not make sense and must not have been created by God. He mentions the cruel murder of a baby and says that the devil may not exist, but man has created him in his own image. He talks about the Russian proclivity to cruelly beat innocent animals and children without a tinge of guilt. He says that everyone has a demon of lust, cruelty, and lawlessness within them that is waiting to come out and indulge itself.Dostoevsky presents a generally unflattering picture of Russia as a backward land filled with cheats, religious fanatics, and unprincipled secular types. But he does have two compelling characters with Alexey and Father Zossima; the rest seem to be suffering from insanity, character flaws, or proclivities for violence. He indicates through these two characters that following the Christian beliefs are better than following liberal secular ones, even though a person might be considered reactionary because of it."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"Dostoevsky's original Russian is meaty. Constance Garnett's translation is Victorian. Garnett may well have thought that she was improving on Dostoevsky's cluttered and lumbering prose, but she did not. Garnett was the first person to translate many of the classic Russian novels (by Dostoevsky and Tolstoy) into English, and it is rare that the early translations of classic works are good. When buying a translation, if there is an option, you are overwhelmingly better off buying the most recent possible. Luckily, Dostoevksy does not now lack for translators, and the \\"Brothers K\\" is *at least* five stars when better translated (Volokhonsky & Pevear).Nabokov & others have derided Dostoevksy for his deep and tormented characters and soul-bareing conversations. However, it is pointless to criticize Dostoevsky for not having shared in the form-enfatuation of the 20th century and not having joined the race of style that started three decades after his death. Dostoevsky most concerned himself with his characters. And for him, real evaluation occurs in extreme value conflicts. He helps himself to these circumstances with none of the super-model frugality of many modern novelists (with all the style in the world, but wary of weighty non-ironic philosophy or morality). Bottom line: Dostoevsky is an extremely readable great novelist.Although many judge \\"The Brothers\\" as Dostoevsky's greatest novel, it is not the most Dostoevskian of his great novels. That's \\"The Devils\\" (also translated \\"The Possessed\\" and \\"The Demons\\"), where the strange workings of his characters and the originality of his social insight are most clearly and uncomfortably evident. Although \\"The Brothers\\" reads more easily, its subtleties are more detectable in the context of \\"The Devils.\\" Read it too. Better yet, read it first."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"I feel duped. The Brothers Karamazov may very well be a great book, but the Barnes and Noble edition is not the version of it I want to read. Being a bargain edition of a work in the public domain, of course it is cheaply printed, and my copy arrived with torn and crumpled dustjacket, which of course did not please me. Then there were several distressing details about the book which I noticed on first inspection, including a long list of quotations from the text and a pages-long \\"introduction\\" before the text of the novel itself. (If a commentator wants to talk to me about a novel, I feel it's only polite that he wait until after I've read it.) The topper, though, came the day after the book arrived, when I happened to get some information about the translator, Constance Garnett, in The Writer's Almanac (a Garrison Keillor project). Their report is that Garnett \\"was born in Brighton, England (1861). She gave us many of the first English translations of famous 19th-century Russian novels.... But Garnett had a habit of skipping phrases that she didn't understand, she often missed the humor of the original Russian, and she altered sexuality in the novels to reflect her Victorian ideals. Critic Kornei Chukovsky compared her writings to 'a safe blandscript: not a volcano... a smooth lawn mowed in the English manner --- which is to say a complete distortion of the original.' Constance Garnett's translations held up as the standard for decades, but now most of them are replaced by more nuanced versions of the Russian works.\\" So unless you are interested in a Victorian distortion of Dostoevsky, I recommend you find a better translation and pay a couple of dollars more for it. I wish I had."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I prize it primarily because of the characters Alyosha and Father Zossima, both of whom are profoundly good. It is very difficult to write about good people. As another famous Russian novelist famously pointed out, it is the bad characters and families that have the interesting lives. This book is made interesting by the introduction of numerous villains who engage and entice the reader, and who confuse and torment the good Alyosha.The most famous passage in the book, and indeed one of the most famous in all literature, is called The Grand Inquisitor. It is important to note, however, that that portrait of evil is a fiction created by one of the characters in the book. Alyosha and Zossima, on the other hand, are \\"real\\" characters -- at least within the framework of the book. We are perhaps not meant to trust the narrative in the Grand Inquisitor, while we are meant to trust Zossima and Alyosha.This book is important because of the wisdom of its author. Dostoevsky perhaps never mastered the art of living a good life, but he did master the art of portraying goodness and evil in fiction. For most of my life Zossima and Alyosha have stood in my mind (either consciously or unconsciously) as beacons of light in a dark world, and the other characters, to varying degrees, have represented the numerous temptations and missteps that plague most of our lives. As such, the book is not so much a novel, as a spiritual guide.Dostoevsky was one of the first authors to deeply understand the modern mind, and I'm not at all sure that anything written since the appearance of this book has fully supplanted it portrayal of the pitfalls of passion, materialism and pride. A good deal of suffering could be avoided if more people could understand how acts of spiritual discipline can help us realize the simple message of love and compassion found in this book."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"It's not uncommon for a novel to attempt to cover the grand scope of everything. Life, faith, the human heart, our relationships with each other and their effects on the people around us. Our uneasy and reluctant acceptance of death and what that can acceptance can mean for us. There's no shortage of people with ambition and walking in any bookstore to gaze at all the gigantic tomes lining the \\"literature\\" section of the aisles is enough to prove that. Many attempt it. Most don't succeed at it.This one does.Recommending a giant Russian novel to anyone is a fairly dicey affair. Length alone will deter most people and those who aren't frightened by the idea of slogging through over seven hundred hard fought pages will want to know, \\"So, hey, what's it about?\\" How do you even encapsulate it? What could you even tell them?Well. You could tell them it is the story of four Russian brothers, all as different from each other as brothers can be different from each other, navigating the tricky tangles of family, loving and hating each other in equal measure. You could tell them it's a novel primarily of ideas, as various people discuss the nature of faith and whether the soul can be advanced through suffering, if indeed suffering is the whole point of the world. A novel where people who aren't even the main characters engage in lengthy dissections of what it all means, sometimes with each other, sometimes with themselves. You could also tell them that it's a murder mystery, with a character dying who nobody really liked anyway and much possible confusion over who really did it, also the source of much great debate.And yet it's not about one of those things. And yet it's about all of those things, somehow, simultaneously, all at once.The primary drive of the novel is the actions of the brothers, all of whom both exist both as people and metaphorical representations. Alyosha is good and pure and honest, Ivan is coldly intellectual, and Dmitri is the sensualist, eager to experience all the aspects of life that he can, whether it's a good idea or not. Each acts within his confines but somehow manages to come across as a real person, Alyosha in particular (it's impossible to believe that a man of such consistent gentle goodness can exist but the novel will have you believing in the very reality of him). But attempting to pin the novel down to one single plot is an exercise in futility that the novel nimbly eludes. To me it seems to exist as an examination of faith in this world, openly questioning how it can exist (Ivan's scenes and speeches involving such a topic are famous for a reason and I love how he can accept the idea of God but not accept the idea that such a being would want to deliberately create a world so steeped in suffering) and also making a case for why it has to exist. It gives us characters who are so good that it seems the world can hardly bear them and people with no redeeming qualities whatsoever (the brothers' dad roars through every scene he's featured in, commanding the page like the drunken train wreck of a guy at a party that you don't want to look your way but you can't take your eyes off of) and manages to make them feel all cut from the same fabric. It feels like sharply observed life, as people wrestle with the same ideas that we privately wrestle with, just in extremely long speeches that never seem to bore.There's no central plot to this. It meanders and rambles, although it never feels like it's getting off track. The author circles around his points and tries to poke at them from every angle just to see what comes out. For every long argument we get in favor of something, in the next chapter someone will turn around and give the opposite argument in a way that seems like truth in that very second. It digresses and sidetracks itself and each time it does it only strengthens what we've already read. Whether it's the story of Father Zosima, or Ivan relating his poem or the young boys who throw stones, it all becomes part of the same piece, part of life in all its ability to come to a single sustained point.And part of death, too, the single sustained messy point of our lives. A novel this big can't fail to have a body count and not a few people drop in the course of it. Some go out with a gentle sigh and some go out with more of a bang. It's the latter kind of death that drives the action toward the last third of the book, as the dad comes to an end that seems inevitable from the very start of it (the way he constantly goads everyone in sight you can't imagine the book will end well for him) and there becomes a sense of tension as it becomes a matter of more when than if. Yet we get no easy explanations for that either, just conflicting stories and contrasted viewpoints, as everyone seeks to find a guilty party that makes sense to their own philosophies. But when that's decided all that's left is for another small death, hardly anything in the scheme of it, that manages to give the novel an ending that seems amazingly hopeful after what has gone before. Indeed, I had no idea how you could wrap up a novel with no easily grasped theme or plot but he nailed it. The ending is perfect, not because it ties things together neatly, with all mysteries explained, but because of the great emotional finality of it and overriding sense of yes, we can stop here. This is a good place to get off.Don't get me wrong, it's not a page turner. The prose does crackle in parts, especially as the ideas start to wing left and right. But you have to spend time with it and let it spend time with you, absorb it and let it seep into the cracks you didn't know you had. These aren't real people, more constructs of real people but in their bursts of living and loving and hating and despairing, their swoops of joy and suffering, they feel more vital in a way that other novels don't. You can't go into it looking for a strict story, it's too big for that. The narrative refuses to hold it and doesn't need to. Instead it takes hold of every thread of life and sets it spinning out into the dark and it, much like us, follows for as long as it can, to glean whatever insights there are to find, before letting those threads continue on their way long past the point where the darkness is absolute. But it's not a source of fear. We often don't see the end of what we start, and that's okay. As long as we've entered the debate, we've made a case for being alive."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"Anyone interested in the central question facing mankind will find \`The Brothers Karamazov' an essential guide. That question--on man's capacity for responsibility and the proper role of the state and religion--is posed throughout the story in dialogue and events, and is framed neatly in a 20-page section where Ivan presents a poem titled \`The Grand Inquisitor' to his brother Alyosha. The chapter that bears that title (Book V, Chapter V) is a masterpiece in itself and should be studied for its narrative technique alone. But the ideas it presents are so immense, so mind-blowing and inspirational, that literary criticism is not sufficient.Indeed, \`The Brothers Karamazov' should not be classed merely as a novel--it is a book of philosophy, theology, and sociology as well that ranks with the greatest documents in those disciplines. There is a fictitious plot, of course, and the characters in the story are some of the most interesting in all of literature, so it is rightly praised as a novel. But the modern reader looking for a plot of twists and romantic intrigues is bound to disappointment. Dostoevsky does not stir up drama through the placement of unexpected developments or improbable character traits. Instead, he relies on the inherent needs and wants of all men to make vivid his story.The amount of dialogue may be shocking (tedious) to one accustomed to the modern show-don't-tell policy in storytelling. Today, novelists and screenwriters let a character's actions speak for them--it is quicker and provides a much more convincing impression. It also limits the kind of ideas that are posed in the story to simple, prosaic ones like \`she likes him' or \`he wants to defeat him.' By contrast, Dostoevsky allows the characters to speak for themselves, which creates a much longer and subtler exposition, but also frees the ideas to be vast and monumental.What is the fundamental nature of socialism? What are the uses of the church in finding purpose? In finding salvation? Why is there suffering? What is the meaning of death? Read the brothers' dialogues and contemplate.Dostoevsky's own philosophy is seen in the protagonist, Alyosha. This is so despite the fact that the author ably covers every perspective on every topic presented in the book, and one can hardly find a positive assertion throughout. If there is one, it rests in the overall effect of the words and actions, a concept Dostoevsky articulated in a personal correspondence--it is that \\"Man is a mystery; if you spend your entire life trying to puzzle it out, then do not say that you have wasted your time.\\"A word about the translations: The title of Book IV has been translated differently in every version I have seen (other chapter titles are also inconsistent, but Book IV is seemingly the most difficult to agree on). The original Russian is \`Nadryvy,' which literally translates to \`Ruptures,' though no translations I have seen use \`Ruptures.' The word is used throughout the book to convey the motif of \`pressures' or \`strained conditions about to break.' The various options I have seen for this title are \`Lacerations' (Garnett), \`Strains' (Pevear & Volkhonsky), \`Torment' (MacAndrew), \`Crises' (Avsey), and \`Crack-Ups' (McDuff). Given this is a central theme, the potential reader might look into which translation he prefers before buying. Apropos, the Princess Alexandra Kropotkin print version bears the Garnett translation, as does the Frederick Davidson audio recording."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"I read this novel 20 years ago and was fascinated with Dostoevsky's ability to portray the inner human conflicts of his countless characters. Reading it again, I'm still fascinated by Dostoevsky's outstanding ability to describe human confrontation with mortality, agony, and the burden of choice. However, now I have a new understanding of Dostoevsky's philosophy.Understandably, and due to the political, emotional, religious and social crisis that Dostoevsky witnessed during his life, he arrived at a point where he rejected radical socialists' positions and all the philosophical concepts popular in Russia at the time, and moved to a conservative position of concern for traditional and religious values.During my life's journey of trying to comprehend and understand Dostoevsky, I came to believe that all his work, with the exception of Notes from Underground, was too predictable. He describes an avalanche of human emotional mysteries and takes the reader on a tragic roll coaster ride that will peak and end in either symbolic or an over simplified answer, both of which stand for one concept: humans are doomed, truth is mysterious, turn to God and you'll be saved. In my immaturity, I thought that Dostoevsky did his part to search for truth and the meaning of life, and consistently forces his novels to this conclusion. In particular, the arrogance of his definitive righteousness that he displayed in his last few books was starting to get on my nerves.After reading the Brothers Karamazov the second time, I came to a different understanding of Dostoevsky's passionate literature. The characters in The Brothers Karamazov were actually more mature than Dostoevsky's previous characters, and instead of Dostoevsky's typical tragic and hopeless conclusion, there is actually an objective, optimistic, non righteous view of human kind's nature.Granted, Dostoevsky still portrayed the hero-Alyosha-as a true loving self denying person, but without the over dramatic craziness that his characters previously had. The other semi-corrupt characters like Dmitri, Ivan, Grushka, and Smerdyakov were realistic enough and displayed both dark and bright sides. Particularly, Ivan was a great character that Dostoevsky used to display his thoughts about atheism, morality and the way he sees free will as a curse. Even though Dostoevsky obviously wanted to disagree with Ivan's debates about God and mortality, he was less definitive in this novel about who's righteous and who's bad.Now, I feel that Dostoevsky never found his true inner peace. After all, he was always torn between his desires, addictions, and obsessive love to the woman that tormented him, Suslova. Maybe, the righteous answer that Dostoevsky forcibly wanted for all his characters problems is, in fact, his own dream of a salvation that could never been achieved during his life.I might be wrong in both my assumptions, but The brothers Karamazov is a well written masterpiece regardless of the author's hidden messages."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: A Modern Library Book (No. 151)","review":"This is on the list of books I wanted to keep in my mobile library - another one from the classic collection.

Unlike today, when there are more books on beadwork than one could possibly read and still have time to actually DO some beadwork, there were no real books on the kinds of beadwork being produced by a few small pockets of artisans.Then \\"The New Beadwork\\" was published.It would be hard to overstate the impact that this slim volume has had on the art of beading. In the early nineties, if you wanted to buy a book on beadwork, this was it. Not that anyone buying the book would feel as if she hadn't gotten her money's worth - this book became an instant treasure. It was a major factor in elevating a certain calibre of beadwork to an art, just as a beautiful woodcarving or an ancient mosaic is art. The beadwork in this book is so far from love beads or the macrame potholder hanging in your grandmother's kitchen, it seems almost criminal to speak of them in the same breath.Any serious beadworker, or anyone who aspires to be a beadworker needs this book, as inspiration and also to see how far we have come. If one could only purchase a half-dozen books on beadwork (which would be tragic), this would have to take a place with \\"The Art and Elegance of Beadwork\\" and \\"Creative Beadweaving\\" by Carol Wilcox Wells, \\"The Beader's Guide to Color\\" by Margie Deeb, \\"The Art of Beadwork: Historic Inspiration, Contemporary Design\\" by Valerie Hector and Lois Sherr Dubin, and \\"The History of Beads: From 30,000 B.C. to the Present\\" (Unabridged Edition) by Lois Sherr Dubin. This listing is subject to debate, of course, but most beadworkers would consider these books to be the best of the best.It's a pity this book is out of print - but it is still available, and still fresh and useful. It is a worthy purchase for anyone who wants to raise her beadwork out of the craft category and into the realm of artwork."},{"Title":"The New Beadwork","review":"The cover of the book was beautiful and I thought the patterns would be included. While the book has great inspirational pictures of work, it was disappointing that no patterns were included. I think from now on I will read reviews for the books before I buy a book. The work in the book is beautiful."},{"Title":"The New Beadwork","review":"The book came on schedule, was well packaged, & in excellent condition. I have to say that after I got it, though, I wasn't as thrilled with it as I thought I'd be. I've been a beader for over 30 yrs., so there isn't much I haven't seen in the beading world. I think the photo on the cover is what prompted me to buy it. But, truthfully, I have a LOT of other beading books that are a whole lot more inspirational than this one, but that's just my personal choice. But, I would buy from this seller again, as I can't say anything negative about the seller :)"},{"Title":"The New Beadwork","review":"This was the first book on artistic beadwork I ever read. Though the creative boundaries in beadwork are being pushed all the time now, this book from 1992 was, for me, an eye-opening introduction to the use of beadwork to create art, not just jewelry. I still have a real fondness for the huge seed bead installation imitating swirling water--just magical!"},{"Title":"The New Beadwork","review":"I know I can't make most of these items with my innately limited hand and eye coordination, so luckily it's not a how to book, but such inspiration! The examples give you a great idea of what can be done with color, shape, texture and design. I bought a used copy since it didn't have instructions, and was very happy I did so I can look at it and dream. It has inspried a few projects of my own."},{"Title":"How to Power Tune Rover V-8 for Road & Track","review":"Great book but too expensive.

Backgrounds and reasoning on particular choices made and goes into detail on subjects such as lighting, plants and materials.I own quite a few garden design books and I would definately rate this the best I've seen and just about every design in his books I would rate amongst the best I've seen."},{"Title":"Patio: Garden Design & Inspiration","review":"This book is an excellent sourse of inspiration for the garden designer who is tired of traditional garden design. Jamie Durie explores new materials and plant selections in a way that is comfortable and exciting. A must read for those of us who are tired of English garden design!"},{"Title":"Patio: Garden Design & Inspiration","review":"I've bought that book 'cause I'm planning to transform a small corner of my garden into a nice patio.

If you're looking for ideas for your patio, this probably isn't a good book for you."},{"Title":"Patio: Garden Design & Inspiration","review":"A definite must have.

There are stories by Dickens, Saki, Kafka, Maupassant and Ray Bradbury along with some by relatively unknown authors. The &quot;Monkey's Paw&quot; is collected along with an unfamiliar M. R. James &quot;Lost Hearts.&quot;The stories range from the sad and poignant&quot;The Little Yellow Dog&quot; about the ghost of a dog to the spooky &quot;A Legion Marching By&quot; about a ghostly Roman legion in Britain. The illustrations add a lot to the presentation."},{"Title":"On the witness stand;: Essays on psychology and crime,","review":"We tend to bypass older books. This is a serious work by an insightful Harvard University psychologist who, in 1913, spoke to the challenges of forensic mental health work. It has many rich ideas and discussions that still overlap with many of the problems that remain even to this day. Worth the time, easy to read, and a good addition to one's library."},{"Title":"Practical Software Engineering: Analysis and Design for the .NET Platform (The Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series)","review":"This book presents an internally consistent software engineering methodology that is contained entirely on Microsoft's .NET platform. A parallel universe of code development, as it were. If you hail from a java-centric J2EE background, most of this book will be familiar turf. Indeed, over 80% of the book is germane to any operating system and language environment. The higher level stages, like getting system requirements or nutting out the analysis model, should be independent of the eventual implementation minutiae. Thus, of the ten chapters, only one, on the implementation model, is truly tied to .NET. (Which suggest that the book's audience is broader than the &quot;.NET&quot; in the title might imply.)Now if you scan a typical book on designing using java/J2EE, you will be lucky to find even cursory mention of any alternative environments, let alone .NET. This book returns the favour; studiously minimising references to java/J2EE. But, as suggested above, on this topic such differences are only at the lowest level.So from your standpoint, if you are engaging in a .NET-based project and you come from elsewhere, this book might considerably ease the pain of transition."},{"Title":"Practical Software Engineering: Analysis and Design for the .NET Platform (The Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series)","review":"With the .NET Framework and VS.NET the higher levels ofabstraction enable the evolving Software Engineer to beginto focus on the weaker links in the chain of softwaredevelopment activities.While many will resist this evolution those of us who haveexperienced similar shifts from machine code to assemblylanguage and the maturing third generation languages appreciatethe concrete concepts put forth in this most excellent text.If you want to keep hacking, experience the never-ending deathmarch's not to mention the managed confusion of softwaredevelopment, then this book isn't for you !"},{"Title":"Imagine 2005: Undiscovered Talent Of Fantasy","review":"As I paged through this book I was astounded not only by the beautiful artwork inside, but by the sheer plethora of mediums and styles of art that the book spanned. Whether hand drawn in pencil or ink, oil, watercolor, computer generated, or digitally painted, there seemed to be a sampling of every medium and variety of fantasy imagineable.Many, many kudos go to Jenni Mills for going to the trouble of collecting such a variety of art and going through the painstaking process that seeing so many previously undiscovered artists have now actually been published! Even though I own one of the pictures that made it into that book, I'm both amazed and honored to be included with so many obviously talented artists whose work far outshines my own.Anyone who loves browsing through a new take on traditional fantasy, from dragons to knights, from unicorns to fairies, can find something to identify with and love in this book, and the content is such that I'd have no problem even buying it for children. In fact, it might inspire them to draw, as well!"},{"Title":"Imagine 2005: Undiscovered Talent Of Fantasy","review":"It's so exciting when artists get together on a creative project! In this book little known fantasy artists (including me) pooled efforts and resources to produce an inspiring book containing an amazing range of fantasy artwork all produced in 2005. There's something here for every fantasy fan, whether you like intricate fairy designs with glowing colours, oil paintings or atmospheric digital work, detailed pencil drawings or dragons portrayed with a touch of humour. The artists' websites and email addresses are included in the book so you can find more work by your favourite artists online. I can't wait for this year's book which I'm sure will be bigger and even better!I heartily recommend this book to students, artists interested in participating in the project in future and anyone who'd like to discover new fantasy artists."},{"Title":"Imagine 2005: Undiscovered Talent Of Fantasy","review":"Before I get onto my review of this book, I have a few thoughts to share with regards to the previous review from Alisa. Now I by no means intend to headhunt or rant, but in my personal opinion as a person, artist & avid book lover, I feel that anyone who has NOT read or even sighted the book they are attempting to review should not be doing so. I fail to see how it will benefit anyone at all. I had thought that the purpose of a review was to share thoughts & ideas with others of a publication of which of which the reviewer has (at some point) read. Therefore, hopefully helping others to make an informed decision as to whether the publication is to their tastes.Basing a review of a 'compilation' art book on one person's art alone is neither constructive or appropriate. Its kind of like assessing a whole school's overall performance on 1 students exam results - it does NOT represent each individual or their abilites.Now onto the book review. I actually have a copy of this publication. I am an artist, but I am NOT in this book... As an artist, I have to say that overall, I'm impressed - there are indeed many contibutors to this publication that have me scratching my head as to why they aren't 'known'. There is a wide variety of subject matter within the pages & interesting & useful information about each artist. This gives the reader the option of being able to learn even more about each artist & view more of their work! Something which I have done with great enthusiasm.Yes, there are varying skill levels within the book, but what the compiler (Jenni) has done, is given these artists - ALL of the artists - the chance to be seen, the chance to expand & grow... AND the incentive to continue to create & improve upon their skills. What some people don't realise is that all it takes is 1 person to take a chance & give others a chance - You never know, Jenni may have just given the next 'Amy Brown' enough courage to continue, improve & become something truely wonderful.I urge lovers of Fantasy art & artists alike to give this book a go - you'll be adding a lovely publication to your collections & supporting all of those starving artists out there that create art because they love it so much... This is their chance to share & shine. And just think, when the next 'Big' artists' star does rise, you'll know that in your own way you helped them to get there."},{"Title":"Imagine 2005: Undiscovered Talent Of Fantasy","review":"I would like to comment on Juroara's review entitled \\"flunk\\". I too am an artist whose art was included in this, and while I understand what she was saying, I have to say that I do not agree.Yes, the book is entitled \\"Undiscovered Artists of Fantasy,\\" and yes, there are varying degrees of both talent and personal styles in the book, but that does not make the art or the book invalid. There are various reasons as to why all of us are undiscovered. Some of us are in various stages of development. Some of us have never tried to market ourselves. We are all of differing ages, and we all come from varying backgrounds.Just because someone's work is not as realistic or refined as your own may be does not mean that the individual has no talent or should be written off. I look at some of the pieces in the book and realize that at some point or another my work also looked like that. Then I look at the artwork of some published and incredibly popular artists and I think that while the really popular stuff is amazing, there are also some pieces that they have done that are less than stellar and that I have done better myself. Then you also have to remember that even the best artists can put out some nasty stuff on a bad day.Then there is the issue of stylistic differences. What one person finds attractive, another may not. What may look like children's drawings that you don't find value in might become incredibly popular in children's books. I saw some pieces in Imagine 2005 that were perfectly beautiful, but would probably be more popular with a younger crowd.I myself prefer realism and classic beauty, but there is still no reason for anyone to criticize other artists. You never know that you might discourage the next great (but usually dead before they become incredibly popular) artist in their time of development. There is an unverified (and I stress unverified) story about Hitler. It is said that he tried to get into an art school when he was young, but he was turned away with comments that his art wasn't good enough. He then turned to the military and we all know what happened after that. While the story may be an urban legend, it does make a point that we should all think about.As one last comment to Juroara, before you criticize anybody else's less than perfect work, make sure that you do so in a grammatically correct manner. Just as one example... the word \\"i'm\\" should ALWAYS have the \\"I\\" capitalized. At our office, when we look at people's resumes, this throws up a red flag about their ability to handle small details."},{"Title":"Imagine 2005: Undiscovered Talent Of Fantasy","review":"I have not bought this book but I definitely won't now. I came here from the website of an artist who was featured in this book and that person is not what I would call exceptionally talented, marginally yes, but exceptionally no. I am not saying they or the people featured in this book should give up art, just that they should not have been featured in a book at this point in time.I am also aware that there are varying types of styles and tastes and what is good for some is bad for others, but a book that says 'undiscovered talent' in the title should be just that, talent, something truly amazing, not something that looks kind of nice and maybe would appeal to kids because it is simple and cute. It needs to be something that makes us wonder why they aren't famous.On the whole I was rather shocked and saddened that the artist I mentioned had their rather low quality piece published, while there are thousands of incredibly talented fantasy artists that have never been in any books all over the internet."},{"Title":"Imagine 2005: Undiscovered Talent Of Fantasy","review":"The project Imagine has some great things going for it. It has the potential to help undiscovered talent get known, and help artists make a living.But as one of the artists who participated in it, I was disappointed with the final result. The book gave me an awkward unsettling feeling to it that prevented me to even want to sell it. Coming from an Epilogue background, I did not feel this book was living up to its title of undiscovered talent, not yet atleat.The level the artworks are done in this book ranges. Some are very professional and others look like student artwork. The two do not mix well when put next to eachother. The glaring differences mess with your head, you can't decide if this book is supposed to display professinal quality artwork - or students growing and learning. It made it hard for me to compare this book to other art books, and even to decide whom am I supposed to sell this book too?Some of the paintings in this book are excellent and one has to be really anal to spot out problems. Others have problems with anatomy - human or beast- that unfortunately even my sister who draws stick figues could spot out. Some of the scans are clean and crisp, some are a little fuzzy *I think even my own is* and some are REALLY fuzzy. The fuzzier the scans get the poorer the quality and the harder it is for anyone to appreciate the artwork.The mix of level of artworks: Professional, Amateur, Student, or however you like to define them is helping no one look good in the book. Its too awkward and too confusing as you flip through the it.Not to mention any names, but I am not the only one who participated who is uncomftable selling this book. However, I hope for the best for Imagine 2006."},{"Title":"Emission Control from Industrial Boilers","review":"Oops, must dash - good book that"},{"Title":"Santa Bear's First Christmas Hb","review":"My 16 months old son does not get tired of looking at the bright pictures and plays with the neat toy pop ups!

His precise field of inquiry is the &quot;common&quot; magic-worker, insofar as such a practitioner existed. He attempts to answer the questions &quot;who was doing magic and why?&quot; by examining a vast array of evidence, both primary and literary. Along the way he discards much of the dross that has accumulated on Classical scholarship in the last decade or so, deriding the postmodern and deconstructionist habits of hanging modern Freudian meanings on antique societies and social actions.The scope of this work is breathtaking. A truly vast array of sources are brought forth, considered, and placed into the context of what is known about the societies in question. Primary material, drawn heavily from archaeological evidence such as curse tablets and amuletic inscriptions, is cited wherever appropriate. Extensive use is made of the magical papyri as well and the author makes a consistent effort to consider what role is played by the casters of such spells in their societies - the society of classical Athens, for example, is different from that of Athens in the time of Alexander, which in turn is different from Republican or Imperial Rome. Each discrete period of time is considered from its own sources, archaeological, primary or literary.Nor are modern scholars ignored in this tour de force. Dickie makes wide-ranging use of the best that Classical scholarship has to offer - Graf, Faraone, Obbink, Johnston, all are cited where relevant. The only modern scholar that is missing from this lineup is Hans Dieter Betz; Betz' translation and collation of the PGM is abandoned in favor of the older and less complete Preisendanz editions, nor is Betz cited in the Bibliography except for two minor articles, both contained in collections with other articles which are extensively cited. (The scholar in me smells some obscure feud in this.) Nevertheless, this puzzling absence in no way detracts from the stellar quality of the book itself.This is a must-own for any serious student of Classical magic. Buy it today!"},{"Title":"Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World","review":"In this work, Matthew Dickie sets out to chronical the development of both the concept of magic and the magician in the Greek and Roman worlds. He succeeds well enough that I would highly recommend this book. Note that generally, he doesn't always trace the origins of magical practices and this may provide different and perhaps complementary information on the sorts of influences affecting magic in this part of the ancient world.The book starts off with a basic premise: that it is possible to trace the development of magic as a sociological phenomenon distinct from mainstream religion in the classical world. He seeks, so far as is possible, to address the concept of magic in the categories used by the cultures he studies and builds a picture both of the situation at different times in Athens and Rome. While the author notes that many cultures do not separate magic and religion, he notes that both Greece and Rome did, and that this distinction is one we inherited from them.The book then proceeds to systematically ask the following questions about different periods and places within its scope:1) What were the social concerns about magic-workers?2) Who were believed to be magic-workers?3) What legal actions were possible against magic workers?4) What was the status of female magic workers relative to their male counterparts?5) What sorts of professional magic workers do we see in each time and place?The study is thus fairly broad in scope, is a very heavy read, and covers the period from Hellenic Greece through the early Middle Ages. In many ways, students interested in the context of the witchcraft trials in Europe should probably start with this book because the work shows a great deal of continuity between concepts of sorcery in Greece and Rome and those during the Middle Ages.This book will challenge you and make you think. It is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Arabian Nights and Days","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. Great writing. Great insights in the human condition. I did not want it to end!"},{"Title":"Arabian Nights and Days","review":"Evil djinnis take the role of bad guys seducing hapless humans into dreadful behavior throughout this book. They bankrupt the wealthy, frame the innocent, and lead people to rape and murder while leading them away from righteous behavior and sound moral judgement. Mahfouz rewrites some of the Arabian Nights tales, like that of Aladdin and Ma'rouf the Cobbler, and works around the edges of others, like that of Sindbad the Sailor, while introducing a slew of his own characters who interact with each other and generally get the short end of the stick in this collection of interwoven stories.Against the djinn are a few morally upright humans and one angel whose powers are extremely limited. This small band tries to stem the tide of corruption and despair which pervades the entire book and gives it its central themes.This is a very, very enjoyable collection of stories, fast-moving and philosophical in tone, posing questions of moral weight and conscious import through its vignettes. I had such a good time with this book that I read it in one sitting. Mahfouz is not trying to give you answers with this book, he's posing questions about moral behavior and corruption and showing what happens when corruption gains the upper hand in people's lives. Beyond that, he's playing with familiar characters from the Arabian Nights and re-writing their stories to take these themes into account. If you're looking for a book that slavishly follows the stories of the Arabian Nights, this book isn't for you. Mahfouz deviates from the stories in that book to explore his key themes; for instance, Aladdin in Mahfouz's story is put to death for theft before he ever had his adventures with the wondrous lamp, and Ma'rouf the Cobbler never finds the treasure hoard in the farmer's field. The book reads like a hallucination, with characters coming and going at whim, their stories warping and twisting as the djinn screw with them and throw obstacles in their paths. If you want an exploration of corruption and moral redemption, you will find it here, and well handled. Come to this collection understanding that Mahfouz is not re-writing classic tales but is telling them anew on his way to his own explorations, and you'll be in the right frame of mind for these stories."},{"Title":"Arabian Nights and Days","review":"I had to get this book for my college Humanities class and to my surprise enjoyed the book very much. The only issue i had was the book has a lot of characters, i found myself writing down each new character that i can across, there title, and if the died how they died. Most probably wont do that but it really helped me keep up with the characters of the novel. I like how most of the characters life decisions would affect another characters life further in the book, if you don't follow along, you can easily get lost. Maybe I'm just a poor reader but that's how i felt while reading this book. The genies though are by far my favorite."},{"Title":"Arabian Nights and Days","review":"I found myself distracted with a nagging question whether the narration was an illusion or reality. The novel is a loosely set of tales, where each chapter is self contained describing the experiences of a character. The plot converges at the \`Cafe of the Emirs'. The characters are faced with an adventure in which they appear to find more about themselves. In this adventure they are tempted with their weakness, there is a self struggle where they determine to take the path of choice. It is this path which can lead to their destruction or bliss. The apparent conflicts are in the nature of corruption, self righteousness, lust, greed.This is my second read from Naquib Mahfuz, he boldly exposes the true realities and choices one faces and makes in every day life. Due to this i found the book somewhat depressing."},{"Title":"Arabian Nights and Days","review":"You know the stories, but you don't. You think you're on the path, but you are not on THE PATH.

Arabian Nights and Days will remain on my shelf for my children's children and then some, for it crosses generational, cultural and religious lines with the same ease and comfort of our best loved fables"},{"Title":"Arabian Nights and Days","review":"Naguib Mahfouz's Arabian Nights and Days is a bitterly entertaining and compelling read. In medieval age, in some unknown Islamic town, genies pulled a series of escapades that created havoc. The clash between the genies and the townspeople was evocative of inveterate, age-old struggles of virtue, corruption, despotism, injustice, and other practices purged by conscience.Seized by a pang of guilt that pricked his heart, Sultan Shahriyar repented of his atrocious massacre of virgins and other pious, god-fearing people. Shahrzad, daughter of vizier Dandan, sacrificed her happiness and remained with the sultan in order to stem the torrent of blood.Merchant Sanaan al-Gamali had a nightmare in which a genie would otherwise punish him if he refused to kill the governor, who had brought about the genie through black magic and made the genie accomplish purposes not approved by conscience. In a state of delirium and crazed fantasies, Sanaan raped and murdered a girl. When Gamali finally summoned his courage, unsheathed the dagger, aimed at the governor's heart and stabbed with a strength drawn from determination and despair, the genie abandoned Gamali to his own fate.Gamasa al-Bulti, the chief of police, was another man whom the genie chose to be the saving of the quarter from corruption. Gamasa was despondent at the ruin of Gamali's family, which now lived in ignominy. But the chief remained aloof to Gamali's widow for fear of ruining his own position and his standing with the sultan, who regarded the blow directed against his official as being aimed against him personally. The genie confronted Gamasa as one despicable person feeding off ignominy for he protected the elite (who was just as corrupted) by prosecuting the respectable people. In \\"repentance\\", Gamasa launched a lethal blow at the neck of the governor, who gave a horrified scream as his blood spurted like a fountain. Unlike the merchant, Gamasa was spared by the genie and was given a new identity Abdullah the porter who then continued the criminal killing spree.The above tales are just a tasteful sampling of Mahfouz's tour-de-force as a raconteur. Arabian Nights and Days is made up of stories and adventures of 1001 Nights-like characters whose lives Mahfouz deftly and seamlessly woven together and converged at the Caf&eacute; of the Emirs. The caf&eacute; was the central hangout spot of town, where the elite met the ordinary, the rich mingled with the poor. It was where Sinbad parted with the town and returned with serendipitous treasures. It was where every father of a virgin daughter felt reassured relieved and rejoiced over the news of sultan's repentance. It was where the whisperings of people regarding Aladdin's innocence originated and eventually reached the sultan's ears.The book does not manifest a plot; rather it drifts along and presents the etched characters and their tantalizing but bitter struggles. I have to employ some patience to scrupulously keep track of the exhaustive cast of characters and their intricate relationships (newly adopted identity, remarriage of widows, merry-go-round-like change/succession of governor and police chief). Underlying the thrilling tales are Mahfouz's persistent philosophical overtones and queries. What is the \\"true path\\" to salvation? To what extent is a person responsible for his wrongdoings? How does one gauge the extent of repentance, if one is persistently pricked by guilt? To what extent does conscience permit wrongdoings, if the wrongdoing is conducted for a good cause?The Islamic town is somehow a satirical miniature of the incorrigible society, a world of outward piety and latent corruption. The acts and conduct of the characters bespeak man's weakness that betrays trust, treats generosity with disdain, and plunges recklessly into debauchery and criminal activities. From stealing, stupid pranks to murder; we see the pitiful fall of one of the most morally righteous man in the book. Does his conscience justify his actions?I am not sure how much I am really absorbing the philosophical message Mahfouz brings about underlying the tale, other than to know I am reading a brilliant satire and a very richly-written novel. Arabian Nights and Days is a delightful departure from Mahfouz's formulaic melancholy works chronicling his times. 4.2 stars."},{"Title":"Arabian Nights and Days","review":"It's \\"Scheherazade Redux\\" in Naguib Mahfouz's \\"Arabian Nights and Days.\\" The1988 Nobel Prize for literature winner takes the times and ages-old story and gives us are-telling, carving his initials on some of those characters (and stories) of a thousandand one nights: Sinbad, Aladdin, Scheherazade, etc.It is a tale told by a learned Egyptian who's display of the original themes take on amore modern glimmer. Granted, Mahfouz keeps the setting in the middle ages, but hetakes those themes and re-iterates their timeliness.Once again, here are the genies and humans facing (sometimes defying) love, hatred,greed, lust, and certainly the social injustices of any corrupt system. Throughout thenarrative, good is constantly squaring off against evil. That there's nothing new underthe sun doesn't phase Mahfouz, however, as he takes some seventeen tales andskillfully weaves them into his own magical spell.Mahfouz is compared to Proust, Camus, Salinger, and an introspective Hemingway,and justifiably so. Hailed as the \\"widest-read Arab writer currently published in theU.S.,\\" Mahfouz has certainly wielded his own influence among international readerssince the Prize; alas, it seems it took the impact of this award for his books to achievetheir circulation, but that doesn't diminish his themes, his philosophies, his impact onboth socially significant issues and modern literature. That said, however, the author(already some 30 novels to his credit), strikes adamantly at issues that transcend intomodern, more socially-significant items of today and thus \\"Arabian Nights and Days\\"is more than just a fairy tale. It's a good read. (...)"},{"Title":"Arabian Nights and Days","review":"Unique, fresh, and inspiring. At times amusing, at times disturbing, but always thought-provoking, never allowing good and evil to really be defined. The reader never knows what to expect. Go read it! It's quality literature that should not be missed."},{"Title":"Arabian Nights and Days","review":"A fascinating journey into the lives of the inhabitants of a city that faces the age-old struggles between virtue and corruption, freedom and despotism, justice and injustice. The novel is a loosely-woven collection of tales bound together by a strong sense of place that centres on the Caf&eacute; of the Emirs, where rich and poor alike gather daily to discuss the events of the day. Mahfouz's characters seek to escape the dreariness and injustice of everyday life, some through love, some by the sword, and some through dreams of flying or administering justice. Some succeed, some are put to death, but there is always a lesson to be learned by the city. A sense of timelessness pervades the book, the issues raised by Mahfouz as important today as they were in the days of the Arabian Nights. Some of the tales are more successful than others, but the overall work is enthralling."},{"Title":"Arabian Nights and Days","review":"The book is very readable and not too long, and the translation is excellent. Starting where the traditional Arabian Nights' Entertainment leaves off, Mahfouz cleverly describes surprising events in a world in which &quot;jinn&quot; (genies) are actively involved in the affairs of mankind. The tale is very enjoyable.But on another level, Mahfouz indirectly poses a more philosophical query: to what extent am I responsible for my actions, and if I err, to what extent can I blame circumstances, outside interference, and my inherent weakness as a human being? And if a very wicked person repents of his evil deeds, how much forgiveness is he entitled to in this world?I recommend the book."},{"Title":"Arabian Nights and Days","review":"These utterly delightful tales begin where &quot;A Thousand and One Nights&quot; left off. Sometimes, when genies play, humans of high and low station are pressed into excruciating choice. Good and evil ripples through society. It's awesome how Mahfouz threads the holy into civic life."},{"Title":"Arabian Nights and Days","review":"I love this book, I love this book, I love this book! Having read it twice from library copies, I finally bought a copy for my own and am reading it again. I love this book!

It is a work of art."},{"Title":"Arabian Nights and Days","review":"Mahfouz goes for some interesting detail in adult content...His writing weaves itself around my brain, wrapping it like a cobra.He makes me feel as if I am right there, part of the story.I find myself feeling mesmerized by the topics within the story-telling and am uncomfortable reading this book alone at home. (By now I'm convinced there's a genie hiding under my bed.) So instead, I carry this book in my purse, just reading it in the marketplace, the street cafe, and on along the bus-ride.Occasionally I look up and assure myself: I'm surrounded by people, and it's 2009."},{"Title":"Arabian Nights and Days","review":"My favorite of his novels - it is philosophical, very thoughtful and never dogmatic or simpliified.. Really magical and somehow fulfilling."},{"Title":"SEVEN BROTHERS.","review":"This rollicking translation of Kivi's \\"Seven Brothers\\" by Richard Impola finally makes this masterpiece of Finnish literature accessible to English readers. Impola manages to capture both the epic grandeur and humor of the Finnish text, and faithfully preserves the character of each vignette or escapade in which the brothers find themselves. This reviewer feels that Impola does a better job than the previous translator, Alex Mason, whose stilted prose is something of a barrier to the modern reader."},{"Title":"SEVEN BROTHERS.","review":"Along with The Kalevala, Aleksis Kivi's Seven Brothers is Finland's most celebrated literary treasure. The crowning accomplishment of Finland's first literary genius, Seven Brothers remains \\"the greatest Finnish novel of all time\\", the classic among the classics in Finnish literature.Published in 1870, in the author's 36th year and two years before his untimely death, Seven Brothers laid the foundation for what Kai Laitinen later called \\"The Great Tradition in Finnish Prose\\". This tradition is characterized by realism, humor, respect for the common people, and depiction of nature as both friend and foe.Received at the time of publication by uncomprehending arbiters of literary taste, who still delighted in romantic approaches to literature, Seven Brothers fared poorly in early reviews. Posterity, however, has resurrected the reputation of Aleksis Kivi, and critics, scholars, and readers at large continue to praise the virtues of this trail-blazing, exceedingly rich novel.Richard Impola's superb English translation captures the brothers' rustic milieu and the exceptional dynamics of Kivi's creative style and artistic conception."},{"Title":"SEVEN BROTHERS.","review":"I read this classic in the original Finnish.

Largely, of course, this was done by academics who were not themselves of that ethnicity. A roundabout way of saying that most were white, and male, for that matter.But there has also been an increasing number of Natives ascending the academic ladder. First as students, and then as faculty. A decades-long process. It has produced enough people, thus far, to enable the editors to put together this book. Here, the emphasis is not so much on changing a typical view of Natives in history, but instead on the academic environment itself, and how it impacts Natives trying to fit in. Which can be very difficult, as some articles in the book attest. A typical Native student might not have a family tradition of reaching college as a student, let alone as an academic.The editors have amassed very articulate concerns. Quite readable."},{"Title":"Indigenizing the Academy: Transforming Scholarship and Empowering Communities (Contemporary Indigenous Issues)","review":"The book is a compilation of poorly-researched essays, really poorly done, each belaboring bellyache ideas that we all, quite frankly, grew tired of back in high school. Example...the ridiculous diatribe into 'who is and who is not a native'. Haven't we all grown sick of that racist measuring stick yet?Unfortunately, each essay follows the same tired format. All are made up of stereotypes, promoting such yowlers as 'all Whites think this way, vs. all indigenous people think that way...'; drawn-out complaints without substantiation, such as 'all non-native professors use gatekeeping to keep out indigenous scholars', and the like.The book is for truly hateful, bigoted people who wish to foster an environment of fear in the academy and for those interested in engaging in senseless, time-wasting, essentialist arguments.Save your money and time and work for justice."},{"Title":"Insurrection: Citizen Challenges to Corporate Power","review":"You come away from this book feeling that people do make a difference, even though progress often happens at a slower pace than we would like, and success often is followed by backlash. The book is well organized, not as a barrage of information, but as a series of well developed stories that have a common thread. Corporate globalization is presented as the race to the bottom by which capital moves freely to wherever cost is lowest, leading to investment where environmental standards are the most lax and exploitation the most severe. The prescriptions for change are debatable, yet worthy of debate."},{"Title":"Insurrection: Citizen Challenges to Corporate Power","review":"In 315 breathless pages this book covers the history of US Corporate accountability struggles and the more recent activist battles over sweatshops, dolphin safe tuna, tobacco, Burma, and rule making in the global economy. In every case the book discusses how the campaign looked to the consumer, the activist, and what the lingering impact of it is. Every chapter ends with at least a couple of pages of &quot;lessons learned&quot;.Much space is devoted to the topic of Brands. In the chapter on sweatshops Nike gets lots of attention, primarily because everybody is familiar with them, but also because as a Global Brand they have a name to protect. The authors discuss how the activist goal was to put the company in a situation where &quot;all they had to do to rehabilitate their Brand was stop using sweatshops for manufacturing.&quot; They acknowledge how it would be much harder to go after the no-name manufacturers with clothes on the same racks, even though their sleaze problems could easily be worse. After reading the book I had a better sense of what a Brand is all about.Another topic that gets a lot of attention is how many of our consumer issues have global implications. In the tuna campaign the activists thought they had a great victory when they got Congress to pass a law against the practices that killed so many dolphins. Unfortunately, the tuna fishermen responded to the law by &quot;offshoring&quot;, changing their boat registration so they could fly a foreign flag. Sometimes they didn't even move where they fished or docked, they just did their registration paperwork in Mexico or some more exotic Capital. The tobacco companies responded to the shrinking of the American cigarette market by developing markets overseas. Over and over the idea that we need a coordinated international response to this kind of stuff comes up.The lesson is driven home in spades in the case of Burma. Activists worked to get local jurisdictions to vote to stop doing business with the totalitarian regime in power there, a strategy that had worked well in South Africa's case. They were undermined by international agreements that made such initiatives &quot;illegal barriers to trade&quot;. Even so, a lot of companies were talked out of doing business there. The country was forced to hold elections, but the pressure was not great enough that the people elected were actually given power. I could almost see frustrated activists saying &quot;well at least we made something happen&quot;.The last case recounted is &quot;The Battle In Seattle&quot;, where activists shut down the WTO in the full limelight of all kinds of press. They show how many lessons learned about using the Internet to get the word out in earlier campaigns like the Burma one kept the corporations from fully controlling the spin on the news the way they had in previous eras. The authors consider it a great victory that the previously quiet backwater of international trade negotiations was now promoted to the front page of political debate. Told from the activist point of view, the book does a good job of tying all these issues together."},{"Title":"MUSICAGE: CAGE MUSES on Words * Art * Music","review":"I know nothing about music, but I loved this book! Cage's conversations brim with humor, wisdom, and amazing insights into every subject under the sun. It's an enormous pleasure to spend a few hours &quot;in his company&quot; by reading this book."},{"Title":"MUSICAGE: CAGE MUSES on Words * Art * Music","review":"Joan Retallack, a long-time friend and colleague of John Cage, has done us the favor of publishing this series of conversations between the two of them. These conversations (for they lack any conventional formality that might render them 'interviews'), which took place not long before Cage's death in 1992, run the gamut of topics. Through their amiable banter, one gets a great sense of what was going on in the oft-misunderstood artist's mind--especially as regards his fixation on chance operations and the I Ching. The talks also give ample insight into Cage's writing and visual art, practices for which he is lesser known. When not provoking thought about Cage himself, the two (and I mean both of them equally; Retallack has a meticulously rich and compelling mind, and expresses many enlightening points-of-view herself) have revealing conversations about everything from Duchamp to Joyce, Buckminster Fuller to the Koran.Perhaps the most interesting and rare aspect of the book is the pervasive inclusion of the environmental and more mundane details of the conversations. She is careful to note the frequent occasions when Cage laughed, what he might have been cooking that day, interactions with an artist who stopped by to fix a bookshelf as a favor to Cage and to Merce Cunningham. Especially valuable is the penultimate conversation, when we are made privy to the beginning of Cage's composition process, as he begins to write a new piece on the spot with cellist Michael Bach. These insights into Cage's daily domestic life are perhaps the most revealing aspects of the book into his personality and philosophies.For those familiar with Cage, this is a must-read. If you are skeptical or confused about his work, these talks will clarify a lot for you. If you have yet to be exposed to Cage, I recommend this book highly as an accurate and exhaustive portrait."},{"Title":"MUSICAGE: CAGE MUSES on Words * Art * Music","review":"In addition to offering a lengthy view of Cage as is, through a series of completely unpretentious and joy-to-read interviews, the short introduction by Ms. Retallack is a thoughtful, sophisticated, comprehensive, and accurate description of John Cage's thoughts and practices."},{"Title":"MUSICAGE: CAGE MUSES on Words * Art * Music","review":"If you are familiar with Cage's art, you will love this account of Cages views on art and life.

My wife and I read this book out loud to each other during the course of the week and we are totally engaged in the ongoing dialogues between the various characters (especially Karl Oskar, Kristina and Ulrika of Vastergohl). The narrative descriptions of the scenery and the various interactions of the characters while they are on board the paddlewheeler \\"Red Wing\\" as they push up the Mississippi River toward Stillwater, Minnesota, will keep you anxious to know what's coming next. Moberg has a gift for being able to understand and describe the human thought and behavior of a people confronting a completely new and different environment for the first time. As the reader, you will be able to easily relate to the oh-so-human fears and frailties of the Swedish immigrants as they try to deal with the foreign and alien American frontier. Remember, they have been uprooted from their centuries-old traditional lifestyles back in the old country and are now thousands of miles away from their home country. They can't speak one intelligible word of English. Bless their hearts, these folks are bonefide heroes and heroines. I highly recommend this book to all those who want to discover and learn about some of the first settlers from Europe as they struggled to survive during their fearsome trip over the Atlantic Ocean, across lakes and rivers, through virgin territory, and ultimately reach their final destination in the heavily-forested Territory of Minnesota."},{"Title":"Unto a Good Land","review":"Moberg is an excellent story teller, compelling characters, attentive to period detail.

Translated from Swedish into English, this beautifully written book of historical fiction was first published in 1954 and met with excellent reviews at the time. It is the second part of a four part opus, the first of which is \\"The Emigrants\\". This book, \\"Unto a Good Land\\", is followed by two additional books, \\"The Settlers\\" and \\"Last Letter From Home\\".In the first volume, \\"The Emigrants\\", the author detailed the emigration of a Swedish family to the New World, grounding it in the reasons for the exodus of so many Swedes from their mother country in the middle of the 19th century. The focus of the first book in this four part opus is on the family, relatives, and friends of Karl Oscar Nilsson, a peasant farmer who unceasingly worked his farm, only to find that, no matter what he did, he could not progress and would continue to live on the cusp of total poverty. The focus of the first book is on their life in Sweden. Gathering up his family and friends of the family, the Nilsson family decides to take the monumental step of making a fresh start by emigrating to the new world, specifically the United States of America.The second volume, \\"Unto a Good Land\\", focuses on the arrival of the Nilsson family and friends in the United States of America. It details their journey from New York, a journey that was to take them across the Midwest by rail, steamer, and foot to arrive in the wilds of what would one day be the State of Minnesota. It is in this wilderness that the Nilsson family and friends would homestead and struggle to make a new home. The author regales the reader with the travails this hardy group of settlers would encounter in their efforts to create by the sweat of their brow a new home in the wilderness. The early struggles of the Nilsson family to succeed in what was an unknown frontier is engagingly chronicled. I have enjoyed the first and second volumes so much that I look forward to continuing their journey with them by reading the remaining two volumes. This is a book that those who love historical fiction will greatly enjoy."},{"Title":"Unto a Good Land","review":"From Manhattan, it is 1500 miles to Minnesota. Before departing, Karl Oskar feeds his family, and Robert and Arvid walk the length of Broadway, amazed by what they see. The group travels up the Hudson River by steamboat, from Albany to Buffalo by train and across the Great Lakes. They are now immigrants rather than emigrants. You can not be one without being both.Alienation is a theme of Unto A Good Land. The immigrants feel the limitations imposed upon them as foreigners. They do not know the geography and cannot speak the language. Dependence breeds suspicion and paranoia.The tension between Kristina and Ulrika begins to subside. After an attack of conscience, Kristina shares a loaf of bread with her. Ulrika and Elin are caring for Danjel's children.At a stopover in Detroit, Ulrika totally vindicates herself in Kristina's and Karl Oskar's eyes. She recovers Lill-Marta, their 3-year-old, from an orchard where she had gone to pick cherries. This is in the nick of time as the boat is about to leave. It is a touching scene where Karl Oskar takes the hand of the woman he ridiculed.The immigrants cut across the prairie and head up the Mississippi River. Arvid remains funny and stupid, fearing alligators which he calls crocodiles.The novels are virtually non-violent when compared with a Hamlet or a War and Peace. They are strong on character, simple, plain. We find people determining their own course, not swept up in events so overwhelming as to have their actions dictated for them.There is an emphasis on nature, the necessity of eking a living from the earth. There is not so much of war or what man has done to man. It is unexpected when at one point Karl Oskar has to elude some would-be bandits. The possibility of evil always lurks in the background, but it is secondary to man's struggle against the harsher side of nature. The immigrants yearn for freedom without having to harm anyone.Once in Minnesota territory, they walk to their final destination. In the lush forest, they feel at home for the first time, and Kristina and Ulrika laugh at the shaggy hair and beards of the men. Kristina uses wool shears on Karl Oskar, giving him the look of a sheep. Robert wants his hair short so he can not be scalped by Indians.When Danjel and Jonas Petter stake their claims near Swedish settlers, the obstinate Karl Oskar keeps going. Only when he feasts his eyes on Lake Ki-Chi-Saga does he feel he has arrived.Ki-Chi-Saga is an Indian name, but it is Karl Oskar's for the taking. It is all here: the lake, oak trees, a pine forest and three feet of topsoil.There is an optimism in the books and in Karl Oskar, an assurance that if we go hard enough and long enough, we will have the things we need.Domestic life resumes. The settlers build cabins, make furniture, plow and planet and hunt and fish. Kristina prepares meals and mends clothing. Moberg pulls us down to basic survival.Making it through the first winter is crucial. They need a cow for milk and flour for bread. Returning one night in the snow with a sack of flour, Karl Oskar gets lost. He finds his way, but realizes he might have frozen to death.The sense of mission in the first book dissipates into a narrative of day-to-day living, into a compilation of anecdotes and close calls.Of all the immigrants, only Kristina misses Sweden. She hides it. She now considers Ulrika a friend and requests her as midwife when the baby is born. The birth is described in detail. So is Kristina's emotional attachment to her first child born in America.The differences between the brothers quickly surface. Robert is no farmer. He wants to get rich. Karl Oskar considers him a liar, governed by his imagination. After the first winter, Robert and Arvid leave for the gold fields of California.Having cleaned up her act, Ulrika begins getting proposals. Women are scarce. Amazingly, she marries a Baptist minister.The book ends with Kristina confessing to Karl Oskar how much she misses Sweden. Karl Oskar shares his vision of the future with her, that their children and grandchildren will one day thank them for emigrating to America. The pair agree to call their new home Duvemala after the village Kristina grew up in."},{"Title":"Unto a Good Land","review":"This is an epic work by its Swedish author.

She says you have to lose your emotional pain before the weight will drop off. She could be right because food can be a comfort and if you are really in pain, there is nothing you can eat that will take away emotional distress. Well, maybe a lot of chocolate, which contains chemicals (PEA) to make you feel \\"in love.\\" Page 191 can be enlightening for anyone who uses chocolate as a love fix.This book is a result of Doreen's work in an all-female psychiatric hospital. Here, she met women struggling with deep emotional pain, stress, grief, depression, rage and dissatisfaction with their work, marriage and life in general. When she started to specialize in eating disorders, she did not realize the devastating effects of emotional neglect, verbal assaults and other abuses. Frankly, before reading this book, I didn't think about \\"emotional neglect\\" as being a cause of eating disorders. Now it makes sense to me.I'm pretty sure most women could tell you why they are in pain and Doreen says that pain should not be blindly accepted. She says: \\"it is a signal that something is wrong and needs to be changed or healed.\\" She even goes as far to say that \\"every extra pound you carry on your body equals a pound of emotional pain you're carrying in your heart.\\"Doreen also explains how serotonin has to be created every night and explains how this occurs and why melatonin is needed. If your REM sleep is interrupted, there can be groggy consequences. Apparently alcohol can interfere with REM sleep.This entire book seems to be dealing with the issues of self-esteem and listening to Self-Esteem: Your Fundamental Power by Carolyn Myss and reading Fed Up by Wendy Oliver-Pyatt might also be helpful.The author discusses dream analysis, exercise, meditation and discusses a variety of abusive situations that may need to be dealt with in order for your body to finally shed the pounds along with the pain.Personally, I've found that working out on a regular basis has helped my self-esteem and yoga has been especially healing. Yoga seems to encourage you to eat healthy foods and by cutting out soda (replace with a packet of \\"lite\\" Emer'gen C, fruit juice concentrate and aloe juice for body healing) and sugary foods (look for chocolate by Hershey's with only 1 gram Carbs)your appetite will not be as aggressive.By increasing protein and taking supplements your body is craving, you can work your way into a more balanced lifestyle. Give yourself time, this entire area of self-esteem can take years to heal and you might have to make some drastic lifestyle changes in order to see your life turn around. Finding one person who believes in you and supports you in your efforts, even if it is an author, will be immensely helpful. Doreen Virtue makes you aware of the link between abuse, stress and overeating. Then, she shows you how to heal your body and how to reclaim your self-esteem.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"I rarely write reviews but just finished reading this and felt compelled to share my frustration with certain aspects of the book. I got this book because I'm a rape survivor and wanted to learn more about the connection between my weight and the abuse I experienced. And for the first seven chapters, I found the author's experience in working with survivors who also have eating problems to be helpful. Then, I got to chapter eight, which deals with adolescent and adult abuse including rape, and I was no longer all that impressed with Ms. Virtue as a therapist. In talking about rape, she concludes that being raped by a stranger is the \\"Ultimate Violation.\\" I found it ludicrous to even suggest that a certain type of rape could be more damaging than another. After all, it's a pretty huge violation of one's trust, as well as one's body, to be raped by someone you know. But perhaps this lack of awareness comes from the fact that Ms. Virtue is not, herself, an abuse survivor.I also found this author has a tendency to oversimplify things, such as her suggestion that an \\"overactive appetite is actually triggered by one of these emotions: Fear, Anger, Tension, and Shame,\\" what she calls the FATS feelings. I've personally found that sadness/grief, guilt, and sometimes even joy can trigger the desire to eat compulsively.Then, I got to chapter twelve about therapy and support. I think the first part of the chapter regarding how to choose a therapist is somewhat helpful, although she again makes a claim bordering on oversimplification about how sexual abuse therapists coming in one of only three forms--I'm sorry, but that just seems ridiculous and hasn't been true in my own experience. In the second part of this chapter, she begins to talk about other forms of support such as the 12-step group Overeaters Anonymous and then suggests Weight Watchers as a solution for people who don't have significant therapy issues. The statistical data alone on the failure rate of weight loss programs like Weight Watchers and the like is staggering. Yes, people lose weight but most put it back on--something like 95% of those who lose weight eventually gain it back within three years and the FDA has declared that not one single company in the entire weight loss industry can show a record of long-term success. But I'm fairly sure that Ms. Virtue's mother having been a counselor at Weight Watchers has something to do with that part of the book.And now we get to the title of my review--stop reading after chapter 13! I say this because Ms. Virtue's ideas about 'healthy nutrition' are rather rigid, fat-fearing, and based on a lot of outdated diet-mentality. For a really good book on healing from food issues, I'd suggest Intuitive Eating by Tribole & Resch, as well as books written by Geneen Roth. As a person with a very long history of dieting, losing/gaining weight, fighting & being afraid of food--the intuitive eating approach is finally bringing me a great deal of peace with food and is slowly helping me to normalize my weight. In the years I spent either dieting/restricting (which leads to bingeing) or even in my experience with OA (a LOT of food fear in that group), I've finally stopped trying to be what I call a \\"food nun.\\" Perhaps you need a name like Virtue to pull that one off in the long-run ;)Also, the author goes into a section about how she believes certain foods cravings are connected to specific moods/energies. An example is a chocolate cake craving being equated to \\"feeling empty, insecure, possibly from a lack of love.\\" I don't know about everyone else out there with food issues, but I for one, am as likely to go after chocolate cake when I'm feeling angry, as when I'm sad, or bored, or scared, etc. I just don't buy her theory, although she claims that \\"in general, though, I've found that my research finding on food and mood to be incredibly accurate.\\" Sounds highly subjective to me.Ms. Virtue also believes that you should weigh yourself every morning, \\"right after you awaken and urinate.\\" OK, I'm sorry but I've never known a person who was at peace with their body and food who did this. I think it's perfectly fine to weigh oneself from time to time, maybe even as often as once a week if you feel the need. The author says that the reason for daily weigh-ins is to give you, \\"immediate feedback about your weight and eating habits.\\" Sorry, but that's just not true. If I eat some salty food, or start my period, the day before, I'm likely to retain water and end up 'weighing' more. This is not a reflection of any actual weight gain. You can drive yourself batty with the daily weighing and become rather obsessed. I'd venture to guess that this behavior came about in the author's life as a result of having the weight-loss counselor in the home.Overall, I was rather disappointed in this book and in this author for pushing off some of her own food issues onto her readers. She should stick with discussing the abuse component and leave the food & weight topics to more enlightened authors."},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"Dr. Virtue relates her own story and those of her patients in a concise, easy-to-read manner, and interweaves therapeutic principles throughout. To paraphrase another reviewer, Dr. Virtue sounds as though she is your best friend giving you a heart-to-heart talk about what she went through and how you can help yourself. I found that just reading the book, before implementing any of the suggested techniques, was very healing for me."},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"without giving too many details as it would be too personal, I consider this book a \\"gift from above\\"... : it helps people understand WHY they eat too much, and how to get your eating pattern back in control to lead a successful weight loss. Doreen gives plenty of tips, such as affirmations.There is no pretention in her book and it helps people who have been struggling with emotional overeating and who have been victims of abuse,whether the \\"facts\\" happened during their childhood or later in life. It's a powerful self-therapy book, highly recommended !"},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"I had never made the connection between my emotions and my eating until I started reading this book. After tolerating abuse from my parents and my husband, I had no idea why I seemed so nice and happy on the outside but one little thing could make me lose it and throw a temper tantrum. By doing the exercises in this book, I began to see how I had been keeping my emotions stuffed and as I released them, I also released the weight. Great book. I highly recommend it for emotional eaters."},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"I really appreciate this book. I loved the caring tone and the way the author seemed to reach out and give the reader a hug! I think that so many of the stories and descriptions spoke to my heart about myself and friends that I found myself calling friends or emailing parts of the books so we could talk ideas! This is a gem! Thank you for writing it, Doreen."},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"\\"Losing Your Pounds of Pain Breaking the Link Between Abuse, Stress, and Overeating\\" isn't the best title for this book. In fact, the description on the back reading, \\"...wonderful book that will truly help you break the damaging connection between emotional pain and overeating...\\" isn't really accurate either. The truth is that too much of the content focuses on sexual abuse. There's paragraph after paragraph about various folks being abused. I hadn't interpreted the title in that way and thought that my stress = overeating cycle would be addressed more completely.There is one page of affirmations and a short section that correlates some common foods to their associated emotional/personality traits, which was helpful. Other than that I was thoroughly disappointed."},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain is by far the best book I have read on the subject! I found I could identify with the case studies and gained numerous inights into my struggle with weight. Kudos to Dr. Virtue."},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"This isn't the first time a book by Doreen Virtue has helped me. She does manage to get close to problems and to help the readers get close to them too. She creates a safe, understanding path for getting to the heart of issues; readers are lead gently to the core of the problems of obesity.Virtue acknowledges that many therapists connect sexual abuse with being overweight, but she doesn't stop there. She delves into other reasons which many times do revolve around sexuality, but aren't limited to it. No matter what the reason for overeating, the result is the same - a person ends up weighing more than they want to be.She explores different cases histories from her experiences as a therapist. Readers can relate to the pain and gain cycle no matter what their issues might be and can use the information to move forward in breaking the cycle.It helps to have a friend read the book with you. You need support to face some issues and hopefully you can support each other. Find someone at the gym or in your weight loss group. She has a great section on the psychology of \\"plateau.\\" Hint: there's no such thing as \\"set point\\" except in your head.I'll admit, I spent a week fighting the book after I started it. I put it aside and went back to my old habits. That's why having a partner helped, we talked through the tough parts and I could pick up the book and begin anew. It's a great book to work through weight issues with a life coach or therapist too. It's not a diet book. You have to change the way you think in order to change the way you eat and move.This reviewer is disappearing slowly but surely.Doreen Virtue's book is being held as an accomplice in this case."},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"I had high expectations for this book, thinking that I'd find some interesting facts and research on overall emotional overeating, not just related to sexual abuse. Sadly, this book is heavily laden with disturbing and very graphic accounts of sexual molestation, incest and rape. I had a hard time reading through the disgusting experiences related in the book.I feel nothing but sorrow to think that a human being could be subjected to such horrible acts and hope that those can be healed and live lives full of love and joy.While it provides some useful ideas, such as excercise,affirmations and visualization to release the negative emotions, the book also lacked a comprehensive plan to help victims of sexual abuse deal effectively with their pain. Directly from her book:\\"To uncover the unresolved pain, you usually need to recall some painful experiences from childhood and/or adolesce and determine who the perpetrator was. If you blamed yourself for any abuse that you suffered, then you need to remind yourself that, as a young person, you weren't responsible for the abusive or neglectful actions of others -even if you somehow felt responsible at the time.\\"Ms. Virtue advises people to seek professional help and get involved in psycotherapy. She also suggests a low fat diet, which is a pretty archaic advise and proven not very effective.Unless you have had a similar experience as those related in this book, I don't think it would beneficial to you."},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"Doreen virtue shows us in her lovely book \\"Losing Your Pounds of Pain\\", that there is a connection between emotional pain and overeating.This book has been a gem in supporting me in overcoming my emotional issues that have kept me locked in a place where I never thought I could overcome my problems with food and weight.There are lengthy chapters about sexual abuse, that do get a little detailed, but she also talks about the pain of this moment and other childhood issues that may cause you to over eat.I really enjoyed the last several chapters that are solution oriented, and have helped me tremendously on my journey. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"Doreen speaks truth and honesty on compulsive and binge eating.Anyone who has suffered from lose of control with eating will appreciate the depth and courage Doreen shares in this book."},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"I'm giving this book four stars only because I am now at a point in my life where I have already become aware of many of the ideas presented in this warm and worthwhile book. It is plainly evident that the author cares about her readers, which must surely be a great comfort to those who are struggling and suffering.While I'm not certain the objective of losing weight by facing one's demons can be universally realized here, the book does provide a useful service in that the reader can come away feeling uplifted and comforted. I know I was. Having suffered ongoing abuse as a child, I became a pleaser and a perfectionist in an effort to stop said abuse - to no avail. The author's statement that even had I been the perfect child, the behavior of the abuser would not have changed was of considerable comfort to me.Whether the reader achieves the goal of losing weight or not, the book is still worth taking the time to read."},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"This book gave me more insight into myself than any other to date! With anecdotes and easy to understand english, Doreen Virtue reminds us to treat ourselves with kindness. Even if you feel anger toward someone (including yourself) who &#34;did you wrong,&#34; this book reminds you to let it all go-- don't punish yourself through denial or suppression, or even through hating. This book is everything one might expect from a woman who knows angels!"},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"This book explores weight and pain in a way that is easy to understand and gives steps to build your new found strength upon.Losing Your Pounds of Pain"},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"I started into this book and could already see a change in me.

I would say \\"YES - GO BUY IT!"},{"Title":"Losing Your Pounds of Pain","review":"I was disappointed in this. It appeared to be so promising. Instead it was more fluff and nothing all that concrete.

Has no practical or innovative approach to offer. Author indicates you need to deal with all your life issues before you can lose weight. If that's the case, no one will ever lose weight. Better off spending your time reading &quot;Overcoming Overeating&quot; - a gem of a book written in 1988 - find it on Amazon for less than ( ). Absolutely novel concept - it's working for me. Approach with an open mind and commitment. OA veterans will find &quot;Overcoming Overeating&quot; scarey - it preaches liberation, not a lifetime of reinforcing &quot;I'm a compulsive overeater.&quot; It's a cure - not an excuse or a prison. Try it."},{"Title":"The Evolution of the Airline Industry","review":"This is the Author's second book on the subject, and both books are excellent (they have written numerous journal articles on the subject). Their treatment of air fares and hubs is particularly good. Their bottom line findings: deregulation has increased economic welfare, and the financial turbulence the industry faced in the early 90 was the result of an oversupply of equipment (the major carriers didn't forecast the impending recession and consequently ordered too many planes). I highly recommend this book it is very well researched."},{"Title":"The Evolution of the Airline Industry","review":"I will admit that this book is not for everyone. The casual airline enthusiast may have some difficulty sifting through the econometrics. This book is written more for academics. However, the concise, clear, well-written style leads me to no other conclusion but to rate this as an excellent book. The hypotheses are clear. The data is explained. Economic reasoning is used to posit their point. If you wish to know how economists look at and measure deregulation, then this book is a good choice. Indispensable for grad students in economics studying transporattion and/or regulatory issues."},{"Title":"The Evolution of the Airline Industry","review":"Lots of facts, but not much depth to them. Essentially their conclusions are that de-regulation has been a fanstastic success. If you read &quot;Airline Management Strategies for the 21st Century,(a better book)&quot; draws different conclusions. I think some of their analysis is shoddy and kind of shallow. Still, its got some good facts, and worth a read."},{"Title":"The Omega Prodigy","review":"As a zealous fan of the 'aliens are among us' literary theme, I am always on the lookout for tales not of this earth- no matter how good, or bad, the writing. Unfortunately, in the case of The Omega Prodigy, the writing is bad- very, very bad. Although I liked the premise, that being a perky, mild-mannered ten-year old girl with nary an evil bone in her body being stalked by a shadowy government agency bent on exploiting her awakening but very deadly telekinetic powers for its own sinister purposes, the author utterly fails to deliver a sustainable story. Too many hackneyed plot developments, too much useless, space consuming dialogue (along with too much forced use of profanity), a few too many plot twists and too little in the way of editing and proofreading ultimately turned a workable entry about alien involvement in human affairs into little more than bad fan-fic written for mass consumption on the internet.Without giving away too much, it turns out that every cliche of science fiction and paranormal phenomena is thrown into this book. On top of this, there is plenty of alien abduction, alien experimentation on unwilling human subjects, and of course, government involvement in a conspiracy of intergalactic proportions. This is all fine and good, but it often gets lost in pointless dialogue, useless scenes, and it takes about three-quarters of the book to get the story finally moving and the action going at a galloping pace. Like too many first-time or novice authors, desperately seeking to make their first novel a good story, he tries to do too much, and thus overdoes key elements. Obsessed with writing a really good story, they end up writing a bad one. As such, this book is yet another example of too much emphasis on the product, and too little emphasis on the process.Although I liked the premise, loved the main character, and really did find some of the story elements to be both original and surprising, the author consistently failed to put it all together to make a good, moving story. A book like this could have either gone two routes. The first route could have been a trilogy that finally reveals the true nature and purpose of the alien intervention, with a high-stakes end-of-the-world final showdown between her and an alien badass (a la the tired Matrix films). The second route could have easily been a series format, where the young girl matches wits against an ever-changing motley of aliens, and along the way learns something about herself and her unusual gifts and comes to some sort of (uneasy) terms with them.In sum, I have to say that I liked some elements of the book, and I did have high hopes for the story going into it. Yet, I was ultimately let down, which typically is the case in this particular genre. However, I hope that the author continues to improve his craft, and perhaps in the future, a better story along the same lines will emerge."},{"Title":"The Omega Prodigy","review":"Being a Sci-Fi fan from waaaayyyy back, I admit I can be pretty picky sometimes. This book, however, I have no complaints about, except maybe it was too short!! I enjoyed the characters, plot line, descriptive writing, well, the story as a whole.Overall, it is definitely an enjoyable read and I look forward to more installments from this author."},{"Title":"The Omega Prodigy","review":"This is truly wonderful science fiction.

Seldom does the story drag.The style is open and friendly, and it's clear that Kisor has respect and affection for the staff and passangers he meets on the train.The narrative style reminds me a little of John McPhee; Kisor has the same talent for fading into the background and letting the story tell itself."},{"Title":"Zephyr: Tracking a Dream Across America","review":"Started reading this book on my first USA train ride in 25 years, the Zephyr heading to Chicago. With the exception of him expounding on a mystery story he and another passenger tried to concoct the book kept my attention. Essentially it is a story of taking the Chicago to San Francisco train and events on that trip, histories of points along the route, and rail anecdotes of all sorts woven into the train trip. The book also offered useful insights in my trip such as the fact that sleeper compartment passengers had a special lounge they could adjourn to in Chicago. It all makes me want to hop aboard again."},{"Title":"Zephyr: Tracking a Dream Across America","review":"I wanted to use this book as a guide for planning my own cross-country trip on the Zephyr. It's a wonderful book if you want to know the history of railroad depots and the ups-and-downs of passenger train history.But if waiting to see what's outside the the train windows, the book is a big disappointment. 150 pages into the book, Mr. Kisor has barely looked out the window. His book is a catalogue of all the minutia that occurs during his trip, from his first conversations with the chef and the steward all the way to the ramblings of drunken passengers. Mr. Kisor seems extremely people-oriented, which I am not criticising; I just would have liked more descriptions of the passing countryside to get a sense of Americana seen from passenger trains.Kisor also seems to focus too much on unpleasant, uncelebrated side of train travel. \\"The second coach stank of stale farts, bodily crevices and morning breath...\\" His reporter's sense of detail is sometimes too keen; he reports on everything around him with impeccable accuracy, whether pleasant or unpleasant. While everyone has experienced cantankerous passengers and garrulous bores, we don't really want them jumping from the pages of a book to spoil our ride. There were sections of this book that made me think twice about scheduling a cross-country trip. If Kisor's purpose was to celebrate the passenger railroads and encourage people to ride them, he might consider trading more uplifting paragraphs for these truthful, but depressing, episodes.All in all, it is still a good read if you want well researched train history mingled with a hefty set of personal anecdotes. But please, Mr. Kisor, the next time you ride the Zephyr, look out the window!"},{"Title":"Zephyr: Tracking a Dream Across America","review":"I read this to obtain background information before taking a trip on the California Zephyr.

They don't expect you to live as if it were the 1800's either. They incorporate the use of vacuum sealers and microwaves--and trying to preserve food in the confines of the modern home. Likewise, they will also explain how to create the old types of environments or something that will work just as well.To be honest, there is more educational information than there are recipes. And even the recipes they give are educational--covering jellies, jams, butters and pickling. These are prime opportunities for failure without appropriate instruction--and that's what they provide. Explaining how it all works--which is not common sense! It takes some learning!They also explain the best preservation method for the food (often right down to a variety of fruit or veggie, or cut of meat) and how the preservation method used will alter the food. They also tell you what the food will be best used for after preserving. For instance, if freezing cabbage means it will never be crisp again they warn you about this and tell you not to expect it to be used for salads.

My favorite cookbooks are \\"The Professional Chef\\" by the Culinary Institute and \\"Culinary Artistry\\". This book is exactly what I expected it to be, a vast collection of information regarding canning, and freezing, curing, and drying food.I purchased this book last year after I decided to eliminate all preservative, chemicals and dyes from our food and had difficulty locating reasonably priced products that were prepared naturally. I remembered that my parents had gone through a hippy phase when I was young and found an old version of this book at their house.

If you are looking for specific meat preparations I would suggest that you purchase \\"Charcuterie\\" by Michael Ruhlman instead as it is much more thorough.This book contains many recipes for jams and jellies, and includes a section on reduced sugar and no sugar fruit preserves. They have also included recipes and directions for fruit spreads with and without added pectin that is very helpful.In the section on smoking they address both hot and cold smoking and give you directions for making your own smoker that reminded me a lot of the Alton Brown episode on smoking. I have not tried this, but it seems very straightforward and this might be on my agenda this summer if I can get my husband interested in the process.Whether you are looking for how to make pickles, can tomatoes, or make jams and jellies this book has a little something for everyone.

It has almost any type of food and how to put it up. Very informative and lots of information on the correct way to can any specific food to prevent bacteria growth. I feel safer knowing the methods in the book are thoroughly researched and tested. A great book."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"A solid and complete resource for any method of food preservation from drying, root cellering to pressure canning of nearly everything. I was delighted to see this book reprinted - I can send a copy to each of my daughters!"},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"This book will tell you everything you need to know to preserve your own food. It covers canning, freezing, drying, smoking and root cellars.I found it very helpful, but a little intimidating. They emphasize safety, and they definitely should, but almost to the point of scaring you to death! I think sometimes the completeness makes the whole process seem much harder than it really is.I've made two batches of jam so far, and all went well.All in all the book is great, but I'd also read through the Ball books, as they make the process seem easier."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"My mother-in-law bought this for me (2nd edition) when I started to put up food 20 years ago.

Only problem is my book is missing pages 155 through 186. It looks like a binder error, so there may be more out there with the same problem. Check as soon as it arrives."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"First I do not hate this book, but I needed to get your attention. It was a great book in 1988. I actually like the book very much except...The book being sold is the fourth edition and was actually published in 1988, and proper food storing procedures have changed. The book is dated.Most, if not all the authors are now dead, but if alive they would be the first to tell you NOT TO FOLLOW the procedures without updated info.Second, I always thought their discussion on making pickles the long way (fermentation) was insufficient. My educated guess is the USDA back in the 70's and 80's was discouraging the old fashion ways of pickling and these authors followed about 1988 USDA procedures. Their discussion on using strong wet brine to preserve is also poor, probably for the sane reason and because of the effort to reduce salt in the diet. But the salt can be removed, or the produce can be used as a seasoning. It's a choice people should make on their own. I make pickles the long way and also preserve in strong brine.Third, they could have been more precise with facts and figures about botulism prevention. For example, a 10% brine, that is maintained at 10% will stop Botulism. A 50% sugar solution that is maintained at 50% will do so also etc: etc: This info is available in Microbiology texts."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"Owned my first couple for years and gave it away to a relative. Had to buy another copy. It is the very best of the all-around food preservation books on the market. It is a must for the reference shelf."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"This book has some of the 'old' ways of canning, which I feel are the best. Why re-invent the wheel? My neighbor who is in her 80's and still gardening and canning actually recommended this book to me. It has taught me some new things, and reinforced things I already knew. I got one for two of my sisters who also enjoy canning. Nothing tastes as good as your own fresh food which you have canned. It is really gratifying and I loved this book!Anyone who cans would enjoy this book, as a reference, and if you are new to canning, it would be invaluable."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"This book has something to say about all types of foods and food processing. When I read it I can just hear my Old Aunt Ellen telling me how to do it! And she was the best!"},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"This book is excellent. It's easier to read and understand than the Ball Canning books. It gives you reasons why a certain way of canning is recommended. I highly recommend this version over any other canning book"},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"I purchased this book for someone as a gift, I have the book myself and love it. The book was advertised as new, when I received the book, the book appears to be new, but when I opened the cover it is inscribed as a gift from someone to someone else. Not what I ordered! Not happy at all. Delivery time was excellent, very fast."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"I received a copy of this book, this edition, from my MIL when I got married. It is basically a textbook on how to preserve food at home while following safety procedures that many may not have learned if they grew up without this resource. Personally, I grew up doing almost everything either frozen or pressure canned, so it was a very good additional source for other methods I hadn't experimented with before. Additionally while I said I grew up utilizing a few methods, I actually didn't entirely remember the steps because my mother passed away when I was fifteen, and I spent about 10 years not doing any home gardening or preserving. One forgets a lot over a decade.My only problem with this book (well other than, as mentioned, it is no longer the latest edition), is that the 'tone' of the writing comes off as somewhat condescending. There are many passages where the authors seem to be addressing all readers as careless idiots. I'm sure some of my annoyance comes from having worked in food service and thus already having had a lot of training in proper handling and avoiding cross-contamination, etc, so please understand I am not saying don't buy this book - just read it with a mind to whatever your personal instruction level is.Other than that, it is a great book and I use it every summer, both to refresh my memory on 'hot water bath' canning and whenever I decide to experiment with another method for a special project. I'm not a Matriarch with weeks of canning and preserving every summer, by any means, but I do enjoy the taste of home grown tomatoes in January, as well as having my own sauerkraut, strawberry jam, and jalapenos and salsa out of season. There is also useful information for drying your foods. Home dried peaches, pears, and apples have become some of my favorite snacks, so having this book has helped quite a lot for that as well.I hope this review has helped and that those interested in home preserving have fun and enjoy the 'fruits of their labor'!"},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"I received this book within an acceptable amount of timeframe. I am continuing to read the book, however the parts that I have read have been very informative. I think it could have been written where it would have been a bit more interesting and organized. But I really don't have any thing to say negative about the content of the book. I do a lot of canning and I would buy this book again based on the contents and information given. I think any beginner canner needs this information so they will realize the importance of keeping things clean, sterile and the rationale behind why things are done as they are. I really like the part that I read about when you take things out of the canner and you don't have a good seal, how to test to see if it is a keeper or whether to throw away. Page 77-78 covering jar seals. I have had this delima from time to time & usually just put it in the fridge and eat right away, however, the book gave some good tips on checking/trying to see if it has a good seal that I felt were very informative and I plan on using these in the future. I am a RN and I found that I learned a lot in spite of my knowledge from a clean/sterile point of view as a nurse. I'd buy this book for my daughter or any woman that is interested in canning just so they understand the threats of not doing things properly. It is a lot of info to take in @ one reading, so I'd recommend after reading it the first time, to revisit the book again to refresh the importance of certain points you might have questions about down the road. I am giving it 4 stars because of the 'whole book in it's entirety'. But as far as it's content it is really deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"This is my favorite canning, jelly and preserve book.

It is complete, easy to understand and thorough. Highly Recommended for beginners and seasoned canners. The perfect reference book."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"The value in this book is its coverage of techniques. That's very unlike, say, the Ball preservation book, which focuses on water bath and pressure canning. Putting Food By is as close to a preservation Bible as you will find. It's a staple among natural food folks, gardeners, home preparedness advocates, even survivalists. Please note that it is a technique book primarily, not a cookbook for canning, as so many food preserving books are. (There is, of course, extensive coverage of canning techniques.) That said, one reason I like Putting Food By so much is that there is detailed food item by food item advice as it relates to preservation you don't typically find in other books."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"This is a good, solid reference book, packed full of facts, and very detailed. If you need to know how to preserve something, this book will show you how."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"I got the first version of this book many years ago when I wanted to learn to can veggies and fruit from my garden. I didn't have the luxury of learning at Mom's or Grandma's knee, since they didn't can, so I had to teach myself. This book was my first purchase in the \\"teach myself\\" arsenal.I bought the second edition only after the first one had practically fallen apart.It's pretty basic, with in-depth explanations of canning methods and food spoilage. Not sure if a certain food is better off canned or frozen? This book helps with that. Also, if you're considering which equipment to buy, be it canning or freezing, this book gives excellent advice. Even though it's a little dated by now, the equipment has remained the same--pressure canners and freezers haven't changed much over the years and jars are still jars!There are instructions for each type of produce and instructions about raw-packing or hot-packing. What I found most useful is the meat preserving sections. It's so detailed that you could butcher your own animal, and preserve it using this book. (I am a city girl--I just wanted to can my own chicken soup, so canning game was not my goal, but it may be yours!)This book is chock full of recipes. Not just how to put food up, but what to do with a jar of food after you've preserved it. My book opens automatically to the Classic Orange Marmalade recipe, which I have used for years. The following page has the guidance on making fruit butters, which I have found invaluable. I also appreciate the chapter on making your own convenience foods--like canning dried beans.Want to make your own ketchup? The recipe in here is excellent!Putting Food By regained its place front and center on my kitchen bookshelf when we moved to the Rocky Mountains and I had to learn about high altitude canning.All in all, if I had to choose just one book on canning/preserving and throw the rest away, this would be my first choice! It's been a keeper in my kitchen since the '80's!"},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"This is a great book for understanding the how to's and why's of putting food by, or storage, but without the \\"ohmygod, you're going to DIE if you don't simmer the lids for ten minutes!!!). There's a lot to be said for using good old fashioned common sense and this book stresses just that - common sense. There are a lot of great ideas for food storage within these pages."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"This book was originally published in 1988. Common practice then differs from tday's standards but the book does say it has been updated. Most of the changes would have to do with recommended times for processing and adjusting recipes. When I got this book I was disappointed at first. I wanted a book of recipes to add variety to what I was canning. (A zillion jars of tomato juice looks dismal in February!) So, when this arrived and I opened it I found that probably only half of it was dedicated to recipes and the rest was blah, blah, blah - or so I thought. As I read, I found that the authors did their best to explain WHY certain processes were important. They explain the science behind the hot water bath and why the time you process is important to heat to the core of the product in the jar. While I have been canning for several years, I hadn't heard a lot of the information in this book. If you want to preserve food for your family, particularly on a large scale, this is a good reference to have. While I think there are probably splashier, glossier books but this should be on your shelf as a reliable reference."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"I failed to note the original copyright date. The information and format is 30 years old. That is OK for some of the older techniques but I would bet some areas have since been improved.The information seems comprehensive. For the used price a good value."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"This book has a lot of very valuable information for canning as well as odd stuff like soap making. It even tells you how to make lye for soap with hardwood ashes. The instructions in the text are very well written, easy to understand, and precise. This is not just a book about canning, it also has good information on root cellaring vegetables outdoors, curing meats and smoking meats and some pretty basic stuff about freezing which leads me to believe that when the book was first written not many people had refrigeration.Basically it's a wealth of forgotten information which is both interesting and practical especially for a person who wants to grow ones own food and preserve it in a practical way. Also would be a good book for someone who thinks that civilization is going to be destroyed in 2012 since much in this book can be achieved with little or no technology and includes info on making soap etc. It's worth having just to have a better understanding of how canning works."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"I have been using this book, well the earlier printed version, for almost 30 years. This book tells you everything you need to know about canning & freezing fruits & vegetables. It's my canning bible. It also tells you how to make jams & jellies. When I first started canning, the whole process was alittle scary to me. Seems like so many things can go wrong, & didn't want to send my family & friends to the hospital. But, this book makes it simple to understand & takes the fear out of it. It's so gratifing to have all this good(no preservatives & additives) food for my family all winter. I live in the mountains, & it gives you all the changes you need to make for high altitude. Process time is usually longer. You absolutely won't regret purchasing \\"Putting Food By\\". I have numerous other canning books & always go back to this one."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"When I first started canning I had borrowed this book from my brother. I was so impressed with it, that I bought my own. That was 35 yrs ago. Its the only book I use."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"As home gardening and using local produce become more popular again, preserving it correctly is critical and here's all the info your mother may not have taught you. This book has so much valuable information, I'll be reading and rereading for a long time. With a mantra of safety first, various processes are described in detail, which methods are appropriate for which foods, the pros and cons of different equipment, how you can safely alter a recipe and where to find unusual ingredients among other topics. Components are described and why they are used. While I won't be using some of the techniques, e.g. canning in metal cans, I am very interested in freezing, drying and pickling, and would like to try other processes.I have a FoodSaver which I use for freezer packaging where possible and with this book's table of freezer time limits for retaining quality, I am writing on my packages, not the date I froze it, but the use-by date, and storing the packages with similar dates together in baskets so things don't get buried and forgotten. I've even found bags for sealing veggies that go from the freezer directly to the microwave for steaming. They work great. This book is giving me the information to ensure the best quality product after preservation.We've become so accustomed to buying our food pre-processed, most of us don't know how to process it ourselves as our ancestors commonly did. For those of us who are interested in returning to natural, whole foods, growing what we can and buying extra produce to preserve in season when it is best and cheapest, we have a huge learning curve, but I think it's well worth the effort and this book supplies all I could possibly want to know (and more)."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"The fact that this is the fourth printing \\"Putting Food By\\" is a good indication that this book is well on its way to being a classic.

Covers the \\"why's\\" and the \\"how's\\" of food spoilage as well as how to best preserve just about anything you can think of. Lots of great recipes, too.One reviewer called the book \\"scary\\" but I think the book simply tells it like it is. You can't sugar coat it. If you follow the directions and don't cut corners, especially when canning, you will be rewarded."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation of an author who had published articles about food preservation. I was not disappointed.I have been accumulating the material necessary to start canning fruits and tomatoes and I had been reading on line sources and magazine articles about preserving foods. I have also been interested in other ways of preserving foods as well. This book gives exhaustive, in depth instructions about different methods of preserving foods. While most of the book is devoted to canning foods, there is much about freezing, drying, salting and smoking foods to preserve them. The author thoroughly discusses every method of food preservation, including old fashioned ways of food preservation which are no longer considered safe.The author carefully emphasizes the need for specific procedures that are followed precisely in order to safely preserve foods. For instance, she shows how to determine if your pot is going to be tall enough to use to can quart jars, since boiling water must cover the jars by at least two inches in order to assure a proper, sterile seal. Many canners cannot accommodate quart jars with a full two inches of boiling water above the jars, so that is an important bit of information to know before you buy a canner.Many recipes are given, but the basic proportions of necessary ingredients are also given which allow for some limited creativity in recipes for canned goods. The author does not just tell what must be done, but goes into detail to explain why things are done the way they are done.At the end of the book there is a comprehensive list by chapter of additional sources of information if one has questions after reading the material in the book.I expect to get a lot of use from this book and it seems to have everything I need in order to accomplish my objective of safely saving food."},{"Title":"Putting Food By","review":"I found the book Putting Food Bye to be an excellent supplementary resource for the amiture food canner or dehydrator.

If you are an experienced crocheter, this book is a disappointment, to put it lightly. I could imagine that perhaps children aged 8-10 yrs would find these projects appropriate to their skills in crocheting, otherwise the designs are just dull and unpleasant. I am truly very sorry to say this, but this book is a waste of money."},{"Title":"Victorian Crocheted Christmas Ornaments: 33 Quick-And-Easy Projects (Dover Needlework)","review":"Most of the patterns in the book are juvenile. There are a few (perhaps 5 or 6) that can be salvaged, if you know how to crochet. I am not an expert, but this author is not even a beginner. Apparently none of the simple (very simple) designs are starched or stiffened, and the patterns are way too simple, and frankly, lackluster. P.S. to the author...if you're a ten-year-old girl, your work is fantastic! (Truly...you just have more to learn.)

I think they will love it."},{"Title":"The Flood Tales","review":"I flipped through this book and saw some interesting conversations--and picked it up on a whim. Thank goodness I read it before I read it to my kids! Noah is depicted as a doddering, deluded drunkard and God as a figment of his imagination, or worse, a subversive vagrant in Noah's orchard. The characters spend all of their time either having contrived conversations about women's lib and ecological and racial issues, or complaining and abusing each other. They also decide that the idea of a Creator is nonsense, and that pure evolution makes much more sense. I was expecting a re-telling of a favorite Old Testament story from Noah's perspective (like L'Engle's \\"Many Waters\\"), and instead received a load of self-aggrandizing nonsense. At the end, Noah appears to have actually imagined all of it, and is insane. If you have any intention of raising Christian children, avoid this book. Definitely not for the young and impressionable. Amazon does not allow a \\"no-star\\" rating, but that is what it deserves!"},{"Title":"Visual Basic .NET Code Security Handbook","review":"So you're wading into the .net world and there's talk of code access security? Where do you start?With an entire chapter devoted to 'How to write insecure code' followed by a chapter devoted to 'How to write secure code', Lippert's book shows us the common mistakes (even if we have the right intentions) that can leave our .Net code vunerable to attack and he shows ways to secure it.Even more is offered up for digestion in the chapter called 'Spot the Security Bug' - or perhaps it could be entitled 'have you understood all that you've read so far?'This book definitely opened my eyes to security risks that I've never even contemplated... And if you want to star in the next movie on cryptography, that's dealt with as well - though I didn't read that chapter myself.So is this book worth it? Will it help you to start using the code security features of .Net?Yes. It definitely gets you started and you'll be able to do some basic but very powerful security quickly with a bit of practice. And thanks to all the tips on bad techniques, you'll avoid making mistakes that could leave your apps exposed.Does it leave you wanting more? Yes. But in all fairness it is a 'Handbook'. I would also say that experienced developers would get more from this book than rookies like myself. I expect as my experience developes, I'll be going back to this book more and more. What would I add? .Net comes with a variety of utilities. Some of these are briefly covered. There are tools to secure and view assembly permissions - I'd got more if this book combined the code security aspect with the use of these utilities and walked me through some real world examples - CASPOOL.exe and PERMVIEW.exe are not covered in any great detail - but would augment the subject matter nicely if they were. For those new to the .Net world (aren't we all? but I mean really new), I think atleast one chapter that details a simple app would be nice - it could cover everything from1) XP/NT security settings and perhaps show how to do a few basic things here2) The stuff that this book already does well - code security3) Using various utilities that come with visual studio .net to view permissions, set permissions on assemblies4) and for good measure, give us some tips on how to test some of this security - how do you test something you're preventing from happening so you know it works? (some details are offered in the book on this and I found them useful)But again, in fairness to the author, that's more a 500 pager type of book and this is a handbook. If Code Security is mysterious to you or you know just enough to want more details, this book is a great start."},{"Title":"Visual Basic .NET Code Security Handbook","review":"I found this to be one of the better Wrox books I have read in quite some time. Many of the topics discussed in this book should be common knowledge in the .NET world, but I can guarantee they are not. In fact, I cently was involved in a panel discussion at a popular developer conference, and then the panelists asked the audience who used code access security, not a single hand was raised.This book covers many .Net security topics very well. It is intended as a handbook, and its size keeps the focus somewhat narrow. For this reason, every serious developer should have more security literature than just this book. On the other hand, if every developer just set aside the few hours it takes to read this book, then we would have much more secure software.Bottom line: Great book that does exactly what it set out to do. However, reading additional security books such as Writing Solid Code as well as other .NET specific security books is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Visual Basic .NET Code Security Handbook","review":"Like many books I found the advice to be at times obvious.

This is not a run-of-the-mill story of adulterous passion, but an honest exploration of human cowardice, courage, and longing.Like butterflies struggling to escape the chrysalis, the lovers Celia and Ben seek to shed the confinement of their respective pasts and create a future together. For Celia, this is her all-too-proper middle-class religious background. For Ben, it is that dark moment when, fearful that he would never again get the chance to make a great film, he testified against his comrades before the McCarthy committee.The novel charts their personal growth in lively dialogue. Sundry interesting characters wander in and out of the story, which is set in interesting locales such as the South Seas."},{"Title":"The Filmmaker : A Novel","review":"As in her previous two novels The Ombu Tree and The Bearded Lion Who Roars, Elise Dallemagne-Cookson in The Filmmaker weaves a tapestry of a particular time and place with an authority that can only come from first-hand experience.

Set in the 1950's, it goes behind the scrim of Hollywood glamour to dramatize the kind of personal tragedies suffered by some of the film world's most famous writers, stars, and directors as the result of the notorious Senator Joe McCarthy's witch hunts.The Filmmaker tells the story of an Academy-Award winning writer/director/producer Ben Rogers' desperated attempt to rebuild his career and slef esteem destroyed by his testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee, and Celia Smith, the politically naive young woman who loves him and almost loses her sanity in her attempt to help him. She has no idea the depth of the emotional wars -- &quot;black-listing,&quot; &quot;naming names,&quot; &quot;no work&quot; at odds with Ben's psyche.With Celia's help, Ben slowly and tentatively regains his confidence and his position in the creative community. Eventually their work relationship develops into a love affair that becomes an obsession bordering on maddness for both of them. Ben wants all of Celia but is torn apart by the guilt he feels about his wife and his love for his children. He is incapable of making a lasting commitment to Celia, but is insanely jealous at the the thought of her being with someone else or of her leaving him.In an effort to maintain her own sanity, Celia flees to Tahiti. Unable to live or work without her, Ben follows her to the South Seas. A stormy confrontation ensues, as powerful as any film ending Ben has ever made, and a stunning eding to a compelling book."},{"Title":"The Filmmaker : A Novel","review":"Dallemagne-Cookson's The Filmmaker is a lyrical read--especially when the author takes us to the South Seas. The story is compelling and true to life in the emotions and situations which grip its central character throughout. Impossible to put down, I found the writing often transporting. Dallemagne-Cookson can weave her words to create vivid pictures and emotions in the reader. Any one who loves the world of film, or is interested in the history of the &quot;black list&quot; and its effects on people's lives will love this book. So will those who have experienced great passion--or wish they had.

She doesn't just write books, she writes movies! &quot;The Filmmaker&quot; will keep you thinking about the way lives can be destroyed by rumor and subpoena, who are these people really, and who should play them in the movie!I recommend this novel highly, and look forward to her next one."},{"Title":"Early childhood development: A multicultural perspective","review":"I bought this book for my child development class. Although I found the physical and motor development of children to be very interesting, I was very bothered by the authors frequent references to stereotypes. He often \\"sugar coats\\" his statements that whites are perfect, blacks are aggressive, and Asians are timid. Page 191 states, \\"Children of Japanese and Chinese familes are often taught--through direct guidance or example--to avoid outward expressions of anger. African and African American children, in contrast are encouraged to express feelings openly. Euro-American [White] children display a moderate amount of emotional expression.\\" This is clearly his opinion and he is entitled to it, but it is very unprofessional to put this in a text where multiculturalism is concerned. Another stereotype that he refers to is that women mainly suffer \\"anxiety and depression,\\" while the father has concerns of bonding with a child with down syndrome.

After reading this book, even hardline Castro/Mafia theorists will ponder over their conclusions"},{"Title":"Coup d'Etat in America: The CIA and the Assassination of John F. Kennedy","review":"This rather incredible book written in 1975 in the aftermath of the Watergate Affair deserves a revisiting in light of E. Howard Hunt's beside confession to his son St. John (published in Rolling Stone and purchasable online as a DVD). The book is very well documented and its narrative covers the waterfront. It concludes that the \\"CIA did it.\\" And uses as its centerpiece a collection of pictures of three tramps caught and arrested while trying to make a getaway via a train parked in the rail yard adjacent to the now infamous Grassy Knoll in Dealey's Plaza. They eventually were released without being booked or even having their names recorded. The authors contend that these curiously cleanly shaven tramps were not only NOT tramps, but were CIA agents Hunt, Sturgis and Christ, participating in a CIA planned and executed assassination of JFK. They muster here an almost encyclopedic amount of data that supports their contention. One of their most important sources is the millions of pages of JFK files in the U.S. Archives.In his confession, Hunt, after having lied about it and denied it repeatedly under oath in two trials involving law suits and when subpoenaed before the the House Committee on Assassinations, finally admits in his bedside confession that the CIA had planned and carried out the assassination but at the behest of LBJ. He cites himself as having been a \\"bit player\\" in the plan, but does not say exactly what that bit part was? According to his confession, the key CIA operatives involved, in addition to himself, were Bill Harvey, Cord Meyer, Frank Sturgis, and David Atlee Phillips. With the exception of Meyers, these are all names that we have seen associated with the assassination over and over in the last forty years.According to Hunt's version the planning and sequence of events were as follows: LBJ, apparently went to Cord Meyers because he was aware that JFK was screwing Cord's wife (Mary Meyers). For that reason, he asked Cord to head up the assassination team. Meyer then recruited among others, Harvey, Sturgis and Phillips, plus a team of Corsican hit men to do the actual shooting.However, a careful reading of this book, contests Hunt's theory, by placing the assassination at the feet of the Nixon gang. Thus the book's theory,would seem to flatly discredit Hunt's confession as an \\"after-the-fact construction,\\" perhaps as disingenuous as Hunt's other stories, because this book claims that the wheels of the assassination began turning well before LBJ could have had a serious motive. It attributes the key motive to the \\"war on Communism\\" in which JFK appeared to the CIA planners to be little more than a \\"fellow traveler.\\" To them, JFK made all of the wrong moves towards Castro once it was discovered that Castro was taking his orders from Moscow. This coupled with his withdrawing air cover at the last minute from the \\"Bay of Pigs invaders\\" virtually sealed his own fate and made the assassination inevitable.The JFK assassination conspiracy saga continues, but this book makes an important contribution to bringing many of the facts into clearer focus.Five Stars"},{"Title":"Coup d'Etat in America: The CIA and the Assassination of John F. Kennedy","review":"Many books on the subject of Kennedy's assassination overlook the fact that our sense of democracy was compromised in November 1963. The title might be deceiving as the book does not expound on the bigger concept of Coup D'etat. Rather it tries to illustrate some evidence that one would draw from to reach the conclusion that our government was overthrown in 1963. Kennedy's death might be the greatest murder mystery of all time, but books on this topic don't end in the way of closure. No one ever gets their man and the butler never did it.Where most other books on the subject of JFK's assassination are about a general overview or the never ending argument of the \\"Magic Bullet\\", Coup D'etat In American draws a link between those that were involved with JFK's murder and the events that toppled Nixon. The book has very little to contribute on the subject of Nixon. However, I think the reader can draw the conclusion that some of the same forces the did Kennedy in also brought about the downfall of Nixon. The era of the \\"Spooks\\" in the 1970s is an important element in understanding Kennedy's assassination. This book compliments the works Jim Hougan and Fletcher Prouty. This era of history has a dark story to tell about the blurring lines between those in the intelligence community and the common everyday crook.In the initial phase of this book we are introduced and review the story of Oswald being an agent of the CIA and his time in Russia, Texas, New Orleans, and Texas again. This along with Oswald's connections to the Alpha 66 and Operation 40 crowd might seem like old news now days. At the time of this book's publication in 1975 there was not much available in documented form on this specific topic. This book predates Garrison's books by 13 years and it would be another 2 to 3 years before the House Select Committee on Assassinations would convene.But the big story in this book is all about the \\"Three Tramps\\" that were photographed and filmed in Dealey Plaza shortly after the assassination. Our authors have a strong belief that two of the tramps are none other than E Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis of recent Watergate history and have some evidence to support their assertions. I believe this to be one first and perhaps one of the only books on the subject of the Tramps in Dealey Plaza. What is interesting about this book, although the authors may be off the mark on some points, they caught the train with Howard Hunt being an accomplice to Kennedy's murder. In years to come Mark Lane would defend Liberty Lobby against Howard Hunt's liable suit in difference to the magazine's claim that Hunt was in Dealey Plaza at the time of JFK's murder. Lane proved to a jury that Hunt was there. In more recent history Hunt made a deathbed confession that he was involved in Kennedy's assassination.For its time Coup D'etat in America is a great book that touches on a link between two major events in history that leaves the reading contemplating the idea that Kennedy's Assassination and Watergate are only two historical events connected in a much bigger story. The books also leaves us with the question of who is in control here? If a couple of CIA Spooks can bring down the Office of the President of the United States either by murder or character assassination, what has happened to our democracy?The book is a worth while read."},{"Title":"Coup d'Etat in America: The CIA and the Assassination of John F. Kennedy","review":"This book is based on photos of the 3 tramps arrested on Nov. 22 1963 who supposedly look like someone. To my eyes, the tall tramp doesn't look at all like Frank Sturgis. The old tramp doesn't look at all like E. Howard Hunt. I saw it as soon as I opened the book. The tramps may have been involved in the conspiracy, but if they are not who the authors think they are, there's not much interest in this part of their theory. It's very obviously a case of mistaken identity. By the way, the authors also allege that the third tramp looks like Oswald and he may have been a double. This tramp doesn't look like Oswald at all, either. They should have their eyes examined!"},{"Title":"Coup d'Etat in America: The CIA and the Assassination of John F.

That a man enjoined, as one of the authors was, from digging in Bob Dylan's garbage be considered a serious researcher, much less a target of guffaws, is beyond the limits of my ratiocination. The thesis here is simple: America is evil, led by such right-wing extremists as lead the Brookings Institution (a big surprise to not only them, but also conservatives), and Mr. Kennedy was removed to remove from a path the sane know he himself supported.

The angel moves to Paris, meets a woman, has his wings fall off &amp; takes up the harp to make a living, since he can't handle harmony. Then he meets the Devil. This is a very funny book, by the world's greatest ironist. A wonderful read for those who smile at people who pray on TV while squinting. Elegant prose even in English, better in French; a quintessential skeptic at his best."},{"Title":"Revolt of the Angels","review":"Yes, Anatole France was a Nobel Prize laureate; No, that is part reason enough to read him (Who can name six laureates). If you need to be convinced, try The Revolt of the Angels.An angel, Arcade, leaves heaven, comes to earth, uses his invisibility to steal books from a library, after which he joins a host of fallen brethren with plans to overthrow god. Fantastic? Think again. In the hands of France, the plot is a mere jot; he is more interested in expressing his contrarian view of the universe.His knowledge of history and religious texts is amply demonstrated; however the main draw is his cynical philosophy and his virtuosity in descriptions. When one of the angels delivers a tirade, the lifespan of the universe is captured in paragraphs: Original sin is a fable concocted by god, the Reformation was started Luther \\"all swollen with beer and theology,\\" and god's thunderbolt was stolen by Franklin. According to France, god foresees everything, yet is surprised by the most probable event. France is not interested in orthodoxy, this is not religious satire to make you laugh; this is one that causes you to painfully shake your head and smile.The conclusion is obvious, but it brings us back to reality - nothing will change. By the end of this impressive work of literature we discover only one angel is in revolt and it is not Arcade. It is Anatole France."},{"Title":"Revolt of the Angels","review":"There's a lot to work with in this idea. Angels exist on earth, lots of them, including many assigned duties as guardian angels. God's in his heaven, and all's right with the world.But, at the hands of master satirist France, all is not right with the world. The god in this story is a petty, tinhorn tyrant. He has arrogated himself power of life and death over this world's little beings, but with no true understanding of the clockwork perfection of even his assigned corner of this universe. Many of those angels on earth have defected, and are plotting an insurrection against that god's dictatorial rule. They secure funding, they stockpile bombs of horrific power, and they brace themselves for the struggle ahead.I'm no scholar of the French revolution, but one point of similarity leaps out: the rebels' near-total lack of plan for what happens after the current in-crowd is outed. And, once the angels take on some features of earthly flesh, they fall victim to many of the ills that human flesh is heir to. Those include love of money, love of women, and love of the anarchic plotting in itself.There's a lot to like in this novel by Nobel winner France, but also a few things that didn't work for me. France move his plot forward using an alternation of many viewpoints - a technique that works poorly for maintaining cohesion in a story. This translation, from 1914, is generally readable and enjoyable, but a few of its phrases seemed stilted by today's standards. And, although I enjoyed the narrative, I was not always sure how the family story of the d'Esparvieus matched the larger story around it. France makes up for any failings, of course, in his repartee, including some well-place barbs at America and Americans.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Revolt of the Angels","review":"Excellent, starts a bit slow but proves itself to be a tour de force of comic invention, emotional intensity and general creativity. The story appears for the first forty pages to be a setup for a rather dull society world with one Maurice the owner of a vast collection of books and discovering one of them to have gone missing. After a bit of by the numbers effort to see who might have taken it, Maurice is met by the being responsible. It's his guardian angel, and as the result of reading the rationalist literary text the angel has decided that religion and the bonds of heaven are tyranny, and sets about to spread emancipatory consciousness among the order of angels. The title of the book wasn't symbolic, it features the direct plot of the book, with lots of unexpected turns, good insights and general hilarity. The strength of the discordant relationship between Maurice and his ex-guardian angel could carry the book in themselves--there's lots of hilarious and surreal scenes like where Maurice tries (unsuccessfully) to preach the virtues of religion, or when he challenges the angel into a duel over an issue of personal honor. Ultimately the book's scale is a lot wider than just that aspect, and it benefits from it.Much of the book is a direct satire. It's from the early twentieth century and bits of this humor haven't aged well, but a lot of it has. For instance there's the effort by one angel to talk another into rebellion against the celestrial arrangement and the current social arrangement in France. The second angel protests, on the grounds that France needs no change and was already completely perfect. It then goes on a speech on how the main credit bank of Frane was particularly refined \\"as pure and chaste and the Holy Virgin.\\"The novel also has, late on, one of the most affecting inversions of Christian myth that I've seen. The text had previously established a gnostic worldview where the entity ruling by the name of God was a lying oppressor of less than ultimate power. It had also shown Satan and his followers to be free thinkers, who tried to defeat God from humanitarian altruist notions. Across the novel the new outbreak lead by Maurice's ex-guardian angel linked up with the old resistance and formede plans for a new front, gathering strength to a march against the status quo. In the last chapter Satan has a dream, whereby his invasion is successful, the God-being is cast down and he takes on the celestial throne. The scenario plays out longer, with Satan becoming more cold, distant and egotistical, remote from and callous towards the human suffering that motivated his earlier fighting. He starts to shroud himself in mystery and hierarchy and govern as a tyrant. Simultaneously, cast down from the seat of power and command, God begins to observe the suffering of the small people and has a turn towards compassion and activity. Satan awakes from the dream, sees that a successful invasion of Heaen would just switch roles, and calls off the attack, resolving to maintain his spirit of compassion and work to help in smaller ways. There's a basic attitude of decency built into this story that's rather affecting, combined with the very strong and narratively surprising ending tone of anti-militarism. Such moments, of which the above is only the culmination, establish a writer of great sensitivity and complexity as well as humor.The novel is enormously rewarding and entertaining. Proof that at least sometimes the Nobel Award for Literature wen into deserving hands. I'm definitely going to look up more of Anatole France's writings.Similar to and better than: Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry PratchettSimilar to and also better than: The Hunchback of Notre Dama by Victor Hugo"},{"Title":"Revolt of the Angels","review":"\\"The Revolt of the Angels\\" is a wonderful tale spun around the dichotomy of existence.

Truly a different way to look at the conflicts of faith and what is deemed good and evil. Written in an intellectual fashion, containing a through understanding of biblical proceedings, \\"The Revolt of the Angels\\" succeeds in summoning up thought processes, even amongst the most pious of Christians.

If the transcribed interviews are reliably authentic, here is a mind quite literally capable of extemporizing sophisticated philosophical discourse. No wonder Camille Paglia attempted to make a cottage industry of ridiculing, belittling, and otherwise attacking this author, who not only anticipated many of Paglia's themes by decades, but who has also shown herself capable of stating in a few laconic phrases what takes Paglia (for all her verbal music) hypomanically-digressive chapters. This is a refreshingly intimate encounter with what &quot;Hurricane Camille&quot; herself has dubbed &quot;one of the great minds of the Twentieth Century&quot;, in addition to being far more engaging reading than I had anticipated. Read Paglia's more serious endeavors to exercize your right brain; but read Sontag (this compilation included) to exercise your left.

I was pleasantly surprised with this book. Many books just spend a lot of time repeating random words or tediously try to explain the very complicated Russian grammar BEFORE you even get to start speaking the language. What I liked about this book is that it teaches you these things but through a realistic, written dialogue. They use many cognants (words that sound the same in both langauges) to start you off and have a handy vocab key next to the dialogue in case you cannot figure something out.

It is written for an English (UK) reader. In other words, the English translations are more British than American. It's not a terrible problem, but translations for an American (like myself) do sometimes sound odd. There are many examples. The other is that it is Moscow-centric. I know many people will probably be going to Moscow or through Moscow on trips, and Moscow is a major tourist destination, but my personal urge is to go to St Petersburg, a place I have learned about immensely. I wish the English-to-Russian dictionary was larger.

A shrewdly flirtatious vixen worthy of Jane Austen, she has agreed, after much cajoling, to travel to Bracebridge to receive and recuperate from a state-of-the-art smallpox inoculation. Her letters home to her Boston friends about the privations of such a dreary backwater sparkle with hilarious and revealing observations.Not so humorous are the suicide and murder that arise from the confluence of these and other characters, including a down-at-the-heels doctor, a young woman from Concord affianced to a local lad, and a flamboyant adventurer with a secretive past. The stalwart English Captain Edmund Montague makes a return appearance, as do the Reverend Christian Rowe and a number of other colorful villagers. As if getting to know these characters were not pleasure enough, Ms. Miles provides a sterlingly-plotted mystery and rich historical context on the state of medicine, marriage, and the mores of 18th-century New England. This delightful combination of entertainment and erudition is sure to put Bracebridge on every mystery-lover's map.Karen Lyon"},{"Title":"Too Soon for Flowers","review":"In 1764, a smallpox epidemic spreads throughout the Massachusetts Bay Colony, especially in Boston. In the village of Bracebridge, Richard Longfellow arranges for two females (his sisters Diana and Phoebe Morris) and a male (Lem Wainwright) to be inoculated by Dr. Benjamin Tucker. When he was in Europe, Richard was inoculated for the disease.Like many Bostonians of wealth, David Pelham flees the city for a nearby village. In his case, he comes to Bracebridge where he obviously knows Benjamin and the two female patients. While the trio recovers from a milder form of the illness, someone murders Phoebe. Richard's neighbor Charlotte begins to investigate the killing. She quickly links Phoebe to David, but has no concrete evidence that he killed the victim. However, her suspicions of David rise further when Benjamin commits suicide. Still, proof is needed and David appears too clever to leave any shred of it around for Charlotte and Richard to find.TOO SOON FOR FLOWERS, the second novel in the Bracebridge historical mystery series, is a superb Colonial who-done-it. The wealth of detail that makes the decade before the revolution seem so vivid to the reader. Like the previous novel, A WICKED WAY TO BURN, the murder mystery is entertaining, but the illumination on 1760's America makes the novel shine. The lead characters are fun to peruse as their relationship slowly forms. Sub-genre fans will go the extra mile to read the two novels of this series as Margaret Miles will become a household name.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Too Soon for Flowers","review":"Ms. Miles' second Bracebridge Mystery is that rarest of items, a follow up that meets or exceeds the quality of the original novel. As before, her research is impeccable, and the depiction of Colonial Massachusetts rings absolutely true. I was fascinated by the descriptions of early practices of inoculation that are central to this story. Additionally, I believe Ms. Miles' prose to be among the best in the genre. It flows with an elegance and balance that is joy to read - and which contributes significantly to the experience of the language and conversation of the period. As before, the characters are well drawn and engaging. This author deserves to be far more widely read. Pick up this series, you will be glad that you did."},{"Title":"Too Soon for Flowers","review":"I had never heard of this author but was intrigued by the cover art and the book's synopsis.

It had some good moments. I like the characters and I like the way Ms. Miles dips into her period. The setting is New England (Bracebridge) in the spring of 1764. In the book we see the earlier attempts at innoculating against small pox. We also see murder and mayhem in this little New England town.Charlotte Willett knows in her heart that when one of the young girls in quarantine for a small pox vaccination dies, it's murder, but she appears to be the only one that thinks so. She must investigate further and discovers an old love story that is at the root of the problem. I found the plot predictable, and there wasn't that much suspense to my mind. In truth, I had trouble getting through the book. I will read the rest of the series because I like Ms. Miles writing and especially her character portrayals."},{"Title":"When I First Came to This Land","review":"When I First Came to this Land was inspired by an old PA Dutch folksong, but was actually written with a new melody and English text in the 1940s by Oscar Brand. Pete Seeger then made it popular, and it does have that folk appeal for which he is well-known.Ms. Ziefert changed some of the lyrics--some to be nicer for kids, which is why it is \\"retold by. . .\\" (Brand's song lists the horse verse as \\"and I called my horse-dead, of course.\\") All in all a cheerful book with fun illustrations!"},{"Title":"When I First Came to This Land","review":"I don't know how this could be considered &quot;re-told&quot; as it says on the cover. These words are not new. They are the lyrics to an old folk song. The illustrations, however, are original, and they illustrate the song in a folk art style that synchronises nicely with the story that the lyrics tell."},{"Title":"THE GREEK GODS","review":"Homeschooling is a tough job. This year my daughter is doing Greece. We started on mythology and dumped a lot of books. Then we discovered this one. What a little treasure this turned out to be!! Each god is described clearly ,in an entertaining fashion. Every story was read and remembered with ease by her not yet 10 year old mind. Frankly, it should be in the library of every household....It can be read by all ages because it is entertaining and painless...."},{"Title":"THE GREEK GODS","review":"While the Greek gods were powerful, they possessed all of the human frailties, albeit in magnified form. They were jealous, fickle, sometimes easily angered, occasionally kind, but always aware of their might and quick to use it. Their characteristics were an attempt by simple people who experienced the difficulties of life as they struggled with nature to make a connection between humans and nature. While we may look on their beliefs as superstitions, it is easy to see the similarities between what the Greeks thought their gods were and the descriptions of god in the old testament Christian bible.This book contains some of the best and classic legends regarding the behavior of the Greek gods. Written at the level of the middle school or early high school student, it is an introduction to the mythology that was the generator of so much of what became the thought stream of western civilization. I strongly recommend this as required reading; I consider knowledge of Greek mythology to be an indicator of being well educated."},{"Title":"THE GREEK GODS","review":"I liked it,I found the way the storys were laid out to be appealing."},{"Title":"THE GREEK GODS","review":"This little book has had a profound influence on me.

The book provides some stories of the gods of Olympia and other important mythical characters in a storytelling-like manner (if one reads the stories out loud, one shall find out what I mean). Once again, the book is only the tip of the iceberg because some of the tales about the gods are meager. Nevertheless, The Greek Gods is an entertaining, short read!"},{"Title":"THE GREEK GODS","review":"I used this book for 20 years with seventh-grade students.

If you read it carefully enough, it is possible to see hints of their fickle and violent nature in the Christian Old Testament. The Greek gods were very assertive in their interventions in human affairs, demanding worship and directly punishing the humans who displeased them.Since Greek mythology is so fundamental to western culture, learning about it must be a fundamental component of every person's education. This book is a good primer of Greek mythology written for the middle school student. The first section is a series of brief explanations of the main gods starting with Zeus and going through Aphrodite. The second and final section covers more secondary personalities such as Prometheus, Pandora and Eros. It is one of those books whose content should be read by all students."},{"Title":"THE GREEK GODS","review":"This book retells many of the Greek myths in simple terms that are appropriate for children. During the narrative, the authors note when there are significant alternate versions of a story, and also point out some of the connections between the stories and modern culture. For example, the idea of a rosy baby confronting an old man with a scythe on New Years day is descended from the image of Zeus confronting Cronos, his father. The book doesn't dwell on the gory details, but neither does it avoid the violence, murder, and rape that permeates these ancient myths.This book basically seeks to spark interest in the Greek myths among children, and when I was a child, it succeeded in spades. An undergraduate english professor once told me that the Bible and the Greek Myths are the two most important source documents for all the important works of English literature. This book will start a young person on a path to understanding one of these two sets of myths."},{"Title":"THE GREEK GODS","review":"The culture of Western Europe and the United States is replete with references to the stories of their gods told by the ancient Greeks.

Be on the lookout for &quot;Count Dracula&quot; by Woody Allen; whether you love him or hate him, this short story is a hoot!This one lets you sink your teeth into some quick, sometimes chilling, sometimes humorous, sometimes just plain weird vampire stories. It will also introduce you to some incredible authors, and I bet you'll race to buy more of their works. Wolf breaks down this collection into categories: The Classic Adventure Tale; The Psychological Vampire; The Science Fiction Vampire; The Non-Human Vampire; The Comic Vampire; and The Heroic Vampire. Horror and vampire fans will recognize some of these stories (King's is an excerpt of SALEM'S LOT) from other novels or collections. But this one is a tasty treat (yes, all puns intended) that I found delightful!"},{"Title":"Blood Thirst: 100 Years of Vampire Fiction","review":"I have a problem. I love vampire short stories. I'm not gothic or even (overtly) weird, but I am well on my way to having read every scrap of vamp short fiction ever written. So profit from my mis-spent youth, and buy this collection because it is by far the best of the best of what this genre has to offer.There literally is something here to suit every taste. Other reviewers have been kind enough to list individual stories and how the various pieces are organized, so I will not repeat their work. Suffice it to say, even authors you think you know will surprise you.I read Salem's Lot (the novel) and was not the least bit scared or even impressed, yet Stephen King's short story based on the same novel gave me chills and had me sleeping with the covers over my head. Tanith Lee delivers my favorite story in the anthology with a poignancy and beauty uncommon to the genre, and Anne Rice writes a superb gothic romance with more quality than even her earlier works.More than the novel, the short story allows the reader of vampire fiction an undiluted taste of each author's true talent that leaves you more scared, more satiated, infected and thirsty for more."},{"Title":"Blood Thirst: 100 Years of Vampire Fiction","review":"Thirty tales of vampire fiction, from the classical blood sucker to science fiction monster to the comic relief. From such great authors as Anne Rice and Stephen King, to interesting choices such as Woody Allen and Hanns Heinz Ewers, and authors I love such as Tanith Lee and Richard Matheson (who are also great), we get a ton of vampire literature. If there is a style of vampire story you like this is the book to get and the best part is if you discover a new author who pushes your buttons you can go find their works. And if they don't push your button you have 29 other stories to make you happy.Read! Feast!

When I took out a tour titled \\"A Week in Chicago\\" I needed a reference that would give me an insight to the city that guidebooks truly don't have.This was the book that I luckily bought!Here's 150 one or two page articles of the most defining moments in Chicago's history. I shared the stories about Chicago Deep Dish Pizza, the Black Sox Scandal, Reversing the River, John Dillinger's Death, The Bi-level Commuter Train, and of course, the Great Fire.I was able to give fresh accounts of these widely varied events to tourist on their first trip to Chicago. These are the stories that mature people really want to know or remember.

It's a professional tour director's secret resource for Chicago."},{"Title":"Chicago Days : 150 Defining Moments in the Life of a Great City","review":"I had been looking for something with the history of Chicago and some good pictures. Despite the fact that this book doesn't really cover the history of the city, it does cover indeed most, if not all highlights of the city's history since the Chicago Tribune was founded. The texts of the 150 subjects have just the correct size, and most of the pictures are as breathtaking as you would expect from a newspaper as important as the Tribune."},{"Title":"Chicago Days : 150 Defining Moments in the Life of a Great City","review":"With excellent photography and sometimes gritty, big city narrative, Chicago Days is the sum of Chicago's history in an easy to read, fast paces, well written book that you won't put down until you reach the end.Objective and very tongue and cheek at times, the educational and nostalgic value of this work can't be put into words. It will evoke powerful memories and feeling in Chicagoans and teach volumes to those from other cities. It would also make an excellent primer for those re-locating to Chicago from other countries, dispelling the popular myths about the City and its people.Covering people, places, events and accomplishments with impartiality not always found in books about Chicago, this is a must read. It deserves six stars."},{"Title":"Chicago Days : 150 Defining Moments in the Life of a Great City","review":"&quot;Chicago Days&quot; is an excellent chronological summation of some of the important events that have occurred in Chicago over the past 150 years.

Some featured events are historic, some sports-related, some fads or 'firsts' out of Chicago, some frivolous and some heart-warming. You needn't live in Chicago to appreciate the stories, events and historic news items found in this book."},{"Title":"Chicago Days : 150 Defining Moments in the Life of a Great City","review":"Every Chicago will debate the moments: How could they forget that?

Perry is only to happy to agree. Terra is only about 27 light years away - a mere skip when compared to a long hyper jump.It turns out the Topides expected to find the wreck of the Arkonide ship on Ferrol - a few small miscalculations led them to Vega instead of Sol. Perry and his Mutant Corps make sure the Topides are sent on their way. I won't reveal what happens to the Topidian fleet, but I will tell you that we meet the Topides again much later in the series.This book also contains another editorial by Forrest J Ackerman (his wife translated these books), another short review of Science Fiction movies, and another page of letters from fans.I really enjoy these books, and feel sorry every time I write a review that some enterprising publisher doesn't pick them up for reprinting and continuing the series. Highly recommended for Space Opera fans."},{"Title":"Fortress of the Six Moons","review":"Rhodan's space planes are still harassing the Topides, until a lucky shot holes one.

The destructive power of the new Stardust shocks the Topides, and co-ordinates have been planted to get rid of them.The Arkonides shock Rhodan, when Khrest reveals the destination he sent the Topides too wasn't an empty solar system, but inside a sun.

Charles Shedd, Karen's father is a pastor, counselor and has a vast knowledge of failed and successful relationships. He covers everything from sex, to communication, to cooking, all so very objectively and with God as the sole motivation behind his theories.

Shed provided a lot of good, applicable advice for relationships. It was also very sweet to see how much the author cared for his daughter by teaching her about many aspects of marriage that everyday relationships cannot prepare you for. I thought the chapter, &quot;I'm Sorry, Honey&quot; is an especially good chapter. It is filled with many truths that some people would rather over look. One of those points was the fact that some people find it hard to express regret. If people were more open about the way they truly feel, they would probably be surprised to find that others are fairly understanding. My favorite quote from this book is in this chapter. It says, &quot;'Bigness may never begin unlessn it begins with me'&quot; (p.69). The one subject I did not agree with Shedd on is the role of a submissive woman in marriage. There should be a degree of submissive behavior. However, it seemed to me that the author thought the wife should baby her husband every time he broke a nail or swoon each time his ego needs some support. Spouses should make each other feel loved and cherished, but that just seems a little to fake for me. Another point I strongly agreed with Shedd on is the importance of prayer in marriage. God is the strongest foundation there can be for marriage. If there is no relationship with God, how can He help you? I thought it is really interesting how Shedd said he has never had a married individual or couple come to him for help if they have prayed together. If you have the strength of God's love you can overcome anything. Overall I think this is a great book for anyone who is open to some godly advice for a strong, loving marriage."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"Letters to Karen is a caturing book that holds wonderful lessons for women to learn.

I choose &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; because it looked like an easy book to read. It interested me that it was a collection of letters about a married life that a father wrote to his daughter. I was told that it might be too old and boring, but actually I found it very absorbing as I read it. The Dad in the letters talks to his daughter very respectably with deep thoughts. He talks about many different struggles incidental to a married couple and gives good examples based on his experiences. Each of chapters taught me some new lessons that I would have never even thought about if somebody did not tell me. Of course, I am not going to be married to someone right now, but those little tips were good to know because I probably will be married someday. I wish I could get some advice like them from my own Dad, but I am from a broken home, and I know that I probably will not. At least now I know where to find some guidance for marriage if I needed some. I think, if there is someone like me, it would be nice for them to read this book. I also want to encourage others who are not from a home like mine just because it might be helpful for them too!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"In the book, &quot;Letters to Karen,&quot; the author Charlie W. Shedd gave some basic guidelines for a sucessful marriage. The points in which he made were very good and did not appear to be unreasonable. There are many books which appear to be strick and unrealistic, their ideas for a sucessful mariage seem to be impossible to acheive, but &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; are not. For example, in the chapter &quot;Emphasis on Good Things,&quot; Shedd emhpasises how we should concentrate on the positive &quot;gradually cancling out the bad and raising up the good.&quot; One reason that I like the book &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; so much is because it was written from a christan's point of view. Charlie W. Shed is a pasture who has experience in the areas of marriage for he has helped counsel other married couples and also been himself, this book isn't written from an unexperienced person but a person who has been through many married situations and troubles of his own and of others. In &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; is written by the love of a father to his daughter, this gives it a very heart warming feeling.

It not only tought me how I want my husben to treat me, but how I want to treat my husband. It is a great book to read when your starting to get serious with your boyfriend. I also suggest that guys read Letters to Philip."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"I enjoyed this book. Some of the author's ideas were a little old-fashioned, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I like the idea of the husband being chivalrous. Also, I like how straightforward and honest he is in this book, telling his daughter personal stories of his marriage and giving good advice from his experience. This is a very good book for any girl to read, whether she is getting married soon or not."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"&quot;Letters to Karen&quot; by Charlie W. Shedd, was full of interesting information and real life examples. This book was not hard to read and goes quickly.It is also for all ages. I enjoyed reading this book because of all the words of wisdom Mr. Shedd explained from all of his personal stories. One of the most important point he brought up for Karen was that communication within marriage is extremly crucial. He emphasizes the necessity of good communication between husbands and wives at all times. Within good communication, also includes apologizing to your spouse. Some people find it impossible to express their regrets but it is a requirement for a good marriage. The fact that Karen's father took time to give real encouragement to her about marriage is an example of parental affection and religious faith. While reading the book, I could really tell that he loved Karen with all his heart and would do anything for her. A godly marriage will take time to perfect but it is possible. If one has the strength of God's love, you can overcome anything. Overall, this book will one day help me a better wife to my husband. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It's wonderful book to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"Although this book may appear to be old-fashioned in many readers eyes, I believe it contains vauluable advice that can be applied in all relationships, not just husband and wife. The author was married for 27 years at the time these letters were written, so he knows what he is talking about. The main emphasis of the book is how to maintain peace and comfort within the relationship, even through hard times. The advice given is very practical. For example, one chapter is devoted to &quot;Tell Him He's Wonderful&quot;. It is simple yet so often neglected by married couples because wives assume their husbands can read their minds. Shedd also lays out guidelines for communication, such as don't use the terms &quot;always&quot; or &quot;never&quot; in arguements, make greetings pleasant instead of with the worst news from the day, and give each other space on bad days and try to figure out how to pull your spouse out of the bad mood rather than join him. I also agreed with Shedd in the chapters &quot;We Know in Part&quot; and &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot;. I like how he describes marriage as growing individually in unity, meaning to maintain your own identity and have things you like to do just for yourself, in order to make the time together more precious. The only sections I did not particularly care for was his advice on housekeeping and cooking and other household duties, because I think that those things are trivial and vary with circumsatnces and personalities. I would recommend this book to anyone who is about to be married or would like to in the future, as I believe there is something for everyone in this book. It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"I think this book is excellent, its a real encouagement and good help for a godly marriage. It gives real live examples of married couples and there struggles. I am only 18 years old and have no plans to get married any time soon but I sometimes worry about what problems I am going to face. In reading this book I have been encouraged and assured that in a marriage you can work things out. I also have learned that as a woman of God I need to be a servant to my future husband and love him through every decision he makes no matter if I agree or disagree. I also learned a little bit more from the boys perspective and have become more understanding of them. I really like the fact that this story is about a father writing letters to his daughter. It's good for girls to get godly advice from the men in there lives. Especially there fathers. This book has changed my outlook on marriage. After reading it I am excited for the time in my life when I will experience marriage. That is, if God allows it, which I hope he does. It would be awesome to have the intimate love that comes from a marriage."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"Letters to Karen provided an overall and highly informative guide on marriage. Charles Shedd is writing advice on every page of the book. He uses real life examples of good and wrong actions that happen during marriage. I enjoyed discovering how important the little things are in a marriage. As an example Mr. Shedd mentions how important it is for couples to still carry on with things like opening the car door for the lady and telling each other by words or action how important each person is. The author gives a grand performance as he tackles a wide range of topics some include sex, sexual differences, budgeting your money, good housekeeping and more. One area he talks about is moods, his advice to his daughter is to &quot;try your best not to go down into the swamps of despair when he goes down.&quot; Mr. Shedd uses a fabulous vocabulary throughout this book. There were a few parts I did not understand, but looking at the book as a whole it shall satisfy the seeker. I recommend this book to anyone, preferably a female as this deals with marriage from a womans point of view."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"I read this book in the early 70s as a very young bride.

How awesome is that?!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"I'm a religious pluralist, and even though this book was written by a Christian pastor, I found it (and still find it) extremely helpful in married life. It's inspirational, informative (esp. about men and how their minds work), and full of great advice.I own multiple copies of this book. Why? My father gave me this book when I left home at 18. I will do the same for each of my daughters. It might be the greatest advice my father ever gave me, and I want to pass that on to the next generation.The only people I think it might offend are narrow-minded feminists. People who don't want to recognize that men and women are not just anatomically different, but different in how their minds work, how they process information.

This book discusses important issues such as communication, sex, honesty, fights, apology and even housekeeping. By reading this book, one will learn many new truths about a successful marriage. I am perticularly fond of this book because it stresses the significant rold God plays in relationships. Often times people tend to believe they can find a resolution by their own abilities.

It is a book I will look to and read over and over again. Though I am not at an age to get married, this book helped me to know what I need and want in my future husband. This book will also help me in preparing to be the best wife I can be when I get married. Shedd gives very good advice which I can apply to my life today. I am so excited for the time when I get married because I now know more about marriage and I know that, though marriage is tough, God can make it the best marriage ever. A key ingredient in marriage, as Shedd writes, is putting God first. Another key to &quot;keeping love in marriage&quot; is putting the other person first. It is important to be the best servant I can be when I am married and reading this book has helped me realize this. Letters to Karen is an excellent book and I recommend it to anyone who ever plans on getting married. It is also helpful for boyfriend/girlfriend relationships and every day relationships as well. I am so glad I read this book because it has given me a whole new outlook on life, love and relationships."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"When entering a marriage relationship or a serious one that might evolve to that level I encourage people to read this book. This book provides helpful and useful adive in all areas of marriage to keep the love alive. This is a touching book from a concerned father with words of wisdom to his daughter. Mr. Shedd has done a wonderful job in capturing the essence of the relationship. Before I began reading this book I wondered how could one MAN know so much about marriage? I began reading with an extremely negative attitude but now that I have read it I see that Shedd has a knowledge of marriage that everyone should learn about. The fact that he is not basing this book solely off what he learned in school but rather from actual life accounts from his own marriage makes this book mean even more. This book discusses many important issues like sex, communication, emphasising on good things, differnces couples go through, and finances. The chapter on communication was most helpful and meaningful to me. Communication is an important aspect to making a marriage work. Although I have never been in a relationship that was as serious as a marriage or even close to, I know that communication can either make or break the relationship. Talking problems out and understanding where each other is coming from will do a world of good. One other part of this book that I found extremely interesting was the way Shedd explains the womans and the mans role in a relationship. Shows the woman her duties to her husband but still shows that it goes both ways. This is a great Christian guide for marriage and keeping God at the center. I would reccommend this book to anyone married or not."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"I'm 17 and I wanted to tell others about the book I read, Letter's to Karen. I'm so glad that I decided to buy this book instead of borrowing it. From the moment I opened the book, I was highlighting and writing notes throughout it; things that I especially wanted to remember and use. It has given me a challange, of the kind of wife I want to be for my future husband. As I read, I found myself agreeing with everything Charlie Shedd said. He has so much advice to give and all of it is so true. I did not think any of it was out of date even though it was written over 30 years ago. After watching my parent's marriage, I decided I wasn't going to make the same mistakes. I want God to be the center of my marriage. I know this will be a book I will refere to time and time again. I was telling my boyfriend about it, so he read it also. He was amazed at how right on it was on how guys think. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants a good marriage or wants to make theirs even better."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"The intentions of this book, to counsel and give advice on marriage, are wonderful. Many points are made in which I have agreed with. These points were written for the pastor's daughter of Charlie W. Shedd. There were many different good insights given throughout this entire book. He had many good stories and analogies that I am sure I will mostly likely deal with many conflicts in which this book confronts. And what a sweet idea to do for a daughter before she gets married! In marriage, this book would act as a great counselor. However, IN MARRIAGE. I strongly suggest this for being a book someone would want sitting on his or her bookshelf, especially if that person is married. Otherwise, I did find it somehow difficult reading being under the personal fact that I am not hoping to be married for quite sometime. On the bad side, being in a relationship while reading this book caused me to tend to want to put my boyfriend in the &quot;fianc&eacute;&quot; position, which I was really hoping not to do. So, I would suggest that this be read as a book for a couple who is soon to be married. All in all, it was a good book, but suggested for couples who are engaged (in my opinion)."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Letters to Karen.

It gave a perspective from the males point of view that might not have been known to women going into marriage otherwise. It also put men and women both in their place in a delicate way. This book shows how we are to go at marriage the right and Godly way. One key part of the book I thought was communication. Communication plays the role of 70% of a relationship making it very important to be able to do this in a relationship. This part, as well as the rest of the book, proved to be useful and practical. Another part that really stood out to me was the part that talked about chivalry. How it is still important to open doors and things of that sort after many years of marriage. Also, on the woman's behalf, to do special things for her spouse every once in a while. Letters to Karen also contained tips on how to be a pleasing wife and how we need to be submissive to our husbands. It also talked about numerous things from communication to spousal differences to sex to keeping God the focal point of your relationship. Because this book was written from a father to his daughter he was able to give all this beneficial advice from experience too.

Well if so, this book might just be for you. Some who read &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; say it is a little too old fashioned for them, but call me old fashioned because I happen to like it. In his book, Dr. Charles Shedd explains to his daughter in letters before she is married tips and hints that will ensure her a successful marriage for the future. I don't believe Dr. Shedd's ideas are wrong, it's just that in many ways they have been forgotten. I enjoyed his book because in a world like today that has eliminated all moral standards, I was able to find encouragement and hope that someone still believes in the same beliefs as I do. I am grateful for that, and if you are searching for ways to better equip yourself for marriage, then buy this book right now and read it. It will present you with successful guidelines to help in your future marriage.

Shedd wrote these letters to assist Karen in being the best wife she could be. Overall, the book was very informative and dealt with a variety of subjects from communication to housekeeping. Each letter is a subject in itself. Shedd does not just scratch the surface either, he digs down deep and offers the truth to a loving and successful marriage. The chapter I found to be the most helpful was entitled &quot;Eyeball-to-Eyeball&quot;. In this letter Shedd focuses on what he calls &quot;The seven official rules to a good, clean fight&quot;. The points he makes, such as lower voices instead of raising them and never quarrel in public, make so much sense and can really help when trouble arises. I am currently in a dating relationship and have actually been able to apply many of the concepts from this book. I can see the awesome affect this book could have in a marriage situation. The ideas presented by Shedd are not out of date even though he wrote this in 1965. They are coming from a happily married man who has had much experience in marriage counseling. I would recommend this book to any woman who is in a relationship or will be at some time in her life.

I cannot say how much this book filled my spirit with God's love and direction. I am young, not even close to marriage, but reading this book helped me to understand relationships better so that I will be prepared when I meet that man God has saved for me. My father loves me very much, just as Charlie Shedd loves Karen, so when I read this book I felt as though my father was talking to me. Shedd is a wonderful author and knows very much about relationships and gives so much insight to those in a serious relationship for both man and woman. I especially liked the chapter &quot;Emphasis on the Good Things&quot;. It was so wonderful how the couple he spoke of were so radiantly in love after such a rocky start. Their list of virtues of each other made such a difference in the happiness of their marriage; it was so inspiring. Also, in the Chapter &quot;The 'H' Twins- Humility and Honesty&quot;, I found it very uplifting to read the phrase- &quot;Blessed are the couples who are humble and honest, for they will reach a higher love!&quot; Also in this chapter it speaks of two things that will not reach the household of humble and honest souls- gossip and nagging. I think it is very important in a marriage that these two things are kept out.

Marriage can be a really scary time and I think it's awesome that this father cared enough for his daughter to start her off on the right foot.

I loved the aspect of a father writing to his daughter to give her sound advice for marriage based upon the Word of God. His letters are often comical and other times very serious. Every engaged couple should read these books if they want to learn how to be better spouses for one another. I would definitely recommend this book to any girl or even any guy. Dr. Shedd is a wonderful man with extremely good advice for all those looking into marriage. I learned quite a bit on what it means to be a good wife and mother and just how hard and rewarding of a job it can be. God has definitely used Dr. Shedd to reach others on being a woman of God.

I thought that it was packed full of good advice covering a variety of topics such as sexual relations, communications, and cooking. Every wife needs a few helpful hints. It definitely pushes the point that God needs to be the center of a relationship; then the inevitable trials will only strengthen one's marriage. I have to admit though that I am more traditional than the average. Many of the comments made could possibly be offensive to a feminist now days. The short letters made the book enjoyable and easier to read. Especially if someone was interested in a specific topic. I would recommend Letters to Karen to anyone getting married and plan to reread it later."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"I thought the book was great, five stars.I especially liked the fact that the father took time to give advice to his daughter about marriage. The book is full of parental affection and religious faith. I agree with Karen's father when he said,&quot;we should look inward at the right time and in the right way&quot;. The father brings up many good points about communication in marriage. He emphasizes the necessity of good communication between husbands and wives. A marriage can only become strong when two people learn to communicate about their problems. Another point he brought up is the importance of looking directly into another person's eyes when you speak to them. This can be difficult but it lets the other person know that you are really listening. Karen's father also emphasized the importance of being able to apologize to your spouse. Some people find it impossible to express their regrets but that is a requirement for a good marriage. In the early stages of courtship, people need to first learn to understand each other's prsonalities. They can start to do this by having fun and joking with each other. I thought the most important point of this entire book is the respect that Karen's father had for the sexual relationship between husbands and wives. He stated that SEX IS A SACRAMENT and helps us recall that in his perfectly marvelous way of doing things, the Creator included this wonder of wonders- &quot;male and female created he them.&quot; God deserves our praise for creating good things for us to enjoy, and among the best of his good things is sex. I recommend this book to anyone because it provides good insight into many of the issues of life that we all must face. Good advice is also provided regarding how to work through your problems when you get into trouble."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"I recommend Letters to Karen. It is an insightful book with good ideas for &quot;keeping love in marriage&quot;. The book is not only fact and opinion, but Shedd also includes little anecdotes and personal stories to bring his book to life. Shedd is a pastor and therefore writes from the Christian perspective. One of my favorite suggestions he made was having a prayer time with your spouse. He also suggested that when you have your prayer time, you should share your requests and then pray silently. At first, I did not understand why he felt that you should pray silently but he goes on to explain it, and his reasons sound very reasonable. I did not find Shedd's book to be filled with outlandish or impossible suggestions, but instead with applications that are more practical that one can use daily. This book is not only for the married woman, but also for the unmarried. Although, I am not married and have not been able to apply the suggestions that Shedd makes, I do plan to use his ideas in the future. By reading about trials that arise and ways to overcome those trials, one can see that marriage is not only a fun, lovey-dovey thing, but also something that requires selflessness, prayer, and commitment."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"Letters to Karen was an excellent book. So many times we read books about how our relationships are supposed to be, and what is supposed to happen. Though these books may have very important points and opinions, they lack the personal touch and intimacy that Letters has. It was refreshing to see that even though Karen was all grown up and on her own, she still listen and considered every piece of advice that her dad had to give. There was something in her dad's voice, so caring and sympathetic. It was almost as if her dad was one of her best girl friends. More and more it is difficult for young adults to \\"not be wise in their own eyes.\\" Instead, we choose to seek advice from our friends, never stopping to think that we need to consult our God and our parents first. I found communication to be the central theme of this book. Letters helps set up guidelines when arguing, consoling, or just having a conversation. In addition, I liked how Shedd emphasized that the little things are just as important as the big things. Everyone is so caught up in getting things done, that we hardly ever take the time to make sure that we get it done right! Overall I thought that Letters to Karen was an excellent book to read for those involved in a relationship that could quite possibly take that next step to marriage."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"I thought this was a very insightful, intriguing, and all-out pretty good book. However, I think the author needs to learn something about women and their needs before he goes off on how we should basically worship men. He kept making reference to 'boosting their egos.' What about the women? We need ego-boosting every once in a while, too, you know!Also, he made it seem like women just plain talk too much. I do agree with that --to a certain extent. However, there also needs to be some agreement and LISTENING going on from the male's side of things. Some men are just so insensitive, they don't listen at all!Dr. Shedd did add some interesting stories during many of his letters, and most were helpful in either deciphering what he was meaning to say or just in getting a point across to the reader.Lastly, this book kind of warded me away from marriage . . . even more. It made it all seem so complicated (as I'm sure it probably is), but it scared me into thinking, 'I never want to get married! There's too much stuff to remember!' However, this book may be a bit old-fashioned in parts, but it does give good advice for marriage, and does, in fact, explain how to 'keep love in marriage.' The good part was that Dr. Shedd gave many helpful hints throughout the book. Now, the trick is to remember them all when --and if --I get married!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"Wow! That was an awesome book!! I can hardly put it down after I start reading. There are so many statements in that book. In the book, he hit the most important points in marriage and how to keep it fresh. Even though it is a pretty old book, but a lot of his opinions can still apply in today's world. There are so many married couples in today's society forgot the basic skills to keep a interesting marriage. How to communicate, how to comproimse, how to think about others, and how love. I espically like the chapter &quot;Tell him he is wonderful&quot;. It tells that we should constantly tell our partner how wonderful he is and how much we appricate to have him by our side. We all humans and we like to know how much others feel about having us in their lives. To show apprication not only helps in married relationships but in friendships as well. Personally, I am an international student who studying overboared in the United States. I often receive letters from family and friends. I know I will be really moved if I got the same kind of letters from my family. Just like Houston Post said:&quot; Letters that any father would like to have written and any daughter would wish to have received.&quot;"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"Letters to Karen provided an overall and highly informative guide on marriage. Charles Shedd is writing advice on every page of the book. He uses real life examples of good and wrong actions that happen during marriage. I enjoyed discovering how important the little things are in a marriage. As an example Mr. Shedd mentions how important it is for couples to still carry on with things like opening the car door for the lady and telling each other by words or action how important each person is. The author gives a grand performance as he tackles a wide range of topics some include sex, sexual differences, budgeting your money, good housekeeping and more. One area he talks about is moods, his advice to his daughter is to &quot;try your best not to go down into the swamps of despair when he goes down.&quot; Mr. Shedd uses a fabulous vocabulary throughout this book. There were a few parts I did not understand, but looking at the book as a whole it shall satisfy the seeker. I recommend this book to anyone, preferably a female as this deals with marriage from a womans point of view."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"This book is a great book for someone who truly wants to go at marriage the right way, but for those who aren't to serious about marriage they probably will not heed much of what is said in this book. I like the way Shedd sort of put the women in her place and the man in his place. Not that he said the women should be barefoot and pregnant and the kitchen, and the men should work all day, come home, eat, and go to bed. But how the women should do chores, cook, stroke the man's ego, etc. They are things a women knows she ought to do, but feel in this day and age they need to be more masculine. The &quot;Bridge of Communication&quot; chapter I believe was the best it made me open up more to people close around me. I've always been one to close up and to not let anybody know why I'm feeling the way I do. But when reading this chapter it was like a reality check. Communication plays 70% a role in every relatonship. It is such an important part of marriage. My whole life I've never really wanted to get married because I just figured they would all end up in divorce sooner or later. But after reading this book, it gives me some hope that there is some men out there that do believe like this book, and will stay married to one person HAPPILY there entire life."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"this book gives great advice to those who are engaged or wish to get married. this book is about a loving father that gives useful advice to his daughter who is about to get married. this book taught me about different problems that come up when in a relationship and how to deal with them. i think that karen is very fortunate to have such a loving father that is willing to give advice along with personal situations that he found himself in. karens father has a great relationship with his daughter because he tells her whatever is on his mind. when i become a parent i will do my best to have a good relationship with my children just as karen's father was to her. i would recommend this book because people can learn alot about marraige though the letters of karen's father."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"Letters to Karen was a great book. I really enjoyed it. This book is about A daughter who askes her father for advice on love and marriage because she just got engaged. The father writes a series of letters with advice on relationships. You don't have to be married to read this book. It helps you understand the opposite sex more better. I am happy I read this bookk, it taught me a lot on relationships and how I should handle things. It also made me think about what kind of wife I should be to my husband. I loved the stories Dr. Shedd had to write about they were interesting and funny. This book has a lot of good pionts and examples. This is an excellent book I recommend it to anyone who plans on getting married or is married."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"This book is incredibly insightful, and was well worth my time. In the way it is written (the context of a father to his daughter) helps me to relate closely to his messages. Because I have not quite reached the age where I would be considering marriage, I apply these truths about males (the explanations for their actions, behaviors, and thoughts) to the guys in my life at this time: my brothers, my dad, etc. Because women obviously differ from men in many aspects, namely their thought process and interpretations of life, it is very useful to get a guy's personal perspective, which is a dominant strength of this book. I was impressed by the father's abilities to portray the picture of a righteous, God-honoring marriage in a way that makes it seem feasible for any who work at it. It was encouraging to read examples from his own marriage where he and his wife had overcome major obstacles and had worked through instances in which their personalities clashed drastically, which might have ended up in heartache, had they not sought God's counsel. The marital advice given is priceless, and I will definitely keep this book to look back on and refer to throughout my life."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"Letters to Karen is a compilation of letters that a father wrote to his daughter who was about to be married. Shedd gives advice on how to make a marriage work, along with tips on how to be a pleasing wife. Some of the issues that he discusses are the importance of communication, chivalry, sex, spousal differences, and keeping God at the center of one's marriage. Shedd has counseled many couples in the past and draws his words of wisdom from his own personal experiences and from what he has learned from others. As a husband, he is able to tell his daughter what a man needs and desires from his wife. The book is an especially helpful source to anyone who is getting married or considering marriage in the future. However, I believe that this book will benefit any reader, whether single, engaged, married, etc. I found the chapters on communication to be the most applicable because communication is essential in any relationship. The book addresses many issues and areas of marriage and provides sound advice to the reader that will definitely allow for a happy and successful marriage that will last a lifetime. Some of the topics discussed were difficult for me to relate to, but that is most likely due to the fact that I am no where near ready to start considering marriage. The only negative comment that I have about this book is that it was a little slow-moving at times. Other than that, I found Letters to Karen to be informative and beneficial. I would definitely consider reading this book again when I am thinking about marriage."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"I gave &quot;Letters To Karen&quot; five stars because I found it to be full of interesting information. Even though the book was written in 1965 I did not find it to be as old fashioned as I thought it would be. Shedd gives good ideas on how to keep your marriage going smoothly. For instance: Shedd talked about giving your spouse some space when he or she needs it. I liked the chapter &quot;A Savory Smell From The Kitchen&quot; and how it talked about all the things you could do to make your meals more enjoyable. I thought it was clever how the list went from A-Z in ideas. There was a story that Shedd told in this book that was good if you are having a lot of troubles in your marriage. This couple was having surrmountable problems and were considering divorce when they got an idea. They wrote out all the things they did not like about each other, let the other person read the list, and then they burnt the bad lists. Then they made a list of all the good things they liked about each other, framed the lists, and hung them above their bed. That way they could look at those lists every day and remember the good things they liked about their spouse. I thought that was a wonderful idea. I also admired the way Shedd was able to openly and honestly talk about sex with Karen. I think some dads would have a hard time even thinking that one day their little girl will grow up, get married, and have sex. So, I appreciated his truthfulness. In one chapter it talks about how you should act like you were still courting in marriage. Shedd used the example of husbands opening the car door for their wife. Just little things like that to show you still care. I am very pleased I was able to read this book. I enjoyed it very much, especially because Shedd based a good marriage on having a firm relationship with God. With God anything's possible."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"I found this book's Chinese version in China. It's really amazing how good and practical this book is! I wish that I would have read it 2 years ago, then I could be a better wife. :-) But anyway... thanks to Charlei. It's never too late to read this book and practice it. ^_^"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"Overall, the book was well written, well put together, and the chapters flow well together. The father was very knowledgeable and knew exactly what to say about a topic and when to say it. He had some interesting and funny stories to tell also, which were probably my favorite part of reading the book. He was probably a very good counselor, and after reading this book I probably would want to go to him with my marital problems. While I was reading it, I felt like I was learning a lot about something I have not really ever understood, the world of marriage. Obviously, being 17, I am not married and most likely will not be for a long time. But some people get married right out of college, and I feel it is important to be prepared for whatever comes your way, and this book does a good job of that. The reason only give this book a 3 after saying such good things about it, was that he repeated himself over and over. I also found him droning about something that happened to Karen in the past that seemed to have no relevance to me. Also, the chapters that were on sex were a little risqu&eacute;. Talking about chastity and the importance of sex in marriage and abstinence before marriage is one thing, but describing ways to have sex and talking about not being afraid made me a little uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"Charlie Shedd's book Letter's to Karen is a very well written book. The insight's he gave on keeping a relationship strong were very good. I would highly recommend this book for any woman entering a relationship, especially one that could possibly lead to marriage. Throughout the book Charlie Shedd often refers to his personal experience in his own marriage or things that he has dealt with counseling other couples. The fact that Shedd has had so much experience helps to convince the reader that what he is saying is true. Another thing I like about Letters to Karen is that every time Shedd is bringing up a new point he will give an example of what will not work. And then he will tell a cute little story of what one wife does in her marriage to keep that problem from happening. Throughout the book there are certain points that Shedd continues to repeat, he does this on purpose and even tells the reader he only repeats these things because it is very important. Shedd has been happily married for a very long time. He know the things that can keep a marriage good, even in the rough times. His advice is realistic, any woman willing to try to keep her relationship alive and full of love could do the things that he mentions in this book."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"This is an old classic book of advice for a woman before marriage. It is a little dated but the basic advice is timeless."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On keeping love in marriage","review":"This book was written in the 70s, but is needed even more today.

John was clinically dead as his heart stopped beating and his brain showed no activity. His doctors manage to get the heart pumping, but he lived because of a machine. Pull the plug and he would be dead.Ten days later, a miracle occurs when John awakens in the ICU. After a time his memory of his fatal day and aftermath begins to return in vivid detail. Soon he begins to see the pain of other people whose lives seemed desperate. John has gained a gift from his time on the other side. He might be able to provide solace to some who are suffering, but the dark knows about John and plan to use him to shift the balance between good and evil to those of the malevolent.PARTING THE VEIL is an exciting inspirational suspense laden tale of hope that will remind readers of the King work The Dead Zone (book not TV series or Walken's 80s movie) The story line is fast-paced and at its loftiest when John struggles with helping people cope with their problems not an easy task to achieve. When the tale leaves the psychological spiritual life after death environs into a good vs. evil thriller it increases the excitement and suspense, but loses a piece of what makes Jay Davis' tale a unique homage to humanity's ability to win against overwhelming odds.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Parting the Veil","review":"The beauty of this book is that it can be read on so many levels. Clearly, it can be read in a spiritual vein, though it's a work of fiction. The author has done his homework, and has a strong grasp of the phenomena upon which several of the book's events are based.But this story is also wonderfully suspensful. The last 100 pages real fly past as you race to the conclusion, which surprises even jaded readers. It's obvious that Davis' other books have given him a robust writer's toolkit with which to craft his tales.Most impressive to me personally, was the degree to which I sympathized with even the antagonist characters. This is perhaps my strongest recommendation of the book. Davis doesn't draw caricatures just to facilitate his book's movement and pacing. Instead, the reader is able to witness the development of certain pathologies in his \\"bad guys.\\" Wonderful!Readers of a variety of genres will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Parting the Veil","review":"I don't normally read fiction but the tag line caught my eye...I am a slow reader but I blasted thru this one in just a few days! well written, kept my interest and intertwined all the NDE, spiritual cliches but still very enjoyable. Am looking forward to the next two...if I can only find them!"},{"Title":"Parting the Veil","review":"Strong start but an unrealistic finish that disappointed me.The Near Death Experience (NDE) info was accurate and interesting as put into a novel. However, the second half of the novel, while suspenseful, was deeply unsatisfying to me. The clues on how to \\"get over\\" serious trauma with the help of divine guidance just evaporated. I would have liked more insight at the ending; I would have preferred that to high drama.Parting the Veil lapses into lectures as to what approach one ought to have toward life or life after death. I ended the story with no hope at all for the \\"winners\\" in the story, and do not believe things could have proceeded as we were told they would happen (after the story ended).This author has terrific potential, nevertheless. Some parts of the story were riveting, and very well written. \\"Please make it more believable and rewrite the last chapters\\" would be my advice to the author."},{"Title":"Parting the Veil","review":"I really loved this book. It is well-written and cohesive. I couldn't put it down, even when I was crying (most embarrassingly) by my apartment's pool. And then I read it all over again...which means I read it twice in a period of four days.As I said, I loved this book. It does touch on some heavy themes, but rather than being objectionable, I found that they made the book feel truer-to-life. And the story's spiritual content informs these gritty and horrifying situations, placing them in a completely different light.Ultimately, this book spoke directly to my heart and left me feeling how connected we all are...something that isn't so easy to believe in a huge, isolating metropolis like Los Angeles. It's one of the better gifts I've ever given myself.I would prefer to end my review here, since this is an accurate detailing of how I experienced the book. However, if I had never read this book before, I would be very perplexed by the range of reviews on it. What I think it boils down to is this. Some readers are critiquing the religious or spiritual aspects as they read; whereas, others find these same elements inspiring. In other words, I believe that some of the reviewers are reading more with their heads and others are reading more with their hearts. Neither way is wrong, but you probably know which kind of a reader you are and should choose accordingly when weighing whether or not to purchase this book."},{"Title":"Parting the Veil","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Jay Davis' book on many levels. It was a great read with sympathetic, well-developed characters and a well-paced story. I couldn't put it down.

If this is truly a trilogy, I wish Jay luck and hope the next books come soon."},{"Title":"Parting the Veil","review":"I just finished reading \\"Parting of the Veil\\" but it wasn't a good read. I was very disappointed in it. It wasn't worth the time to read the 400 pages and it was SLOW. Thing is, I didn't agree with a big part of it. A guy murders his daughter, wife and a family friend (who had had the out of body experience). The father then committed suicide and the only survivor was his little son. The angel says that they all completed their mission. God sent them to earth to teach the little boy some valuable lessons he will need later in life. (It took 400 pages to say that too.) Anyway, I DON'T AGREE! That abusive father is responsible for his actions. He could have been a loving father but instead he turned on his family and murdered them. I don't think that murdering the family was his mission at all! I think the book review was very misleading. I wonder if the reviewer that recommended the book even read it."},{"Title":"Us and them: A history of intolerance in America","review":"This terrific book effectively tells the story of oppression inthe United States and subtly connects the interrelatedness ofoppressions by putting the chapters side by side. The information and sidebars are magnificent in their detail and it is nice to have many sides of history that are so rarely shown. I learned more about history from this book than any history textbook I can remember. The stories of racial, religious, ethnic, and gay oppressions become human stories in this book--hopefully stories that we can learn from and choose not to repeat."},{"Title":"Us and them: A history of intolerance in America","review":"&amp;#65279;In an age of sanitized history and calls for revisionism that make people feel comfortable, there is a great need for more books like Jim Carnes' history of intolerance in America. With 128 pages of text and 16 concise chapters this book corrects much of the white washing that is taking place in much longer history texts, even at the college level. Religious liberty, Native American exile, freedom from slavery, racial extermination, and ethnic tensions are highlighted with graphic images and easily accessible narratives. The trials of diverse groups such as Mormons, Catholics, Chinese, Native Americans, Jewish immigrants, Mexican Americans, Japanese citizens, and just playing Americans are dramatically highlighted in an unforgettable montage of images and words that give the lie to the &quot;melting pot&quot; that is the United States.Paintings, etchings, drawings, and photographs illustrate in no uncertain terms would hate has done to this country. More than that the pictures combined with the simple prose personalizes each inequity that is introduced. For example, &quot;A Rose for Charlie&quot; presents photographs of the community disrupted by hate, as well as that community's response to the hate. From photographs of hate speech scrawled on walls to portraits of citizens mourning the victim of a deadly hate crime present a view of America that could not be farther from the Norman Rockwell ideal we all wish this country would be. For those interested, a fictionalized account of this particular crime can be found in &quot;The Drowning of Stephan Jones&quot; by Bette Greene, which chronicles the death of the young man simply because of who he loved.It should be an essential book for all classrooms."},{"Title":"Us and them: A history of intolerance in America","review":"There does not seem to be much available for the general reader about the treatment of immigrants to this country.

In his book, US AND THEM: A HISTORY OF INTOLERANCE IN AMERICA, Carnes introduces readers to issues in US history that are briefly expressed in textbooks. However, this book has a textbook format, but it is informative and insightful when examining the history of the United States in terms of religious, racial, and social intolerance. Although the book may be geared towards social studies and history classes, grades 5-12, or libraries, it is an effective learning tool towards setting the stage to discuss intolerance that has occurred within American history.US AND THEM covers the most pivotal events in American history that have had a drastic affect on its people and communities. Carnes shows a birds-eye view of societal indifferences and injustices that occurred in the seventeenth, nineteenth, and twentieth century. Each of the chapters in the book are succinct and detailed, however, they leave the reader with a better perspective of events, such as the Salem Witch Trials, the debacle between Protestants and Catholics in Philadelphia in 1844, the Ghost Dance at Wounded Knee, and several other events that happened in the 1980s and 1990s pertaining to ethnic and gender issues.The narrative and first person accounts situated within the side margins of the pages are helpful in providing the historical background of each particular event. Two essential sections, \\"At issue\\" and \\"The context\\" synthesize the facts between the myths, and the graphic illustrations within the text may invoke strong emotions and open the doors for discussion and critical analysis; undoubtedly, questions will arise on why issues such as gender, race and religion were problematic issues in history and continue to be today.Indeed, Carnes and the preface by the late Chief Justice Harry A. Blackmun acknowledge the importance of the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution and the relevance these documents have toward excluding intolerance and ignorance within society during critical periods, times of war or economic hardships. This book reiterates the importance and the understanding of laws and rights, and should be recommended reading for all ages, especially when judgments of the past are being reinterpreted and transformed."},{"Title":"Us and them: A history of intolerance in America","review":"I would like to start by saying that c. page is correct in saying that this is nothing new, and niether was the ignorance in his/her review.

Rather than taking a balanced approach with each of the topics they addressed, these authors rush to a conclusion unsubstantiated either in fact or analysis and little true \\"discovery\\" is ever made.I have much more respect for authors who seek to do some spade work in uncovering a new point of view, balanced and justified with deductive reasoning, not recitations of pre-packaged pabulum already in circulation in dog eared white papers written by disenfranchised college professors.Fortunately, I bought this book used and my personal loss, other than the time I spent reading it, was minimized.Bytes"},{"Title":"Kicking Depression's Ugly Butt: Tried and True Methods for Outsmarting Depression","review":"KICKING DEPRESSION'S UGLY BUTT - Tried and True Methods for Outsmarting Depression by Robert Westermeyer, Ph.D. Quick Publishing. 2004. 206+xiii pp. illustrations, charts, removable \\"coping cards\\".Westermeyer writes in a down-to-earth, good-humored style that helps individuals to understand their depression and work their way out of it, thus ending the cycle perpetuating depression and drawing those who suffer from it deeper into it. What Westermeyer's book accomplishes is giving an individual a perspective on depression, thus helping her or him to see that it need not be all-consuming. Once realizing this, an individual can begin to gain control over depression. Along with this perspective, the author relates various proven techniques enabling one to cope with depression, and over time overcome it.Westermeyer's approach to working with individuals suffering from depression has been introduced to some medical facilities, and the author has been recognized by other professionals in the field for his work in this type of treatment of depression. In Westermeyer's treatment, \\"patients are expected to practice [the] skills and by so doing, treat their depression.\\" In this innovative and effective treatment, depressed individuals are regarded more as collaborators with the psychologist or other medical professional than as patients in the traditional sense. This largely self-help approach Westermeyer relates is appealing to today's public with an interest in taking charge of their own health problems as well as the medical profession's adjustments to work more closely with patients as individuals who can play a major part in remedying their ailments.Keeping a journal, analysis of thoughts, social activities, motivation, and ways of keeping depression from recurring are among the topics included to help individuals learn how to get the upper hand on their depression. Westermeyer's well-paced, reader-friendly style is not only instructive, but also encouraging to the reader. It is apparent he is concerned about the reader's depression, and is sympathetically reaching out with advice and techniques he has seen alleviate depression in his own extensive experience. The recognition that the individual is the most important agent in dealing effectively with a depression extends to the inclusion of removable laminated \\"Cognitive Coping Cards\\" at the back of the book for an individual to carry with him or her to review in developing the beneficial perspective or refer to when experiencing a severe mood associated with depression."},{"Title":"Kicking Depression's Ugly Butt: Tried and True Methods for Outsmarting Depression","review":"Written by a professional, licensed, practicing psychologist with a PhD and considerable experience in the field.

Two of my brothers died because of it, through depression induced suicide. It is not uncommon in families, many of whom, like mine, are genetically disposed to bi-polarism (which used to be called 'manic depression.')We are not talking here about simply 'feeling down' because of some external event, which will go away when the environment changes, but depression.

There are drugs today to uplift the spirits and quell the disease, for it can be the result of disease. It can be a neurosis, or it can be a psychosis.But, understanding helps, and self-help books, like this one, written by people who know what they are talking about, can be very useful, not only for the depressed person, but for the resource people around them who might aim them at the help they so desperately need.

It is the first time I have hesitated, not because I didn't like the book, but because of the wonderful feelings I had about it and my own inability to do it justice. Reading Cold Front was like visiting with an old friend who has been away for awhile. It was so great to catch up with what had been happening with the citizens of Delphi. I didn't realize how much I had missed them until I got to the second paragraph and felt like I was home again. Kathi Taylor's series incorporates each and every one of the points you expect from an excellent read. She has once again written a very believable, unique, interesting book. She not only has a protagonist that is three-dimensional, she has a whole town of characters who literally come to life on the page. They are so believable that you are sure you have known them personally for years and years. And, above all, they are sharply defined. You hear their voices as you read, each one special, individual and unforgettable.As for the plot, Cold Front gives you a new twist on the locked room murder. It is, instead, a stranded town. The fact that the entire story takes place over the New Years holiday makes it all the more enticing. There is no electricity, no heat, phones only intermittently, no access to the outside world. Times of crisis seem to be where Tory Bauer soars, and soar she does as she sets out to find the murderer in Delphi.I have one caveat. Make sure you are reading this with a big mug of hot chocolate, a fire in the fireplace, and snugged under a warm quilt, because you will be darn cold on your visit. The blizzard descriptions gave me a whole new appreciation and understanding of cold weather."},{"Title":"Cold Front: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"Toby Bauer, the female amateur sleuth first person narrators, is a widowed overweight waitress in a small town in North-east South Dakota.

Sometimes the plots are clumsy. They are mildly comic but there's never a quotable great line to compare with Elmore Leonard. The characters are pale and undifferentiated compared with Janet Evanovich. Patches of facetious exposition clog the action at he beginning of each chapter.

Kathleen Taylor, who can make you feel like you're in a blizzard in Florida, sets a wonderful scene of small-town South Dakota. She pokes just enough fun at the town to be realistic. She also employs a unique tactic of interaction with the reader directly (including the reference to page 219 of a mystery novel on page 219).Her characters aren't fully developed - I presume that comes from missing the earlier books in the series - but the reader quickly comes to understand the \\"role\\" of each player in town. She very adroitly captures the interactions, and nosiness, of small-town neighbors, all the while spinning a fairly plausible yarn that will keep you guessing until the end.All in all, I was very impressed, and she'll be on my list of authors to watch!"},{"Title":"Cold Front: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"As a born and raised South Dakotan, I can relate..no one tells it as well as does Kathleen Taylor. If you like tongue in cheek wit, great writing, round and living characters, this book is for you. Only problem is with her use of the f word..out of character and not necessary..only offensive. I'd suggest that it not be used in future writing. But, this one problem aside, I'd recommend it to friends..after blacking out the offensive word of course. Joyce"},{"Title":"Cold Front: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"Cold Front, the fifth in Kathleen Taylor's South Dakota series, is disappointing. The first third of the book works well: we start in a familiar place--the diner--and the town is as usual, filled with bored, slightly nasty people. It's New Year's Eve and there is a blizzard. Taylor is, as usual, wonderful with the reality of a small farm town in South Dakota. People drink too much and sleep around. In this book, because of the blizzard, no one can go anywhere and the hell of being trapped without lights, heat or escape is well-done. The heroine, Tory Bauer, is, as usual, masochistic and in need of sleep; (in all the books Tory is in need of sleep, and in this one she also is in need of a bathroom quite frequently). I liked the mystery, but nearly half way through the book becomes bogged down. Everyone goes to the bar and there they sit. Nothing happens but a lot of talking--and small farm towns in South Dakota are not populated with extraordinary talkers! I liked the solution of the mystery, but getting there is tedious."},{"Title":"Cold Front: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"While I enjoyed this book, I have to say that at a certain point, I just wanted to get it over with and almost didn't care any more who the culprit was. I also wasn't totally satisfied with the conclusion once I got there. Before I pick up the next mystery in this series, I will have to make sure it's under 300 pages. These mysteries do not warrant any length, because once it gets to a certain point, it just drones on and on."},{"Title":"Cold Front: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"Taylor's South Dakota mysteries are a combination of good writing, good stories, and good characters. Her subjects - life, love and death - are what the best novels have always been about. She skillfully encapsulates an entire world of humanity and emotion in one tiny town in South Dakota.In COLD FRONT, during a blizzard on New Year's Eve, overworked, overweight, forty-something waitress Tory Bauer just might be &quot;amateur sleuthing herself into an early frozen grave.&quot;COLD FRONT is the 5th in the series. If you want to read them in order, begin with FUNERAL FOOD (originally titled: THE MISSIONARY POSITION). The second is SEX AND SALMONELLA. Third is HOTEL SOUTH DAKOTA. Fourth is MOURNING SHIFT. Like her characters, Taylor lives in a small South Dakota town."},{"Title":"Cold Front: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"I think one of the highest compliments to an author is for someone to say they would buy any book the author wrote even if it was hardback. That's what I have to say about Kathleen Taylor. Her books are wonderful and even if there wasn't a mystery involved, I would read her books just for the pure fun and enjoyment of visiting with the residents of Delphi, South Dakota. From the very first book, Sex and Salmonella, Kathleen Taylor gained an avid follower by her humor and her ability with words which enabled you to picture Delphi and its inhabitants so clearly. Her characters are people you find yourself laughing and crying with and for. Closing the back cover of the current book, you find yourself eagerly looking forward to her next. Cold Front was just as good as her first through fourth books! My only criticism is that things between Neil and Tory are going so slowly! Other than that, I would highly recommend this author and I hope there will be many more books to the series!"},{"Title":"Cold Front: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"Love, love, love this book and the whole series. I am going to be very strict and tell you to run and read the other books before reading this one if you have not already. Some series do not require reading in order. This series does. Start with Funeral Food/Missionary Position and go on to Sex and Salmonella..though for some wild reason S &amp; S is the only book in the series OUT OF PRINT!! And hard to find. But it's well worth it, so keep digging until you find it. The only thing i am mad about is that the book is over and I have to wait countless months for the next one. I kept spreading it out and making it last.The writing is very clever in all the books, but I think Kathleen Taylor hit her biggest stride with Cold Front. The writing rocked. Even the chapter titles were too clever. She does a lot of literary takeoffs I really like. Tory is always asking herself what Miss Marple would do, so there's one chapter called WWMMD! Then there's the Terrible Awful No Good Very Bad Day chapter. And Little House Trailor on the Prairie! Love It!! Her writing is so hilarious..when talking about one townsperson and how out of snyc she was acting, Tory was mulling it all over and could only come up with one solution-pods in the basement.I love all the townspeople-Stu the philander, Ron the blinker, Del the cranky nympho roommate, Aphrodite the cook, Neil the librarian-my new hero, Junior the uptight control freak cousin.And throughout all the books, Tory keeps telling the reader, now if this was a REAL mystery, you would not be putting up with this or we would have already have solved the mystery etc. A nice touch.Read these wonderfully funny books."},{"Title":"Cold Front: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"It's New Years Eve, a blizzard has blown into Delphi, South Dakota, the power's out, the roads are closed, the temperature with wind chill is about thirty below and everyone is stuck in town to celebrate. Bad luck for the folks of Delphi, but good luck for us, as we watch overweight, over forty, mystery loving, waitress Tory Bauer, and the rest of the Delphi citizens bring in the New Year. But by morning, thefts are being reported all over town and a frozen body is found in the back of a pick-up truck. It turns out to be Ian Douglas O'Hara, who blew into town from Sioux Falls, just before the blizzard hit and spent the night charming just about every female in Delphi. Now ever inquisitive Tory is on the case, asking questions and as usual, secrets start popping up all over town. Kathleen Taylor has written another terrific, light-hearted mystery, full of great quirky characters. Her writing is smart and irreverent with scenes that will have you laughing out loud and enough twists and turns and false starts to keep you guessing to the end. And as Tory circles closer and closer to the truth, you'll be rooting for her. So sit back, put up your feet and join the gang from Delphi, as they work their magic. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Cold Front: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"I started reading the Tory Bauer mysteries about a month ago and quickly found myself without something to read because I read them all so fast. So I was excited when Cold Front came out. And Kathleen Taylor did not disappoint!Tory Bauer is once again thrust into Delphi intrigue after a friends wife reveal secrets that Tory would have rather kept quiet and when her best friend answers a personal add. Her date, a good-looking Englishman who comes to town, along with a snow storm, is found dead in the back of Tory's ex-boyfriends truck.Along with that, the cafe that she now owns is in financial trouble making it necessary to employ new strategies to keep it afloat that ultimately bring more problems than it solved.However, Tory's inquistive nature once again take her to wrong conclusions while she trys to understand exactly what happened to her friends date, why a well established town couple is falling apart, and where her new feelings for an old friend will lead.This book was a great read which I could not put down until I discovered everything there was to know. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Cold Front: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"Kathleen Taylor is one of the most consistent writers I have ever come across. In this, her fifth novel, she continues the story of the residents of Delphi, South Dakota (and a colorful bunch they are). It is the New Year and a major blizzard has cut Delphi off from the outside world. Three strangers, who came into town before the storm hit, are suspect in a number of robberies around town. One of the strangers turns up dead. It is up to intrepid waitress, Tory Bauer, to sort things out. As in other Taylor books, there is plenty of laugh out loud humor and insight into the workings of human nature. Another winner."},{"Title":"Cold Front: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"I eagerly look forward to the next release in the series!! Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Cold Front: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"The ordinaryness of the possibility of being frozen to death is the real tension in the book, reminiscent of Jack London's \\"To Build A Fire.\\" Like that classic, this will you make shiver in bed at night, even if you live in San Diego. The unspoken moral choices and community judgment set this firmly in South Dakota, not Alaska. Note that I said too realistic: South Dakotans tend to see outsiders as cartoon characters, much as coasties view South Dakotans (\\"I blame Fargo\\" says Tory), so the criminals' cardboard characters may simply reflect the townies' view of them. The puns and literary references are great fun, but they also tweak the reader's suspension of disbelief. My wife and I adore the series, but this one is very literary, which is why only 4 stars."},{"Title":"Cold Front: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"Brrrrr - sitting in my warm house, reading COLD FRONT, I fully expected to look outside and see the blizzard approaching. Kathleen Taylor keeps honing her skill as a writer, enveloping her readers with precise description and telling dialogue, creating a new &quot;real&quot; world. This latest Tory Bauer novel is everything I wanted it to be, fun, tense, exciting and a good mystery. What more could readers want? I'm just sorry I have to wait so long for a new one!"},{"Title":"Cold Front: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"As the delightful Ms. Taylor says: \\"Fable and fiction are filled to the brim with horror stories of what can happen when people are closeted together over a long and unrelenting winter.\\" Been there - done that- got the Damart Long Johns!The chapter names are just a hoot! For instance: \\"WWMMD?\\" (What Would Miss Marple Do?)My quandary with serials is that, unless one is more patient than I - and can therefore wait for all the books to be available to read in one continuous shut-in-the-house-due-to-blizzard marathon, one must recall who was whom - and with murder mysteries - who offed whom - from the last installment(s.) Waiting for the entire series to be complete (what letter of the alphabet is Sue Grafton on now, anyway?) is really not a good idea - considering my philosophy that life is uncertain: eat dessert first! - that is, if one is allowed dessert - which I am not - see my review of Dr. Atkins' \\"New Diet Revolution \\" but I digress. In Taylor's latest ode to the fictional South Dakota town, I was thinking that one of the characters here shouldn't still be in the familiar confines of Delphi, but rather, off at the South Dakota State pen for offing someone in a previous book. I guess I'll have to \\"back track\\" during our next blizzard ;-)"},{"Title":"Cichlids: A Complete Introduction","review":"Cichlids are a fascinating family of fishes, with high intelligence and complex behaviors. Robert Goldstein has written a solid introduction to keeping and breeding a wide variety of these fascinating species.Even though it is an introduction, however, it is not a beginner-level book.

It seemed that the three boys were just perfect, perfect, and--oh! I forgot to mention--PERFECT! Not perfect as in they're characters you can adore, perfect as in no flaws. They all get perfect grades. They're all handsome and popular. They're all rich and happy (or maybe it's just Nokoru who's rich). They're all in the greatest school ever. They're all polite and compassionate. Basically, they give you no reason to really care about them because you know their lives are perfect, and the only think that can interupt that is a damsel in distress. Even the so-called \\"cases\\" they have to solve have no mystery or suspense to them. All of CLAMP's mangas have characters that you can actually CONNECT with and they have enormous flaws which makes you like them even more but CLAMP school detectives is no exception.The plot isn't rolling either. It may be because this is a book for all ages and so they didn't want to get our younger readers confused, but it makes the book more boring. They could've had one huge almost-impossible-to-solve case that would effect the lives of the boys, but instead they chose to do mini-cases that weren't very huge.Another thing I didn't get was why the girls were so all over the 3 boys. I, myself am a girl who gushes over many manga boys (Sesshomaru from Inu-Yasha, Kai from Akira, Yue from Card Captor Sakura, etc.) but I couldn't feel what was so \\"hot\\" about the boys who (minus the colors of their hair) looked as though they could be triplets. And the girls even said how there's no manga bishounen (japanese for \\"pretty boy\\") that could match the beauty of the three boys. Umm...yeah...sure...So who do I recommend this item to? Children ages 7+, as the boys will set a good example for them. Teenagers, try something else."},{"Title":"Clamp School Detectives, Book 2","review":"After volume 1 I did enjoy \\"Clamp School Detectives\\", but I wasn't extremely impressed with it. I just thought it was cute. However, with volume 2, it develops the characters of Akira and Suoh more, taking the spotlight away from Nokoru, and as much as I love Nokoru, it was nice to see the other characters fleshed out a bit more. :D Even though the boys do look almost exactly the same, they're personalities really set them apart. Nokoru is the woman obsessed-slacker-genius, Suoh is the martial arts pro, goal focused, and serious one, and Akira is the young innocent master chef whom looks up to his Senpai's with adoration.The stories in this one are much better too. Especially the story that involves Suoh's search for a girl he saw in the Wisteria.If you even remotely like volume 1, you will love volume 2! It is just as much fun, the characters are stronger, and the art work is gorgeous. Its more than a guilty pleasure.God Bless & *Enjoy* ~Amy"},{"Title":"Clamp School Detectives, Book 2","review":"Noroku, Suoh, and Akira are back for more mysteries to solve and damsels in distress. ^^ I really enjoyed this book.

The book has been translated into English by Richard Schaaf. In this book, Neruda considers the political upheavals and abuses that have occurred in many Latin American nations: Cuba, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Panama, and others.Many of these poems contain harsh invective directed at specific political figures. If there's a &quot;hero&quot; to this book, it's Fidel Castro, who is praised along with the Cuban communist revolution. The villain of the book is the United States, which is almost always mentioned in a negative light.Neruda is a passionate writer, and his poems are thought-provoking. And interspersed throughout the harder-edged poems are some more introspective pieces in which Neruda reflects upon his own poetic vocation. Some of these reflective poems have a Whitmanesque flavor--Neruda even invokes Walt Whitman in one of them (&quot;To a North American Friend&quot;).I don't think that &quot;Epic Song&quot; represents Neruda's best work. And I think that after reading the poems praising Castro's revolution, it would be wise to read the works of an anti-Castro Cuban dissident like Reinaldo Arenas (who was persecuted under the Castro regime). Still, &quot;Epic Song&quot; contains passages of real emotion and beauty, and is worth reading."},{"Title":"Next, After Lucifer","review":"This is a great horror novel . No psychological bs here.

The workbook exercises are basically questions with blanks (as opposed to charts or tables), which could just as easily be accommodated at the end of any book.You certainly don't need both books. In either case, neither book will take you from idea to finished product. More accurately, both expect that you at least already have a work-in-progress, so an accurate title would be \\"REVISING the Breakout Novel.\\"I bought both books and I would suggest only one or the other. If you want some in-depth on topics, buy the book. If you want just the essence and a few questions for thought, buy the workbook."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"Donald Maass is a New York literary agent who seems to spend as much time promoting himself as he does his clients. Maass also does workshops on novel writing throughout the country, and this book, a companion publication for the more-in-depth WRITING THE BREAKOUT NOVEL, incorporates some of the exercises he assigns during those workshops.I have read dozens of writing books over the years; just about always I glean some valuable nuggets from each of them. Maass's workbook is no different. For instance, he suggests that the beginning novelist put off back story as long as possible to add tension and suspense. Maass stresses THERE CAN'T BE TOO MUCH TENSION in a novel. He suggests the writer add tension on every page!Another segment I found useful was his section on plot development. He recommends using layers and subplots to add texture and believability to your work. Subplots are plot lines given to characters other than the protagonist; layers are additonal plot lines given to the main character. He uses Mystic River as an example. Sean Devine is a homicide cop who must investigate the murder of his boyhood friend Jimmy Marcus's daughter; his wife has also left him, taking their baby daughter with her; he also flashes back to the day when the principal suspect, Dave Boyle, was kidnapped by child molesters while he and Jimmy stood by and watched.Maass reinforces his advice by furnishing a sample outline in an appendix. He insists that every novelist, whether he uses an outline in actual practice or not, must provide one for a possible agent or film producer eventually anyway, so he might as well learn how to do one.Beginning writers should understand that writers never quit learning and that they should continually practice their craft. Baseball players and piano players practice continually, why not novelists? WRITING THE BREAKOUT NOVEL WORKBOOK will help you practice and head off possible mistakes."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"Since he published Writing the Breakout Novel in 2001, Maass has taught a seminar of the same name at many writers conferences, and naturally learned from these experiences. The original book is here expanded by nearly three dozen exercises, which seem quite sensible, not hokey as are some by other teachers I've read.I own the Breakout book and just now am comparing the workbook that I checked out of the local library. They're not the same, not by a long shot, despite what one reviewer here says. Though many sections have identical headers (such as Inner Conflict), they are completely rewritten, using different examples. The original book is 259 pages of 6x9, the workbook is 230 pp. of 8-1/2x11 format, thus it is by no means a condensation as TheCafeWriter asserts, and the original book is not necessarily more \\"in-depth.\\" Some sections are, some aren't. The structure is substantially rearranged. Yet the concepts and the really fundamental points -- keep your story charged with tension, and so on -- do remain identical. These are essentially two complementary treatments of the same material by the same authorMaass asks his seminar participants to bring their in-process novels to perform exercises on, so the workbook is particularly useful if you are well into writing a novel already. With the discipline of the exercises, Maass teaches you to be your own draft doctor.For me, there appear to be easily enough new perspectives and ideas here to warrant buying the workbook even though I have read the original and have it on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"What does an aspiring novelist do when they've read just about all the how-to books out there? This has become my own dilemma, since I've read over 30 of the best fiction writing books (often twice) and am still looking for new insights and pearls of wisdom. It's not a bad idea to read the basics of fiction writing multiple times, since repetition is the surest way to permanently absorb and remember all the many details one must know to succeed in the novel writing market. This is why I heartily recommend Maass' new workbook IF YOU HAVE MASTERED THE BASICS AND ARE READY TO TACKLE THE ADVANCED ASPECTS OF NOVEL TECHNIQUE. Reading his previous book, \\"Writing the Breakout Novel\\" is imperative, and having read it twice is even better preparation. By expounding on his previous book's instructions and providing over 500 individual tasks to aid in improving and refining what you've already written, Maass has written a workbook that should make a big difference to anyone willing to spend the time and energy required to write a truly great story. This book is not for beginners, and it's not for sissies, but if you are thoroughly committed to succeeding and have already written a substantial part of your manuscript, it can give you the help you need to put you over the top. Bookstores are full of mediocre novels that somehow got published. Donald Maass has set a new standard for excellence. If you're serious, get \\"Writing the Breakout Novel\\" and \\"The Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook,\\" and go for it!"},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"\\"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook\\" advises us in several places to 'make it move'. But Donald Maass could stand to take some of his own advice. The book's organization is poor, and the informational structure seems to rely more on sound bites than in-depth knowledge. Each chapter has a point to make, and uses an excerpt from bestseller fiction to make the point; the two problems with this are that the points do not stand on the fiction used to back them up, and that the fiction is not selected for quality, but for saleability.If you're trying to write books of low quality that fly off the shelves and earn you a large check, I revise my rating upward, but only to three stars -- because, again, the advice structure doesn't go into detail enough to be useful, or hold together very well.While we're at it, I understand this is a \\"workbook\\", but we're perfectly capable of bringing our own paper! Half the book is taken up by fill-in-the-blank notebook spaces -- very annoying in a 200-page, 20-dollar volume. They don't even allow enough room to complete the suggested exercises! I'm not too happy about these.There are a couple of decent pieces of advice in here, but I don't think they're worth buying the book, and I plan to return it. The Elements of Fiction Writing series seems to have a lot more good in it, especially \\"Plot\\" by Ansen Dibell."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"This book is most beneficial to writers who have already completed the first drafts of their manuscripts. The exercises made me review some of my characters' attributes and turn offs as well as making sure my secondary plots tied into my main plot. Mr. Maass' suggestions caused me to re-think my villians a little bit and show a side to them that could be somewhat empathetic. Also, adding tension on every page for me was tough, but I found creative ways to do it. I do believe my completed novel is better now after making suggested changes. I stuck to my own gut on some of the things he suggested I change, but overall I did use a lot of his advice.

My only problem while using it was that Maass intended for it to serve both as a companion piece as you write your novel, or as a workbook afterward. That makes it difficult at times. He asks questions that require you to be far along in your book, yet the whole purpose of the book is to ratchet up your novel to break out level. Still, after years of writing, and having read tons of writing books, I think his is one of the best. It does require you make your own way, it is not paint by numbers. The book does not do the heavy lifting for you. He says in the intro that you can do the exercises while writing. They require a lot of work, but in the end I do believe he is on to something, and I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"I love this book because it has given me exactly what I wanted when I finished a first draft of my novel. It gave me a set of things to do to improve my first draft and in worksheet form so it is very helpful.

The workbook provides very straight forward advice and suggestions, it was exactly what I needed to help me rethink my focus, characters, etc. and helped me avoid some common mistakes."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"Literary agent Donald Maass' exercises help draw out the heart of your novel.This workbook goes beyond so many other guides in the field--it is not about grammar, nor formatting query letters, or shallow revisions that change verbs from passive to active. Instead, Maass' book is unusual because illuminates the big picture of your story arc.I am grateful for Maass' ideas that sparked in my own novel new scenes and revisions of old ones. He shows you how to make your story even more compelling.This is currently my favorite guide to novel revision."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"This workbook is just a fabulous aid in helping a hopeful fiction author assess the quality and depth of characters, plot set-up, sub-plots, everything ...Some people in my novel-writing group didn't find it useful, but I intend to use it for all my future work."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"This book is not just its companion volume in workbook form. This was written four years after publishing Writing The Breakout Novel, and after extensive workshop tours. You get the addition of all the exercises from his workshops. If you liked Writing The Breakout Novel, or if you're considering buying it, go ahead and add this volume to your cart. It is well worth the purchase.The only dissapointment I had in this book was that after many steps in the exercises, he orders us emphatically, in italics, to \\"Write that down now. Write those down. Start writing now. Note them. Make notes. Note it now. Make notes, starting now.\\"He insults his reader by assuming that we are procrastinators who can't finish what we"},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"Very helpful as a \\"how to\\" book with written exercises. The content itself is not unique but the practice for a beginner could be very useful."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"Mr Maas is a literary agent and speaks authoritatively about writing novels. I believe all but the top notch writers will find this a great book. It does not just explain what makes a breakout novel, it gives examples from various works on how these authors wrote a breakout novel. Mr. Maas also explains how the publishing market works and puts the oneous on the writer to take their writing to the next level.I write differently as well read other works from a different viewpoint.If you are writer or want to be a publish author, you should read this book."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"I have read through the book once and am beginning my second time through using a highlighter.

Otherwise, don't bother."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"Maass has created a good workbook with some nifty ways to come up with information. He's also included some material that's new, especially in terms of how to put together plots and subplots, and he expands the theme section from Writing the Breakout Novel.Two problems though: first, except for a few places, the workbook really retreads the original book, just barely expanding on the original. I was hoping for more nuggets of information.The second problem is that it is a workbook. I hate workbooks, mostly because my brain simply doesn't do those kinds of questions. I work from story down, not parts of story up. The workbook gives the impression to writers that answering the questions will magically make the story fall into place, and I instinctively reject that attitude. No, Maass isn't deliberately trying to tell writers the process, but the impression is there.I would have rather he put together a follow-up book and then listed these questions at the end of the chapters instead of formatting the book with lines to be filled in. I think I would have been more receptive to the content. As it was, I read hastily through, feeling nauseous that I wasn't doing my homework--a kid's attitude from far too many workbooks in grade school.Basically, good but not great information, and formatting that puts me off means that I have a hard time recommending this book. But if you're a workbook type, go for it."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"I am currently only half way through this book, but I am already learning from this book. It gives you some good things to work with. It made my mind think of different plots to come up with by putting Characters in one column, then Narrative (questions to be answered, plots to include, subplots to also include and so on..) in another then Scene in the third column (where the action is happening). You criss cross over and can get many combinations to your story. Great book from a great author."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"When I first began working through this workbook, I did not heed Donald's first suggestion. It was not long before I realised that were I to succeed, as was his intention, I needed to read his book, 'Writing the Breakout Novel'- FIRST.Sage advice.Now as I push myself through the pages of the workbook, I understand the depth behind his lessons.Be prepared to exorcise your inner self to create the best novel you can. Donald Maass is to writing as Tony Horton is to fitness, and 'Writing the Breakout Novel workbook' is the P90X of novel writing. He will make your brain sweat, push you beyond your comfort zone to show you how to get the most out of each character, flex your creative muscles as you go deep to develop your plots, while you heighten tension to deliver a novel, which cannot help but burn with cadence, resonate with readers, and leave them wanting more.Is that not what you wanted to do? Write that Breakout Novel?I wish you well in your endeavour."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"I did not read the companion book \\"Writing the Breakout Novel\\"; I only read this workbook version and it was terrific! The book focuses on techniques to develop your characters, plot, and scenes. The greatest lesson is to fill every page of your novel with tension_ this book gives a lot of great advice and exercises to help you do this. I have used it on several stories and they are by far the best I have ever written."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"I agree with another reviewer that this should be called \\"revising\\" rather than writing. The excercises are interesting and thought-provoking, but (and this would go for any book that claims to teach you how to write a novel) do not use this unless you have a complete first draft of your novel. Using this before you have all your ideas and plans written down may very well hinder your progress because you get so wrapped up in editing and revising.So, don't be misled by the title of this book or most other how to writing books. Use them only after you are complete with a first draft, otherwise you may never get that first draft done."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"I finally bought this book after rechecking it from the library several times.

This book has helped me dig deeper and develop my own novel."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"I previously purchased WRITING THE BREAKOUT NOVEL. The workbook was recommended by an instructor at the University of Wisconsin novel writing clinic in November. The guidance from both works is very good. The workbook provides specific suggestions for implementing the techniques of novel writing and is aimed at the writer who has completed at least a first draft of his work. The workbook is useful even if you haven't read the original work but I recommend both.I have read a number of 'how-to' books on fiction writing in general and novels in particular. For pure instruction with an entertaining style, these books by Donald Maass are the best."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"Excellent guide for writing a novel, whether your first, second, third, etc. Love the exercises.

This structured approach really helps you achieve that goal. In his book \\"writing the breakout novel\\", it seemed to me Maass spent way too much time preaching the importance of writing a novel that is a breakout. Here, in the workbook you'll get right into exercises that will have you get results you can use. Maybe someday I'll go back and carefully compare the two, but for now I used the workbook.I also liked how he took examples from good fiction and used them in his chapters to make his points and then you did something related. Yes, there is a little \\"extra\\" space in the workbook and I actually just used a notebook on the side rather than the workbook (I can use it again on my next novel, too). I ended up with PAGES of notes about different characters, what they would do, will do, could do, etc., based on the exercises in the workbook. This is definitely a helpful resource to give you ideas to improve your plot and characters. One of several good books on writing stories and novels."},{"Title":"Writing the Breakout Novel Workbook","review":"Covers the same topics as the non-workbook version, but is more condensed and clear. The exercises help the reader to apply the content directly to a work in progress, showing how all the parts fit together. I found the book very helpful.

Burton for pulling it off - a slick and immensely satisfying read told with the flair and sophistication of an author you'd think had been doing this for a career.\\"The Rogues' Game\\" refers to, at least on the level closest to the surface, a weekly poker game held in an aging hotel of a backwater post-World War II Texas hole of a town. In classic noir fashion, we learn neither the name of the town nor our narrator whose story rolls as easily across the pages as our hero rolls into town in a grand convertible with an even grander blonde babe on his arm. From there Burton artfully leads us down what appears to be an oft-traveled path of a pair of grifters on the con, but soon we find that the author and his narrator have a much more important score to settle than a simple heist in a local high-stakes poker game. Braced by a strong supporting cast of memorable thugs with names like \\"Chicken Little\\" and \\"Ice Pick Willie\\", the author weaves a tight mystery told in dusty Texas roadhouses and smoky (...) fight galleries, settings which he knows well and relates with authority. With oil boom in truly Texan scale and murky allusions to Reinhard Heydrich and other Nazi war criminals, the initially simple block thickens deliciously on the way to an unsuspected jackpot.Well paced, gritty, and authentic, both Milton T. Burton and his debut novel are the real deal. I'm looking forward to his next hand - you'd be wise to place a bet on this one."},{"Title":"The Rogues' Game","review":"This is a mystery about an elaborate grift set in Post WWII Texas at the start of the oil boom. All the characters are so well done and not stereotypical; Della, the beautiful blonde is also very business smart; Manlow Rhodes, the Presbyterian banker, \\"Chicken\\" Little, an old ex-con and breeder of gamecocks; Det. Ollie Marne, the cop on the take \\"would like to be a better man than his job and the circumstances in this town will allow him to be.\\", and many others including the protagonist who tells the story in retrospect. The plotting, sense of time and place, dialogue and tension are first-rate. There is a second standalone and a series on the way by Burton and you can bet I'm going to read them."},{"Title":"The Rogues' Game","review":"Because of the excellence of this novel, it is hard to believe that this is Burton's first published work. It is a \\"quick\\" but superb read. This is an exceptional thriller - the hints are there throughout the book but I never would have guessed the ending. The characters are extremely well developed.Bravo Burton!!! I hope that we'll be seeing other novels from him!!"},{"Title":"The Rogues' Game","review":"Backdrop for story in post WWII Texas is intriguing as is basic plot but story becomes too predictable & the characters are caricatures. The result is a below-average page turner."},{"Title":"The Rogues' Game","review":"In 1947 a forty-three years old man drives into a Texas city in a brand new Lincoln convertible with a beautiful blonde Della. He books a room for them for two weeks at the Weilbach Hotel informing the clerk he may stay longer. The next morning as the man expected Deputy Sheriff Ollie Marne visits him to learn what he is doing here. The man bribes Ollie to get him access to the weekend poker game at the hotel's Plainsman Suite where to sit costs five thousand.Not long after meeting with Marne, the man and Della have breakfast with ex convict Herbert \\"Chicken\\" Little and Ice Pick Willie. Ice Pick is irate when the man insists the scam to con banker Clifton Robillard could take six months though Chicken Little seems calm; the man knows he has an enemy in Ice Pick. The game has begun.This post World War II noir is character driven by the no nonsense amused narrator who provides no name for himself or the city he works his game in. The story line is action-packed but clearly belongs to the poker playing anti-hero who bluffs his way through scenarios without fear of someone calling his hand. A final twist adds to a strong late 1940s Texas suspense thriller that never slows down once the man with no name begins raising the ante.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Rogues' Game","review":"The author's debut, The Rogues' Game, set in 1947, is a light entertaining version of The Sting - albeit Texas style. Using an ongoing high stakes poker game as the ruse, spiced up with a once in a lifetime oil strike as the backdrop, the reader is given an inside look at how a big scale scam is run as the \\"mark\\" - a real bad guy - is slowly but effectively lured into a trap capitalizing on his own deceit.The story is narrated by our hero, whose name the reader never learns, who is fresh from serving in WWII in some unknown capacity and initially appears to be no more than a professional gambler. Pulling into town with his traveling companion, a beautiful woman 12 years his junior, he is in search of the above mentioned poker game and the reader soon learns that our man has more than just card-playing on his mind.Our hero lines up his team of \\"good\\" guys and goads the \\"bad guy\\" weekend after weekend at the poker table, setting him up for the big finale. The coincidental, but fortuitous oil strike, provides him with stake money for his scam, and gives his girlfriend the opportunity to show us her business savvy. She's not only drop dead gorgeous, but smart too! And by the end of the tale everything is tied up in a neat little bow - our hero and his team satisfyingly rich and happy and the bad guy and his team receiving their just desserts.The Rogues' Game is a quick and entertaining read and more than a little predictable. Not a bad book just not a great one."},{"Title":"The Rogues' Game","review":"Good stuff! It's hard to believe this is Burton's first novel. HIs writing is excellent, the plot outstanding, and it's full of interesting characters. Plenty of action, lots of surprises, and a very satisfying ending. One of the better pieces of fiction I've read in several years."},{"Title":"The Rogues' Game","review":"I mean could it really get any better? A rhetorical question if there ever was one. Tying the subject headers all into what might be one of the top 3 freshman efforts that I have ever read. My general MO is to not recap the plot (as that is generally available in the publishers review), but rather to comment on likes and dislikes. Starting with the latter, I offer a one word reply: \\"none\\" What I liked: the vivid description of the onset of an oil boom, poker strategy, cockfighting, German espionage prior to the on set of WWII et al.I believe that everyone is entitled to an opinion, however, it is hard to find fault Burton's first effort."},{"Title":"The Rogues' Game","review":"The Rogue's Game is a hell of a ride through post WWII Texas. It's got a great poker game seemingly at the heart of it, until you realize that poker is just a means to an end.Burton's characterizations are quite unique, and drip with the flavor of West Texas. His sense of the slang, and character nicknames are very appealing. If you like movies like The Sting, anything to do with poker, noir novel, or sharp local dialog like almost no one writes today, run to get this book and make sure to check out his second book, The Sweet and the Dead, which is a true five star read. We can only home that Milton Burton is going to be with us for a very long time. This is one hell of an entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Rogues' Game","review":"Mr. Burton's characters are very well developed .It is hard to believe he has not written more books.I hope to read more of his books in the future .The plot moves quickly and is never dull.One of the best grifter plots i have ever read.It is bizarre at times and captures the imaginationof the reader .CAPPY"},{"Title":"The Rogues' Game","review":"This is a great first book. As a native Texan I thoroughly enjoyed this tale of old time Texas in the 40s, oil wells, greed and con men. Plus a little dose of WWII intrigue. Looking forward to Mr. Burton's next effort."},{"Title":"The Rogues' Game","review":"Like the small west Texas town that is never named, the man with no name is not what he appears to be on the surface. He drives a beautiful car and appears in town with a beautiful woman named Della. It isn't the first time he has been in town as he was here before in 1942. This time he is back to seek some revenge and no one remembers him or suspects that he is anything other than what he appears to be-a flamboyant gambler.Revenge for what isn't clear nor is his plan. His plan does involve a weekly high stakes card game that has been going on for decades at the Weilbach Hotel. It also isn't really clear which of several players is his target. It also isn't clear on how Della's interest in a recent oil strike is going to help or for that matter hurt his plan. Like his cards, he keeps his plans close to the vest and adjusts for changes. He does have a plan, he is flexible and he just needs a little help from friends like Chicken Little and Icepick Willie.What follows in this novel by Tyler, Texas resident Milton T. Burton is an intriguing and deeply twisted tale of a great con. The author opens a portal back into a different time and pulls the reader deeply into a Texas of the recent past. Told through first person point of view he spins a rich and complex weave that pulls the reader deep into his world where only slowly does the shape and scope of the plan come tantalizingly clear like the mirage on a West Texas highway during the heat of the summer before disappearing again. Heavily atmospheric both in place and in style of writing, this is the kind of novel that starts slowly, moves slowly and pulls the reader in so deep that when one looks up from the book there is that splendid moment of disorientation between the past that might have been and the present.Kevin R. Tipple 2005"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This was such a good book. There were a few chapters that were repetitive but overall this book was very interesting. At the end it seemed to have gone by too fast. This thick book is worth time. It made me very interested in reading books about Ceasar and this time period. Prior to reading this book I knew the basics of Cleopatra's life but this gives a whole new perspective of her. It talks about her relationships with Ceasar and Mark Anthony, her religion, being a queen, mother, and her sad ending."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I found this to be an excellent example of a ficticious novel which quite completes a profile of a woman of which much speculation is assumed. It furthers an interest of the times and truly historical documents of which it is founded."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"True to the formula of a historical romance, this book skimms through history with extensive detail on clothing, furnishings, intrigue and romance. The historic part comes in last. A delightful and mindless read, good for a long plane ride or a summer at the beach with the kids."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book was one of the greatest books I read this year! It was researched to the point where nothing was left out. The author made you feel that you knew the charcters by the end of the book.

When you read this book are in the room when Bernice IV and Cleopatre VII summon Cleopatra! The Memoirs of Cleopatra is the longest book I have ever read but it is also the most thrilling! I found the there is not a dull spot in this book, from the first paragraph you are on the boat and in the palace."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"At page 711 (only 246 to go) I put down and put away Margaret George's Memoirs of Cleopatra. We've just had another tour of another dark temple (The Temple of Diana at Ephesus, one of the 7 Wonders of the World, though given the perfunctory description, you'd never guess it) and Cleo is nagging Marc Antony yet again about Octavian and Rome. The Battle of Actium, one of the lynch pins of western history, is in the offing and the author is taking time out for a travelogue and a harridan's tirade.Ms. George did exhaustive research for this book and she doesn't waste one bit of it. It's fascinating stuff, at first, but she continues to pile it on at the expense of her story and characters. Every new city, new parade, new religious rite, new erotic tryst with Antony reads exactly like the last.This book is 300 pages longer than it should be. As it plods along, the actions--even the dialogue--of the characters become completely predictible. Cleopatra is smart ! and tough and likes kids. Antony is an indecisive lout. Only Caesar stays fascinating and charismatic. By conjuring up curiosities in place of insights into her characters, Ms. George has produded a book as heavy as an obelisk and a heroine as flat as an Egyptian painting."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I bought this book based on the many great reviews here. I was very disappointed. After the first 500 pages, I couldn't read anymore (very unlike me!) - the story was going nowhere - how many times can I read about a banquet! The dialogue between the characters was way too &quot;20th century&quot; &amp; completely unconvincing."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Learned as I enjoyed. Truly swept me off my feet and transported me to a place in time. History buffs will love this book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I must commend Margaret George on the amount of research that went into writing &quot;Memoirs&quot;. When I saw this book in the bookstore several months ago and perused it, I mistakenly believed it to be a mostly fictitious piece of work. However, after reading it and reading the author's notes at the end I realized that very few aspects of the book were fabricated. This book gives life to Cleopatra through the images presented to the reader through the dialogue. Although it is a lengthy book, it is definitely a book you can't put down and one that you need to read straight-through. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in Egypt, the Ptolemaic dynasty or even Caesar and the Roman warriors."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have always been fascinated by the story of Cleopatra,so, when I found this book at my libray I quickly got it out. The book was very entertaining for the first 300 or so pages, but after that it seemed to drag on and on and I found it quite boring. I also did not like the representation of her as a mostly good person. Though, I don't think history's depiction of her as a scheming seductress is entirely accurate, I still would have liked her to be evil once in awhile. I mean, come on? Do you really believe she went to see Antony dressed up as Venus, without the thought of seducing him not once crossing her mind?"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"not quite as mesmerizing as her other novels. just could not seem to make the characters come alive in this one."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I am literally in the middle of this tremendous book. I absolutely love it! I hope George's other books are just as enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This historical fiction book covers the entire life of the famous Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt. The book starts when she is a young child, and ends.....well, I'll leave that up to the reader to find out for him/herself!I'm embarrassed to admit that I started the book knowing next to nothing about Cleopatra. In this case, it was probably a plus that I didn't know much; the book is so huge and detailed that I think it would be easy to get bogged down in if you already knew her story. For me, though, everything came as a surprise, and it made it hard for me to put the book down. I thought the book was very well written, and it was fascinating to read about Cleopatra's time period, and ancient Rome and Egypt. I've added Helen of Troy by George to my TBR list; it sounds as fascinating as Memoirs of Cleopatra was!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I'd admit that I put off reading this novel for the longest time--its thickness was an excuse I harped on, fearing that I might get bored with the story without even reaching the half of it (despite reviews to the contrary).Of course, I realized the foolishness of this sentiment soon enough when I found myself staying up well into the hours of the night, turning page after page, losing myself in the grandiosity and harshness of Ptolemaic Egypt and the treacherous, unstable world that was Rome. Through it all, I marveled at the skill with which Margaret George sought to blend truth with the long-established views of Cleopatra as the seducer and corrupter of powerful men, and the harbinger of Rome's doom.A scintillating novel, couched in colorful prose that one can actually feel the heat and grit of the desert sands, the cool polished floors of the palace halls, and the breeze that sweeps from across the bay right into Cleopatra's window. The figures of Caesar, Antony, and Octavian are just as striking--with allusions to human weaknesses and failings behind their powerful personas. And even secondary characters like Olympos and Mardian bring a touch of humor, whimsy, and even more humanness to the mystery that is Cleopatra.From those first words of salutation to the goddess Isis, to the accounts of events after the Queen's suicide, The Memoirs of Cleopatra stands as a masterful story that brought to vivid life the woman, the mother, and the ruler possessed of unflagging strength of love and loyalty to her people, her children, and her lovers. Her silent \\"admissions\\" of fear, frustration, loneliness, and even pain make this \\"memoirs\\" truly unique, as it purports to shed a tantalizingly unexpected dimension in her person when held against the usual non-savory portrayals of her in the annals of history."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"A tour de force of imagination and history. I found this to be perhaps one of the most engrossing novels I have ever read. When I finished the last chapter, I wished I were just beginning the book again. Strange as it may sound, Cleopatra somehow became real to me, and I was haunted by her presence afterwards."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I loved every page of this book. This book brings life to the story we all know and love. The characters are brought to life and for the first time, we see Cleopatra in a different light. She is not portrayed as the evil seductress that Roman history would have had us believe. As you read this book, you think, \\"A woman whose possesses the intellegence that Cleopatra did would have not resorted to some of the things history has suggested to us.\\"George's knowledge of ancient Egypt and their customs is amazing. I know she did a lot of research for this book, but the detail in this book is incredible. I mean, you can picture what ancient Alexandria must have looked like. You can picture what all the characters must have looked like.Great book! I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I confess I'm something of a nut when it comes to Ancient Egyptian anything, so when I bought this novel by Ms. George, I could hardly wait to read it. It fulfilled all my expectations and more. Cleopatra's sad story is well-known to any student of history, so the story won't have any surprises far as the better-known aspects of her life and death are concerned, but the language used to express Cleopatra is perfect, the setting as well. For the first time, you feel as if you really know this woman and her thoughts, as well as what her expectations of her two major loves were. Anyone who is an Egyptophile will love this book. I do."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Lush is the first word that comes to mind when reading this book. The world of Cleopatra is so descriptive that you feel as if you're right there with there eating, walking and seeing the same sights she is. There is a great deal of information about the ancient Egyptian world, as well as the world of Rome. I never thought I could get through such a heavy book without becoming bored, but this is very well written and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I am thoroughly enjoying this long, long story. I just cannot agree with Mrs. George, that Cesar loved Cleopatra! If he did, he would have recognized her son by him and at least mentioned the child in his will. I do not believe Octavian had deceived Cesar. I actually believe Cesar being cut from the same cloth as Octavian, naturally made the young man his successor. Queen Cleopatra was raised in court among courtiers, without a mother, with a drunkard for father; I can't believe she was so nave as to think Cesar did really love her... She seems to have been a dreamer, but wouldn't the absence of her son from Cesar's will bring her back to reality?"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book is spectacular, transporting the reader back to the waning days of the Roman republic when Cleopatra consorted with Caesar, Antony and Octavian.. Old myths about Cleopatra and Antony are shattered, and, by the end of the book when Cleopatra commits suicide with the famous asp, you really feel like you've lived her life. The character development and writing style are amazing, and I enjoyed every page of the 900+ book. Margaret George has written a true classic, one of the most compelling stories I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I picked up a copy of this book one afternoon because I was bored but I couldn't put it down after I started reading it! I used to think the character of Cleopatra was too overrated but Margaret George changed my way of thinking! After reading this book, I immediately read &quot;Mary, Queen of Scotland and the Isles&quot; (an equally excellent book) writen by the same author. I have yet to read &quot;Henry, the Eighth&quot;, but I'm sure I will love it. What I love about Margaret George is that a lot of what she writes is true. She clearly does research and then weaves an intricate storyline around her characters. Just as a warning, do not read this book if you don't enjoy reading in the first place, are hyper-active, or are male. This book is quite long (900+) and tends to be a little tedious in spots. Margaret George is a female and I think she writes her novels geared toward females. I love her novels and she is now one of my favorite authors. I hope she writes another book soon! Maybe about Joan of Arch or some other prolific historic female!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I would like to say this out front, but WHY does it really matter what skin color Cleopatra had? Black, or not, she was a great figure in ancient history. We cannot bind people's greatness by color of skin. As long as we see a person as white, black, yellow, etc. we do not see their real self. So, I think caring about her skin color defeats the purpose of seeing her as a person."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Having studied the fall of teh republic and the rise of Octavian at school, this book vaguely interested me. And I came away from it just totally loving it. It is one of teh best books ever written - even when you have finally finished you just want to keep reading. And I know that it is just fiction but I can never say another good thing about Octavian as long as I live. As for Cleopatra...I could never say a bad thing. George does a wonderful job. I even wanted to go into teh book, to actually meet Charmian and Iras and Mardian and Olympos.

I am always disappointed when I reach the last page."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Memoirs of Cleopatra is an outstanding novel. The near 1,000 pages race by. The reader is mesmerized by Cleopatra's account of her fasinating life. Ms. George experty weaves historical events and people throught the story. She has allowed us to glimpse into the private thoughts and lives of key historical figures from Ancient Rome and Egypt. What is releaved is not only a picture of history but how the events affected the lives of the individual people and how their personalities and view of theworld have influenced their decisions and therefore history. Ms. George has several pages of author's notes in the back of the book in which she explains her research and which events in history were true or why she deviated from popular belief. She also provides titles for further reading broken down into catagories of books about the people or the time period. You will be captivated from the first sentenceto the last in this spellbinding novel."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"The book is magnificent, as good or better than her earlier works. The wealth of detail adds much to the total quality of this work, especially in an era in which so much fiction / literature seems to be devoid of detail, obsessed with plot, action and dialogue, and obviously aiming at ultimate film / television treatment. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get Rex Harrison, Richard Burton and Roddy MacDowell out of my head, throughout the entire enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this latest novel by Margaret George. Having little knowledge of Cleopatra other than what's out there in pop culture, I learned a tremendous amount. Cleopatra fascinated me - she was shrewd, brave and charismatic. I don't think George was quite as comfortable with the subject matter of Egypt as compared to England (Henry VIII). Nonetheless the book picks up momentum as it goes and delivers a remarkable inside look at one of history's most interesting women."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book makes history come alive in a very easy-to-read form. I wish learning history in school was as enjoyable as reading this book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George truely brings this time period to life. It is a trip back to Cleopatra's Egypt and the people of her time; Julias Caeser, Marc Anthony, and Octavian. It is obviously well researched and it makes for a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"TOO STRANGE BAD IN MY OPINIO"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George's presentation of Cleopatra comes across very much as a historical romance rather than quasi biography. The depictions of Rome and Egypt are mesmerizing but she's excessive in her metaphors which detracts from the flow of the story. The book was a great read for amusement but the reader feels as if the writer is struggling too hard to be a classical writer. George's depiction of Cleopatra's character and personality was difficult at times to find believable. Here was a powerful ruler of Egypt that held the wealthiest country in her hands but she appeared throughout the story like any other pedestrian rather than a queen. In George's attempt to bring us closer to the human side of Cleopatra, she erased the actual power this woman must have held. Too much emotional portrayal and not enough intellect."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I love novels set in ancient times, ones that are well-researched and tell a good story. This novel does none of that. A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that just because something is based on a true story that that automatically makes it good reading or a good movie. No, it doesn't work that way. You still must tell a compelling story. This novel fails to do so, and in fact, gets several facts about Cleopatra absolutely wrong.The story is told in first-person, which normally I would think was a good choice, but the voice of Cleopatra is like someone giving a deposition. Just the facts, ma'am, just the facts. The author would have us believe that Cleopatra never suffered, never felt fear, never doubted herself, always had the answer. There's absolutely no character arc, no fatal flaw.After portraying a character absolutely ruled by ambition, pragmaticsm and logic, she meets Ceasar and gives over all her power to him. She says she loves him more than life itself, but this is really difficult to believe by that point. It would have been so much more believeable if the author had justified their relationship due to Cleopatra's wanting to secure her rulership and using Rome to her advantage. When the unemotional, dispassionate Cleopatra finally commits suicide it makes absolutely no sense.The sea battle of Alexandria is one of the most famous and harrowing of historical battles, but we hardly get a glimpse of it. The author doesn't mention the billowing clouds of smoke or soldiers screaming. There's a painting that clearly depicts the devastation that was 100 ships burning. In the novel, it warrants maybe one page of action both leading up to it, describing it, and resolving it. Weird. It's as if the author can't handle anything really emotional and so just glosses over it. Why then did she choose to write this as fiction?The author also claims that Cleopatra is a great beauty, when in fact Cleopatra was never considered a great beauty. Cleopatra was known to have an incredible, hypnotic, seductive voice. Both the History channel and Discovery channel's informative documentaries made this point from correspondence written by Roman senators and others after they met Cleopatra in person. Paintings of Cleopatra depict a rather plain woman with a broad forehead, large nose and Grecian hairstyle. She didn't look at all like Elizabeth Taylor!The author does not know how to build tension or vary dynamics by having failure followed by success. There are very few details about attire, a lot about food, hardly any about life in Egypt in general.The utter lack of lyricism, emotion, sensory details, make this novel more boring than any history book I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra is my third Margaret George novel. I love the way George lets the reader immerse him/herself in the world inhabited by her subjects. She makes it easy to imagine what that world looked like, and even what it smelled and tasted like. Several readers have objected to her descriptions of the many sumptuous banquets and elegant articles of clothing, but that's what makes the foreign become so tangible. But, while I whole-heartedly loved Mary, Queen of Scots and The Autobiography of Henry VIII, I don't feel I can recommend Cleo quite so highly.While George successfully creates the sensual and exotic feel of Ancient Egypt, I didn't find the story truly compelling until about 50 pages from the end. (And I had to wade through 900 pages of less-than-compelling story to get there!) I knew little of Cleopatra's story other than that she liked her men Roman and soldierly, but her story wasn't really very interesting until Cleopatra's and Antony's last days in Egypt, waiting for the arrival of Octavian. The anxiety of waiting for their inevitable destruction made their previously rather dull relationship interesting at last. Their passionate and romantic deaths were beautifully rendered, and made the previous 900 pages somewhat worthwhile.I look forward to reading George's future books (and I'm very curious to see who she tackles next), but wouldn't recommend this one unless you've a lot of time to kill."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Just as she did in \\"The Autobiography of Henry VIII,\\" Margaret George has given an utterly realistic voice to a famous historical figure, while remaining true to the facts contained in whatever documented sources are available.Many other novels about Cleopatra focus only on her affairs with Julius Caesar and Marc Antony. Many of them also repeat the myths and inaccurate stories about her that grew out of Roman propaganda. Books like these usually ignore the facts that Cleopatra was not a femme fatale who seduced hundreds of men, but a capable ruler who competently governed Egypt by herself for many years; that she was actually only with two men in her entire life (her arranged dynastic \\"marriages\\" to her brothers were almost certainly in name only); that she was also mother to four children.Cleopatra's real story has enough drama, love, war, and intrigue to make a fascinating tale all on its own, and Margaret George does it full justice. Cleopatra's stories of her childhood are probably mostly from George's imagination, but very plausible. George then has Cleopatra relate how she overcomes the palace coups staged by her own family; how she allies herself to Julius Caesar and later to Marc Antony to maintain Egypt's independence, falling in love with each of them in different ways; how she convinces Antony to join her in an attempt to create an eastern dynasty after they realize that Octavian is untrustworthy; and finally how, after being defeated by Octavian and losing Antony, she decides to maintain her dignity by committing suicide rather than being taken back to Rome by Octavian to be paraded in his Triumph.The story is written in first person in the form of a memoir, with an epilogue by her physician Olympos, who was an actual historical figure whose writings are an important accurate source for Cleopatra's life and especially her deathbed scene. The book is a little long, because George goes into full detail about everything, but you are so caught up in the story that you hardly notice.I always wondered how history would have been different if Cleopatra could have been content to confine herself to governing an independent Egypt instead of making a bid to expand her territory. But even Cleopatra was not immune to the dreams of empire-building that all monarchs seem to have had then."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"In writing this review I must say upfront that I didn't finish the novel. For me, however, that's an anomaly which speaks much more about the book than anything else I'm about to share. Simply put, I finish whatever books I start, for better or worse. But it pains me to finish this. The prose is cumbersome and weighty of ambling passages of thought that bore me completely, and has been previously mentioned, this well-researched book seems to have turned into an attempt to fit every granule of period history into it. Three pages of Cleopatra getting into a pool, pondering this and that and everything, it seems. She ponders excessively, which results in too much time going by without something, anything happening. One of my earlier writing teachers told me once that something should happen by the end of each chapter. However, in this unraveling production, events happen one to the next with so many pages between I can hardly ever remember the thing of consequence. Often, I asked myself, 'so what?' SO WHAT? Whomever edited this book should've asked 'so what?' and slashed accordingly."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I'm fond of big novels but this one was a chore.After a thousand pages I still don't feel like I know, or care for, Cleopatra. How can that be?You would think it impossible to make her story a tedious one - but tedious it is. Banquet upon banquet, frivolity upon frivolity. Surely there was more to her than what she ate, what she wore and how she spent her country's money?The portrayal of Caesar was adequate, though not impressive. Marc Antony... who was he? The depiction of him is so thin he almost disappears.Not one character in a cast of hundreds manages to leave an impression.Very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I'm only writing this for amazon to update my preferences.. I don't need to say anything else that hasn't been said. Took me 3 tries to be able to commit to this novel but i'm glad I did."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I picked this up because it was on the recommended reading list at the book store, and I've always been intrigued by Cleopatra's story. The length of the book was a bit daunting at first, but by the end of it, I was sorry it was over! This book was a real page turner, especially the last few scrolls describing Antony's and Cleopatra's impending demise. It was the perfect combinatin of action, romance, suspense (even though we all know how it ultimately ends), and adventure. After reading this, I am inclined to read George's other books."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Previously to listening to the audiobook, \\"Cleopatra,\\" by Margaret George, the only thing the culture had related about her was that she was only a sexpot who ruined good men! Margaret George's book shows that she was acutely intelligent, trying to survive in a male-run world. She put her nation in excellent condition economically and ecologically and in this book appeared to be the kind of ruler our country needs right now! During droughts she fed the population with the granaries that she built above the regular flooding of the Nile. She warded off the Roman conquerers, Caeser and Anthony, during most of her lifetime, enabling her to continue her ruling of Egypt. It was only the military defeat of Anthony by another Roman that caused her defeat. From this book and apparently, it was well researched, one would wish that more women were allowed to be rulers, especially today, in spite of the Margaret Thatchers of the world. Does the culture need to keep her excellent ruling a secret in order to make believe women can't function well in high positions? Or is it the need of a still male-dominated elite to keep the non-alpha males titillated with the allurement of sex instead of leadership. I have on order the other book on Cleopatra by a female writer, but have not listened to it. Both audiobooks are available at audible.com I have listened to one by a male writer from Librivox and it is the same old male story, good men ruined by a woman. Say, wasn't there something in the Bible about that?"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I absolutely love love love this book. As far as I am concerned this is the best version of who Cleopatra was. I have never read a better book or saw a better movie about her. This is amazing.... I am sad I am done with it."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Since childhood, the story of the legendary Ptolemaic Queen has captured my imagination. Throughout the years, I have read many books on Cleopatra - many of which have remained faithful to the ancient sources, however biased as they may seem. After buying this book on a whim, assuming that this novel was simply one more incorrect reinterpration of history and past novels previously read - a blatant reiteration of Plutarch et al. - I now admit that I was was wrong! The extensive attention given to detail and characterizations, the scope and magnitude of this novel are impressive! Margaret George has done extensive research into the time of the fabled Queen of Egypt and brings Cleopatra's world to life, not only referencing from ancient texts but also drawing upon the more modern-day sources. This engaging novel allows the reader to transcend the present and be transported into a fabled world, one which has captivated writers throught the centuries, a story which brings the tale of Cleopatra and her contemporaries into the immediate. In this book, you come to understand why the main characters - Caesar, Cleopatra, Antony and Octavian - held the fate of the known world in their hands. Ms. George takes pain-staking effort to scratch beyond the surface of the Cleopatra-myth and reveal these godly, yet wonderfully all too-human personalities that transcend time: the characters in this novel are complex and multi-dimensional, grand and legendary, even in their most vulnerable moments. Via this window into Cleopatra's world, you experience every nuance of expression; her descriptions appeal to every sense. Within these pages, you share Cleopatra's joys and pain, witness her triumphs and heart-wrenching sorrows. You experience the range of emotion: her sense of majesty as Caesar confirms her a sole ruler of Egypt, you feel her passion for Antony, know her rage upon betrayal and suffer through her final defeat. I was particularly pleased by the fact that the book (more so than in the past) depicts Cleopatra less as an evil Eastern seductress and more as an able queen and mother; Julius Caesar is seen as a mortal, and not as a deified individual, and Marc Antony ( who in the past has been much-maligned ) is allowed to be viewed in a more favorable light as a great and able Roman leader, and not simply as the emasculated shell of a man that his enemies and successive pro-Augustan authors have portrayed him to have been.On a grand scale, Ms. George conjures forth an intriguing tale of epic proportions into this well-crafted account of a time long-gone, but not forgotten. For those of you who are interested in this tumultuous, but extremely fascinating period of history, indulge yourself and read this book! Sip a glass of wine in your finest crystal goblet, light several fragrant candles and play some soothing music. Take that journey and let your imagination soar - you are in for a delightful experience!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"It's really a stunning work, and having now done most of the research myself, I can see that Margaret George has made very historically correct, or at least acceptable choices. Sometimes all you can do is choose when there is conflicting evidence. Margaret George is writing for Cleopatra's side, so if there's a dispute or an interpretation of propaganda, she resolves it in Cleopatra's favor. (Such as the death of her youngest brother Ptolemy.)On the one hand, writing a story about this period of history is a no-brainer. It's one of the most compelling love-stories of all time. You really can't screw it up. On the other hand, she does a beautiful portrayal of the major characters in the book. Caesar sweeps the reader off their feet--as if he were one of those heroes in a romance novel, flawed only insofar as his imperfections will make the reader love him. When he dies, one does feel the momentary blotting out of the sun.Cleopatra herself, tireless, shrewd and inspiring. We wonder if we could have gone on in similar circumstances the way she did, time and time again.In truth, but for one very talented admiral Agrippa, our lives could all be very different today. Antony might have been the perfection that died with Caesar. But with the war having gone the other way, it's Antony that had to be the greatest challenge to Margaret George as a writer. Lets face it. He's history's biggest loser. And all the propaganda of the time paints him as unmanly, foolish, drunken, and weak. Margaret George uses his letters to revive a different kind of Antony. One who is manly and warm-hearted, and dreadfully, tragically, honorable.Margaret George makes Antony lovable in a way that even Richard Burton's massive acting talent, Elizabeth Taylor's passion, and all the money in Hollywood could not. And for that alone, she must be honored.Fantastic work."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I enjoy historical fiction not only for the sheer pleasure of reading, but also for the acquisition of knowledge. I am happy to say that all of Margaret George's books succeed on both levels. Reading a book in this genre always spurs me to further reading on the period, and it's always disappointing to find that an author has played fast and loose with historical facts to write a good story. George stays well within acceptable guidelines when creating her story and still manages to write fascinating material.'The Memoirs of Cleopatra' did read a little more like a romance novel than George's other books, although it's hard to blame her - Cleopatra is a bit more romantic a subject than Henry VIII. And while I did find that I began to be suspicious of the sympathetic treatment 'Memoirs' gave its subject, I don't believe that is a shortcoming, but rather an inevitability of a good biographer identifying with her subject.I disagree with other reviewers that the book was too long; while Cleopatra's life was short, it was thick with events too important to leave out of her life story. On the whole I found the book entertaining and educational; what more can you ask for?"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I am a prolific reader, at about 50 or so books a year and accurate historical fiction is my biggest passion. This book is one of the best researched, best written novels I have ever had the pleasure to read. I hated for it to end, especially knowing how it had to end.I laughed with Cleopatra, I cried with her, I fell in love with Marc Antony, and I hated Octavian. Ms George is a writer of exquisite talent. She brings to life an epic time period, major historical events, and bigger than life characters realistically, beliveably and seamlessly.I would recommend this book, and I am looking forward to reading her other works."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have to congratulate myself and everyone else who finally, finally made it to the end of this monster. I tried 3 times before and met with failure, so the fourth time is the charm. Don't get me wrong: I LOVE the Cleopatra legend! What's not to love---passion, intrigue, politics, betrayal, war, power, wealth, lust..... Cleopatra's real life is the original soap-opera! It's obvious in the first few pages that Ms. George loves the subject as much, if not more, than I do. Perhaps too much, for she bombards us with a preponderance of details, more details, and still more details. She even gives us details of details. The problem is, with so much minute description in every scene, the vision is lost. The mind wanders, loses its grip on the message; ultimately the picture Ms. George's multitude of words attempt to create becomes less distinct under the sheer weight of information.Now, I have to ask, who, speaking in first person, relates such lengthy, indepth description? The whole premise of the novel is that we're supposed to be reading Cleopatra's own words, right? So why would Cleo feel it necessary to give us a 1,000 page treatise on Egyptian and Roman history, social customs, manners, etc? The answer is, she wouldn't. She would assume that we already knew these things. So from the start, all credibility is lost in this gargantuan novel; never for a page was I able to imagine that I was actually reading the words of Cleopatra.Aside from the endless descriptions of every flower, banquet, jewel, and wig; I had a serious problem with Ms. George's interpretation of Cleopatra herself. The opening chapters deal with Cleo's childhood, which are painfully written from the perspective of an adult---but not, alas, an adult looking back and remembering. No, instead we're supposed to believe that a six-year-old girl would walk around acting, speaking, and thinking like a 32-year-old. Or that a 12 year old girl would have all the emotional developement of a fully mature woman. I quickly began to feel as if I were no longer reading about the legendary queen, but Ms. George herself, dressed over in Egyptian drag. This feeling only strengthened as I made it further into the story; and I frequently found myself stopping and asking \\"Would Cleopatra really say that? Would she really think that way?\\"The answer is a painful, NO. But a middle-aged British woman with 21st Century sensibilities would. And there lies the real failure of this novel. Ms. George never fully gets out of her own skin, or her own time, to bring our beloved heroine back to life."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I've done slight research on Cleopatra in the past so I'm easiy disappointed when she seems wrongly or sloppily portrayed in books or movies. If there's any author out there who is perfect for writing Cleopatra's biography (voiced as an autobiography) it's Margaret George. The story is beautifully and gracefully woven together from the first page and once I started I did not want to put it down. Of course I had to, many times, since the book is over 900 pages long, but that just made it better because there was more too read - I didn't want it to end. George pays immense attention to detail to give the reader a real view not only of who Cleopatra was, but what the culture and time period and location she lived in were really like. George also does an brilliant job of portraying Cleopatra as a real, albeit incredible, person that the reader attaches to throughout the book. I enjoyed the book all the way through and I recommend it to anyone, whether they know the story of Cleopatra or not, whether they like histories or romances or instructional pamphlets, they will love this book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"My husband had this book on his Amazon.com wishlist and his sister decided to purchase it for him at Christmas. Due to his own workload (a budding writer is always under a heavy workload), I picked it up to take a peak. What can I say.. I was rivetted.This is NOT my normal selection of book, in fact Mary Queen of Scots has been sitting dormant on our shelves for months, having purchased it from a throw out library sale for 50cents. But Margaret George managed to bring her characters - historys characters - and the Roman empire to life for me.A perfect blend of historical information and interesting interpretations which had me seeking every available opportunity to read. I ended up reading the book within a week - which isn't easy with a 2 and 1 year old.So enthused was I that I purchased two other books pertaining to Caeser, just to know more, by Colleen McCullough. Her books I find to be left seriously wanting after the brilliance of Margaret George, but unless Ms George plans on writing a book dedicated to Caeser (Marcus Antonius would be great too..) it's all I have at hand.In closing, one of the best books I've ever read. It opened my eyes to a part of history that before had no interest to me."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I was excited to read about Cleopatra from the author of such a wonderful historical novel as &quot;Autobiography of Henry VIII&quot;. I was also glad that she reverted to using the first person narrative after the less successful re-telling of the story of Mary, Queen of Scotts. I have to say that I enjoyed &quot;The Memoirs of Cleopatra&quot;, but it still fell short of my expectations.The biggest problem I had when reading this book is to tune out &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; series of books by Colleen McCullough. After reading the series, I could only look at the history of Ancient Rome through McCullough's eyes and any departure from her story-telling did not sit well with me, even though Margaret George could have been more accurate with her description.The first disparity was the identity of Cleopatra's mother. In &quot;Memoirs of Cleopatra&quot;, she is described as Ptolemy VII's half-sister. In &quot;Fortune's Favorites&quot; and &quot;Caesar's Women&quot; by Colleen McCullough, she is described as a daughter of King Mithradates of Pontus. This little detail is probably insignificant but McCullough's version makes Cleopatra's connection to Rome's enemies poignant. Also, McCullough describes an affair between Caesar and Mithradates Nysa, who is in her version Cleopatra's mother's sister or Cleopatra's aunt. It would have been an interesting connection to explore if Margaret George decided to follow this version of Cleopatra's story as well. Although she did not explore any of these possibilities, I kept thinking about all of these connections and that hindered my enjoyment of the novel.The most interesting paradox between the two treatments of Cleopatra's story is the character of Caesar. McCullough devotes all of her books in the series so far to him and he comes out to be a completely different person than Margaret George makes him out to be in &quot;The Memoirs of Cleopatra&quot;. I have to agree with George's depiction of Caesar. He is shown as an almost unfalliable person that he undoubtly was (almost being the imperitive word here since McCullough makes him god on earth). However, by this time, I have already bought into McCullough's legend of Caesar so it was a bit disappointing to read about this human version.Other characters that appear in both places confused me. I liked Marc Antony in George's version better because he appeared as more complex individual than in McCullough's version. In her books, he is just a beast in human clothing. Octavian is shown with more potential for later brilliance in McCullough's version, so that is why I like him better in her novles. George makes his emergence unexpected although she writes from Cleopatra's point of view and that might be how she perceived him. Fulvia is too one-dementional in George's version -- she's just some shameless hussy who can't live without a man by her side. I think Fulvia was too unique and interesting (after all she captured the imaginations of Claudius, Curio, and Antony -- very different and strong individuals) for her time to have so little said about her. But again Cleopatra's perception of her might have been different.The characters that appear only in George's version are extremely well realized. Olympus and Mardian were fascinating and the author really let us get to know them. Ptolemy Caesar appears as such a wonderful and brilliant boy that his fate is truly tragic. The Kandake was also an unusual strong femal role-model that is hardly, if ever, heard of in the story of Cleopatra.Cleopatra herself is a wonderful character. George did a wonderful job getting inside her psyche. She was certainly brilliant and a good politian who, alas, followed her heart more often than her reason. I like the way George makes a distinction between Cleopatra's love for Caesar and her love for Antony. The best scene in the whole book is the plan and description of Cleopatra's death. It is amazing that the author can make the readers feel triumphant that this woman is killing herself.The biggest problems with this novel is that it is too long and there are inconsistancies in the description. Cleopatra's stay in Rome is hard to reconcile with history because of so many inconsistancies. For example, how could she cross the pomerium into the city of Rome if no annoited ruler can do that? The length is really felt here because some key moments in time are summarized while superfluous details are elaborated to the point of boredom.All in all, this is a great epic on Cleopatra's life."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have always been fascinated with Cleopatra, and when I was 13, I picked up this book and thought, I don't think I can get through this. Once I started reading, however, I began to think differently. This book keeps you on the egde, and puts you right there in ancient Alexandria. The book is written from the viewpoint of Cleopatra, whose voice is so rarely heard. She is one of the most discriminated women in history. Many think of her as a seductress that stole away married men from their true wives. This book shows a more human side to Cleopatra- a real person, with feelings and emotions. We go through her famous life, and on to her tragic death. People who think they know all about Cleopatra should read this book. They will find out so much more about her and her life. After reading this book, I searched for others, but none measured up. The writing quality Ms. George displays is amazing. When reading the detailed descriptions, you feel like you are right there. I loved this book, and you will too. If you love stories with strong female characters this book is for you. Cleopatra Ptolemy VII is my idol, and this book is a fitting tribute."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"A biographical novel re-creating the entire life of an enigmatic, yet colourful, ambitious, conniving and flamboyant character such as Cleopatra embellished and fleshed out with fictional anecdotes and details to bring an enormous cast of characters to life cannot help but be long in the telling. The problem is compounded, of course, when the cast includes a list of players such as Julius Caesar, Marc Antony, Octavian and Herod, King of Judea, each of whom is larger than life and worthy of a biography in their own right. Now, any lover of books knows that long need not of necessity be tedious but, frankly, even George's first-rate story telling abilities were simply not consistent enough or compelling enough to render this novel enjoyable for its excessive 1000 page length.Oh, it had its exciting moments, to be sure - the high speed running sea battle with the Mediterranean pirates off the coast of Sicily; the final epic confrontation with Octavian at Actium; Cleopatra's heart-rending grief and the conflicting surge of her searing anger and dismay at the moment of Caesar's assassination; the crystal clear depiction of her character as a strong-willed, self-centered woman who was willing to risk all to further her ambitions and to protect the birthright of her son - but these moments were separated by intervals that were so wide as to render the book a tedious, difficult novel to complete with only sporadic rewards for those who persevered.On the plus side, George injected her story with plenty of entertaining and informative historical aside raising questions that would certainly serve as fodder for interesting, thought-provoking discussion on a wide variety of topics germane even to this very day. Two examples in particular stood out for me.This excerpt on the religious beliefs of the Egyptians of the day:\\"Together Osiris, Isis, and Horus live as the holy family, a blessed three. The birth-chapel commemorated the miraculous birth of the child. Across the water from Philae, on the neighboring island of Biggeh, part of Osiris lay buried, and every ten days a golden statue of Isis was ferried over in a sacred barque to visit her divine spouse.\\",would probably cause a modern Christian to pause, scratch his head and muse at the common appearance of the concept of Trinity.As Cleopatra waited for news of Antony's exploits in Parthia, she thought:\\"The Queen in me yearned for his victory, and prayed for that; the wife feared he would not return alive, and begged Isis only for his life. I was both the Spartan wife, saying, 'Return with your shield or on it,' and the Egyptian wife saying, 'Only return - even without the shield.'\\"It occurred to me to wonder what the modern spouse says about their partner who has chosen a career in the military. Are they thinking in terms of honour, valour, career, survival, service to their country??\\"The Memoirs of Cleopatra\\" was a rewarding, informative and interesting novel but an intimidating, time-consuming, slog of a read that took will-power and dedication to complete. Recommended for those that enjoy ancient history, but only just!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This is THE book to read about Cleopatra.Meticulously researched for decades this masterpiece will transport you to Egypt with Queen Cleopatra and you will believe you are reading her private memoirs.I've read it twice.Thank you Ms George."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"\\"Memoirs of Cleopatra\\", by Margaret George, was by far one of the best books I have ever read, and I love books. I was constantly in emotional turmoil along with the character as she made her way through life. George has a great gift for making situations seem real. I felt as if I were actually in the room with Cleopatra as she held meetings, walked the palace, and best of all, had her intimate moments with the two great loves of her life, Ceasar and Marc Antony. I could hardly put the book down as I was enthralled by every detail. I even cried at the inevitable ending (I rarely cry from books), which I knew was coming and almomst dreaded it knowing the book would soon thereafter come to an end.George really researched her facts well and made them seem as if everything actually happened, even the unknown gaps in Cleopatra's life. I learned a great deal and would never have learned so much from reading a textbook, simply because I would have fallen asleep. With this, I was constantly enthralled and was thinking about it even at work. I wanted to continually read it until I could read no more!One note, I have read her other two books when I was younger, and, after reading this book at an older age, I feel as if these books would be best suited for older teens and up. The content is very saturated with facts and details that a younger reading may become lost with, let alone the love scenes may be a bit too much for young teens.Overall, wonderful book by a wonderful author! I am currently re-reading \\"Henry VIII\\" and it is amazing!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This 900+ page masterpiece is not for the faint of heart -- you'll spend hours every day poring through the story. It gets exhaustive at times, but this is in accordance with the action, and absolutely heartbreaking at others. I would recommend it to any history buff, and anyone who wants to learn more about the mysterious Cleopatra."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I was totally lost in this book- Margaret George transforms your world and takes you into Cleopatra's in the paradise of Alexandria. You feel what she feels, and truly care about the characters. It's one of the only books that has made me cry, and it's the best I've ever read. Even though it's long, The book goes fast- I read it and I'm only fourteen. It had me utterly fascinated, and I learned so much! SO GO READ IT, NOW!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I must say, with all honesty and after great contemplation and analysis, that this is, in my opinion, the finest novel to have ever graced this earth.Though extremely long, this \\"autobiography\\" has the reader's attention from its melancholy opening, to its gripping and heart-wrenching finish. This book recounts the much too short but very eventful life of Cleopatra VII, the last Macedonian queen of Egypt, the last of a long line ruling over the free peoples of Egypt. This book paints a portrait of the dazzling queen, and depicts her not as the ambitous and greedy vixen her enemies would have liked us to think she was, but rather as a moral and agreeable character: kind, clever, witty, brilliant at times, affectionate, and reasonable. Everything the modern world knows about the famous queen was written by her enemies. There are no accounts that exist today pleading her case, and so Margaret George has made one, one as accurate as anything Plutarch wrote.In the beginning of the book which is divided into ten \\"scrolls\\" plus another at the end, Cleopatra is a clever and ambitious young princess, the apple of her father's eye, who develops a love of her country, Egypt, that no other Ptolemy possessed. She goes to great lengths to learn Egyptian, something no other Ptolemy did, and visit the ancient sites of Egypt. Meeting her childhood friends, later to be her trusted physician Olympos, and her closest friend, the euneuch Mardian, at the age of seven, she develops a thirst to free her country from Roman debt and looming threat.The book then speeds up, as Cleopatra, after a long war against her brother, is placed on the throne with the help of Julius Caesar, who has come to Alexandria to make peace between the siblings, and becomes the young queen's lover, and later husband. The story unfolds: Cleopatra's journey to Rome, the assasination of Caesar, her love affair with Marcus Antonius, her trip to Meroe, the wonderful prosperity she creates for her country, the heartbreak she faces, the battles she endures against her enemy the endlessly conniving and cruel Octavian, and her defeat at Actium.A beautiful picture of Alexandria, and Rome is painted in this novel, and what it must have been like to live there. The reader can see the umbrella pines of Rome swaying in the wind and feel the light rain on their faces of a Roman spring, and smell the Mediterranean as they stand in the Temple of Isis on Pharos overlooking the dazzling sea, and the city that rose from nothing to make all of Rome and the Western World tremble thanks to one resourceful, ambitious, and wonderful woman.Cleopatra's children are wonderful and loving, as clever maybe as she, and their story is perhaps as tragic as hers., all the more meaningful their tale is that the already learned reader knows that they are to be executed in the desert, or dragged away in chains to the streets of Rome.Then finally, the last scene in the life of the great queen unfolds: her death. Cleopatra begs Octavian who has taken everything from her: her city, her country, her children, her pride, to let her visit the mausoleum of Antony, who has killed himself. Octavian lets her do this, and with her most trusted friends and service she enjoys a sumptous meal, performs the funerary rituals for Antony, and writes a last letter to Octavian, before taking her own life using an Egyptian asp, a story everyone knows. George tells it in such a tragic but wonderful way, one that leaves the reader dazed and sad, yet full of hope and admiration for such an admirable and misunderstood figure in history.This book is beautiful. Its exciting, joyful, and horribly sad all at once. I had never respected Cleopatra as a historical figure, and had thought her overdone and overrated. But this magnificent tale of love, hate, passion, power, ambition, murder, greed, and splendor brings the Queen herself back to life...her wit and charm...her intelligence, and the everlasting lure of Cleopatra VII."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I haven't quite finished it yet but as of so far, it is excellent. I have two hundred pages left and find it hard to get to bed sometimes due to reading this book. It is a bit lengthy but it has to be to completely give you the feel of everything that has happened to Cleopatra, daughter of Isis. Don't be frightened by the number of pages, each page is wonderful.I recommend this to anyone who is interested in Cleopatra. I've researched the events and Magaret George hits it on the mark but adding Cleopatra's &quot;feelings&quot; was ingenious! Very romantic and very powerfully written. It will make you dream of Egypt!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have always been a lover of ancient egyptian history and this book helped me transport myself to the time when Cleopatra was Queen. Wonderfully written. The way we see life through Cleopatra's eyes is captivating and very well done. The way the scenes are written, it allows the reader to read and relive the times in Alexandria, Rome and many other cities in the middle east. A great historical novel."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed reading this novel, as Margaret George did a marvelous job of describing the events and people who surrounded Cleopatra. It is a slow, but an excellent scene-setter for the characters involved. The real problem I have is with Cleopatra herself. She is shown as if she had been plucked from the streets of America and transported to that time. She is extremely kind, walks out on a gladitorial display because the violence shocks her, shows regret or guilt in having a pretender to the throne executed, and wishes to spare virtually all those who threatened her rule. She is kind to a fault, disaproves of slavery (which was extremely common and a fully accepted practice at the time), and is shown to be far wiser at the age of 24 than Julius Caesar or the other figures around her. In essence, she is designed to be a fully sympathetic figure for modern readers to identify with. I've never understood or enjoyed that. If you are going to write about an ancient woman or man, show me an ancient mindset and thought process (there are many sources that would help a writer do research into that). Don't show me a modern person walking around in ancient clothes. To me, that is boring and quite predictable. That is why she didn't get four stars. However, her ability to set the scenes around Cleopatra were very interesting and eminently readable. I enjoyed reading it, but would have truly loved reading about the fascinating life of a more hardened and realistic queen."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I really felt to be a part of history when I read this book and strongly encourage others to pick it up. It looks daunting, but you will get engrossed and lose track of time and before you know it, you will have read the entire book!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"While the story of Cleopatra has largely been reduced to a m&eacute;lange of titillating myths and Shakespearean references, Margaret George has managed to conjure a sweeping portrait of the Greco-Egyptian queen. Her weighty novel is filled with a large cast of characters outside the usual suspects and a descriptive language that deftly brings to life the sights and smells of the classical Mediterranean world that Cleopatra called home. Perhaps the quality that \\"The Memoirs of Cleopatra\\" lacks is the single most important in an historical novel - authenticity.It's been suggested that a writer should take care not to use language that is traced etymologically to a time period occurring after that in which the story takes place. The title of \\"Memoirs\\" itself stands as example, but this will probably annoy only the most picky readers. There are other instances that come up, though, that may make even a casual reader of history scratch his head: when Cleopatra asks Antony for the date of the Roman festival of Lupercalia, Antony replies, \\"The fifteenth day of February. Why, the month is named after the whipping strips!\\" George neatly detracts from the peculiarity of such a comment from someone whom we are to believe is speaking Latin by letting Cleopatra note to herself that it's as if Antony is \\"just realizing it.\\" Many more examples like this pepper the narrative, and it becomes apparent that George is a studied individual who is doing her best to explain interesting historical tidbits by inserting them into her characters' dialogue. While this may be appreciated by some readers, to others it could be a hindrance in their attempt to transport themselves as wholly as possible into Cleopatra's environment.From a publisher's perspective, it's easy to see why an historical novelist would wish to take the time to throw in brief, albeit encyclopedia-like, explanations for an unfamiliar cultural practice, or a translation of a foreign word. This makes the book more accessible to the modern, half-hearted reader, who doesn't want to have to work too hard at the end of a long day to fully understand the world in which the written characters live. George's writing style is the stuff bestsellers are made of; and her novels are, indeed, bestsellers. But an avid lover of quality literature in general, and historical fiction in particular, can't help but wish George had a little more faith in her readers' grasp of context. In many cases, the way a character presents an idea that is completely foreign to modern culture can be fully understood from context alone. This calls to mind the opening sentences of Mary Renault's novel of ancient Greece, \\"The Last of the Wine.\\" It begins:\\"When I was a young boy, if I was sick or in trouble, or had been beaten at school, I used to remember that on the day I was born my father had wanted to kill me. You will say there is nothing out of the way in this. Yet I daresay it is less common than you might suppose; for as a rule, when a father decides to expose an infant, it is done and there the matter ends.\\"With such narrative skill, not only does Renault make it sound like we, the reader, are her narrator's contemporary, but she gently educates those readers who might not have a close familiarity with ancient Greek practices. George's Cleopatra comes dangerously close at times to sounding like a history professor, which renders her character almost unbelievable as an individual whose only experience of the world was the one in which she lived. After all, what autobiographer expects that she'll have to explain in scrupulous detail her culture's customs to iPhone wielding soccer moms who won't be born for another 2000+ years?Of course, it's entirely possible that it's not George's condescension that prevents her from achieving a masterpiece with \\"Memoirs,\\" but a lack of that rare quality of storytelling genius that creates such unforgettable historical tours-de-force like \\"Gone with the Wind,\\" \\"Cold Mountain,\\" and the above referenced \\"The Last of the Wine.\\" There is no question that George is a competent and prolific writer. Her story of Cleopatra is highly enjoyable and seems to be thoroughly researched. It's apparent that she takes her subject matter seriously and idolizes her heroine. Such reverence can certainly translate to an engaging novel, but do not look here for a character you can love as though you know her. Though at times her emotions, particularly her pain, are nearly palpable, George's Cleopatra remains the untouchable queen she is, committed to the annals of history, a relic to be marveled at and enchanted by, but not to be realized as what she was: a human being."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This 960 page book is truly outstanding. I have loved Cleopatra from the first time I read about her in grade school. This book gives you tons of visual images through the words of the author and a list of fact-checking sources in the back of the book (something very important to me).It is heart-breaking at times and even though most people know the way she died, it's still with dread that you turn those last few pages. But it's hard not to be in awe of Margaret for doing such a fantastic job. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book is beyond words. The story is meticulously researched, clearly, and the end result is a book which I have now read three times, and am unable to put down. Yes, it is long, but it is the attention to detail in this book which makes you feel like you are actually there yourself, knowing the characters personally. I was captivated by this story, and I'd recommend it to any Cleopatra/Egypt/Rome fans. Excellent work."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I'm a sucker for Cleopatra stories and have read many fictional accounts as well as biographies, of the last Pharoh of Egypt.Margaret George does an unsusally good job of portraying Cleopatra believably. Her style is both entertaining and sympathetic. George does a wonderful job of making Cleoptra's life exciting without giving in to the unfortunate tendecy among writers to make her lurid and licentious.Give it a read.

However, George brings her and the times alive in this book. This book is a fantastic escape to an ancient time. It is a must read for nearly anyone.

The historical content was made interesting enough for a schoolgoer to enjoy. I defy any person that has read this book not to love it. It shows her to be an intelligent, passionate woman and a loving mother. It tells her side of history as it happens and it makes you want to find out more.

It gives you a sense of emptiness when you're not reading it. It made me realize what it's like to lose someone you love. When Caesar was murdured, I cried.

It is so descriptive I did feel transported, and it makes me wish i could travel to that place in time.

This is definately one of the best books I have read and I thank Margaret George for writing it."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"History books barely mention Cleopatra. They only say things like, &quot; Until Caesar met the bewitching Cleopatra.&quot; They make no mention of her extraordinary life the joy and the pain that she went through, how regal that she truly was. Her love for her kingdom and her &quot;white&quot; city of Alexandria, was almost like a mothers love for a child. She always put her country first, even before the love of Caesar and Marc Antony. Margaret George is an extraordinary author. My applause to you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I found George's &quot;Memoirs of Cleopatra&quot; to be a spectacular work and, without question, the work against which all other attempts to fictionalize the Queen's life must be judged. Quite obviously, George has done a stupendous amount of research and, being an Egyptologist, I can vouch for the accuracy of her portrayal of Egypt during the tumultuous time of transition from Ptolemaic to Roman rule. As for the fictional elements, George handles what could be an intimidating task with the grace and insight of a master story-teller. For example, one never has the impression that the rightly mysterious figure of Cleopatra is being exploited for the sake of an entertaining narrative. The plot simmers and boils and stews and thickens--and satisfies at every turn. This is a must for fans of historical fiction, Egyptology,great women of history, or good old fashioned legend. The respect that one must give an ancient woman of Cleopatra's guile, extraordinary intelligence, and ability to survive and thrive in a cutthroat time is fostered by this book. Bravo, Ms. George. Five Big(Shooting!) Stars."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"The beginning of the book failed to capture my attention, but after I got through the first few pages, I adored it. It extremely interesting to hear about Cleopatra's affairs with men whom history has immortalized. (However, I was a little bit anxious to see Caesar die and discover how she got involved with Marc Antony.) Also, I was only familiar with accounts that referred to her as unattractive and homely, so this book's presentation of her was quite a surprise. Though the book tends to get a little fuzzy at times, it is full of color and life. George manages to make all the places alive again, even if her characters get somewhat flat. The detail that she goes into is at times surreal, the onyx floors, gem encrusted thrones, the jewelry, the doors with gold inlays, etc. Though the book is quite long (1,000 or so pages) it is most certainly worth your time."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"&quot;The Memoirs of Cleopatra&quot; brought the woman behind the legend to life for me. The only shame is knowing how the story has to end and dreading the last word written, because it means having to wait for the next Margaret George novel."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"All I can say is Margaret George has a wonderful flair for detail. She takes you back in time and lets you live everything with her. Some may say it was a long book and close to 1,000 pages it is long - but any shorter would have left out all the wonderful details that make the book what it is. The stage was set, everyone was in their place and Ms. George suddenly said ACTION! And there you are, part of Queen Cleopatra's court. This book made me feel as though I was in Cleopatra's world. She was an incredible woman, sometimes misunderstood, very passionate, loyal, caring, and at times vicious but for someone so young, she was intelligent beyond her years. This is the kind of political candidate we could use today and at least she admitted to her affairs, and what affairs they were! You'll fall in love with Caesar and Mark Antony as well, and wish you could have known them all. A great book, a great story and a great author! Bravo!!!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I loved the book. I loved the details. I feilt that I was living in Alexandria and Rome 2000 years ago.

Way too long and drawn out. It could have been done in 5-6 hundred pages like Helen of Troy (which I also read and enjoyed very much). I love the history behind it. I would recommend the book with the advice to skim through ages 650 to about 850 or so. Antony's final battle is just too detailed."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have enjoyed most of this author's other work, but I think she lost a great opportunity to create a childhood for Cleopatra that reflected the tumultuous times. I also think creativity was sacrificed in favor of creating a heroine with the usual impossible combination of a brilliant mind, a beautiful face and body, and stunning strength of spirit. In fact, Cleopatra made many political mistakes in her career and contemporary sources did not note her for her beauty, though the author certainly implies it.Historical facts can be interpreted many ways, but ignoring historical facts annoys me as a reader. One example that struck me early on was Cleopatra saying she was of pure Macedonian ancestry, although it is easy to learn one of her ancestors was Mithridates II of Pontus. It is a very small thing, but it still bothers me.I also would've found the book more interesting if it hadn't felt like a very long rehash of the usual view of Cleopatra's relationships with Caesar and Mark Antony. At least I didn't buy it in hard copy."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This novel is a compelling work of art and history. Ms. George has clearly done her research and fills in the blanks beautifully. Although this book is based on history, there is never a dull moment from start to finish."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"George really does a wonderful job inticing the reader down the rabbit hole into the time of Caeser, Antony and of course Cleopatra."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"i can't believe no has reviewed this book yet! I loved this book. It was so refreshing to read a book about Cleopatra that didn't protray her as a scheming, power hungry tyrant. This books follows her life from when she was very young through to her death. The story is told through Cleopatra's own eyes and we see the struggles she faced and the motivation behind her most famous deeds. In this novel she is a adventurous young girl obsessed with Alexander the Great who grows into a Powerful and caring mother and wife. We share her thoughts and feelings as she faced the spiteful roman populace who saw her as nothing more than Caesars whore. We feel her pain at Caesars passing. We are witness to her plight to have her son recognized as Caesars true heir. We are swept away in the love she develops for Antony. We grieve with her and understand her in the final moments of her life.This novel is a true treasure. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book was a great find. I love reading fiction set in ancient Egypt, and Ms. George does a very admirable job. Everything is well researched, and documented in the back of the book. Over 900 pages might seem a lot, but it isn't. I loved the daily life details that were gone into, it COULD have been shorter by deleting them, but the book was so much richer for them.Memoirs political manuvering, intrigue, romance, war, everthing anyone could want in a novel. I didn't enjoy all the politics and war details, but that is just a personal opinion and they were easy enough to skip over.I highly reccommend this book to anyone, even if they have no idea of the history of the times or characters. Memoirs works as a stand alone work of fiction as well as a historical novel with real people and events."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"When I first received the book I was overwhelmed by the 900 hundred something pages, then I began to read the book and I was NOT disappointed. No details were over-exaggerated, scenes were described with beauty and precision, many of them bringing me to tears.I had once thought of Cleopatra as a lustful, powerseeking woman but this book proved me wrong. George leads us into the mind of Cleopatra, a loving, strong, caring Queen, mother and wife. I just could not put the book down so many scenes left me hanging and wanting more. I truly recommend this book at all ancient Egypt fans and historical fiction readers."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This was the first Margaret George novel I read. I loved it. It held me spellbound from the first page, and I had no trouble reading the whole book, and I wished there was more.I think that George wins big with the subject matter. Cleopatra, as I found out (I had little to no info about her before I started the novel - I hadn't even seen the move \\"Anthony and Cleopatra\\"), was a smart, beautiful, and fair ruler. She was obviously drawn to very powerful men, but interestingly they seem weak and flawed compared to her. Anyway, what makes the story so compelling is that it is about a very strong and interesting woman ruler from history, and George tells her story with respect and reverence."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.First, the author's research of the time and culture in the book is phenomenal; the book is rich with historic detail.Second, the story, portrayed by everyone from Shakespear, ancient Romans and modern authors, is new, exciting and alive through Cleopatra's eyes. Although it is more than 900 pages, it never fails to capture the excitement of the struggle between Rome and Egypt, the west and the ancient world of the east, and the political geniuses who battle for expansion and control of their world.Finally, the character portrayals are marvelous. Cleopatra is beautifully and sympathetically drawn - her pride, strength and scheming even when confronted with hopeless situations, her shrewd wisdom as a politician, her love of Egypt, her children and her friends, her turbulent and passionate love affairs with Caesar and Marc Antony, and finally, her pride and courage in her final act are spectacular, making her admirable, almost larger than life, even while her flaws are apparent. Caesar is likewise shown as a brilliant general, a larger than life man and a great lover, yet his vulnerabilities are shown, too, especially his weaknesses and misjudgments as a politician. His love affair with Cleopatra is touching and moving. Marc Antony is well drawn - he is shown as being honorable, admirable, a wonderful father and lover, but with a tragic flaw - he is a weak man who falls under the control of whoever is around him who is stronger - including Octavian and Cleopatra.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone. It is a book to be read and reread."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"As I remarked several times in the time it took to read Memoirs of Cleopatra, \\"I'm really enjoying the book, but lugging it around is starting to be a bitch.\\" At well over 900 pages, this is a much longer novelized biography than, say, Colin Falconer's \\"When We Were Gods,\\" so if you're not really, reeeeaaalllyy interested in Cleopatra, Caesar, and Antony, you might want to skip this one.If you are interested, however, I don't see how you could do much better than this book. From the death of her mother as a young child to her own death 30 years later, \\"Memoirs\\" recounts Cleopatra's struggles to hold onto the crown of an independent Egypt. These struggles pit her against everyone from her own siblings to the might of the Roman Empire, which she carries on a tortured love/hate relationship with in the form of her affairs with Caesar and Antony and her mutual hatred with Augustus Caesar (Octavian). Cleopatra, through her son by Caesar, has a claim on Rome, yet she wants nothing more than to free the Eastern world from its influence. This conflict provides much of the plot of the second half of the book, culminating in Cleopatra and Antony's disastrous defeat at Actium and their subsequent double suicide.The book is filled with captivating secondary characters, most of them historical: Cleopatra's four children, her physician, her servants, various political figures in Rome, King Herod of Judea. It's these characters that give the book its life apart from the well-known story of Cleopatra, and I was impressed by the care George has shown in not allowing her story to become sensational or pitiful.Honestly, as heavy as the book was, I thought it was worth every page."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George's talent really shines through this book. I was a first time reader about Cleopatra, and I was not disappointed with my selection of this book. Cleopatra's story is so beautifully written by George that the reader can almost see Cleopatra and the time, and culture that she lived in. In addition to this, the book is well researched. George even informs the reader about what parts of the story are actually true, and what parts are not true. She also explains how the unfavorable myths about Cleopatra came to be. George even explains what happened to Cleopatra's children after her death. Do not pay any attention to any of those movies that are out. They are wrong and are nothing compared to George's research and wonderful writing. I got up and moved around during those movies, but I couldn't tear my self away from this book!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George's Cleopatra is a very real person - flawed, egotistical sometimes, brilliant at others, loveable, and self-deceiving, too. This book is certainly the epitome of the Historical Fiction genre. It is light reading, the narrative easy follow, and you never want to put it down. Most importantly, the main characters defy stereotypes, which makes for worthwhile reading, indeed.The time and place is richly described... my desire to visit the Greece and Rome (I have been to Egypt) is heightened. I particularly appreciated some of the details concerning the polemics of the gods / goddesses as they moved from Egypt to Greece to Rome, and how the author characterized characters by their patron gods / goddesses.This is great reading from an entertainment standpoint, which also (painlessly) provides a great history lesson and something to think about afterward."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"When I saw this book on the shelves of my school library I was debating on whether should read it. (It was after all 964 pages). I had of course heard of Queen Cleopatra but I never really knew about her life and was curious to learn about it. And so I checked out the book and began to read. From the moment I finished the first page I was hooked. I was very surprised at the amount of research that the author had done to write this book. From the beginning to the end Memoirs of Cleopatra is an absolutely wonderful book that gives readers a glimpse into Queen Cleopatra's life."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"As the seventh Cleopatra of the Royal House of Ptolemy, Daughter of Isis and wife to both Julius Caesar and Marc Antony, Cleopatra is more than merely a woman, she is the essence of beauty, ambition and power.At nearly one thousand pages, Margaret George's novel, Memoirs of Cleopatra is more than merely a book, it is an epic journey straight to the heart of a woman shrouded in mystery. From the moment I opened the cover of this book, I was transported to the ancient city of Alexandria. I felt the heat of the Egyptian sun on my shoulders, I could smell the exotic fragrances drifting from the palace and I watched as Cleopatra's magnificent fleet glistened in the harbor. The book created the most amazing literary experience I have ever embarked upon. At a time in my life when I needed an escape from reality, The Memoirs of Cleopatra provided just that.The book offers a first person glimpse into one of the greatest stories ever told. Throughout the book, you are right beside Cleopatra as she battles to hold onto her empire. You feel her heartache as Caesar dies, and you feel proud when her son is born.We may never know the true story of Cleopatra. Many of the &quot;facts&quot; we now accept are merely rumors created by her enemies that have lived on throughout the centuries. Was she a seductress? Did she bathe in blood? How did she really die? Margaret George's meticulously researched book is considered a novel, but it offers a fresh look into the life of Cleopatra as it answers many questions.From the moment I turned the last page of Memoirs of Cleopatra, I have and will always be a devoted reader of Margaret George's work."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book was life changing. I've read it twice, despite it being almost 1000 pages. Don't let the thickness of the book discourage you, it was so great I cried when it was over. . Such an empowering book. Really captures the essence of the time. By far my favorite book. Great author, would recommend any book by her."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"At nearly 1000 pages, it tends to drag.The author clearly did a lot of research and she is determined to prevent Cleopatra in the most flattering possible way. And while the the real Cleopatra was undoubtedly the victim of unfair propaganda attacks by Augustus and others, and in real life she was clearly a strong, brave and highly accomplished woman, I find this version of Cleopatra to be just too... perfect.The woman presented here is some kind of idealized version of womanhood. Loving, kind, strong, supportive, independent and a good partner at the same time. Sweet and always well-meaning. More of a feminist caricature than a real person. This character has no flaws. And I find it very hard to believe that in real life, a girl who survived constant assassination attempts by her own family members, at a very young age, and who was forced to marry 2 of her brothers would be this well adjusted. I think the real Cleopatra would have had to be at least a little bit bloodthirsty to even survive in the environment she was born into, and that would also be more interesting.A good example of this is the authors insistence that Cleopatra's brother/husband Ptolemy died of natural causes and that Cleopatra was very upset by it. I just don't buy it. It seems far more likely that this potential rival was killed. That's what Cleopatra's family had been doing for hundreds of years, they married their brothers and sisters and killed them. Maybe there's no proof Ptolemy as murdered, but the way the author insists on assuming the best about Cleopatra gets a bit predictable. I find it hard to believe that after generations of that Cleopatra would suddenly be some kind of saint.All of which is not to say the book is terrible, but it drags."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I am writing this review in response to the one reviewer who was disgusted by the racist society which &quot;cannot acknowledge the beauty of an African queen.&quot; Cleopatra was of Greek descent. She did not have one drop of Egyptian blood. Therefore, I am sorry to disappoint those who believe that she was black in telling them that she was not. Interestingly, this is a fact which, incidentally, credits her amazing intelligence and saavy in being the first ruler of Egypt who could actually speak the language of the people. The Memoirs of Cleopatra is a wonderful read, and potential readers should not measure the book's worth by the miniseries."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"After having read Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles by Ms. George, I was excited to find The Memoirs of Cleopatra; I was not disappointed! I love a book with colorful detail, and The Memoirs of Cleopatra is simply bursting with it! I also enjoyed the first person narrative - Cleopatra came across as intelligent, strong, beautiful, and oh so human. From history class, I knew how the story would end and dreaded it, having become so involved in Cleopatra's life - I have to confess I had to dry my eyes and blow my nose before I could read the final pages. Don't be daunted by the book's 1000 plus pages - I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a truly well written historical novel."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I too am &quot;only 13&quot; but I would not like to praise the book. Sure the eloquence and knowlage of M. George is enough to make Isis breathe in awe, but it got to be a little too much. I felt like I was reading a textbook and the book seemed so impersonal. A little too much was put into this book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George has the amazing ability to get inside her subject's skin and become that person in a very convincing way. The life and personality of Cleopatra are electrifying and you will never feel as you make your way through this mighty tome that Cleopatra's voice is phony in any way. You think \\"This is the way Cleopatra would sound. This is the way Cleopatra would act.\\" But it's not just Cleopatra whose identity Ms. George absorbs and spins out for you. All of the characters act just the way you imagine they would act. Julius Caesar is masterpiece. Caesar was an enigma in some respects, and he's a man of contradictions in the book. You cringe when he falls down in an epileptic fit and you're terrified he's going to collapse at some inopportune moment. He can wax angry at one moment like the sun going under a cloud and quickly emerge from the black mood to one of contentment. His dark eyes are the mirror of his soul but Cleopatra was never totally sure of him as a lover or a political ally. I got so fond of Julius Caesar that I turned the pages slowly when I knew the Ides of March were going to come sooner or later and Caesar had to die. It's like closing your eyes in a scary movie. Octavius is beautifully created, too, he's handsome and blond, but he's not lovable. He will kill Cleopatra's and Caesar's son Caesarion much later. I won't begin to describe the portrayal of Marc Anthony, the boisterous young man with the black curls and the vulnerable heart, but he is a treat in store for you. You are going to be carried back to Rome and Alexandria and become a spectator of an incredible story. You'll feel as though you were right there on the scene as a witness. That's how good Margaret George is as an historical novelist. Don't miss \\"The Memoirs of Cleopatra!\\""},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Excellent book. Perfect paperbook for a plane trip or a beach vacation. Obviously well researched. Margarent George has a natural flair for bringing histoy to life. Every character in this novel is believable and sympathetic. While this is not a time period I have spent alot of time on, I found myself drawn into the culture and landscape. Definately not a waste of time."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This was a riveting book that takes you into the would-be mind of Cleopatra. The amount of detail and emotion that was put into the characters was what made the book hard to put down. I loved the way the character development progressed over the course of the book. There is a movie that goes with the book but it hardly does justice to the book. This is on of the best books that I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This novel is big in every sense except the one that matters. In her 964 pages, the author handles a broad and complex sweep of events with considerable technical skill. She is especially good on the great set-piece scenes: her depictions of the Battle of Actium and of the series of spectacular triumphs awarded to Julius Caesar, for example, are brought to us in the novelistic equivalent of living Technicolor.Since the novel is entitled The Memoirs of Cleopatra, events are necessarily filtered exclusively through the Egyptian Queen's own eyes, which is a shame, for Margaret George's Cleopatra seems to suffer from chronic psychological myopia. This has the unfortunate effect of fixing both events and personalities in a single dimension, so that they never come truly alive for us. And since Cleopatra's own musings rarely rise above the banal, we are given very little insight into the minds that shaped what is, after all, one of the major turning points of European history.The narrative is brisk and workmanlike, but marred by dialogue that is almost comically stilted. Both creak under a hefty burden of semi-digested research, which does little more than prove that the author has done her homework. (This we may already guess from the long and erudite bibliography that appears in the Author's Note). She would have served both her art and her readers better if she had learned a little less and woven what she did learn a little more deftly into the fabric of her story.If there's a good and satisfying novel buried here somewhere (and I'm sure there is), ruthless editing would have rescued it. As it stands, the best that can be said of it is that the reader who seeks an undemanding tale rich in romance, pathos and spectacle will not be disappointed. It would help, however, to have both a strong pair of wrists and plenty of time on one's hands."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"When the broad lines of a story are so well-known by almost everyone, and the fact that it ends tragically is equally well-known, it is truly a challenge to take that story and tell it so well that a reader is compelled to keep turning page after page nevertheless. Especially when there are 964 of those pages. With this novel, Margaret George shows she is definitely up to the challenge, and meets it with stunning success.She brings the age of the much-maligned last queen of Egypt to vivid life, sweeping us away to ancient Egypt, Rome, and parts beyond. We live through those years with Cleopatra, following her as she falls in love with the inscrutable Caesar and later the boisterous, sensual Antony, and as she worships her goddess Isis and adores her four children. All of the characters, from the very sympathetic Cleo, Caesar, and Antony, to the chilling Octavian, to lesser-known personages like the feminist Kandake of Meroe and Cleo's loving handmaidens, are made real to us, not just figures in a dusty history textbook. We are transported to their world, drawn with loads of descriptive detail and sensuality, and even a smattering of humor where we least expect it. &quot;Do you go into heat every time a Roman comes over the horizon?&quot; teases one of Cleopatra's close friends. Also adding drama is an abundance of mythological metaphor; these people were seen as gods in their own time, and the stories of the ancient deities play themselves out in the lives of the human characters again and again.In the end, of course, this is a tragedy. By the time the fall comes, the characters are old friends, and the reader is truly saddened by what happens to them. I was left with the fervent hope that there really is an afterlife somewhere, where Cleo, Caesar, and Antony are feasting together for all eternity. This is one of my favorite novels ever; it takes a little while to read it, but it is VERY worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I own the hardcover edition of this book and I could NOT put it down. I read it in 2 days! It is by far the most brilliantly told story of the great queen Cleopatra and the trials and tribulations she endured to hold onto her beloved Egypt. I definately recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Egyptian history. It does not matter if you are beginning your journey into the land of the Pharoahs or have already traveled through the Valley of the Kings, this is a book you MUST experience."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have always admired Cleopatra ,this is the most wonderful book i have ever read.

It feels as though I was a close confidante of the queen. Margaret George has written about a queen with real strength, intelligence, beauty, and love. The old story of Cleopatra was that she was nothing more than an evil temptress who would commit murder to get her way. I hope this book becomes the story people think of when they hear the name Cleopatra. Thank you, Ms. George, for giving the world a work of art and for giving the Queen of the Nile a chance to tell her tale."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This is the best book I've read. I went to Asia and had to bring an extra suitcase just to take Cleopatra with me. The gripping descriptions of George made me feel like I was THERE with Cleopatra from age 4 until her death.

M. George takes the time to depict the day/age and feelings of Cleopatra as if she had been there. The characters literally jumped off the pages and came alive with each paragraph. Provided the user is content with a percentage of fact (not 100%) and willing to be enthralled, this book is WELL worth it's 1000-page weight! This book is a fun way to learn a bit of history..not the entire truth of history, but just enough to make the book a convincing great read."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Cleopatra and her world come alive in the pages of this ambitious and highly entertaining novel. I did catch a few minor inaccuracies, e.g., Cleopatra is puzzled by Latin syntax because of the case declensions - when her native tongue was Greek, which has the exact same type of syntax! But aside from such minor flaws, the book is a resounding success. The author's depiction of the campaign which culminated in the battle of Actium was an especially inspired bit of storytelling, offering a much more plausible explanation for Cleopatra's seemingly inexplicable action during that battle than Plutarch or any of the other ancient sources do."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Being a voracious reader, especially on the subjects of Ancient Egypt and the Ancient Near East, I found The Memoirs of Cleopatra to be food for my unquenchable appetite, leaving me very satisfied but definitely looking for more from Margaret George. Ms. George is to be congratulated on creating such a masterpiece, no mean feat when the subject of the research is thousands of years old. Thank you, Ms George, for feeding my mind and imagination so well. Keep up the good work... you are reaching a grateful audience. I place The Memoirs of Cleopatra into the coveted position of being one of my top five favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I loved this book! It was fun to read, and I learned a great deal about the times and history surrounding the title character. Of course, I also learned much about Cleopatara, and those famous persons surrounding her.

The Memoirs of Cleopatra is a novel written like an autobiography. Again, as I say in the title, this book must have taken a long time to research. It is one of the only historical novels I have read that is also historically correct. The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory is one of my favorite's as well, but it is historically incorrect. A great book if you like historical novels, if you don't, I still recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This well-researched story about the last Egyptian queen is compelling and fascinating. The historical detail is amazing and the characters relatable and believable.

Not just for historical fiction fans, but anyone who loves a great story."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This is simply a marvelous book. I enjoy period fiction so when I found this book I couldn't resist even though it's length (at first glance) seemed off-putting. However, Ms.George's attention to detail (historical and otherwise) makes it one of those books you hate to finish. When I finished the book I felt like I lost a cherished friend. I recommend this book to any one interested in any period of Ancient Egypt or any fans of the Roman Legions of Caesar's time or any fan of love stories as that is what it ultimately is. It is long story but well worth the trip."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I read this book backwards, because I bought first the 3rd book instead of the first (in Mexico are 3 books), I started in the scroll 7, 8, 9, 10 and olimpo's scroll, and then I read from the first to the 6th, I think this is the way to read this book and to get hooked with Cleopatra."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I saw the ABC movie and It said that the movie was based on the book.

This book reads like a novel, being that it is written in Cleopatra's point of view as it is happening. You will not want to put down.

Ms. George is a writer of incredible ability. She brings the past into the present and makes you live these lives along with her. Each phrase is a delicious morsel that demads to be devoured quickly and yet savored at the same time. The details of people, places, clothing, and atmosphere are so compeling that the feel is that it was she who experienced it all and not just researched it. This is where her great talent reveals itself. Steeped in wonderous detail and historical data, it is written as compeling as any fiction tale needs to be. It inspires the reader to read other books on the subject and become and explorer of history and truth. I admire such dedication to perfection and hope other will see fit to delve into her works without being put off by the shear size of them. Only a great life warrants 900+ pages! My belief is to share these things with everyone - in that vein, I would be happy to pass my copy along to anyone who wishes it."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra is a very good book. Alas, you don't discover that until after you've slogged through 700 pages of really dull, often eye-rolling, bland prose. The last 250 pages, however, are powerful, gripping, and moving.Is it worth the 700 pages of tedium to get to the last 250? In the end, yes. Margaret George has given us an amazing depiction of Marc Antony - multi-faceted, both strong and weak, confident and cowardly. Fans of both Roman history and literature in general will find much to admire about George's ability to bring Antony to life. The Octavian seen here is intriguing, if one-dimensional; Octavian as he probably must have been to have gained absolute power, but a far cry from the benevolent Augustus we tend to picture. As events race to conclusion at Actium and afterwords, George will leave you gasping for breath, trying to keep up.The tedium until that point, however, is painful. The book is simply far too long for a first-person narrative. A periodic change in perspective is critical to avoid burn-out (see Shogun or War in Peace, which change viewpoints often). It does not help that Cleopatra's voice is not a strong one, lacking the charm of Robert Graves' Claudius or the strength of Mary Stewart's Merlin, and failing to arouse any strong feelings of either like or hate. George's Caesar seems flat, as does Cleopatra's instant infatuation with him. So many times I found myself longing to give up on the book. I'm glad I did not, but it was a tough struggle.An earlier reviewer suggested reading the end of the book first. Since we all know how the story ends anyway, that might not be such a bad idea."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This is one of those huge books that you feel obligated to finish reading only because you started it ! Most people who contemplate buying this book are already familiar with Cleopatra's story and are fascinated enough to want to read a book to paint a complete picture. For me this book ruined the strong, powerful woman that I'd imagined her to be. The way the author portrays her she appears to be a silly, whining woman completely devoid of common worldly sense, let alone wisdom, who had no control over the events in her life. You begin to wonder why Caesar would be mesmerized by such an ordinary woman. And then you promise yourself that you will shut the book if Cleopatra utters \\"Oh Isis\\" one more time !! Agreed that this is a piece of fiction..but does that disclaimer really forgive the author for forever destroying the image of a past queen? Face it..sometimes the truth is not as important as a reaffirmation that there have been powerful, self-assured, enigmatic people in history."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Long book but it kept me hooked from beginning to end.

When she becomes queen after her father's death, she must fight the regency council of her young brother and future husband.I have to admit my heart sank when I saw the size of this book. I don't have anything against long novels per se, but it is my sad experience that very few authors can maintain an interesting storyline for a normal-length book, much less a massive monster. Then there were a lot of small incongruities that contributed to a jarring effect, such as addressing Cleopatra's pharaoh-father as \\"King\\" and referring to her family as \\"the Ptolemies.\\" Everything I've read on ancient Egypt showed a vast cleft between the god-kings and those who served them. I managed to wade through the first hundred pages, but between the little inaccuracies and lack of a compelling storyline, I gave up."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Throughout my education, I had never learned much about Cleopatra. Sure, every halloween someone would dress up like her, and everyone knows how she died and was a lover to Antony, but beyond that there was not much else I knew. I found out a lot of information about her in this book - not only did I learn a lot, but I really enjoyed reading it for the most part. The only parts that were a little boring for me were the drawn-out battles and meetings. Although interested about the war that was waged, and interested in the tactics that were thought out (for both sides), this seemed a little too drawn out to me. However, other than this, I found this book enjoyable! George really allowed me step into Cleopatra's world and see a part of history - this books follows Cleopatra's life beginning with her childhood, up until her death. If you are a reader who does not mind reading a very large book, and are interested in Cleopatra, I'd recommend this book. However, if you don't have a lot of patience, hate reading long books, and don't have the tolerance for descriptive narration, this book isn't for you."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Just had to comment. The only reason I rated this so low, was not the book itself but the narration!!! The reader may have a 'sweet voice' but her mispronounciation! She read the name 'Pompey' as the town 'Pompei'. She mispronounced 'Lepidus'and even the title of 'tribune'. This just grated on my nerves! Shouldn't the narrator receive instructions and coaching if they are unfamiliar with certain names and words? The text is fine. Read it. Just don't listen to it!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"A tremendous journey that rewards all who enjoy the egyptian world and their order of Kings and Queens. The Memoirs of Cleopatra is an exciting tale of love, lost, sacrifice and much...much more. A warning to viewers, however, if you wish to keep \\"your\\" mystic version of the renown Queen, then you should stray away. But if you feel that you would rather enjoy the mortal and more realistic version of Cleopatra, then by all means. Take the magic carpet ride and live as she lived."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"As an avid reader I found this to be one of my great accomplishments. This book, though long, gives a first hand experience of the often misunderstood Cleopatra. It tells of her love and loss, life and times, and the world that was changing around her. Read this and fall in love with an unforgettable leading lady."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Like George's Henry VIII, this novel is superb. I'm not sure that I have much to add to earlier positive reviews. However, there was one review that I read prior to reading this book, which almost made me pick up another book. Shelley de Lange (1 January 2003) noted that George had characterized Cleopatra as &quot;a great beauty&quot;. As most scholars would argue that she was not a conventional beauty, this comment made me wonder how accurate the research had been and whether it was worth my while to devote so much time to this book. I am glad that I did decide to read the book and found that Ms. de Lange's criticism is incorrect. George, on the other hand, seems to have gotten everything, including Cleopatra's physical appearance, quite correct."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I'm only a teenager, yet have read this book three times this summer. I just can't get tired of it. The book seems to be very based on a lot of historical facts and helps bring her story to life. The settings and dialogue help you to really experience her world and the mystical Egypt through her eyes. I originally picked this book up just to see what my mother was reading, and couldn't put it down. It can really get your emotions running, from fear to joy to sadness, and back again. Experience the earliest memories of her childhood until her death. Forget about the nine hundred or more pages, this book is totally worth it!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"When you pick up this book forget everything you think you know about Cleopatra, and learn the truth. George turns Cleopatra from an Anciet Egyptian Flirt to one of the greatest women the world has ever know. The touching love story of the great men in her life is so well written. I was captured from the beginning to the end. Cleopatra became my role model and always will be."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book does an excellent job of vividly bringing Egypt and Cleopatra alive once again. Even it is over 900 pages, I wish it could have been longer. This is truly George's greatest novel. I would strongly recommend buying this book; it is definitely worth it."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"A brilliant un-put-downable book. For the first time, I began to view Cleopatra as a real person (not just a history figure) with feelings and passions. Margaret George has made history come alive for me."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Such a great novel. Margaret George has knack for making her characters so human, and accessible. I enjoyed every minute of this book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"THE MEMOIRS OF CLEOPATRA are narrated by Cleopatra herself. They begin when Cleopatra is a child in the palace of Alexandria, then follow her through to her famous death scene. Although Ms. George can be wordy at times, describing the clothes or landscape with more description than the reader really needs, the story more than makes up for this.MEMOIRS is a lengthy book, and not for readers who don't like history or aren't willing to put in the time to read it. I have several friends who stopped half-way through, but for anyone who is a fan of ancient Rome, ancient Egypt or history in general, you'll be well rewarded in reading this."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Yes, this book is very long, but worth the time. I found it very engaging for the most part, although at times, especially toward the end, the battle descriptions got a bit tiresome. The author creates a Cleopatra who is very intelligent, admirable, and an instinctively wise ruler. I did enjoy the descriptions of the lifestyle and culture of her realm and others she visited; I was aware of her Greek ancestry before reading this book, but I learned a great deal more about the ties between Egypt and Greece, as the legacy of Alexander the Great from reading it. Before reading this book, I really had only read a little about Cleopatra, and had seen the epic film starring Elizabeth Taylor; it was interesting to see what elements of the story in the movie matched up with George's account and what didn't. I had read a couple novels about Ceasar, but this book had the most complete creation of his personality that I've read to date. I very much appreciated and enjoyed the Afterward, which gave some account of things that happened after the novel's ending, as well as clarifying what the author based on historical accounts and what she filled in with her own imagination. I confess I skimmed over some of the battle scenes toward the end, partly because I was tired of them, and partly because I wanted to find out what happened with Cleopatra and Octavian. The series of betrayals she and Antony suffered were rather depressing, but I knew basically how it was going to end, so that was expected, I guess. If you like Egyptian culture in general, check out The River God, by Wilbur Smith - it's a wonderful story of a queen & has lots of great descriptions, etc."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book was absolutely spectacular! Margaret George takes you through the life and times of the larger-than-life Cleopatra. I became so attached to the characters in this book that I was actually sad to end it. Alexandria and Rome are brought to life before us--George's prose is so minutely detailed that I felt transported to this tumultuous era in history. Before reading this book (which sticks closely with the facts) I thought of Cleopatra as this mysterious kohl-eyed seducer of men, and after watching HBO's mini-series, Rome, I thought her to be a shrewd and unsympathetic character. How wrong I was. The show only portrayed her as the Romans saw her--an overindulgent and strange foreigner. She was in fact highly intelligent, loyal to her people and those she loved, and the first Ptolemy who learned to speak Egyptian. After inheriting the throne from her father she built up the Egyptian economy and made the country a rich and prosperous land. Her life was a triumph and a tragedy, full of intrigue, betrayals, and great love. At the end of this book I was so moved that I could not help but shed some tears. This is a piece of literature not to be overlooked!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book certainly is not a quick read. However, I found it kept me entertained. The development of the character of Cleopatra is excellent. There are some sections that could be cut in length, but overall a very good book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"A friend of mine gave me this book, telling me it was one of the best things she'd ever read. Since I have a passion for Ancient Egypt I gave it a whirl, even though the sheer volume of this book was daunting. Not exaggerating, this book took me a year to finish, but not for the usual reasons it would take anyone a year to finish. I savored the entire thing, every moment, every word. As an avid reader, I've gotten into the habit of skim reading most books, but I read every single word of those 970 some odd pages. Anyone who has an interest in historical fiction, Cleopatra, Egypt, or even feminism would enjoy this book. George doesn't just make Cleopatra a character you'll remember forever, she also goes into great detail about her brothers, sisters, and father; her lovers Caesar and Marc Antony; and her own children.From a fictional point of view the way she describes all the characters and their reactions to actual historical events is never boring and always memorable. From a historical point of view, the extent of her research really shines and I learned quite a few things I hadn't known before.If lengthy books don't turn you off immediately, then you should definitely delve into this one. You'll be enraptured and fully satisfied by the time it's finished.If you're looking for other books like this one, you should try The Ptolemies by Duncan Sprott, or if you want something with fictional characters set in that era, try River God by Wilbur Smith."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Many other reviewers have posted here explaining the outline of this story, so I won't bore you with the same details. But suffice it to say that as someone who is loathe to get through heavy books (and this is a seriously heavy looking book), I found this to be refreshing. The writing is beautiful, the characters well-rounded, and the author brings ancient Alexandria to life in a way that makes this book simply fly by. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in history, particularly ancient Roman or Egyptian life."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George's writing, coupled with Cleopatra's story, create a masterpiece that is all-consuming and captivating. I was a prisoner of its pages, often up until or 4 or 5am unable to put it down. In reading the Memoirs of Cleopatra, you are able to enjoy the splendors of Egypt, travel to Rome, have passionate love affairs with the 2 most powerful men in the world, endure the weight of civilization on your shoulders, encounter several brushes with death, and rule a country. And these are just a few highlights of the life of a wise princess, a persuasive queen, a fierce warrior, a fiery lover...the most powerful woman of her time, Cleopatra...all beautifully crafted by Margaret George."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have read this book multiple times and find myself falling even deeper in love with it each time. Margaret could have taken a lot of liberties with this book but she doesn't. She certainly has done her research.The characters practically jump off the pages. The more you get to know them, the more you adore them. Even the most detail of descriptions is not enough. You find yourself wanting more and more.If there is one thing I didn't particularly like is how modern she wrote Cleopatra. She sugar coated her morals and point of view.It would have been a lot more interesting if she had given us the Cleopatra who is widely believed to have murdered her brother. It would have been a challenge that I guess she wasn't ready to take. Shame, really."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This is a beautiful novel. it is long, but when I first read it, I couldn't put it down. I have probably read it more than ten times now. Margaret George is masterful in her telling of the life of Cleopatra. She is portrayed exactly as I would have imagined her to be. Many women identify with Cleopatra, myself included, as she invokes images of beauty, power, love, and tenacity. This is my absolute favorite work of fiction, ever."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book is great. It grabs your attention right from the very first page. Cleopatra's dedication to Egypt was very touching. The book is like Cleopatra herself telling the story, sharing all her feelings and personal experiences. There are so many great things about this book. I highly recommend it and would never let anyone borrow this copy! Prepare to spend a lot of time reading this big but beautifully-written book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Fascinating story. I couldn't put it down. I look forward to reading some of her other fictionalized historical accounts."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This is an excellent book. I would strongly recommend this to anyone wanting a good story. I cried several times and got so caught up in this book. It is WONDERFUL!!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have long had a fascination with the ancient world and watch every program on Egypt and Rome that is on TV. I found that this book is very descriptive about the palaces, clothes, jewelry, ceremonies, temples and battles of the ancient world. The author obviously did a lot of extensive research. It's a good book for someone who does not know a lot about the ancient world and would like to know more."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"margaret george depicts cleopatra in all of her glory. she accurately and passionately brings out the true cleopatra and left no doubt in my mind that cleopatra was truly one of the most passionate, ambitous and yes honorable people to ever live."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I am not a lover of historical fiction but purchased this book because I have always had a fascination with Egypt. I took it on a two week trip to Bali and once I started it I could not put it down. I, too, cried when Caesar died. The story and details transported me into another world and every day I was torn between exploring the island and reading by the pool. When I finished, I couldn't help but feel admiration and a sense of loss for this woman who lived so long ago. Books I have read following this one were good in their own right but none have left such an impact on my imagination and my soul."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I for one am a complete fan of Margaret George. I have fallen in love with the characters she portrays not just in Memoirs of Cleopatra but in her other two novels as well. The vivid language told from the eyes of the great queen herself captures the land of ancient Egypt like no other thing has before. If you are a true historical fiction fan this book is a must. If you're not it's still worth reading just so you know how a book is supposed to be written. I for one hope she continues to write novels and I cannot wait for what I am sure will be another trimuph of a book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"A book of love, life, death and hate. Cleopatra is all of these. From her affair with caeser to the asp that killed her. This is a great book for avid readers."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book was a very good value. When I received it, I was alarmed at how long it was - I wouldn't have bought it in the bookstore as it is big, thick and heavy. Nevertheless, I began it and was immediately &quot;into&quot; the story. It was engrossing and &quot;felt&quot; like non-fiction in the amount of detail, dialogue, and interesting characters. This book really cemented my new interest in &quot;things Egyptian&quot; -- this interest started in my recent readings of Christian Jacq's series on the kings of Egypt. Also, now I want to see the Liz Taylor / Richard Burton movie about Antony and Cleopatra. Summary: outstanding, engrossing read. Try it even if you shy away from books over 300 pages long! You will surprise yourself."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I think The Memoirs of Cleopatra is one of the best book that I ever read. Despite of her cruelness, Cleopatra has immense inner strength and intergrity. Anthony has a heart that is pure as gold and the level of dedication that he brought foward to Cleopatra make us relaise that &quot; Love is blind&quot;. Anthony's love for Cleopatra is undescribeable.

I think the entire book focuses way too much on Cesar and Rome though. I actually only read half of it because I grew tired of reading about Rome and Cesar. Was starting to wonder if the book is about Cleopatra or Cesar? If I want to read about nothing but Cesar, I would have bought a book about him only."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This was a fairly interesting book until I came to the part about the Roman cruelty to animals and people; and for the Romans' enjoyment !!!!! I couldn't force myself to finish reading it."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have read all of Margaret George's books &amp; this is the only one I haven't been crazy about. I don't know why but it was hard for me to get into it."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"It never ceases to amaze me that although we're entering a new millenium, American media is still so RACIST. As the consultant for the ABC miniseries based on this book, George's failed attempt not to &quot;talk down to the readers/audience&quot; (a direct quote from The Hollywood Reporter - 5/21/99) should have extended into revealing Cleopatra as a strong, capable AFRICAN role model. Perhaps this truth could have been an issue in casting the miniseries as well. It's such a shame that as a society we're still unable to appreciate beauty and accomplishment in every color, and shame on you Ms. George for allowing such a distorted view of an AFRICAN queen to hit the shelves for all of our children to see - or did you think that their braids were wigs? The &quot;Cleopatra for the 90's&quot; miniseries should have at the very least cast an Egyptian!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I find it hard to believe that this book has the same author as Mary Queen of Scots! Two completely different books. The topic of Cleopatra is one of the most intersting topics of all times, but this book is so amazingly boring, I had to skip pages because I couldnt follow endless emotionless dialogs and empty, almost non-existing characters...Very very disappointing (would be a good textbook though since it seems to be historically correct)."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Usually I am not led astray by reviews - if the reviews are good, the book usually is too. Unfortunately, that isn't the case here. I always finish my books but I am only half-way through this one, and I've already read many others rather than finish. The writing is immature. The speech is sometimes fake and forced. But, worst of all, the book is unbearably boring. It might be becuase of the way Geaorge writes, or it may be becuase she fails to make me care one bit for the characters. I don't know. All I can say is, if you like the long historical books, try Aztec (Jennings) or Pillars of the World."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"If you like history in book form this is the book for you. It was mailed promptly and received in good condition."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"After reading Margaret George's The Autobiography of Henry VIII and Mary, Queen of Scots, I was eagerly awaiting her next book--assuming that it would be more British historical fiction. When I discovered The Memoirs of Cleopatra, I was a tad disappointed. Nevertheless, I happily bought the book assuming that it would be as interesting and fun to read as those other two.Boy, was I wrong! This tome was so horribly uninteresting, I was never able to finish it and it still sits only half-read on my bookshelves. Sometimes, I think of tackling it again, but everytime I read the first several pages, I wind up putting it back down."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I thought the movie with Liz was bad!!! ABC has a big problem with sticking to the story. This book was wonderful, a real trip back in time. What a joy. ABC ripped it apart! Ms. George should sue! It was nothing but sex farce. Let's see Bill Zane's chest! It was nothing more than that. It was horrible! Not only did they not tell you what happened to her son, He was killed, but it failed to mention the three children she had by Marc Antony. Read the book and when the movie comes out on video...and we know it will..avoid it, nothing but trash. I only mentioned this here in the hope that no one will think the book is like that, it's not. The book is truly a great Novel take it to the beach. WONDERFUL.I waited in great hopes to see this movie, since they announced it in Febuary...only to be disapointed it took everything I had to watch the whole two nights. Two friends of mine who read the book and loved it, both told me about it..watched the first night, were so discusted by it, they didn't watch the second."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Read this book if you would like to see what Cleopatra would have been like if she had've been a modern corporate super-mom.While the story reads well and fluidly, Cleopatra is incongriously well informed for an ancient ruler and has a utopian court of dedicated people around her who all love her dearly. Ancient rulers would have been extremely jealous! She also has the benefit of historical hindsight as she is able to predict with certainty most future events that the likes of Antony are unable to.If all she wanted for her children was a stable Egypt and she was the only one to predict Octavian's treachery - why did she demand the additional lands from Antony when she would have certainly known that this would give him the ammunition he needed to destroy Antony in the eyes of the mob?Cleopatra was a canny poltican of her day, and at least equally as conniving as any of them. This book exonerates her completely and does so with some narrative clumsiness."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I was scambling to find out more about Cleopatra by the time I was finished reading this novel. What a wonderful work of art. Margaret George does a wonderful job making the reader fall in love with Cleopatra and her love interests.

She was the ruler, in her own right, of Egypt and seduced 2 of the greatest roman rulers of her age.Margaret Geroge gives and impressive re-creation of a lost world in this novel. She also gives a lively characterisation to Cleopatra. That said, however, the book is long, and I found myself drifting, and I never finished it. I'm not quite sure what is wrong with this novel.The author is gifted, but I suspect this is like one of those long movies that goes on just that little bit too long and destroys what would otherwise be an amazing outing."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I bought this book from a second hand bookstore, thinking I'd made a great find. I love history, history fiction, and biographies, and this book seemed to have it all.But I was wrong. I don't understand how so many people can love this book: The book was terrible. The writing was atrocious. Cleopatra, one of the most clever, cunning and admirable women in history, was denigrated to a simpering fool in the book. The characters were two-dimensional, the dialogue was forced, and at times, just plain stupid. I tried very hard to give the book a chance; sometimes, stories need a bit of time to get going. But this one didn't. By the one hundredth page, I was bored to tears, and I found staring at the arrivals and departures screen at the airport (where I was reading during a long layover) to be far more interesting.I wouldn't even give this book away. I think I chucked it in a bin somewhere and purchased a far superior book : Stacy Schiff's Cleopatra. Now THAT's good writing."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"A bit too unrealistic, I thought. Such detailed descriptions and impressions on every person, every landscape, every banquet were certainly a pleasure to read ... at first. But this book, Memoirs of Cleopatra is written as an autobiography decades after all those events. It isn't written as a journal, as they happen just now. According to this book, Cleopatra must have been not only beautiful, strong minded, politically correct, excellent in languages, but also had the best memory in history. Or shall I call, &quot;Memory of Cleopatra&quot;?The indication that the &quot;scrolls&quot; were written years later, in fact, after her defeat in Actium comes here and there throughout the book. Beginning as early as the middle of the first scroll, when she bemoans her own fate, while describing her sister Arsinoe's, doomed to be displayed in Roman streets as a captive in chains. And constantly afterwards. Yet the answer does not come until late in the 9th scroll, when she finally reveals the purpose of the memoir that it was created to tell her side of the story as opposed to Octavian's. That's when the novel really opens up and takes us into the next dimension. All the battle scenes, banquets, sorrow and love, only a prelude now. Her inner struggle takes over now. I could now fall so deeply into the character as if her feelings were my own ... finally. It was a great joy. But, then, why did I have to wait that long? It could have been much better written by spending more on Cleopatra's inner psyche than getting lost in all the details signifying little. In short, too much history and less literature."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This novel is very slow-paced right now. In these hundred pages I know Cleopatra was rescued from drowing with her mother as an infant, as a child she was more audacious than maybe she should have been, her father was exiled, father came back and killed his daughter and may have killed the other had she not executed herself by eating mushrooms, the King has bestowed the honor on Cleopatra as Queen, she has to rule with her brothers (they are super annoying and should be on her hit list), and that's about it. Okay, I got to page 73, but so far there is not much happening and makes me wonder if the other 600 plus pages are is going to move this glacial. I sure hope not! I would read this book if you have the patience of steel but if you want something a little more fast-paced, I would go for another novel about Cleopatra. I will finish this book because I never turn down a challenge, and usually it's not so hard for me to read a novel this large if it's interesting."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This epic (epic meaning really freaking long here) book tells the story of the great Queen Cleopatra, last Pharaoh of Egypt from beginning to end. It tells of her relationship with the two great loves of her life-Julius Caesar and Marc Antony, her struggle to keep Egypt independent in a world that is being dominated by Rome, and her determination to rule an Empire and make it one of the World's greatest powers. The story begins with her birth and follows her through her ascension, her failed attempt to fight against Rome, and her memorable death by asp bite.This book was about 300 pages too long. I understand how George felt the need to create a complete portrait of Cleopatra, but I also believe that her editors should have been a little more strict. But yet still only a couple characters feel more than ancillary. Even Caesar felt a little two-dimensional. It goes on and on about feasts and battle strategy, and often inserts exclamations like \\"My heart stopped cold\\" or \\"The aching need for him was killing me\\", when Cleopatra is nervous about the safety of someone, or worried about some outcome or another, or longing for her man. Would the real Cleopatra shown such tender weakness? Who knows? It doesn't make her less of a political genius. Still, I do feel like I know a great deal more of the history of that time period, and for that I am grateful."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I read this on my Kindle and midway through the book called Amazon to complain about the overwhelming errors on almost every page. This might have been tolerable had the book not droned on for hundreds of pages. I love Harris's books about Cicero (Imperium and Conspirata) because of the richness and ultimate concise text. This could have been similiar but at almost 1,000 pages I gave up on the last 250 and skimmed the remaining story. I'm glad to see Amazon pulled the Kindle edition and hope that other books get a better reading before being offered to readers. I wanted to like this book but just can't recommend it."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I could repeat the other reviewers, but I will not. I read this and LOVED IT. I loved the HBO Series Rome, and my friend, said she thought Cleopatra was inaccurately portrayed, and cited this book. Well I read this book, having always been interested in ancient Egypt, and I absolutely loved it. I felt like it was historically and culturally rich, and it was a juicy read as well. I can't imagine anyone who is interested in this subject not enjoying the book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George can write. At times her prose is remarkably good, almost poetic in its beauty. I think I'd enjoy reading a non-historical novel by her. My only objection to this book is her flagrant dismissal of history in creating aspects of her novel. The other Egyptian themed author to compare is the brilliant Pauline Gedge, herself an Egyptologist whose strict adherence to historical facts makes her books something you know you can trust and which are completely believable. Or Wilbur Smith who takes some liberties with his unhistorical figures but has them so connected to historical facts that you accept them without the reservations you develop with George. I think historical fiction should be as accurate as possible. Of course, novelizations require fictionalizing fact, but there's a line over which I fear George has stepped.George has an annoying habit of trying to take historical figures and place them into scenarios common to the average person, presumably to make the reader relate, when in fact, the reverse happens. For example, she has Cleopatra as a young girl running wild, doing as she pleases, going off on excursions with boys. Fishing, swimming, boating with boys, going off on a long trip down the Nile on a whim. It was like Cleopatra was a tomboy on Huck Finn's raft. This idea is just so wildly not possible that it destroys the suspension of disbelief so necessary when reading an historical novel. These images are just too ridiculous to be believed. Another such example was the Pharaoh, Cleopatra's father, who liked to spend his evenings in something that translated as close to a family room as she could get. Princes and Princesses lying on the floor playing with toys or being bounced affectionately on daddy's knee. I all but saw faux wood panelling, oval braided rugs and Sear's plaid sofas in that scene. Some Pharaohs had hundreds of children, wives, concubines. I doubt they bounced anyone on their knees and probably often never set eyes on some of their children.The other aspect which disturbed me was bringing modern notions into an Egyptian time period. The most glaring example of this was when Cleopatra was preparing to marry Marc Antony and referred to her \\"wedding gown\\". Please! Why stop with that? Why not have the honeymoon get-away chariot and tossing a bouquet of lotus flowers at crowds of bitter, desperate vestal virgins?She also did something which I found personally repellent. While she treated the Egyptian and Roman gods with appropriate awe and respect necessary for this character, she did insert some scenes that were in very poor taste about Cleopatra's fascination with the Old Testament and her longing and approval of the foretold Christ. Please!If George made these kinds of frankly amateurish mistakes with her other books, I would strongly hesitate to read them. The thing that saved this book from being a morass of faux pas and bad taste is the fact that in all other respects, she is a brilliant writer. Her writing keeps you turning the pages. You roll your eyes in disgust at these lapses and are tempted a time or two to throw the book across the room, but the lure of beauty left unread is too much to repel you for long."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I loved reading this book because I love learning more about famous, or infamous, and mysterious people and the events. We can only speculate today on the events surrounding Cleopatra and her children and loves and politics. That's why I couldn't put it down. M. George really sets an atmosphere in her novels of the times and circumstances and implications going on at the time. Our lives can be enriched by the past and people of the past when we have the benefit of M. George's efforts. She explains thoroughly their lives and world while we struggle daily in our own. I can't wait to see who she writes about next."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Once i started this book i just could not put it down. By the time i finished all 900 pages i found myself wishing there was more. I loved this book. Margart George is a wonderful storyteller. She really makes the book come alive. You feel as if you are right there with the character. Trust me you too will love this book!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I went through this bookin two weeks. Once I started I just could not put it down. One of the main reasons that I rushed to finish it was to watch the movie of Cleopatra that aired sometime in May'99. What a dissapointment that turned out to be. I was completely disgusted at watching the first half of the movie that I didn't even bother with the second half. The movie took away the real essence in which Cleopatra was portrayed by Margaret George. Instead of sympathizing with her, in the case of the movie, I actually sided with the Romans in thinking her a power hungry seductress. So in conclusion read the book and skip the movie!! That includes the old Elizabeth Taylor fiasco too."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book had it all -- romance, intrigue, etc. but my favorite thing about it was that it showed Cleopatra as how I imagined her, a strong minded, determined, beautiful woman, who, if not for some dumb headed men, would probably have been the ruler of Rome, basically all the known world. The movie was awful, some cheap sex flick that involved Billy Zane half naked alot (Although the actress who played Cleopatra was good). Don't base the book on this movie. It can be a bit boring at times, describing scenery and all that stuff, but it's overall grade: An A++++++++++!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"As a senior high school student, I decided to read the Memoirs of Cleopatra as an independent study unit. At the time, the idea sounded bizzare, choosing a story much longer than the rest of the students in my class. On the other hand, I was up to the challenge. After much procrastination, I began to read George's novel and found the story to be very outstanding. I didn't know too much about the controversal character of Cleopatra until I read the book. I admire George for the way she placed her life in such an excellent narrative story. I actually felt I was with Cleopatra throughout her life. I felt her victories, joys, losses and pains. I was following her every move. Cleopatra is indeed a strong, determined woman living in a society dominated by men. She encourages women all around the world to stand up for themselves, even in the face of danger."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret Georges account of Cleopatra Queen of Egypts life adheres to historical accuracy while providing an intensely personal insite into the psyche of one of historys most fascinating personalities.The first person technique combined with the authors wonderful intuition and imagination allows the reader to know the human being and woman behind the legend and historical figure.We learn that the Egyptian queen,in addition to being a shrewd politician, scholar, and linguist, was both a devoted mother and the kind of lover who in Georges words &quot;gave all of myself&quot;. Yes, political expedience may have motivated the young queen to seduce Julius Caesar, yet the woman behind the politican fell genuinely in love and later became devoted mother and wife well as the ambitious egotist who could ruthlessly plot the murder of her younger sister.Thus through Margaret Georges insights we learn that the Queen of Egypt, who sincerely believed herself to be the living embodiment of the Goddess Isis, was also refreshingly human. As a human being and a woman, we can empathize with her even as we may recoil at her monumental ego and overriding ambition. This is a novel to be read and reread. There will be a new insight to delight the reader with every new reading, and perhaps a new insight into ones own self through insight into this complex woman who was also a major historical player in her time and throughout history."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"The history you'll learn is enough to recommend the book, the captivating characters and story are bonus. Well worth every penny.

The intriguing saga of this alluring woman -- Cleopatra, queen of the Nile -- vividly comes to life in Margaret George's stunning biographical novel. From page one, readers are transported to the sensual city of Alexandria and follow the mesmerizing tale of the rise and fall of one of history's most enticing figures. Once I started reading this novel, I just could not put it down. One of the best novels I have ever read!!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"The story is awesome and so is the movie.the movie left out parts but they really weren't important parts."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book is great, I really like it, you can find anything you wanna know about Cleopatra life, I really like it, it's preatty interesting"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George has a real gift for bringing characters to life. Despite the fact that very little verifiable information survives about the real Cleopatra, George's active imagination has created an intriguing and fascinating title character in this epic piece of historical fiction. The author conjures up vivid imagery, peoples the story with three-dimensional characters, and has certainly done her research when it comes to representing Eqyptian and Roman culture of the era. She includes many historical facts, while creatively filling in the blanks with characters and events that are purely products of her wonderfully vivid imagination. The end result of this blend of fact and fiction is a thoroughly enjoyable, highly readable and fascinating account a remarkable (though mostly fabricated) woman.While I tend to gravitate towards books based entirely on historical fact, I enjoyed Margaret George's Memoires of Cleopatra tremendously. Despite the ponderous size of the book, it's a light read and is immensely entertaining. It would make an excellent vacation book, as it is easy to loose yourself in it. I found myself sneaking it under my desk at work - I simply couldn't put it down. Don't be daunted by the book's length - I was sorry to see it end!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Many readers may now be discouraged from reading this book, thanks to the totally inaccurate ABC re-telling in its recent production of CLEOPATRA. Don't be discouraged! George's account was based on HISTORICAL DIGGING and NOT Hollywood fantasy! Having read several accounts of Cleopatra VII's life, I found George's to be especially refreshing. Her accounting of the Battle of Actium shed important, new historical accounts/theories on what probably happened. History has always been so HARD on both Cleopatra and Antony. Though they both made their share of mistakes (who hasn't?!), George's book strips away the cold marble facades of their museum busts, and places flesh and beating hearts into their characters. And for those who are loath to believe that Octavian (Caesar Augustus) was beyond flaw, remember that the way one acts in victory says MUCH about one's character. The tragedy revealed at the end of the book (the murders of two sons of Cleopatra and Antony, and the destruction of their statues and the smearing of their names) should be evidence enough that sometimes history can be extrememly wrong. Thanks Margaret George for finally telling the OTHER side of the story. It was illuminating, and I cried when Antony died. Readers, get your Kleenex OUT!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Let's be clear: I am an Egyptophile...one who borders on snobbery when it comes to the Ptolomies. I have always regarded them as upstarts, Greek effetes who brought Magnificent Egypt to its end of days, on its knees. I bought this book because I had so loved George's Henry VIII, and thought Cleo might at least interest me because of George's glorious writing. I was wrong--George has written of a woman of towering strength and fortitude, a story of love and death, a story of a bittersweet time, with very real humans, in all their frailty and dreams. Cleopatra is now ALIVE to me, a very real, very human person who lived, dreamed, hoped, feared and loved 2 millenia ago. I know it was fiction...but it was written in first person, and gave me the sense that I could have been Cleopatra, that any of my strong women friends could have been Cleopatra, and that Marc Antony could have been the man for any of us, flawed, brilliant, loving, generous and sexy. I nearly wept with fury when it ended...as it had to. I wanted to scream for more of the story...but there was no more. Need I say, I am not quite so snobby...about Cleopatra Ptolomy anyway. The rest of her family? Effete Greek upstarts. Buy the book--you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, Augustus, four myths, for more than two thousand years. What is fiction, what is real? It's hard to say. If you want a dry account on the historical figures, try Suetonius; if you would like the romantic, poetic and theatrical version, try Shakespeare's dramatic masterpieces (\\"Julius Caesar\\" and \\"Antony and Cleopatra\\" are his best, in my opinion); if you want to see these four people as the most beautiful of their time according to standards of our time, watch Liz Taylor's and Rex Harrison's \\"Cleopatra\\". If you want to get close to them as they might have really been, as real and alive people, try Margaret George's \\"Memoirs of Cleopatra\\".This is not an easy book to read. It is quite long, and there are many secondary characters who don't stay in the story for too long, making them all somewhat hard to track. Nevertheless, it is a very good and well-researched book. Not only Cleopatra, the narrator, but also Julius Caesar, Augustus and, most of all Antony appear as real people, with ambitions and flaws, like everybody else. It only happened that they struggled to control most of the known world at their time, and that makes their story interesting.Margaret George has had an interest in Cleopatra since she was a child. In her own words, this is her masterpiece and has taken almost forty years to be written. It is a very good work and I would recommend it to everybody who's interested about the last days of the Roman republic and mythical Egypt.Grade 8.2/10"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"\\"The Memoirs of Cleopatra\\" is an amazing piece of historical fiction that chronicles the life of the Queen of the Nile from her childhood until her tragic death. This books depicts Cleopatra as a strong and intelligent ruler who would do anything to protect her family, her children, and her greatest love of all: Egypt.This is a truly an amazing story, and the narration is exceptional. Author Margaret George did meticulous research and covered all the major events in Cleopatra's life, including her rise to power at a young age, the numerous betrayals by her siblings, how she coped with Egypt's economic and political difficulties, and of course her relationships with Caesar and Marc Antony.I was completely swept away by this book. So many details of the stories and details presented are grounded in historical evidence, and it's hard to remember that this is actually a work of fiction. George's portrayal of Cleopatra is simply stunning. If there's any fault with the book, it is perhaps that when faced with choosing between several different historical accounts, George always went with the version that painted Cleopatra in a better light. However, I don't see anything wrong with that, as it is fiction, after all.I absolutely loved this book. It's a great story about a fantastic woman ruler, and it's also a passionate love story...two passionate love stories, actually! What a fabulous novel."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Well, when I bought this book, I knew it was going to be a guilty pleasure. You know, a highly enjoyable romanticized account of Cleopatra. And I was right, but I also underestimated it. It is an extremely easy read, but it is also very long. I stuck with it however (and I never really thought of ever not) and its a good thing - the last few chapters are by far the best. Which is interesting, since we all know the ending. But I truly loved the way George depicted the ending - Cleopatra's agony over Antony's death, her resolution to do what she had to do - and her brilliance in executing her plan. It was without a doubt the best part of the entire novel. ...I actually did skim a bit through Actium, but that says more about me than the book. (It was terribly depressing and everything kept getting worse and I just wanted to get it over with!) So no, Memoirs of Cleopatra is not great literature, obviously. But it IS a wonderful, engaging account of Cleopatra's life, by far the most entertaining of its kind. And the amount of research that must have gone into it - amazing. But what is probably best about this novel, is that it is a springing board to read more, perhaps non-fictional accounts, of Cleopatra and her time. I know intimately more about her than I ever did before, and I am eager now to understand what is fact and what is not, and learn as much as I can. And for that, George should be commended."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Do not be discouraged by the size of this massive book. It reads so smoothly and beautiful. You will find that you completed the entire book in record breaking time, and you will wish it never ended.I have reccomended this book to many friends and relatives. Many are put off by the length However, the brave few who took my advice, were thanking me afterwards.I have always loved stories about Cleopatra, and this one, is without exception the best. Ms. George really knows her history, and it is obviously clear that she took this book very seriously.Ms. George weaves fiction and fact together so meticulously, that no seams are visable. At the same time she manages to stay true to historical accuracy as much as possible.It is always a pleasure to read a book that is written by a person who is clearly an expert, not only in the craft of writing. But, in the topic as well.The pages are filled with some of the best detailed and descriptive writing I have come across. You will feel as if you are inside of the story. When you have finished with the book, you will feel a longing to visit all of the places and lands Ms. George describes so beautifully. Not as a new visitor, but instead as a frequent traveler to a familiar place.If you are in need of an escape, or a much needed vacation but don't see it happening in the near future. Then I reccomend you pick up this book, a warm throw and settle into your most comfortable chair. It's a shame we can only give 5 stars!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book helped me shed a lot of light on Cleopatra's character. Before I didn't even know that the Mark Antony of Shakespeare's play Caesar was the same one that was romantically involved with Cleopatra. How dumb. It brought Caesar and Mark Antony to life for me, but the protagonist's view comes across as being less personal to me, and more like Margaret George recorded the words of a very dear friend, instead of getting inside Cleopatra's head. I liked one realization in the book, when Cleopatra is looking at her reflection in the mirror and examining it for signs of beauty. She thinks simply that the girl in the mirror looks &quot;like someone she would like to know&quot; which seemed to ring true for me. The descriptions were wonderful, I felt like I really was in Egypt looking at the pyramids and the sphinx and I could see the lighthouse at Alexandria from Cleopatra's window."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I bought this book at a bookstore. I was, at first very skeptical. I knew very little about Cleopatra, except tidbits here and there. Plus the book was huge and I thought it would be drawn out and too long. But to be honest...It was Great! I couldn't put it down. The pages really took you to the place. You could visualize how life was like there. You can understand why Cleopatra made certain decisions. How they benefited her and at the same time hindered her.It was exciting to see how she was able to secure the throne. How she had to fight for it as soon as she had it. And the ally (Caesar) she had to make to seal the deal. But also the unexpected turn of things as she found out; what was a plan turned into love.During the part that Anthony entered into the picture. It was great! Until after the initial meeting, only then did the book seem to be drawn out. It almost was like the first half but couldn't actually match the greatness of it.The first part I flew into and now near the end I have slowed into a steady pace. I could honestly stop reading for awhile and pick it up later.Either way I would recommend it. I am glad I bought it. It was very interesting and taught me a lot of what was then. Honestly...I would read it again...lol...at least the first half."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I've alwaysed loved the stories of Cleopatra and her tragic death. With this book I was transported to that era, and was able to breath the same air that Cleopatra once did. George wrote in a way that not only brought the characters to life, but Alexandria herself. I could smell the lotus, see the colorful fabrics, hear the mummers of the people. Anyone who reads this novel can't help but feel as if they themselves lived in those simpler times.I love the way Cleopatra was strong but at the same time weak. She was strong in her beliefs and convictions, but weak in who she chose to let in. I didn't want the book to end due to the fact that the ending was already written in history. I was finding myself hoping that history has lied all these years and that this book would prove it. Unfortunately though one can not rewrite history. George managed to tie the ends of the novel very well and even put a few sections of what took place after Cleopatras death. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a closer look at the mysteries of a time period that seem lost in this day and age!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I knew this was a long one and going to take a while to read through, so I read all my short, fluffy books beforehand and then devoted myself to this one. What a fantastic book this is, and kudos to the author for creating a story of this length with no slow parts or bogged-down areas. It flows perfectly from the first page. I was very appreciative of the notes at the end regarding her findings and clarifying how much of the story was as fact-based as possible and how much was her imagination. I bought this for my Kindle, but this is a book I would like to have to display on my shelves; it's that good."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I must say that this was one hell of a book. It does everything you hope it will do for an epic. Highly recommended!

I was not disappointed! George's depiction of Cleopatra reveals her as a multi-dimensional person who ruled with great love for Egypt and passion for the men in her life. Her account of Cleopatra's death was particularly touching. I especially liked the scene when Cleopatra visits Mark Anthony - the barge, the party, the \\"carpet\\" of rose petals, the gold tableware, all comined to reveal the complexity and brilliance of this woman who was so pivotal in world history. This is my favorite of all of George's books, which says a lot! Highly recommend this (and all Margaret George) book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Everyone remembers Cleopatra from history class and we've all seen the movie with Elizabeth Taylor. Neither really do her true justice. This book does.Margaret George goes from the beginning of her life to the absolute end, and even beyond. This serves to really get the reader into her world, understand her thoughts and feelings, makes you understand why she did what she did. History paints her as a temptress. The downfall of Marc Antony. Here you see her not so much as a temptress, but a lover. She does nothing to make the men in her life do anything; they naturally just do. This seems so much better than the seductress of legend. And this is far better than any movie. I doubt this could be made into a truly satisfactory movie.I like that Cleopatra seems very royal, but very down to earth. Like she could be your friend, but at the same time you know she's all business. The ancient Mediterranean is brought to real life. You can taste the figs, feel the sand, and smells the smells. Every word has a reason.George also brings the battles to life. I'm not a person for military strategy and her way of writing the battles didn't completely confuse me.Totally worth a read. This was the book that put me at ease when I was in labour ith my daughter. Yeah, it was that good. If I didn't have a set time to get out of the tub she'd have been born at home."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"You will love this book if you are not \\"picky\\" about historical accuracies. This is fiction, and I absolutely loved it. I am now married to this version of her. Cleaopatra comes off as an amazing woman, I admired her more with every page I turned. I love that this is a long book, because I seriously did not want it to end! I am sad that I am over her story.The author is amazing at making you feel with each of your senses. I would describe this book as the first 3D version of all books. Amazing! I could see, feel, smell, taste and BE THERE."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This took a while to get through, but not because it wasn't a page-turner, just time constraints.I had read Sagan's \\"Cosmos\\" for the sole purpose of expanding my horizons, what it did was also inspire a fascination with Alexandrian history. I read a few non-fiction books on the subject, and this was my first historical fiction on the subject and I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.Very few books can hold up with such length, but this one does.My dilemma now is: do I read another one by Ms George (Mary of Scotland) or yet another one on ancient Egyptian history by someone else??????? argh!!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book is quite long, but I devoured it in two days (which goes to show how much I enjoyed it). I simply couldn't put it down. George spent twenty plus years researching Cleopatra's life and it has paid off in this novel. This reads like a memoir written by the woman herself. This will dispel any myth, any movie about this historical figure that you've ever read or seen before. It is interesting, provokative and even at times, quite suspenseful.This not only delves into Cleopatra's well versed romantic affairs (and this book puts them into context) but also what she endured just to obtain her power and what she did as a leader. Remember this woman had a country to run, she wasn't sitting around and having sex and looking intriguing the way they portray her in movies, she had decisions to make on a daily basis that would effect everyone in Egypt, she faced the starvation of her people, the threat of Rome, whom at the time was taking over all regions. I suggest this book to anyone who even has a remote interest in the woman herself or the time period. It's well written and extremely entertaining but with a sense of realism due to the mountain of research George did on this fascinating woman.One of my all time favorite books, and before reading this I'd never considered myself a fan of creative non-fiction, but after this book, I immediately purchased George's novels on Henry and Magdalene. Looking forward to them!Margaret George, thank you for all of your hard work, you have written a true gem. Bravo."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Loved, loved, loved it! I have always been fascinated by this modern woman living in ancient times (I studied about her a multitude of times during five years of Latin). Margaret George brings to life one of history's most celebrated yet maligned women, Cleopatra. What is it about her that engages our fancy? Even my daughter HAD to be Cleopatra one Halloween. It's a family thing. This book was amazing, and one of my favorite reads this past year."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"But still a very good read. Very well written and researched story about an incredibly fascinating, intelligent, courageous and loving woman, a brilliant politician, but above all that a Queen. There are times when the book drags on a bit, with long descriptions of feasts, the court and court life and the business of running the country, but when she met up with Caesar (sp?) and then again with Marc Anthony things really started to cook, especially the final heartbreaking moments at the end. The author did an excellent job of portraying these two great men, Caesar and Marc Antony, particularly Antony, a flawed but ever so fascinating man.All in all a great book to read once, but not one I will keep on the shelf to read again and again due to some of the repetition and lengthy descriptions of the life of a monarch, hence only 4 stars. Don't misunderstand me, it was an excellent book and I'm glad I read it and the story of such a great woman and queen, but it's one of the few books that once I've finished I have no desire to read again and again."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I started this book immediately after reading The Autobiography of Henry VIII. The autobiography was so superb, that I found this book a little harder to get into. I stopped reading midway because I was slowly losing interest. When I resumed reading, I couldn't put it down. I am a big fan of Margaret George, and I prefer her books to Phillipa Gregory. I recommend this and all other Margaret George books to anybody who enjoys historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book is one of the most brilliant books I have read in a long time. Margaret George paints an exquisite, refreshing tale of remarkable women of legend. I think the most amazing experience that one gains when reading this book is the vision of Caesar when a young Cleopatra leaps from the rug. I don't think I could recommend this book highly enough!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"OK, so maybe Margaret George's book doesn't quite have the power Dio Cassius attributed to Cleopatra. Nonetheless, The Memoirs of Cleopatra is a captivating story of one of history's most romantic and infamous heroines. George makes excellent use of primary sources and, by incorporating their detail, makes her story all the more believable. Nearly all the accounts we have of Cleopatra come from her enemies; she was, after all, &quot;the lascivious fury who was to become the bane of Rome...&quot; (Lucan, Civil War). It is refreshing to find a novel so thoroughly researched that presents events from a friendly point of view while sticking to the basic historic facts.This story mesmerizes; at the end, you will want to storm Alexandria yourself, not resting until you find the long-lost ruins of Cleopatra's palace and the tomb she shares with Antony."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George, with her usual thoroughness, draws the reader into ancient Egyptian society with all it's color, danger and intrigue.

Enjoyable from page 1 to the end"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Historically right on the mark. Margaret George is meticulous in detail that fills in the gaps for minds that wonder about people and their times.She travels in ancient universes and shares with us her adventures. Well worth your indulgence."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Although the writing was clear and descriptive, the characters interesting, and the history fascinating; the length of this book was so unbearably long, I cannot give it any more that 3 stars. As a lover of historical fiction, a recent voyager in Egyptian historical fiction, and a devourer of long books, I thought this book would be perfect for me. But I learned that some books, like this one, can cross the line from lengthy to burdensome. I must say, I truly enjoyed the characters and the story, and it made me very interested in Egypt and Roman history. But three quarters of the way through this nearly 1000 page book, I simply couldn't stand it anymore. I couldn't believe how long it was taking me to finish the book! Eventually I found myself dreading having to slog any more of it and resenting the book for putting me though all this. If 200 or 300 pages could be edited out, I would give it an enthusiastic 5 stars, but as it is I didn't finish it and wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. All in all, great writing, characters, history and story, but just TOO DARN LONG to be a truly enjoyable reading experience for me."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George did a masterful job of research and storytelling, giving the reader a front row seat into history. However, it came off too much like a Danielle Steele romance novel. Cleopatra was supposed to be highly intelligent, speaking 12 languages, and one of the great female rulers. Yet here we are led to believe that she was the equivalent of a \\"video vixen BC\\", dating only \\"Roman rock stars\\", becoming the \\"first #1 baby-mama\\" with several \\"baby daddies\\" who allowed her \\"booty calls\\" but no wedding rings. She dated married men and left her children while she went \\"on the road\\" behind Julius Caesar and Marc Antony like a \\"band wife\\", leaving Egypt to be run by employees and eunuchs. George does give the reader fabulous in-depth descriptions of the characters and locations. If you are interested in a good read about Egypt, Rome, the mighty Nile River, Caesar, Antony, Octavian, Marcus Agrippa, Fulvia, Cornelia, and the Kandake of Meroe, in addition to the battles and technology of the time, this is the book for you. But if this is truly what Cleopatra was about, then we've been fooled all of this time. Here she is an indifferent ruler, a bit loose with her virtue (rolling out of a rug for a roll in the hay with J.C. on their first meeting is a bit low-class and trifling), and a very negligent mother. She put the men in her life before the welfare of her children and her people. I was very impressed with Margaret George's dedication to this subject and, overall, I loved the book. But it left me very, very disappointed in Cleopatra as a woman and a queen. Marge, you turned what could have been a rich-as-butter ruler into cheap margarine! Fabio could have graced the cover as Marc Antony. Now I ain't saying Cleo was a gold digger, but she sure wasn't messin' with no broke %&#@^%!!!!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Memoirs is a very long book but I found myself loving every page - every word.

I had a difficult time putting it down."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have read several of Margaret George's books. Henry the 8th, his six wives and one on his heirs. Cleopatra is by far my favorite. The paperback was sort of cumbersome to hold so I ordered it on Kindle and could not put it down. I hated this book to end. Well written and takes you back to Cleopatra's time. You can practically smell the air and Cleopatra's fragrant oils. What a gal!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Based on the reviews I was expecting a real page turner. It was slow and hard for me to get into. It did pick up about half way though."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This was a great book. As a fan of Historical Fiction I would recommend this book to anyone who is also a fan. This was the kind of read that you didn't want to put down. Margaret George really taught you about ancient Egypt and Rome and she made you feel like it was really Cleopatra telling her story. I found myself laughing and crying. Again, this was a great book and when it was over I was really sad that it ended."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This was a wonderful Historical novel. I read it while cruising with visits to Egypt, Cyprus, Rome and many of the places that were mentioned in the book. I learned much while I was completely entertained."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book is amazing! It gives great insight into the life of Cleopatra and those close to her. I highly recommend it! It's a bit long, but totally worth it!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"One of the few books I've read where I've been unable to resist coming back to it again and again. The quasi-autobiographical viewpoint makes the story exceptionally engrossing. I love all of Margaret George's novels, but this one is far and away my favorite."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Amazing and detailed book about the story of Cleopatra from a first person point of view in the form of a \\"diary\\". George did an admirable job of weaving an entertaining fictional story while sticking to confirmed facts about Cleopatra's life. It fascinated me as a teenager and made me inclined to read anything I could get my hands on about Cleopatra, the last Queen of the Nile. By far the best book about her that I've read in the last 15 years."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Easily the best novel I've ever read! So good, I've shared it with everyone I know (and total strangers!) and am buying another copy to read again... I never read a book twice! Margaret George takes you on a wonderful voyage through the eyes of Queen Cleopatra... ancient times brought to life... a true adventure for the reader... read all of Margaret George's other books before you read this one (seriously!)... save this ultimate treasure for last and savor it! :))"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"When I saw the Cleopatra hardcover on the shelf at the library, I was intrigued, but thought--what a LONG book, and don't I already know a lot about the historical Cleopatra anyway? NO! This book brings you into old Egypt in a way that makes it intimate as well as foreign, and immerses you in the politics, intrigues, and daily lives of the Caesars and the Ptolemies . . . One of my favorite books of all time is Mary Renault's Fire From Heaven about Alexander the Great, and this book is similar in appeal. Cleopatra weaves a spell--the book makes you feel like you were there and you understand the time, the period, and the players in a fresh way."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book brings to life acient cultures, religions, and people. It is a wonderful read! I especially liked the notes in back, where George tells us what is definately based in historical fact."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"as an arab this book truly makes me proud to be middle eastern..........such a book as this i have NEVER read... greater than this book i cant find on cleopatra... based on all daily activities this book makes cleopatra a best friend putting you through her ordeals.This book by m george compelled me to get others such as Queen mary queen of scotland and the isles. and King Henry VIII. I WOULD love if another book by margret george was published ... if it was the memoirs of a middle eastern ancient ruler i would be the first to buy it. theres NO better autobiography, when cleopatra crys you cry when shes happy your happy it's like your by her right side ruling with her .the 1999 movie supposdley compared to this book was nothing like it the book has details i never knew a human could fish out about a queen that lived 2,000 years ago."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I finished this tomb about a week ago and still cannot get it out of my head! Definately worth the commitment to read. Highly readable, engrossing, and enlightening. Ms. George gets an A!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"After reading Margaret George's other outstanding books, The Autobiography of Henry VIII and Mary Queen of Scots and the Isles, I decided to read Memoirs of Cleopatra. This book was magnificent! By the second chapter I was hooked! The descriptive writing was moving and enchanting! I loved the lush detail, personal views from Cleopatra, and the scenery. I felt as if I was with her throughout out her life and known her. This is the only book that 900 pages seems to be not enough. This book was illuminating, enlightening, and entertaining! I highly recommend this book to everyone. Please do not judge this book by the ABC production CLEOPATRA. This book is the real thing!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Cleopatra was an intelligent and articulate woman, involved in two monogamous relationships, mother of 4, and politician whose post was that of Queen of Egypt. Ms. George held me spellbound with this historic icon she brought to life in some 900+ pages. The characters were fully fleshed out and maintained their individuality throughout the text. There were a couple of myths I expected George to dispel surrounding the death of Cleopatra's second &quot;husband&quot;, the Battle of Actium, and her death by snake bite. At all times however, each event was seen through the eyes of the characters and what is currently known about the event. As a reader I came away enlightened, educated, and refreshed. I completed the reading within 10 days and was sorry there weren't more pages. It was so easy for me to let the world pass me by while I accompanied the Queen on her tragic journey through her life in the last century B.C. Most tasteful and steamiest romantic passages I've read. It was the most natural feeling of euphoria I've ever experienced. Gore Vidal eat your heart out!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have to say I could not put this book down. This book was so fascinating and so very passionate. It made me laugh, it made me cry and it made me see Cleopatra as the woman she truly was--smart,intelligent, pretty, determined, ambitous and so very passionate. Not only passionate for her men. She was passionate about her country, her ancestry, her children. She was passionate about everything she believed in and loved. She was an independent woman way, way before her time. Margaret George is a brillant writer. The imagery, the description of Egypt, Rome and other lands was so very detailed and elaborate. I could picture myself there, back in those times. Cleopatra truly was a fascinating woman. As a woman myself, I find she's someone I can admire. This is my #1 book of all time."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margret George does true homage to the legend of Cleopatra. She dispels the overdone, glitzy image of this very intelligent and sometimes ordinary woman. From Ceasar to Marc Antony, George keeps her characters true, staying away from the commercialized view of these historic people. A definite read for anyone intrested in Egypt, Rome or romance and intrigue."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"For all those reader's out there who suffer from insomnia, like myself. This is the book for you. Why, is it boring I hear you cry. No not in the slightest, but it is a heavy tome and the sheer weight of it will probably tire you out. Joking apart, as with all of Margaret Geor4ge's offerings, it is well written, well researched and well put together.The book is told in the first person and as the title suggests it is about the happenings in the life of the very young Egyptian Princess and the fights she had with her brother who should take over the rule of Egypt after their father the pharaoh died. Follow on with her dalliance with the great Julius Caesar and ultimately her love for Mark Anthony. A love that finally brought about her death at her own hand.Although the book is a novel,the background is expertly researched and would be of interest to anyone interested in Egyptology, as well as the ordinary reader who will read it simply because it is a good story."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This novel really let you inside the life of Cleopatra, however, unlike most people, I was not sympathetic toward her. My favorite historical figure is Octavian and he is made out to be an evil, blood-thirsty, unintelligent monster, as opposed to the brilliant man that he was. He had an amazing impact on Roman history, and while he may have been ruthless at times, his impact on the world is undeniable. He wasn't an idiot like George made him out to be. I actually felt myself rooting against Cleopatra, but I'm biased. However, the rest of the novel is amazing, and I could not put the book down. Even though I have studied Roman history, and I knew the outcome, I still was interested and enveloped in the story. Even though it is long (over 900 pages), I wish it was longer and was actually upset when I finished it. I felt like Marc Antony was made out to be somewhat weak and a \\"wimp\\", but that is probably an accurate depiction of him. Some things about the story are obviously innaccurate, like her younger brother's dying of the consumption, when in reality it is thought that she most likely poisoned him. She herself was a ruthless woman, who sought power and used her sexuality to her advantage.The novel, although having some criticisms, was impossible to put down, and it is definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book was in Excellent condition!!!! Like New!!!! Thanks, I will enjoy reading it....It is better then the Review the seller gave it....These books by Margaret George are wonderful....Great Escapist Fare!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Really enjoyed this book. I felt like I was actually reading her real memoirs and hd to keep reminding myself that it was historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I am so into historic novels and this one does not disappoint. It does drag on a bit during all those wars and names of the kings and generals but most are not that important to the book, just shows that there was a lot of research involved.I am one who looks up words I do not understand and write in the margins ie: trireme, natron, silphion or what the six seeds Persephone ate signified. Fascinating. Thank goodness for Dictionary.com. As I write this, it shows some of these words are spelled wrong. Look them up.Makes me wonder how it was living as an average citizen in this time.At 963 pages (I also read the authors notes), it gets a bit wearisome and I am only on page 633. Not yet finished but getting there.I'll be ready for something lighter. At best, shorter."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Historical fiction is my favorite genre but I hadn't read much about this era, mostly 13th to 17th century European history. The first few chapters were somewhat slow to me, but once I got into it I could not put it down. Cleopatra's life was fascinating and Margaret George told her story well. Of course not all of it was solid fact as there are not good records kept about Cleopatra, but the story was very interesting and I learned a lot. This book turned me into a Margaret George fan and I am excited to read her other works."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Although a long book, every word is fascinating, and I could not put it down. I've read a few reviews that claim this book is a mere \\"bodice-ripper,\\" but those reviewers could not have read the whole book. This is a well-rounded account of a very interesting life in all aspects. The author does an excellent job of bringing this story to life and making the reader feel like a witness. I'm sad to have finished the book, since reading it was such an enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"At almost a thousand pages, you would think it would take forever to read. Not so! I am preparing for an upcoming trip to Egypt and thought I would get in the mood by reading about ancient Egypt. I use historical fiction to spark my interest in actual historical accounts. I found this book entertaining and informative. It certainly took a different perspective on Cleopatra who has previously been depicted as a power hungry seducer.This book, as the title suggests, is told from Cleopatra's perspective, her memoirs. Cleopatra points out that history is told by the victorious. Her, fictional, account of her life is meant to ensure that her side is preserved for all time. Since this is my first real look at Cleopatra (my previous knowledge came from Rome, the HBO series, and my recall of high school Shakespeare), I cannot comment on the historical accuracy/inaccuracy of the book. However, Margaret George weaves an intricate tale of a heroine whose only self-acknowledged objective was the continued success of Egypt. I lost a bit of sleep this past week, but I do not begrudge the time spent reading this book! This book definitely achieved the objective I set for it - inspiring further historical reading on Cleopatra and ancient Egypt. Now if I could just figure out which book out there is a true account of Cleopatra's life!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I will not give a long review, others have done much better than I care to. What I will say is that this is the second novel by Margaret George that I've read and thus far she never disappoints to deliver a riveting tale. I found that this novels only weakness was that the author disregarded African and ethnic diversity. The authors need to white-wash the Ptolemy bloodline, and harp on Cleopatra's ethnicity was a bit irritating, to say the least."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George has a way with words. This is my first MG book and what a book to start with! I confess, it took me a while to get into it, though I appreciated what I read I was not pulled in. The book is a staggering 956 pages (if you don't include th authors notes etc.) and while the book read like poetry at times it also got tedious in the explanations of things; such is history though. Though I know that Julius Caesar and Cleopatra's relationship is very much more romantic in the book than it was in life, it was easy to sucumb to getting swept away in a literary crush on MG's Caesar. I felt the frustration's of the Egyptian Queen as well as the swell of love and pride for her children and her Antony. I had before a disdain of Octavian but in the book found myself expressing aloud agreements in finding his cold fiendish actions a neverending well. I don't imagine myself ever reading this for a second time, but I am glad I read it a first."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I purchased this book at the Field Museum in Chicago at a Cleopatra exhibit back in 2001...and finally got to read it. Indeed, George took me back in time and had me right there next to Queen Cleopatra. Margaret George's descriptive writing, without being \\"wordy,\\" allowed me to create amazing images of the wardrobes, architecture, unbridled partying in Rome, and battles that made my heart pound. I was almost sad to finish the book...wanting more of that time and place.I am a history buff, particularly art history, and this book satisfied my thirst. I highly recommend this book, despite it's daunting size, for anyone interested in Cleopatra, her romances, and Egyptian or Roman culture. Granted, this is \\"historical fiction,\\" but George does base her writing on research. I am looking forward to reading her other novels, and just ordered Mary Magdeline. Mary, Queen of Scotts is next."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I am a lover of historical fiction and a librarian recommended this book to me. It was well worth the effort to read it. I remember taking it (lugging it) to the public pool to read in the summer of 1999. So it has been a few years. I re-read it once since and would like to do so again. Don't wonder, read it! You'll learn something."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra is my third Margaret George novel. I love the way George lets the reader immerse him/herself in the world inhabited by her subjects. She makes it easy to imagine what that world looked like, and even what it smelled and tasted like. Several readers have objected to her descriptions of the many sumptuous banquets and elegant articles of clothing, but that's what makes the foreign become so tangible. But, while I whole-heartedly loved Mary, Queen of Scots and The Autobiography of Henry VIII, I don't feel I can recommend Cleo quite so highly.While George successfully creates the sensual and exotic feel of Ancient Egypt, I didn't find the story truly compelling until about 50 pages from the end. (And I had to wade through 900 pages of less-than-compelling story to get there!) I knew little of Cleopatra's story other than that she liked her men Roman and soldierly, but her story wasn't really very interesting until Cleopatra's and Antony's last days in Egypt, waiting for the arrival of Octavian. The anxiety of waiting for their inevitable destruction made their previously rather dull relationship interesting at last. Their passionate and romantic deaths were beautifully rendered, and made the previous 900 pages somewhat worthwhile.I look forward to reading George's future books (and I'm very curious to see who she tackles next), but wouldn't recommend this one unless you've a lot of time to kill."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"15 STARS AND 10 THUMBS UP!!!! I am only 12 years old but am a very picky book critic. This is truly the most descriptive, yet lovely book, I have ever read with its passionate romances and day by day account of the Battle of Actuim. You may not take my word on this because I am only 12, but beleive me: THIS IS THE GREATEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!!!!All the while through this book, I was constantly thinking that I was Cleopatra in my other life because it all felt so real and it was like I was a living, breathing person right there with Caesar, Antony and Ocavian. I could have sworn I met Caesar or Antony before in my life because the book allowed you to plunge into the mind of Cleopatra and enabled you to meet Casar and friends. She was so lucky to have friends like Mardian and Olympos and I felt as though I had met them too. There was such good character development!!!!!!! I don't think I will ever get over this book!!!!!! Once I finished reading this 900+ pages book, I was so sad that my life with Cleopatra had ended and I had to get into my time machine and travel back to 1999. But I found a way that I could still live with Cleopatra!!!!!! Read the book again!!! So that is what I did and I am now reading it for the 3rd time. You may think that the story will just repeat and it will be boring but you have forgotten about all the facial expressions, descriptions of scenery, and conversations!! The book is like a new book every time I read it but I think I can blame that on my bad memory!!! Oh, if only there were a rating that was more than 5 stars, I would no doubtedly give it that!!!! F I N I S"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George is a wonderful researcher and there is no denying that, however, did she have to throw every single bit she dug up into the book?The story of the young Cleopatra was fascinating. I liked the little girl that Cleopatra was and how she had to grow up real quick. I couldn't stand the older Cleopatra.The the first few hundred pages were worth reading, but not the rest. I put this book down several times only returning because I hate leave books half read."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have read MANY books about history and I have found that Margaret George writes a fascinating account of history. SO easy to read and SO enjoyable! I have read ALL of her books and look forward to new ones. This books brings to life the Cleopatra history forgets. The mother she was and the Great ruler of her Beloved Egypt. She would even rival Elizabeth the First. I highly recommend this book for history fans who like to read a well written account of history. Some parts Ms. George does explain are fictional but they are small and more often than not this has to be done since actual accounts of ancient history do not survive or were not written."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Pretty historically acurate, very interesting, but long. If you don't want a long read don't get this book. It's 1000 pages. I loved this book. It kept me enthraled from begining to end."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I started off reading this book on fire! I couldn't get enough. All points that were made were relevent and interesting. There seemed to be a point. About halfway through, it started to feel a little tedious and too many minute and unimportant details were replacing interesting ones. By the time I was 2/3 through it, it was all I could do to make myself pick it up. It was reading like a history book with entirely too many little redundancies. This book would've been marvelous if the editor had been more on-the-ball.I've read every Margaret George book so far except Mary Queen of Scotland and the other's are top-notch in every way. This was just ok---a mediocre work by a normally brilliant author."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This plodding tome, belaboured with endless detail, is a testament to Ms. George's research ability but unfortunately, does not translate into a readable work. It was a real let down, as I loved her two previous works and have reread both more than once. I couldn't put those books down, but in this case, I couldn't pick it up! Cleopatra the woman go lost in the detailed descriptions and history. If you're considering buying this book because you loved her other books - think again!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George has painted flat and unrealistic characters with no flaws. She would have us believe Cleopatra and Caesar were wise and benevolent rulers without any emotions. Nineteen year old Cleopatra, too often, speaks in the voice of a 21st century, thirty year old woman. It seems George knows her history however, she papers over her characters' documented bad behavior with made-up excuses and sometimes she ignores historical facts altogether.This book is for people looking for lush and extravagant romance novels with gilded ships, jewel encrusted furniture and silk robes. For those who like good historical fiction, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book is MASSIVE and I envy you if you haven't read it yet. If you're looking for a HUGE book that is easy to read, fascinating, absorbing, well-researched, and fun then this is the book for you. This book is a luxurious escape and I accidentally learned a lot too."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I bought this book because I love Cleopatra & her story. Unfortunately it was not all I was hoping for. Don't get me wrong there are some parts that are extremely exhilirating but in between those moments the story line moves really slow. It got to the point that I finished the book not because of the story but simply because it's so thick I wanted to be able to say I finished a book that was more than a thousand pages long."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I am an avid reader with a bordering obsession in Egyptology....Hands down my Favorite book of all time. A trully gifted Author, who's done her homework.. I could swear to you, I saw the world through Cleopatra's eyes while reading this Unbelievably DETAILED Novel....COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!!!!!!!! A Must !!!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra is a mammoth novel, both in size and scope. Crammed full of historical events, real-life characters and period detail, it breathes new life into the familiar story of the fabled Queen of Egypt.The book revolves around a triumvirate of finely crafted characters: the ambitious Cleopatra, the aloof Caesar, and the vacillating Antony. While the tale occasionally bogs down under its sheer weight--I felt like I needed a scorecard to keep track of all the characters--it is nonetheless a riveting read.Margaret George is a fine writer, skillfully depicting epic battles, palace intrigues, and tender intimacies. At times, as Cleopatra reflects upon her life or upon human nature, George's prose is profound and takes on the beauty of poetry.I think this book would appeal to just about anyone who likes historical fiction. Don't let its size intimidate you."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"At first I was intimidated by the length of the book. I got past that once I opened it, it was a little long winded in the beginning but I somehow couldn't put it down and by the end was wishing it had a sequel."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have to admit I am in love with Cleopatra. After all, she is one of the very women who have made her mark on the history of time. Margaret George writes a beautiful fictional story based on Cleopatra's life."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I appreciated the author's prodigious research which is necessary to truly capture all aspects of Greco-Egyptian society, and move the story forward. The central character of Cleopatra is compelling enough, but when you add in all of the major figures of the Cleopatran era you get a colorful pastiche of drama, history, and romance. Yes, at times it seemed overlong, but the ending was satisfying, and made the journey worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Of all works of fiction, this book certainly gives the most indepth account of the fascinating and tragic Queen of Egypt.The author has clearly done extensive research and aquits this research well, in an entertaining and exteremly informative way.Not only does she have an impressive array of books and documents that she studied before embarking on this work, but she travelled to Egypt, Rome, Israel and Jordan, and spent four years working on this epic.The author explains that her sympathy is with Cleopatra, and that much of the documentation of her story, was compiled at the behest of her arch-foe Octavian, and that some of her enemies included writers and poets such as Cicero, Vergil, Horace, which assured that her version of events would be silenced and the accounts would be skewed against her.The author explains that the popular modern idea that Cleopatra was unattractive is incorrect, and that the way that coins and statues were done in those days would have made her look less attractive certainly.The author gives a credible explanation of the death of her second brother Ptolemy, from comsumption,and the truth is we do not know how he died, and there is no conclusive evidence that she did indeed have him murdered.The book is not only a window into the lives of Cleopatra, Julius Ceasar, Mark Antony and Octavian, but also a portrait of the world of the time, taking us from Egypt to Nubia, Rome, Syria, Anatolia Judea, Armenia and Pathia.George fills in with an amazing cast of Cleoptra's retinue, such as her chamberlain,the eunuch Mardian, her physician Olympos, and her brilliant Hebrew finance minister, Epaphroditus. The book begins with a fictional account of the rescue of the three year old Cleopatra from a sea accident in which her mother is drowned, Cleopatra's growing up in the Egyptian royal court of Alexandria, the schemes of her sisters Cleopatra and Berenice, the death of her father, the arrival of Julius Ceasar and the incident of her being smuggled to him in a rug, the battles with her siblings, the first Ptolemy and Arsinoe, her romances with Julius Ceasar and then Antony ,and the tragic and ill-fated defeat of Cleopatra and Antony, by the ruthless and scheming Octavian, which could so easily have gone the other way.One finds oneselves biting ones nails at the end of the book, dealing with Cleopatra's cartivity and her suicide.A compelling novel, which I read in a week.Filled with brilliant diaologue and description."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Of course, being a work of fiction, a few of the facts in this book will be off, and some characters may have never existed, but this book is rewarding in itself. Overall the story was accurate. Cleopatra is portrayed as a strong woman with a mind of her own, yet vulnerable, with many hardships to go through by herself. I must say that the only thing I disliked was the character of Marcus Antonius. He seemed so childish and unable to make a decision for himself that he didn't seem to mesh well with Cleopatra. However, the story is beautifully written and deserves all of five stars and more. This was my first Margaret George novel...Mary, Called Magdalene will be my next one."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but was I distracted by one repeated inaccuracy. The author places Cleopatra frequently within the Roman pomerium--a place where no sovereign monarch was permitted. It threw me off, but as always, I enjoyed Margaret George's wonderful writing."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This was the first piece of historical fiction I'd ever read. I loved it. I was captivated by the detail of daily life in Cleopatra's time period. The expert weaving of historical fact with the lifestyle and customs of the time was remarkable. Ms. George has definitely done her research. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"First of all, I love the author(if you get a chance, buy some of Margaret George's other books). I like the fact that Mrs. George makes her characters realistic. By that I mean that she not only writes about the events in Cleopatra's life, but also includes everything from what she thought to what she wore. I also suggest that you read the author's notes in the back. Mrs. George has really done her homework. She is very thorough and detailed. Nevertheless, not boring by anymeans! I thoroughly enjoyed it. I could not put the book down!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"A very long book, but not the least bit boring. She did an excellent job making the subject matter come alive. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book is in perfect condition! I am very pleased with my purchase from this bookseller, and I will purchase from them again with no hesitation."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I read at lunch and am still reading this book!! It mixes facts with the everyday life and you get totally enthralled in it and time just passes by!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"It took me forever to finish this and not just because it's long. George goes into such detail about even the most mundane things that there are times when it was a bit of a bore to me. Quite frankly, I almost gave up on the book, which is something I almost never do.I persevered, however, and I must admit that despite the issues I had, it is an achievement. After finishing, there is a real sense that you have witnessed Cleopatra's entire life even if the historical narrative differs with what is presented in the bookRecommended for the patient reader"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I read this book because I have enjoyed reading historical fiction in the past - this book blew me away - the author is so good at capturing a moment in time and the feelings of Cleopatra. From what I have read, much of this book is pretty true to actual events - obviously, she had to fill in Cleopatra's thoughts and feelings, but I feel she did her justice and really seemed to embrace her. I had no interest in anything Egyptian until I read this book, now I'm itching to learn more about that time and also more about Rome and its leaders. Although the book is long, she keeps the reader engaged and interested - I never wanted to put it down and felt swept away to a mystical place while reading it. One of those books you don't want to end."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I loved every minute spent reading this book. I did not want the story to end. This book will NOT dissapoint."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This is a great book. I love this author and have read several of her jother books. The seller shipped very quickly and bood arrives in good condition."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"When I received this book in the mail, I noticed it was nearly 1,000 pages long! I thought I'd never get through it, but the minute I started reading it I could barely put it down. This is a page turner and will not disappoint. It is a terrific account of Cleopatra, Cesar, Antony and all the events that happened during their lifetimes. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"As with all of George's books, The Memoirs of Cleopatra is rich in detail and the characters are well developed. With George I feel transported, like I am there, an actual observer - not just a reader who sets the book down for the night and leaves it for a month! I read this book and Colin Falconer's at the same time. There is no comparison. George's characters seem real - not wooden as Falconer's do. They have depth - their strengths and weaknesses are all there. She makes me think about Cleopatra as a real living woman - if you read one book about Cleopatra make it this one."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This is quite possibly my favorite book. I couldn't get enough of it and was sad when it was over. George's detailed descriptions incorporate all of the senses as she gives you Egypt and Rome in vivid color, thick with emotion. She subtly creates a world for you to get lost amongst, and when you are done, Cleopatra and her life stay in your blood for a long time after."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"If you're looking for a good book this is the book to read. Margaret George writes as if she was with Cleopatra all her life. She uses great detail and knows what she's writing about."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Such books it is difficult to rate: the characters - Cleopatra, Caesar, Marc Antony - are so legendary and their story is so generally wide-known and notorious that it is nearly to impossible to percept them as humans that ever lived. And often I couldn't reading this beautiful book - they were so beautiful, daring and head-strong, ruling empires and proving how challenging and fleeting luck can be. This book reads slowlier than two other splendid books by this author: to savour all details (that are the main asset of the book and sometimes turn into its drawbeck)you need time and mood - you feel scent of burning incense, weight of golden necklaces, crispy cool cotton dresses, clanking of breast plates, dust and sweat of Roman crowds - and million of other sensations that the author weaves into thin tapestry enwrapping you. Another note: this novel contains a dozen more love scenes than her other books (it's a story of love and power, in the end). Some scenes make you choke with tears (Caesar's burial, death of both protagonists), some makes you admire enormous wealth of the ancient Egypt. I can only add that 4th book by Ms. George will be an anticipated gift to me."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I've loved all George's books but I can't seem to get to the end of Cleopatra. The first 700 pages were fine, the next 100 I found myself skimming for action and the last 150 pages I can't seem to finish. Of course, we all know how it ends so I find myself thinking, &quot;Grab an asp and get this over with already! &quot; I have finished 10-mile runs that required less stamina than this book! Forewarned is forearmed...be prepared to spend a LONG, LONG time with this book. It is good, but I'm not sure it's THAT good."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I am not averse to reading long novels. In fact, I am a Michner fan, which says it all about long novels. This book could have been done in about 500 pages, but plodded along for an extra 500. It is rich in detail and tells the story of one of the world's more interesting women. I must admit that I learned things I did not know, but there is a limit as to how much detail is necessary in describing every banquet, every outfit, every sunrise and sunset on the Nile. Enough is enough. I made it to the end and I am not sorry I read the book - just sorry it wasn't shorter."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I read and enjoyed Margaret George's Autobiograpy of Henry the VIII, and liked how she made Henry into a very real character. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed in her treatment of Cleopatra. As a character, her actions were predictable and almost devoid of any sort of feeling or emotion. I found myself comparing this work with William Bostock's &quot;I Cleopatra&quot;, and for all its faults, Bostock's work far exceeded George's in terms of characterizations, flow, and historical accuracy. Im sorry, I would like to rate this work higher, but in all good conscience cannot."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Loved this book. I have been fascinated by Cleopatra and Egypt all my life so when I stumbled upon this book I had to read it. Well worth it."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I love this book. It was well researched and what I love most about it, is I had to watch both seasons of the ROME series just to see it all again. The only thing I wish was not present in the book is minor, if even mentionable because the story is rich and made me wish to see it all as it was. The word shudder is used over and over again like a thesaurus was forgotten. It was a delight to read though and I'll reread it and tell others about this great book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I find there is so much more details than is needed, I know her books are good but by the time I'm half way throughI loose interest."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I remembered nothing about her history from my school days, so this really brought history to life for me. The story was really well written and the author's research must have been tremendously extensive. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have never read a better novel about Cleopatra. I felt as if Ms. George had really gone back in time and wrote this from experience. This book goes from Cleopatra's childhood through her marriages until her death. It delved into her friendships and the history of the battles she fought. Cleopatra has come alive in this book. It was so hard to put the book down. As it's very long book you have to put it down, but the book is done in Chapters and Scrolls, so you can find a great place to stop and then you can pick right up where you left off. This book is a marvel. The detail that went in to it, the historical facts and the way they were seemlessly integrated made this book come to life. While I read it, I really felt it was Cleopatra talking and Ms. George made me forget that it wasn't written by Cleopatra or that it was a novel. I was able to lose myself in the book completly."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book transports you to another time so well that you feel your face twisting with pain or relief with every page. When Caesar was assasinated I actually cried. When Cleopatra began to fall in love with Marc Antony I was knee deep in backreading every page because I thought he was so sweet. Now that I have finished this book I wish there was another to replace it. I feel almost cut off from the reality of Cleopatra's time as if it were my own life. I will be a studying Egyptologist soon and have always been fascinated with the Ptolemaic dynasty especially because of Cleopatra. This book will be treasured. Thank you Ms. George for the time machine."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"What a book! I reluctantly finished the novel last night and miss Cleopatria, Mardian, and friends already. No one but Margaret George is able to so fully immerse the reader in the period and lives of her subjects. This is no romance novel, but historical reading. She is able to successfully, seamlessly tie historically accurate detail after detail together in a fascinating, can't-put-it-down tale."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"If you're looking to learn something about Cleopatra in the most enjoyable way possible, this is your book. It's not a masterpiece, but it's competently written, a fascinating story, and impressingly well-researched. Don't be TOO put off by the length - it will beguile you for just that much longer!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"The size of the book should not deter anyone from reading it- believe me you will not be disappointed nor with any of Margaret George's other books. In this particular book, the reader is gently but completely uprooted and replanted in Ancient Egypt where all senses come alive with the sights,sounds, smells,tastes and even touch of a culture and time that has long been viewed with much interest and fascination. This book is a &quot;keeper&quot;."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I am a 13 year old teen who would like to praise this book, so please take me seriously. The way Margaret George brings to life the characters and makes it seem all so real is something that I had never read in a book before. Such detail... such wonderful writing and such detail... blows me away. Even though I'm only 13, take my word for it: The Memoirs of Cleopatra is a fantastic surprising novel that is a great read for the summer. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I have always been fascinated by the wonders of Ancient Egypt, and I eagerly attacked this book--I could not put it down! Margaret George vividly brings to life Egypt (and Rome, etc.) with plenty of detail. I could picture myself as Cleopatra, providing for and defending my country. And even though the book is long, the story is well worth the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"George brings her characters to vivid life in ancient Egypt and ties together all of the myths and legends around queen Cleo. Wonderful imagery and rounded characters make this book a definite page turner. Romance and history together in one wonderful story!! A must read."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"George is a powerhouse of a writer! This is a truly captivating novel with outstanding depth of character and accurate historical detail. My all-time favorite book. Thanks a million Margaret! I will read and reread this one many times."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I was excited to find this book. However intimidating the number of pages, I took it on and found it to be a great story. I was impressed with the intense insight you have being inside Cleopatra's life. But Caesar and Marc Anthony are figured so prominately in the novel, it also provides a great picture of those historical figures as well. So many people I've talked to didn't even know Caesar and Cleopatra shared a child! Men, don't be shy about picking up this book. It's not a romance novel. It's a great crystal ball of history of an very active time."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Read this book if you would like to see what Cleopatra would have been like if she had've been a modern corporate super-mom.While the story reads well and fluidly, Cleopatra is incongriously well informed for an ancient ruler and has a utopian court of dedicated people around her who all love her dearly. Ancient rulers would have been extremely jealous! She also has the benefit of historical hindsight as she is able to predict with certainty most future events that the likes of Antony are unable to.If all she wanted for her children was a stable Egypt and she was the only one to predict Octavian's treachery - why did she demand the additional lands from Antony when she would have certainly known that this would give him the ammunition he needed to destroy Antony in the eyes of the mob?Cleopatra was a canny poltican of her day, and at least equally as conniving as any of them. This book exonerates her completely and does so with some narrative clumsiness."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I've read and reread a lot of books, but this is the first book I've ever wanted to reread before I finished it the first time! This book (and Cleopatra's life) read as nonfiction, but George's thorough research makes the topic even more interesting, knowing that the major events are true. If you love historical fiction, if you love powerful rulers and court intrigue, if you love lovers and their pitfalls, this book is for you. You get to peer into the mind and heart of one of the most powerful and intriguing woman the world has ever seen. Even though you know how it must, how it does end, you can't help but wish they would only listen to her or that she would rethink this decision or that. You will see the potential they had to create a new world, admire her bravery and character, and sorrow in the fact that she dreamed ahead of her time. Her spirit stays with you long after you turn the last page. I'm thinking of buying a second copy to loan to my friends and family, because I can't bear to part with my original copy."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I for one am a complete fan of Margaret George. I have fallen in love with the characters she portrays not just in Memoirs of Cleopatra but in her other two novels as well. The vivid language told from the eyes of the great queen herself captures the land of ancient Egypt like no other thing has before. If you are a true historical fiction fan this book is a must. If you're not it's still worth reading just so you know how a book is supposed to be written. I for one hope she continues to write novels and I cannot wait for what I am sure will be another trimuph of a book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This started out great and I enjoyed the book up to Ceasar's death. After that, it seems that all Cleopatra did was have sex, obsess about Antony, throw banquets, and repeat. This book should have been about 500 pages shorter! Henry the Eighth is still my favorite."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"The content of this book is spectacular. As soon as I had read a page, this book grabbed my interest. I loved reading about Cleopatra's life, through her own eyes. I felt as if I was there with her and she actually did write the book. I would recommend this to anyone, for it is a very enjoyable book and a definate page turner. I could not stop reading it!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I was completely caught up in this book. I truly enjoyed it. I can't wait to read her other books."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book has done a wonderful job of painlessly educating me about Cleopatra and her relationship with Rome. Although the length may be quite daunting, the book moves quickly. I feel as though I know Cleopatra and truly yearn to know more. I flew through the last two hundred pages in anticipation for Anthony's heartbreaking defeat. All in all wonderful but may have been pared down by a few hundred pages."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This was the best book I have read in years. It had every form of writing stlye all meshed into one great novel. (History, mythology, romance, suspense, horror) I highly suggest anyone with interest or not in the life of Cleopatra to read this book. Excellent!I have never read a Margaret George novel until I read this &quot;Memoirs of Cleopatra&quot;. She now has a new fan."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"If you want to escape your present surroundings, read this book. I have read hundreds of book and I would have to say this is one of my favorites. From the very beginning and up to the last page, I experienced ancient Egypt through Cleopatra's eyes and I couldn't put the book down. Although I knew the ending, I was wishing that Margaret George would pull a fast one and have a different ending. You WILL enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"While I must admit that in the begining the book seems overwhelming, once started, I found it to be a true page turner. I read every word, even the ending by the author. It is a truly wonderous blend of true hystorical fact with story line. I picked up the book on a whim, not having an opinion on cleopatra either way and am now SO GLAD I DID!! It was worth the time, money and effort I put into it. I look forward to other works by the author in the hopes what was accomplished in this book will be duplicated again and again."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I liked this book even if it is not in my language(i didn't understand some of it).Everyone who have an interest in egypt,love and history must read this book"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I read this book and immediatly fell in love with Cleopara and Egypt. Margaret George did an excellent job of depicting what it might have been like for the young queen. It was almost like I was in her shoes. If your just looking for a great book this is probably your best choice. I have read many narritives on her. If your an egypt lover or are just looking for a great way to escape this is what you need."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I nervously purchased this immense book, concerned that I wouldn't be able to commit to the time it might take to read it. I was wrong...from the beginning, it pulled me right into ancient Egypt, immersing me in the scents, sounds and life of this legendary queen, who has always fascinated me. If you're looking for a great summer read, a book to get totally lost in , this is the book for you...It is one of my favorite historical novels, right up there with Mists of Avalon...It's a long read, but never boring..Margaret George amazes me---she must have done much research, as I believe, much of the book is fairly accurate in the way history has handed down the story. Don't be scared by the size....you'll be sorry when you've finished it!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I saw the ABC movie and It said that the movie was based on the book. I soon found it in a bookstore and saw it's unprecedented length. My mom said maybe Christmas. A few weeks later I saw it in another store. I read up to 81 within 30 minutes. I realized I had to have this book, for already it had entranced and captivated me. I did get for Christmas indeed, and within a week, I finished. Ms. George is an extraordinary writer, and I highly reccomend this novel.Colin, age 12"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I was almost put off reading this by the relatively large numbers of Customer Reviews from young girls aged 11-14 who seem to LOVE it! Even the angelic Charlotte Church hyped it in an appearance on Jay Leno's show last week, saying it was so marvelous, she is reading it for the second time, and she is also 14 years old. Most of the readers reviewing this book seem not to know that by the time Cleopatra was queen, the period of Ancient Egypt's greatness was long over. She and the other Ptolemy rulers were GREEK, not of the old Egyptian pyramid-builders blood. One even commented that this book reads like a &quot;novel,&quot; apparently not realizing that it IS just a novel, not actually Cleopatra's memoirs. However, it's worth Four Stars as a gigantic literary effort, mostly entertaining even for Adults, Male Adults as well as 14 year old girls, who have an interest in Rome and not-so-ancient Egypt. Why it is almost 1000 pages long is difficult to say, since Cleo wasn't all that old when she got bitten by the asp. For the most part, it IS evocative as some readers have already said, and presents an imaginative panoply of the somewhat decadent period of Egypt's recently-lost greatness. Probably rates the dubious accolade &quot;A good (long) read.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"When ABC did a movie about Cleopatra I read in my TV guide that the movie was based on this book. Although the movie was terrible the next day I was at the library I saw it and checked it out. During the two weeks I had checked it out I was rather busy so after not being able to finish the 900+ page book I bought it. It my second favorite novel and longest book I have ever read. I couldn't put it down and still reread it over and over. It is the most truthful historical fiction I have seen. You feel like you are a character in this lush bedazzaling world of passion and loyalty watching the story unfold like a lotus bloom. You have real feelings for all the characters. In the back of the book there is also some words by the author about which parts of the novel are real and which parts had to be made up( which Ms. George did beautifully). The reason this book is so well written with so many real facts is the author spent many years studying Cleopatra before she wrote a word. If you are up to traveling through a mystic realm of magic read this gem of a novel. It will spellbind you too. FINIS"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"If you wanna book that will \\"take you away\\", take this to the tub instead of Calgon ; ) You'll be transported back to acient Eygpt, to the Roman Empire.....I could not put it down and am puzzled by those who found it boring..?? No way! Cleopatra is a fascinating historical figure and the author transports you back to her time....I liked the fact that her facts are researched so the book is not only a great read but educational to a point....I recommend it highly, esp. to those who love historic novels and anything to do with the Romans, Greeks or Eygpt....."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George does an excellent job in this retelling of the turbulent life of Cleopatra VII. The detail is astounding and every character from Cleopatra herself to much smaller characters like her personal servants is meticulously defined. I would reccomend this book to absolutely anyone interested in ancient history. It's not just a book about Egypt, but Rome also and the great empire's struggle after the death of Julius Caesar. The book is of astounding size, 963 pages, but don't shy away if you don't like large books, the pages of this one seem to melt away as you are transported to ancient Alexandria and the infamous queen's side. The Memoirs of Cleopatra is a finely written and researched book and is nothing short of a masterpiece, George is truly a gifted writer. Read this book, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Ms. George can tell a story. In Cleopatra she adds to her excellent reputation. Previously offering such excellent works as Henry VIII and Mary, Queen of Scots, she hits her objective again in this book. Cleopatra is brought to the reader in startling relief and Margaret George's mastery of the narrative transports you through time and space to live the trials and tribulations of this remarkable historical figure. The secondary characters of this novel are as intriguing as the focus, Cleopatra, and her relationships with them are told in vivid detail. I await with impatience Margaret George's next effort as I have every effort that has come before. Her books are the quintessentially engrossing, rainy day, fireside page turners that we all long to discover. Cleopatra fits this description aptly as well."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"If you prefer your historical fiction to be non stop action or something you could read over a boring weekend...then this probably isnt your cup of tea.If you prefer however a book that makes you feel like you have gone back in a time machine - so rich is the detail painted by Maragret Georges excellent prose that it makes the reader feel as though they are front and center with the real Cleopatra - then you will love this epic tale.While one may know the tales of Cleopatra and her flings with Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and her famous death scene, this book is so much more. George does a tremendous job to recreate the rich settings, hardly documented events and travels in the life of Cleopatra, and customs that abound in the life of the Egyptian royal palace, as well as religion and Egypt itself in such clarity no one can fail but to be awe inspired by Georges account of the times. All-in-all this brings to life the real Cleopatra, not as a superficial 2-dimensional seductress (of Hollywood fame)but as the truly inspiring figure she was and the reason why she is one of few great ancient historical female figures who come to mind when we recall those times. Fom age 3 onwards, we follow her fears, insecurities, courage, will to succeed and claim her destiny, struggles to understand her own country and protect its interests in a Roman dominated world. Its all here. And added to that is the way George shows Cleopatras, intelligence, humour, gentleness, and loyalty and love for her servants, family and followers as well as her lovers - even when they let her down time and time again including Caesar and Antony.Its masterful characterisation that brings you to wish Cleopatra and the apparently nobly lovable (in this account) but flawed Mark Antony had succeeded in overcoming Octavian (later Augustus Caesar)and changed history. And it was oh so close. Thats the gift of a marvellous writer - immersing us so much into a long dead persons mind that you feel so one with them and their thoughts and motives - it is almost as though you were side by side with them willing them on at that time. Truly brilliant writing. Highly recommended to the serious lover of high class historical fiction.As a footnote: The end of the book may leave a bitter taste to the romantics in us; However(little spoiler)..Little Juba II who was paraded in chains by Julius Caesar in one of his many triumphs at age 4 (its in the book and a sweet scene of innocence it is) following his father Juba I's defeat and death in Numibia during the civil wars went on to marry Cleopatra's daughter (paraded in Octavians triumph) and together - after their Roman upbringing - they went on to create a thriving kingdom in Numibia and later Mauretania during a 40 year relationshio full of love. Thus a happy end of sorts."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I must admit a strong bias in favor of works dealing with Ancient Rome and other classical Mediterranean civilizations. Despite being thoroughly familiar with the history and most of the facts contained in this novel, the writing style (written in the form of Cleopatra's diary) gave it enough of a twist to bring fresh perspectives and interest to a story whose ending is certainly known to anyone who saw Elizabeth Taylor reprise the starring role.While I'm sure that scholars from the period might quibble with aspects of the story line, it is after all a novel and I found it highly entertaining as well as educational on occasion."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book is a challenge to devour in bed, as the book itself weighs about 5 pounds... but it's delicous. The historical details are thrilling and keep the reader enthralled from page one to 1001.~ Danielle Rivard"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This is a breathtaking novel about the mysterious Cleopatra. It follows Cleopatra's life from beginning to tragic end. The story is believable, the characters come to life on the pages of this beautifully written book.Not only do you get a close look at Cleopatra's surrounding Egypt, but you also get to know Julius Ceasar and Mark Anthony, as well as the Roman Empire very intimidly. The descriptions of the characters and locations are vivid and memorable. Ms. George does an excellent job of making you feel like you are truly in Egypt and the Roman Empire, with Cleopatra whispering her life story in your ear.This book left me thirsting for more novels about Cleopatra, but I have never found one to be as well written and intruiging as this one.Don't let the size intimidate you. In the end, you'll be glad it lasted as long as it did."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"EXCELLENT book. Helped tremendously to understand the goings-on that led to Cleopatra and Antony's defeat. Full of interesting info about how people lived at the time. Some of their sophistication will surprise you. This book spurred me on to learn more about her."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I am an avid reader, and this book is on my top 5 list of all time favorite books ever. Margaret George writes Cleopatra as fully dimensional; with faults, compassion, power and full emotion. She had done an amazing amount of research and dispels various myths (coming in to see Antony on a barge, etc.)This is a long book but not to be rushed through. The writing is to be absorbed. You feel as if you are in fact living in B.C. Egypt, along with all of her wealth and friends and servants and lovers. When the end eventually came, I missed Cleopatra. I had felt as if I knew her and experienced her life right there with her. An absolutely amazing book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This book is an amazing book. I could hardly put it down and the last two books that I have read after it have paled in comparision to this book. It is one book that you won't want to put down and won't be counting down the pages until it's finished (even though it is 900+ pages). I can't wait to read more about Cleopatria now and read another Margaret George book."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Margaret George has the ability to take the reader back in time and take part in Cleopatra's life. A book I was unable to put down."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"I loved this book - could not put it down. It was a real page-turner and I was very sad to finish it. I wish it had been a couple thousand pages longer!"},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read! I would recommend this book to any one who wants to be taken in to another world. Even though this book is fiction, it is a great way to learn about Cleopatra and what life was like back then. Two of the great things about this book was the description and the characters. George makes the places and the people of this novel seem like real people, not just a bunch of boring figures in a history book. If you are looking for an exciting and entertaining read you will find it in this book. I would recommend any novel by Margaret George because she is a wonderful author as well as a talented researcher."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"An incredible book written in the most exquisite taste. I just wish it never ended. A great story about one of the first women to empower the world. I will read it again. I just don't know when! Oh memory, please fail me now."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel","review":"Having managed to avoid reading much about Cleopatra before, I picked this up only because I enjoyed Margaret George's previous novels. As with her debut &quot;The Autobiography of Henry VIII&quot;, Cleopatra tells her own story through George's pen, proving that George is a master of the first-person narrative (which made me wonder why &quot;Mary Queen Of Scotland and The Isles&quot; was not in Mary's voice--would have made for a better story, in my opinion). Cleopatra is made of stronger stuff than Mary, though, which makes this novel even more enjoyable to read. Another winner from Margaret George!"},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"&quot;There is nothing to fear but fear itself, I'm fear itself,&quot; whispers the killer.Dorie Bell is afraid. A year ago she attended a phobia disorders convention in Las Vegas, and since then three other attendees have died...all by ways they feared the most.FBI agent E.L. Pender has decided to hang up his holster, until he receives the letter from Dorie explaining her fear of what has happened, and that she fears she will be the next victim. Pender begins looking into the deaths of the three victims and questions everything surrounding them, such as...How can a man with a fear of heights jump 19 floors? How does a woman with a fear of blood cut her own wrists in her bathtub? Why would a woman with a fear of suffocation drown herself, and why would no water be found in her lungs?Pender knows someone, somewhere with a connection to the victims is out there, seeking them out, and preying on their worst fears. Can Pender stop the madman, or will Dorie be the next victim?\`Fear Itself' is a fast-paced, shock packed, jolts at every turn of the page thriller that will grab hold and not let go. The creepy plot unfolds on page one, and only gets creepier and more suspenseful with every turn of the page. The killer is twisted and clever, and one of the more original villans in recent novels. The only problem is that the killer's identity is known early on, and while it doesn't ruin the rest of the novel, it would have made a nice additional shock if revealed at the explosive climax.Jonathan Nasaw is making a name for himself in the thriller genre writing scary, twisted, fast-paced thrillers, and with this follow-up to his best-selling novel \`The Girls He Adored' he proves he is going to be around a long time.A great read for thriller fans!Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"This novel is another spin on the popular genre of serial killer tales.Simon is a particularly malicious individual, in search of the ultimate adrenalin high. He discovers early in his sadistic career, that by inducing fear in his victims, the rush is the best he can attain. Mixing drugs and torture, he has found the perfect combination. Simon is a smart killer, sophisticated, and plans his fear games to the last detail. He is also rich and can spend full time exploring this deadly activity.Enter Special Agent Pender, a large, witty and terribly dressed veteran of the FBI on the verge of his retirement. Pender is a likable fellow - he drinks too much, a live-alone divorcee, at the end of a long career. But appearances can be deceiving because this roly-poly officer of the law has been chasing serial killers for twenty years and knows how they think.Dorie Bell is a middle-aged artist with an unusual phobia - prosoponophobia, fear of masks. Simon has her in his reptilian sights and when she least expects it, he strikes and his malevolent activities begin.Nasaw writes his descriptions realistically and effortlessly. He's a visual writer, placing the reader directly into his scenes. As you turn the pages of this novel, the images of Simon's sadistic games appear before your eyes - Nasaw is a fly-on-the-wall- writer, which makes this kind of story that much more enjoyable.As a fan of this genre, I'm intrigued how so many good writers out there can continue to come up with new spins on the ways and methods of the serial killer; Nasaw certainly ranks with the best of them. He seems confident with this genre and writes it superbly well."},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"\\"Fear Itself,\\" by Jonathan Nasaw, stands out from other serial killer novels. Nasaw combines whimsical humor and terror expertly, without either element throwing the novel out of balance. His villain is an incredibly cold and malicious individual; yet, Nasaw fleshes out the murderer's personality so that we understand how he became so monstrous. All of this is packaged in a fast-moving, incredibly exciting and suspenseful story.An unknown assailant is targeting a group of people who suffer from specific phobia disorders (fear of heights, snakes, drowning and masks are some examples). The killer makes the murders appear to be suicides, but one individual, a phobic herself named Dorrie Bell, suspects that these were no suicides. For example, an acrophobic (a person who fears high places) apparently jumped out of a twelfth-story window. Dorrie doesn't buy it.Two unlikely candidates decide to help Dorrie find the out the truth. One is E. L. Pender, an overweight, fifty-six year old Special Agent of the FBI. Although Pender is on the brink of retirement, he cannot resist getting involved in one more case. The other is Linda Abruzzi, a thirty-five year old woman with a disability. Abruzzi stubbornly refuses to leave the FBI, even though her superiors have made it clear that they no longer value her services.Abruzzi and Pender use their considerable skills to track their adversary, who is clever, ruthless and very dangerous. Nasaw ratchets up the tension almost unbearably as the book progresses. The scenes in which the killer confronts the phobics with what they fear most are not for the faint-hearted.The dialogue and plotting in \\"Fear Itself\\" is terrific and the novel is perfectly paced. Nasaw depicts all of the characters, both major and minor, with care and they all contribute to the complex story. The author provides fascinating background information on phobia disorders, which helps the reader to understand and empathize with the plight of the victims. If you have a strong stomach, if you like nasty villains, and if enjoy a dose of both humor and horror with your suspense, pick up \\"Fear Itself.\\" Just be sure to leave the light on."},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"Johnathan Nasaw has done it again. I stumbled upon his Girls He Adored quite by accident and absolute went nuts. When Fear Itself came out I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I was not disappointed. By the time the last 3 chapters came around I had palpitations and had to remind myself to breath. I couldn't read fast enough and yet wanted to slow down to prolong finishing because I didn't want it to end. Agent Pender is wonderful and I hope we are treated to more of him in the future. He's one of the most believeable characters out there. Since Mr. Nasaw's earlier books are out of print, just this last week I tracked down some used copies in Amazon's used book store; can't wait for them to come. If you have never read Nasaw before, treat yourself. Shadows and World on Blood are the other titles I purchased and I expect them to be every bit as entertaining. Grab a copy of Fear Itself, pour yourself some coffee (or whatever) and settle back for a ride you won't soon forget."},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"&quot;Fear Itself&quot; is an excellent book.I read one or two books per week.(that's alot of books)I can easliy say this is now on the top of my favorite list. I haven't read alot by Jonathon Nasaw, but will from now on. The story moves right along and the characters are unforgetable. Each character is unique, not cookie cutter characters that so many books are enguled with today. This novel should be a must read for all mystery/thiller lovers."},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"The second E.L Pender novel by Jonathan Nasaw has a strong plot consisting of a serial killer attacking people with various phobias.Pender nearing retirement recieves a letter from a woman in California who suffers from a phobia, but Pender and new F.B.I. liasson agent Linda don't believe she is with the MDA (Martian Defense Association I believe?)So Pender decides to &quot;unofficially look into the mysterious suicides the letter writer informs them about.Nasaw writes a creepy disturbing thriller, and what's more he makes the telling of the story effortless. There is real subtlety dark humor, touching moments and style in his prose. I read this novel in little over 24 hours that should be a hint about how intense, gripping it is, too many novels are dubbed &quot;compelling&quot; reads but if there is a case where cliche meets fact Fear Itself is that book."},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"While this is not up to par with Nasaw's previous &quot;Girls He Adored&quot;, it is nonetheless an effective, if somewhat muddled, little thriller. The hero, E.L. Pender, continues to be an unconventional hero, overweight, balding, and not someone who stepped out of GQ. His replacement, Linda Abbruzzi, is likewise likeable, considering she has a life threatening disease and the FBI doesn't want her around. Add phobic Dorie Bell as a mask-fearing heroine, and you've got the setup for a tasty thriller.Unfortunately, the sum is not as good as the parts. The villain, Simon Child, is nasty enough, and his relationship with his Down Syndrome sister Missy, is touching, yet repulsive. What hurts the book, I think, is that instead of a tense whodunit, it becames an example of police procedural, and let's see how long we can keep these people tucked away in the basement. Pender's romance with Dorie sometimes gets in the way of the action. Child's reunion with his childhood buddy Nelson Carpenter, is also drawn out to the point of losing its momentum. Although the deaths we share are gruesome and nerve-wracking, they are so coldly presented, they manage to lose some of their impact.And Nasaw missed a great opportunity to finish off his villain. Way late in the book, Dorie remembers what Simon is afraid of--after all, they met a convention for phobics, which he put together to suit his dastardly purpose. Why didn't Nasaw use this fear in the end?Oh well, I don't mean to sound too negative.It's a good book that could have been better.RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"Jonathon Nasaw follows up a great read in ,\\"The girls he adored\\", with this book. It is an easy read though sometimes jumping from two or three different characters point of veiw. A must read for a Nasaws fan. This book is no disapointment after reading it. I recommend this read to anyone. It was a great twist as he used phobia as his target for fear. I look forward to his next creation."},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"I, too, stumbled upon Girls He Adored quite unlike my typical &quot;I know what I'm looking for; I'm not gonna try a risky unknown--&quot; then, looking at the publisher's logo and reading the backjacket, &quot;oookay, mebbe this once...&quot; Girls was exhiliarating! Thus, Ive been waiting for Fear Itself: A Novel like a child waiting to hear reindeer hooves and bells outside on Christmas Eve! omg-- Nasaw did it! Do not begin this book (Fear Itself) unless you have time to totally immerse yourself. I particularly like how Nasaw cleverly weaves a sense of humor (a very risky endeavor, this) into the dark, complex fabric of his characters; be they friend or foe. Keep 'em coming, Mr. Nasaw!"},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"I liked this book just because it was different from every other serial killer/psychological thriller/FBI book out there - and there are a whole lot of those! Our hero was not fresh out of the academy, gorgeous, athletic and brilliant. He was overweight, old and made mistakes. He was feisty enough to become endearing, though. The female lead was not a Clarice Starling clone, she had MS and was deskbound! The book does not have a happy ending and that was just stunning to me after years of reading the same old plots and having them neatly wrapped up at the end, in a manner that surely does not happen in real life. The story unfolds in an unusual manner because the killer is revealed like four minutes into the story, but there's still plenty of book left and it doesn't turn out to be a letdown that you already know whodunnit. In addition, you learn some new things about phobias after reading this book. There are some nasty deaths in here, but not so gory that you have to skip paragraphs to get back to the story. And there's no detailed sex! Could be a drawback for some, but personally, if I wanted to read that, I wouldn't have picked up a novel. The phobia killings were an interesting hook but I only gave it four stars because the book wasn't intriguing enough to keep me running back for more. It's worth a read just to experience something different in fiction for a change."},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"If the first Pender book was by turns revolting, scary, and creepy...this one tries to be, but has a lighter tone. Pender is great fun (I wish we had more of Sid, the wise cracking, dapper best friend to Ed), but we don't get even get as much of him. Linda is a decent character, who is not fleshed out. We get a lot of Simon Childs (not real clever with that name, but oh well), who is fascinating in theory, but only fairly interesting in reality. I would have liked more Pender. The book is good in that it does not dwell too long on any one chase (as the last book did at times). The last one worked for pure scare factor, this was more fun, but there are many better thrillers out there. Oh, and why is Nasaw always trying to show us that he must have scored well on his Verbal SATs? I wonder what he is trying to overcompensate for. Still, I'd welcome another Pender novel, but I hope he enjoys his retirement first."},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"The best book I have ever read. Jonathan Nasaw does it well.

Almost like a drawn out definition of \\"FEAR\\" itself.And I mean the \\"word\\" fear itself."},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"I'm being generous with a 2 star rating, gripping this story was not. I had put this book down several times and it was shear stubbornness that I made myself finish it. Revealing the killer in the first quarter of the book lost my interest.I experimented in reading the remaining chapters by skipping all sections that had reference to the killer 'Simon'and a really obscure section dealing with his sister. This did not present any problems in following the storyline. I have read many thriller stories dealing with FBI investigations and this had to be the sloppiest. Skipping sections of the book sped up the reading considerably and shortened the story, thankfully.If this killer was using 'fear', it was a poor attempt. Just pick anyone off the street and torture them, you'll get the same results. I really want to give this one star, I'm just sorry that I spent the time finishing it."},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"I went looking for this book, having been told by a friend who had it on her to read list that it involved a serial killer, targeting phobics, and using their worst fears against them.Wow, I thought, what a great idea for a plot. And it is, it really is. But that's where the great part ended.The writing style was pretty much average for this type of novel. The ideas behind some of the characters were really good, original, potentially interesting, but that's again where it ended. In the idea stage. When it came time to develop, things began to unravel, and then, to rather promptly fall flat. With many years of experience behind him, and retirment in the offing, the main? FBI agent character suddenly goes brain dead, and forgets how to behave like a professional. Instead, he nearly gets one of the victims killed. I didn't buy that anyone with that vast a field of experience, attracted to a witness or no, would suddenly get that stupid. It frankly reeked of agism. Oh yes, and poor characterization.The other partial, Persecuted due to disability, mostly former agent with MS, again, potentially a good character, also continues to hang, fall flat, etc. What she's even doing there is often questionable. Were it not, again, this might also be quite good. The author does have a real sensitivity, on some levels, to the plight of the disabled. Perhaps he should have stayed there.The sister of the killer has downs syndrome. The Killer, who is far too soon revealed, and long before he could really get down to thinking up ever more horrendous ways in which to off his poor victims, frankly what one would expect, considering the idea, yet again, manages to fall flat.Of all the characters, the sister is the one I actually liked best. Her ultimate disposition, however, felt so contrived as to be ridiculous, lead-ins for it, or no. Too, within this story line, there are places he started to go, then didn't. Rather a tendency toward tangents, that, indeed, I found running throughout the work.The other character I liked was the phobic female artist. Having found, only halfway through the book, however, what her fate would be, I set the thing aside. Every now and then, I picked it up, thereafter, to slog on through, having paid full price for the paperback, and hoping it would get better. No such luck. The villain, who goes on the run, looks up old chums, etc., just doesn't manage to overcome the yawning.Perhaps the author's other works are better. If ever I'd be inclined to find out, I'd do it at the library."},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"Fear Itself Jonathan Nasaw( pg 327 Thriller Carmel &amp; Berkley)Agent Pender is cleaning his office out and handing the reins over to Linda Abruzzi. Just like he was outlawed to the vastland of Liaison Support, Linda has been placed here hoping to force out of the FBI. She has just been diagnosed with MS and instead of her supervisors supporting her and helping her with medicaldisability they want her to quit. As she is organizing her new desk she comes across a letter from Dorie who thinks her friends are being murdered by a killer who is using their fears against them. The police reports all point to accidental or suicidal deaths but Linda feels in her gut that this letter is legitimate. After confirming Dorie's story and reviewing the case files it is determined that a stalker is terrorizing people who have phobias. After getting Pender to hang around unofficially on the case and convincing the bosses to set up a task force the story goes south. At this time I get tired of the mini chapters inside each chapter that pulls the plot apart and makes it very difficult to follow the train of thought of the book. Nasaw also compromises the integrity of the case by having too many characters get emotionally attach to the case the ending was forced instead of a smooth conclusion like he did in Girls He Adored."},{"Title":"Fear Itself : A Novel","review":"I had expected a whole lot more.

Prior to this work, he produced seven volumes of a \\"History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850\\" (an eighth volume was published after this work), and he also produced a three volume \\"History of the Civil War 1861-1865\\". In the preface to this one-volume \\"History of the Civil War 1861-1865\\" he states that this is not an \\"abridgement\\" of his prior work, but rather was a \\"fresh\\" study.Originally published by \\"The MacMillan Company\\" in 1917, this new History was awarded the 2nd Pulitzer Prize for History in 1918. Rhodes became known for his detailed research and lack of bias which is consistent throughout all his history works. His balanced treatment of both sides is a rather stark contrast to the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize in History (Jean Jules Jusserand's \\"With Americans of Past and Present Days\\") which was more of a celebration of Franco-American relations.It is interesting while reading this book to think about the way the perceptions of the United States Civil War have changed over the years. As an example, Rhodes has no difficulty in emphasizing slavery and anti-slavery as the primary causes of the war, and since that time it has become more common to see more general references to state rights used, perhaps to cover the ugliness of issue. Another example would be the way History and Historians treat Robert E. Lee. Rhodes has high praise for Lee, though that is not to say that he doesn't point out his mistakes. Lee does not seem to fare so well with modern historians.The discussion of other nation's attitudes towards the war is one of the more interesting sections, at least for me. Though ultimately there was no foreign interference, it is interesting to learn how a different outcome in a battle here and there, could easily have changed things considerably. One also gets a slightly different view on the French position towards the Union than one did from the essay from Jusserand's work, though to be fair the prior work was more focused on their attitude towards slavery and Abraham Lincoln, and not as much on the war and its negative effects on France.Other interesting chapters and threads throughout the book include looking at how the North responded to the draft, especially after it became clear that the war would be won. There is a discussion of the politics and the Democratic Party turning into the Copperheads, while some legitimate opposition positions were lost as a result of the party pushing their opposition to Lincoln and the war. Rhodes also discusses the technology, and the failure to quickly move to breech loading rifles.His discussion of the economics during the war is also very thorough. Obviously there is a discussion on the blockades and blockade running. In addition he discusses the currency problems faced both in North and South, as well as the debt resulting from the war and the consequences to the populations of the Union and the Confederacy. He also looks at the illegal trade between North and South during the war.Not surprisingly, Rhodes gives an excellent and thorough evaluation of the Generals and other figures on each side of the war. In particular, his comparison of the Generals as they come into opposition with each other is particularly well done. While the perception of some of them as changed through time, one can count on an even appraisal in all cases. The same is true for his evaluation of the battles, tactics, and strategies from the perspective of both sides. Of course, there are many good books on the United States Civil War which cover these areas, but just as obviously this book would not be complete without them.One weakness of this history, is that despite Rhodes' claim that this was a fresh study, he does in the very early discussion inform the reader that his discussion of the supporters for disunion was so complete in his three volume history that it is unnecessary to repeat it at length. The result is that one has to wonder how much he is leaving out in this one volume history that was included in his earlier three volume work. Having not read his earlier history, or his larger history of the entire era, it is impossible to judge how much he is leaving out.Along the same lines, his discussion ends fairly abruptly after describing in some detail Lee's surrender, he then briefly mentions the assassination of Lincoln and the surrender of Johnston to Sherman. There is no discussion of the aftermath of the war to balance the discussion of the events leading to the start of the war. These weaknesses are small though when one looks at the overall strength of the book. This one is highly recommended, even after 90+ years."},{"Title":"History of the Civil War, 1861-1865","review":"Purchasers of this classic civil war history need to be aware that the original Macmillan hardcover editions contain 8 full-color, fold-out maps, that you will not likely find in such marvelous form in the print-on-demand paperback reproductions.

As for the accuracy of information presented, I cannot tell but trust the various reviews that I've found on different sources that this is a good book. It sure packs a lot of information into it, and gives a very good over-view of the civil war. The only peeve I have is that the book is rather centered around the east-south-eastern USA. There isn't much mention of what was going on in the north (especially wisconsin where I live where the civil war was very alive) nor the west (there's a few mentions here and there about the west.)

It owes its origin to a BBC radio series on G&S; produced by Baily in 1947. That date is significant because then-elderly people who had attended the first runs of the Savoy operas, and some who had actually known Gilbert, Sullivan, their partner, Richard D'Oyly Carte or performers of the first Savoyard generation, such as Grossmith, Bond and Temple, were moved to offer their reminiscences to Baily before it was too late. Baily had also cultivated the formidable Bridget D'Oyly Carte, Richard's granddaughter, and so had wide access to the archives of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.\\"The Gilbert and Sullivan Book\\" was published in 1952 to great critical and popular success. My own copy is of the revised fourth edition, published in 1956.The book takes the form of a triple biography of W. S, Gilbert, Arthur Sullivan and of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. The outlook of the author is intensely British. To Baily, the D'Oyly Carte tradition is THE tradition. While Americans are not actually described in black and white as barbarians at the gate, the implication is plainly there.Baily was much given to hand wringing about the approaching year 1961, fiftieth anniversary of the death of W. S. Gilbert and the expiration date of the British copyright, which would deliver the pure and innocent G&S; operas into the hands of insidious, non-traditional producers. In point of fact, nothing much took place in 1961 except for the beginning of a series of operatically-oriented recordings led by Malcolm Sargent, an old hand at conducting for the D'Oyly Carte Company. (From that day to this, of course, those Sargent recordings have been applauded by opera fans and dissed by diehard, traditionalist G&S; fanatics.) For the D'Oyly Carte Company, real disaster came in the 1980s, appearing in a form far more sinister than anything Baily had feared: Maggie Thatcher and her penny-pinching government.In the half century that has passed since \\"The Gilbert and Sullivan Book\\" first appeared, indefatigable scholarship has added some details to the story Baily presents: Sullivan's locked diaries, for example, were rather more lurid than Baily suggests and Richard D'Oyly Carte might have been a bit more slippery in life than he is in Baily's pages. Nevertheless, this book remains sound on all the larger matters in the lives of the two creators and unique as a history of eighty years in the life of a production company known the world over.Moreover, more than any of his successors, Baily knew that he was telling an epic. His writing style and the dramatic arch he makes of the rise and fall of a great partnership is unmatched.A solid five stars."},{"Title":"Indian fighting on the Texas frontier,","review":"This collectable book provided me with invaluable insight into the life and times of early pioneers on the Texas frontier. The reader will find many accurate first-hand accounts of historic Texas adventures that took place on the open ranges of west Texas.Protection of the settlers from raids by marauding bands and the recovery of property and kidnapped children were among the feats performed by Captain John M. Elkins (non-uniformed) and his company of rangers. Many episodes were centered in the area of Camp Colorado, Coleman County, Texas along the Colorado River.For the genealogist researching an Elkins Family line in Texas, i.e. Captain John M.

At last the speeches of Lysias have been given the attention they have been long over due. The author has successfully produced a modern translation of the extant works of this great Greek logographer. Lucid and insightful this work is easily accessible for those with a general interest in Ancient History, as well as both A-Level Ancient Historians and undergraduate level students who possess no or limited knowledge of the ancient Greek language.The author's most notable achievement is that of the quality of the translation. Textual emendations and inferred passages are clearly provided, as are the alternate readings and meanings of the Greek text. However, the erudition of both author and book are clearly evident. Each speech is preceded by a detailed introduction outlining important events referred to within the text as well as political ties and historical events that often form the background to the case in question. This often-invaluable introduction is used to highlight effectively the subtleties of the cases but it can be undisputed to state that the true appeal of the book is in its majestic grasp of language. The obvious skill of the author lies in his ability to capture the true atmosphere of the speeches whilst at the same time providing a clear and lucid translation.Whether you possess a general interest in the ancient world or are a student in Classics or Ancient History is irrelevant - academic works simply do not come any better than this!

Like stones on a path that become important only when we stop to notice and often touch, Kate's observations and personal sharing serve to remind me to slow down and notice. This book is next to my bed and read when I need a shot of quiet simplicity."},{"Title":"TouchStones : Little Words of Wisdom","review":"Like Karen Crane had stated, Touchstones is a great self-discovery tool.

It is a useful guide to self empowerment. Each of the 70 words dealt with in the book is insightfully defined and explored. The commentary on the words can be used to give purposeful direction to one's life. The book contains layout systems for use as tools in the daily practice of meditation and enlightenment. These word layouts can also serve as directional guidance for time blocks, such as a day, a month or a year. TouchStones is a very special book. It contains a full spectrum support system available to anyone seeking spiritual help. Or it can simply be used for a gentle lift in someone's otherwise ordinary day. It is a &quot;must have&quot; for the library of anyone on a path of spiritual growth."},{"Title":"TouchStones : Little Words of Wisdom","review":"I have used my copy of Touchstones on a regular basis since receiving it as a gift in June last year. It is a wonderful way to start the day as a &quot;jumping off&quot; point in meditation. I can simply open to a page in the book, or use my collection of Touchstones, and draw one at random. I find that, no matter which word comes up, it will make a difference in the way I perceive things that day. Sometimes, my friends and I will pick out stones using one of the layouts in the book, and have a discussion based on the words that have been chosen. It's a great way to to learn more about ourselves, and our core beliefs."},{"Title":"How to Write Great Copy: Learn the Unwritten Rules of Copywriting","review":"I am an advertising student and found that this book provided good tips on how to be a better copywriter.

Only real use I can see in preparing for USMLE is to read this book to gear you up for studying and to get some dormant material back into circulation.What it does wrong: It does cover SOME high yield content, but it is greatly lacking in the details that allow you to differentiate the content (ex. It never mentions gene translocations associated with specific cancers/leukemia's/Lymphomas, poor description of age brackets for leukemia's). T8:14 WILL be on the USMLE. No two ways around it. As another random example, there is NO mention of many microorganisms/viral pathogens like Parvovirus. AFP? ACD? \\"chirp chirp\\" is what this book says all to often.Conclusion: Do NOT think that this book is a \\"complete\\" review for USMLE. It is severely lacking in crucial details. It should only be used as a primer for hard core prep - if that. Time is of the essence, so why waste it on intro material. The core of your studying should be First Aid (with additional resource books in weak areas), Goljan Rapid Review Pathology (new ed out late 2006), Case reviews (I like First Aid Cases, and the Platinum Vignettes series), and last, some type of Qbank (I went with usmleRx/FA)."},{"Title":"High-Yield&#8482; Comprehensive USMLE Step 1 Review (High-Yield Series)","review":"this a great compact review book to have handy around if u like to review key concepts and high yield topics!! recommended for on the go review anywhere .."},{"Title":"High-Yield&#8482; Comprehensive USMLE Step 1 Review (High-Yield Series)","review":"This book covers information in a manner that is to superficial for thorough STEP 1 revision."},{"Title":"Bookkeeping the Easy Way (Barron's E-Z)","review":"I wanted &quot;Bookeeping made simple&quot; or &quot;booking made easy&quot; but both titles were out at every store I tried.So I got tis one instead on Tuesday, knowing Monday I start a new job as an assistant bookkeeper with no accounting experience.This is not for beginners!

There are numerous mistakes and errors throughout and considering this was written in 1999 but still has not been updated is embarrassing.I did like the fact that it is step by step, it does teach you the double entry method without relying on computer software and there are exercises for the reader to perform to test and perfect his/her skills.Overall, this is a fair selection to buy and considering that it is only about $11, not a bad deal either. Still, I would definitely recommend you supplement with something written in the last 2 years and then consider a book that teaches you the software program of your choice...such as Quickbooks, Peachtree, etc. The old world style of pencil and paper is invaluable alongside the computer accounting world of today."},{"Title":"Bookkeeping the Easy Way (Barron's E-Z)","review":"Was very satisfied with my purchase. It did not take long to ship and was in good condition.Thank you."},{"Title":"Bookkeeping the Easy Way (Barron's E-Z)","review":"As a CPA, I frequently encounter small businesses who have hired bookkeepers and accounting clerks with little to no experience. Thankfully, these people have been bright and eager to learn, and I am often asked if I could recommend a course or book on the subject. Your local high school will probably have adult education classes in bookkeeping. In addition, your community college will offer relatively inexpensive courses in accounting (though these courses can be quite challenging and too indepth for the bookeeper who simply wants to record cash receipts and disbursements and balance the check book). To recommend a book, I had to do a little research.I set out to find a book that presents bookkeeping in a clear and concise manner; this was not an easy task. Many books throw the reader into accounting too quickly or weigh him/her down in pages of text before getting to anything remotely interesting. These books leave the reader frustrated.I reviewed several (7 or 8) bookkeeping and basic accounting books at my local book store (sorry, Amazon, sometimes I need to see more than the cover of a book, but I already told you this). I found that Bookkeeping the Easy Way was the best of the bunch. It sets a clear and concise foundation of basic bookkeeping principals. Each chapter has a discussion with simple and easy to follow examples. Each chapter ends with a review of vocabulary and additional questions/problems and answers. The table of contents and index are clear and appear to be accurate.Bottom line, I gave this book to one of my clients, and three days later she called and said, &quot;Kate, I finally understand what you have been trying to tell me... Assets = Liabilities + Equity,&quot; and we both laughed.I don't think that any book on this subject will be as helpful as classroom or on-the-job training (with a knowledgeable supervisor), but if you're determined to try to learn on your own, I think that you might find this book helpful.I wish you well in your endeavours."},{"Title":"Bookkeeping the Easy Way (Barron's E-Z)","review":"When I was trying to find a bookkeeping book it was hard to sort through the many choices offered on Amazon.com. If you are like me and want to get a basic understanding of bookkeeping with a chance to practice then this one will work for you as it provides all of the basics necessary to understand double entry bookkeeping. I had accounting in college many years ago but never really understood bookkeeping. This text walks you through the subject from the ground up. Presented in short lessons with lots of practice exercises it is practical, and well presented. The book has been updated (1999) but it was clearly originally written long ago (the original copyright is 1983) so be prepared to feel as though you are in the 70's as you do the exercises. There are several errors (which begin appearing in Chapter 10) where the answer key does not match even the original data provided in the problem but if you know this (another reviewer had mentioned this when I was researching this book and that was very helpful to know ahead of time) then even their mistakes can be used to keep you on your toes and enhance your learning by trying to discover where the errors are! (The errors aren't so gross that it interfered with my understanding of the material.)Even though you may never actually do bookkeeping using hand written entries and journals and ledgers as the exercises in the book ask you to do, the understanding of how this all works can help with knowing what is going on behind the scenes in Quickbooks or other accounting software. My only caveat may be that if you don't have any business experience whatsoever, it might not be substantial enough. I would still get this book and then supplement it with other general business books. A great companion whose first 5 chapters mesh well with this book and which then takes you beyond bookkeeping into accounting is The McGraw-Hill 36-Hour Accounting Course, Third Edition. The focus of Bookkeeping The Easy Way is small business and the McGraw-Hill book is corporate focused."},{"Title":"Bookkeeping the Easy Way (Barron's E-Z)","review":"My husband has started his own small business and I am his Office Manager, so I started reading different books on Bookkeeping &amp; Accounting.

With the DV revolution, Rick was forced to rewrite this book many times in just a few years, to keep current. Surely anyone whose dabbled at all in film or video the last 5-7 years is bound to be seasick from the many dizzying changes that have occurred in the field.These tomes are more about getting off the couch and making your dream a reality, rather than a step by step recipe. Rick gives lots of good time and money saving advice and while it's easy to throw rocks at someone who's \\"never made a film of note\\", those who are so quick to criticize should take a look at their own lives and be honest about what THEY have produced. Rick has made a nice living for himself producing and consulting on independent works and I admire his tenacity and his refusal to sell out to the corporate mentality.I have had the pleasure of meeting him and working personally along side him and attending some of his seminars. He is knowledgeable, experienced and \\"street-wise\\" to the ways of guerilla feature film production.It's easy for the rich, elitists to go to NYU or UCLA and study film. What's hard is for the average, middle-class person to break into the field. Books like this one and Rodriguez' Rebel Without A Crew, are always going to meet with skepticism from the \\"formally trained\\". Yet year in and year out, Sundance, SXSW, Dallas Video Festival and countless other film festivals are full of incredible works produced by artists who've never darkened the door of a film class.DV, DVD and now the newer Media card-based camcorders, along with bundled editing software on most newer computers, has enabled a new generation of filmmakers to realize their visions.

It has a chapter on everything from planning, shooting and marketing plus some of the author's experiences in each. The bad aspect of the book is that each section is very short. The chapters only basically touch on subjects. In addition, the movie is weak in the area of planning non-documentaries (i.e., very litte discussion of script - author's advice is just go out and shoot). In addition, the book is geared to the cheapest production values. For example, he spends a lot of time discussing the use of a TRV10 (a digital 8 camera!!) and the $60.00 on camera amateur mike that can be purchased for it. Little discussion is given of using even a slightly more advanced camera such as a Canon XL-1. If you are going to spend a few weeks of your life on a project does it not make sense to spend another grand and use decent equipment?Despite these weaknesses book gives good (albiet very rudimentary) intro to most phases to indie filmaking. For somebody starting out fine. For someone who is beyond the beginner level the book will not provide much of use."},{"Title":"Extreme DV at Used-Car Prices: How to Write, Direct, Shoot, Edit, and Produce a Digital Video Feature for LessThan $3,000","review":"Rick Schmidt writes FAR more than mere books on making movies. When you feel the words on the page speaking to your being on as many levels as this man communicates on, you are being re-arranged. Ricks writings are a real world example of how The Force works through us. You will have the opportunity to take advantage of the intense focus of passion and energy that surrounded this man as these words traveled from the abstract infinite into solid order before you on the printed page, and it is much like finding an oasis.I ordered Extreme DV expecting largely a re-hash of his first work, Feature Filmmaking at Used Car Prices. Maybe Ray Carney's Open Letter to the Next Generation of American Filmmakers and the chapters about digital video fleshed out with more modern equipment mentioned, and certainly some all new material. I had no idea how off I'd be! To begin with, Ricks decision to open his books with a Ray Carney forward was one of the most profoundly fitting ways to live up to his ideologies of collaboration essential to efficiently allowing things to become their best. This new book gives us Mr. Carney's The Path Of The Artist, equally as worth our while as the aforementioned Open Letter. Worth the price of the book by itself, even if you have read it on Ray's website!But the main meat of Extreme DV is worth more than the budget and gross of the movie Titanic. Invaluable is Ricks recounting making three of his workshop collaborative features, each one giving you new angles and aspects. Through his placing you into the positions he was in, you can feel yourself facing your own future navigations and he gives you the method of finding your own confidence in your ability to make these things happen for yourselfHe does provide you with all of the technical basics you will need to actually carry out your own operations, but he knows where to stop when it is either unnecessary to know, or more properly found in books devoted almost entirely to the technical end, such as The Filmmakers Handbook. He will tell you about selecting a camera with the most essential features and qualities, setting yourself up with an adequate computer editing system, and even the basics of how to use the software (though I do wish he would have covered Vegas for PC, which is awesome beyond description!).But for me, the most wonderful and surprising chapter is number 10....DV Vagabonds: Shooting By Van! I will not discuss this chapter any further. It is just too personal and intimate for me to detail. Even if you feel there is no chance that you will literally follow the path in this type of manner, there is much essence to be communicated within.The Guerilla Promotion chapter will give you a true feel for the type of thinking you will need to be generating to get yourself and your art properly spread, and the VangoghsDV chapter will help keep you from straying too far into clich&eacute; with your art. It will encourage you to find that what makes you and your art truly unique, which if there is any common thread to Ricks passion, it is the celebration of uniqueness. I would suggest picking up both of Mr. Schmidt's very unique books...your soul will thank you."},{"Title":"Extreme DV at Used-Car Prices: How to Write, Direct, Shoot, Edit, and Produce a Digital Video Feature for LessThan $3,000","review":"Don't judge this book on the typing errors (they are not noticeable anyway), but on the content.

In the new era of digital and HD filmmaking, this book will breif you on everything you need to know.

This book is part of the Sage Series on &#65533;Developmental Clinical Psychology and Psychiatry&#65533; prepared by experts in clinical child psychiatry, psychology, development and related disciplines. The focus is on the diagnosis, assesment, treatment and prevention of problems in developmental psychopathology that arise in the period from infancy through adolescence. The book is devided into six chapters: What is child maltreatment ?, Normal and abnormal child rearing patterns, A developmental perspective of the abused child, Unraveling the causes with theory, background and multidimentional influences and the last chapter on Prevention and treatment strategies. Since the first edition of this book (1987) there has been an explosion in child abuse research and therefore also more knowledge and background to understand the mechanisms involved. This is taken into account in this book, but also the fact that the author in the meantime had three children of his own has made this book very important for professionals working with abused and neglected children."},{"Title":"Child Abuse: Implications for Child Development and Psychopathology (Developmental Clinical Psychology and Psychiatry)","review":"Lots of highlighting but it was all important stuff so it actually helped me.

I found the work to be incredibly well written. I am glad that I discovered it."},{"Title":"Colonial Affairs: Bowles, Burroughs, and Chester Write Tangier","review":"From 1923 to 1956, a coalition of European powers governed Tangier, Morocco, and called the city \\"The International Zone of Tangier,\\" which William Burroughs referred to as the \\"interzone,\\" a word he later used as the title for one of his manuscripts. During its years as an International Zone, Tangier became a notorious magnet and haven for smugglers, spies, outcasts, artists, and expatriates-a place where nations, languages, and cultures could mix wantonly. In the years following World War II, Paul Bowles, William Burroughs and Alfred Chester left America and eventually settled in Tangier (Bowles permanently; Burroughs and Chester temporarily), where each of them wrote some of their major works.In Colonial Affairs, Greg Mullins reassesses the \\"interzone literature\\" of these three writers in relation to queer and postcolonial theory. Each writer receives an entire chapter's worth of analytical scrutiny, with close readings of their major texts, in which Mullins purports to find evidence of what he refers to as \\"colonial desire\\" and \\"colonial nostalgia,\\" as well as other examples of \\"colonial discourse.\\" A fifth and final chapter, \\"Translating Homosexuality,\\" deals with Paul Bowles's collaborations with Larbi Layachi, Mohammed Mrabet, and Mohamed Choukri. Here, Mullins raises some interesting points about translation and the issue of \\"authenticity,\\" but he comes to questionable conclusions, such as \\"The Bowles translations can best be understood as an erotic exercise in their own right, an exercise that reflects the patron/client model of sexual commerce between West and East in Tangier.\\"The arguments that Mullins advances are both compelling and intriguing, but his attempt to map the rigid coordinates of postmodern theory onto the slippery and erratic topography of these six highly eccentric writers falls short of being totally convincing. To say that Bowles, Burroughs, and Chester perpetuated or embodied \\"the structures and stereotypes of colonial discourse\\" seems far fetched at best; in the act of turning their backs on America and immersing themselves in the crucible of Tangier, where the demarcations between language, culture, nationality, and sexuality were in constant flux, their project (and common denominator) was primarily one of self-discovery, or even a deconstruction of the self altogether, in order to get to a place beyond, the true \\"interzone\\" of the subconscious. That the work of these three writers \\"variously celebrates, critiques, and attempts to evade the double bind of colonial sexuality\\" seems moot in this light, while the fact that they \\"reordered reality through their writing\\" is a given that hardly warrants further discussion. As for Choukri, Layachi, and Mrabet, their entrepreneurial savoir-faire and large doses of egomania about their literary endeavors hardly jibe with the \\"patron/client model of sexual commerce.\\"Originally begun as a dissertation, Colonial Affairs frequently veers off into totally unrelated terrain (such as the roots of postmodernism in the work of Burroughs, Freudian fetish theory in the work of Chester, etc.). Nonetheless, Mullins has provided us with an engaging portrait of these three writers and their lives in Tangier, and an intriguing reinterpretation of their legacy, which has more in common with Rimbaud's \\"disordering of the senses\\" than the \\"horror\\" that Mr. Kurtz lamented in Conrad's Heart of Darkness."},{"Title":"The Colorado Plateau: Map and Guide to Public Lands on the Colorado Plateau and Its Borderlands","review":"This map is beautiful and very useful - labels landforms & all points of interest.

I do live in Australia and although some of the metric conversions might be difficult for the average home buyer of this book, most people who work in this industry know what an Oz is and can follow the measuring units easily. Great layout, with easy to follow steps and illustrations. Also a GREAT selection of non-alcoholic drinks (the most I've seen) to satisfy the non-drinkers out there.

For some people this is a vague and intangible expression. In reality, it means precisely a life of common interest with God; a life in which this love of God dominates all our thoughts, words and actions. The Greater the love, the more Christian the life.Whatever we eat, drink, say, write or do, it should come from our soul living I conscious union and silent conversation with God. It is this union with God that colors our whole life and makes it Christian.\\"Kilian who has taught theology and philosophy, a voting member of the Second Vatican Council, and a Carmelite priest uses his vast experience to bear on this topic of conversing with God. Much like Brother Lawrence's The Practice of the Presence of God it will help one learn how to experience God in all the details of life.The Chapters are:1. Servants or Friends of God?2. Friendship With God3. The Exercise of the Presence f God4. The First Way: Searching for God Through Creatures5. The Second Way: Listening to God6. The Third Way: Living With Christ7. The Forth Way: Offering Ourselves With Christ8. The Fifth Way: Finding God Within Us9. Prayer of Aspirations10.

Most of the stories involve Iktomi (Unktomi) the Spider Trickster and his moral misadventures. Other stories include the Avenger and Iya (\\"Mouth\\")the Glutton. Most of the stories are used in showing the proper norms for D/N/Lakota society: be generous, do not be greedy, be hospitable, do not boast about yourself, do not deceive others to attain things, be merciful, be a good relative, etc. The reader will notice that some of the later stories do not follow the pattern of teaching morality, but seem to reflect older stories that do not always seem to follow logically. All in all, they are amazing stories that Zitkala'sa, also known as Gertrude Simmons Bonnin, wrote for primarily white audiences. There is a nice biographical sketch of Zitkala'sa and the illustrations by Angel De Cora are interesting in that they imagine the characters in human form.Here are the stories as they appear in the book: \\"Iktomi and the Ducks,\\" \\"Iktomi's Blanket,\\" \\"Iktomi and the Muskrat,\\" \\"Iktomi and the Coyote,\\" \\"Iktomi and the Fawn,\\" \\"The Badger and the Bear,\\" \\"The Tree-Bound,\\" \\"Shooting of the Red Eagle,\\" \\"Iktomi and the Turtle,\\" \\"Dance in the Buffalo Skull,\\" \\"The Toad and the Boy,\\" \\"Iya, the Camp-Eater,\\" \\"Man'stin, The Rabbit,\\" and \\"The Warlike Seven.\\""},{"Title":"Old Indian legends","review":"This is a clever and interesting book of Indian Legends. The first several stories are loosely linked and are probably best read in order, but otherwise the stories stand alone. They are a bit more violent than many Western tales, so if you're concerned about exposing your kids to violence, I might suggest reading over them first (I pretty much suggest that for every book of cultural tales, though).Also, many attitudes have changed since the times these stories were written, so although they cannot exactly be construed as prejudiced, there are a few odd phrases and translations that wouldn't have been used if the stories were transcribed today--nothing offensive, just odd.There were no formatting errors in the text. There is an active Table of Contents, but it is a chart, half of which is inaccessible. Even the available half looks incorrect in my kindle-for-pc program, though it's fine on the kindle itself. The kindle edition also lacks any discussion or author biography.The stories included are:Iktomi and the DucksIktomi's BlanketIktomi and the MuskratIktomi and the CoyoteIktomi and the FawnThe Badger and the BearThe Tree-BoundShooting of the Red EagleIktomi and the TurtleDance in a Buffalo SkullThe Toad and the BoyIya, the Camp-EaterManstin, the RabbitThe Warlike Seven"},{"Title":"Old Indian legends","review":"This is exactly what I was hoping for.

It was meant for a preview to my Linear Algebra and Applications class and as an alternative reference.

I gave up on it and it was just sitting there until I decided to further clarify to myself the concept of kernel and image, and all the proof questions associated with them.

I don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra Demystified","review":"The book spills out formulas without adequate explanation. I don't learn unless I understand.

As a beginning student, I stared at that for a few minutes before giving up on what the author was trying to communicate. It was only when I turned to PAGE 6 did I see the matrix that he stated was on PAGE 5.A similar error appeared on PAGE 8 when the author breaks up the discussion on PIVOTS with Figure 1-3 which is a discussion of the upper and lower triangular matrices. But then he continues the PIVOTS discussion on PAGE 9 ane NEVER refers to the Figure 1-3 (because it was actually part of the previous section)!The next error pops up on PAGE 13 when the number 13 in the sample matrix mysteriously turns into the number 19. And this error is carried through the next page (14). At this point I gave up on the book with it errors and inconsistencies. Luckily, I had borrowed it from the library.The only reason I gave this book ONE STAR is because Amazon would not let me give it ZERO STARS.However, the library also had copies of Schaum's Outline to Linear Algebra and 3,000 Solved Problems in Linear Algebra.

It may teach you a few basis things about matrixes (addition, subtraction, multiplication), but in don't explain any meaning of these operations. There is no geometric or any other interpretation of anything. It already assumes you know what vectors are ?????? It mentions material in the beginning of the book that is explained at the end of it. Definitely not enough solved examples. At the end of each chapter it has a quiz that supposed to have solutions at the end of the book, but only 1/2 of the excesses ( the easier ones) have solutions. for the other have the author rudely tells you to follow the path of some other exercise. I find it unacceptable laziness on his part. I know what I need to follow, but I also need to know the answer so I can check myself and see if I followed it correctly. Don't buy it."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra Demystified","review":"This book should be renamed \\"An Unsophisticated Treatment of the Rudiments and Mechanics of Matrix Algebra,\\" for that is all it is. The first one hundred pages are spent manipulating matrices before the text introduces the idea of a vector space, the heart and soul of Linear Algebra. Even though it does eventually get around to introducing the idea of a basis of a vector space and Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, the reader has no idea what they are to be used for. It leaves no hint that Linear Algebra is actually a foundation for more advanced mathematics. The central idea of Linear Algebra, idea of mappings and transformations, is only insinuated in the final chapters.As presented here, \\"Linear Algebra Demystified\\" reduces to little more than an Undergraduate Survey Course in the manipulation of matrices. By trying to make the subject matter completely painless, all the substance has been bleached away and the book fails to treat any of the real concepts of Linear Algebra seriously or with any rigor. This Demystified series seems to have been a mindless compilation and cribbing of explanations and problems from other more standardized texts. However, judging by what appears here it could not have been taken from the best texts.What a pity.

I started searching for an aid to help me understand the material better to get me through my mid-term and final, and I only had two weeks to teach myself a whole semester's worth of the stuff. This book was an absolute lifesaver! He goes through every aspect of Linear Algebra that I needed to know, and often gave a much simplier way to solve problems than my textbook had presented. I now have a good understanding of the subject, and I got a B in my class. This book doesn't just give you formulas or a straight way to solve the problem, he walks you through different types you might come across and if you do the quizzes and the final exam in the back then you will definitely be prepared.

For instance, a system of equations is referenced in terms of \\"m by n\\" dimensions, and another as \\"n by m\\". The author appears to prefer the approach of not telling the reader of details until he thinks the reader is ready.

(One can always check the solution to a set of equations by verifying that they do, in fact, solve the set of equations.) Since I am only up to page 138, there are probably more errors, as well. Given that this is supposed to be a self-teaching guide, this is a definite drawback since the student's first impulse is always to assume that the mistake is their own. Needless to say, this can result in a lot more frustration than required. Even now I'm wondering if I really just missed something, but I don't think so. A book like this really could have used better proofreading (a lot of the mistakes may simply be dropped or duplicated digits). So Caveat Emptor and Caveat Lector."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra Demystified","review":"After reading the author's other book Quantum Mechanics Demystified, I was curious about this work. I was quite surprised. The author's talents are topic selection and presentation. It seems linear algebra books are either theoretical or applied. While this book is clearly of the applied flavor, it steals the gems from the theoretical presentations. Most people who have had linear algebra and are not math majors see matrices as collections of numbers to solve linear systems. While the author covers the solution of linear systems, he shows that Gaussian elimination is a form of reduction which tells us about the problem, not just the solution. By the time you get through QR reduction and singular value decomposition (SVD), you will think of linear algebra in a broader sense. To me this volume corrects a common problem where practitioners think linear algebra = Gaussian elimination + determinants. He brings in the practical perspective from advanced treatments without a cumbersome theoretical framework. As for the quality of the presentation, I must say that when I compared the SVD presentation in LAD to that in Numerical Recipes, I had a strong preference for LAD. By way of critique, I would encourage the author to rework his problems so that they have integer solutions; the manipulation of complex fractions is tedious and detracts from the clarity of the presentation. In closing, this book collects the material you should have in your mind after completing a class in linear algebra."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra Demystified","review":"If your looking for a book to supplement your textbook on Linear Algebra, or a book that provides a mathematical background for a course in Quantum Physics, check out this book.

How many times have you started a chapter on Vector Spaces, Linear Equations, or Matices, only to be lost after the first page or two. David McMahon does an excellent job of giving clear, step-by-step examples, as he walks you through Linear Equations, Matrix Algebra, Determinants, Vectors Spaces, and Eigenvectors. And here's the thing, you understand each topic, as you complete it.

I agree with the reviewer that praised the idea behind the book and also with one of the author's stated goals--to provide a quick review for graduate students about to take a more advanced course in linear algebra--but the execution is awful.This book is replete with errors! Listing them from least to most serious, I found 1)spelling, grammatical and typographical errors 2) MANY computational errors (approximately half of the problems have them) 3) imprecise usage of vocabulary (in a very vocabulary-driven branch of mathematics) 4) SERIOUS errors in definitions and descriptions of procedures (the exposition of one of the most famous algorithms in mathematics, Cramer's Rule (p. 64), IS WRONG!). Also, the few proofs given are worthless except as examples of begging the question, the book in general is poorly written, and--as one reviewer wrote--the answers to the quizzes are incomplete or not given, period.I am a long-time Amazon customer who orders quite regularly, but this is the first time ever that I have been prompted to write a review. That's how bad this book is. I'm very disappointed; I planned a quick review of linear algebra this summer and do not have time for a textbook-type treatment of the material.NOTE: I would have given this book zero stars but, as I attempted to publish my review, I discovered that I needed to give it at least one star.

The difference in approach to teaching between my textbook and this book are night and day; compared to Demystified, it seems like my textbook is TRYING to make things complicated.CON -At the same time, this book has an insane number of typos. You can't trust any of the examples to have the correct answer at the end, nor can you trust the quiz and exam questions to have the correct answers in the back of the book. This book WOULD have been a great self-teaching linear algebra book if the problems had been thoroughly checked, or if there was a comprehensive errata sheet out there (there is an errata sheet, but it barely scrapes the tip of the iceberg of mistakes), but since there are so many errors, this book serves better as a supplemental guide to explaining concepts you might not have understood in class or from a textbook."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra Demystified","review":"I just finished the book and am about half-way through the \\"final exam\\" (which is contained in the book, with answers to most problems).The book seems to cover most or all of the stuff from a first course in linear algebra (upper-division).

In fact, I am beginning to see that most of the \\"Demystified\\" books, at least the technical ones like math and physics, are more suitable for review and/or reference.The one thing I would like to see in the book, is more of a \\"why do we do this?\\" type of explanation. For example, of what use is a Hermitian conjugate? What does it do for us..does it have any physical meaning? Would it at least help us solve a system of equations? Or what about the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem - who cares if we can formulate a \\"characteristic equation\\"?

He is challenged by his mother whose faith impresses us with its strength. The priest, in turn, seems weak in that area. As other events take place, we see a transformation in the priest who struggles and falls but forces himself to do the right thing. The mother, however, undergoes doubts and weakens in her resolve. In the climatic ending we are reminded that faith is constantly challenged and thus is in need of regular maintenance.As in all of Grazia Deladda's novels, the reader gets a sense of life in the distant world of rural Sardinia and an appreciation for the story-telling abilities of this Nobel Prize-winning author."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"\\"A death in the family\\", it's very sweet and emotional novel that's what writer made me think of the book. It is because I found the story very realistic because there are many children who has lost their parents or their dad in such a young age. In that age, children don't understand the meaning of death or what the family went through. The main character Rufus Follet I found his character very innocent and lovely because the way writer described his character and what makes him what he is. I believe Rufus character changed from the beginning till the end. I think Rufus character changed when he discovered about his dad death. It showed he was close to his dad and even he did not showed any feelings toward his dad death but sure he felt loneliness. At the end of the novel, nobody knows what he made out of his father's death and what he thought. But the writer showed by showing the butterfly that there is hope for something- like power. Later, Rufus would understand and will be look care for his family.The devices the writer James Agee used in this book to evoke my thoughts and feelings about the character are like theme of the book. It is because the role of religion in this book is the most important part since mostly it's revolve around the religion and the character thoughts. Throughout the book it shows different side of the main character Rufus Follet and his mother Mary as well. Not all the family members were into the religion but Mary and Hanna these were two who truly intensely believe in God and the Catholic Church. Mary wants to raise her children as a catholic children which not everyone sees the point in this. Rufus totally not understand the meaning of the religion and why her mother is so religion. When Rufus dad, Jay died Mary explained both of her children using religion belief which Rufus questioned to her mother and he do not understood from him it did not make sense at all. The symbol in this book can be butterfly because at the end the butterfly lands on Rufus dad, Jay coffin at the funeral. I think this symbol shows the hope of each character, especially, Rufus. It is because Rufus lost his dad when he was six years old and he did not understand regarding the death of his dad. Since, he is a kid and not fully understand. In the beginning, the writer showed that Rufus is a innocent kid, and very close to his dad. Later on, the writer also showed that he is very sensitive and intelligent as well. I felt really bad for Rufus cause he lost his dad because he and his dad always go together like going for watching movie. They spend time together, even thought they don't talk much but he was close to his dad. Since, he didn't had any friend and wanted to make friends. The school kids who already tease him he thought they talk to him because they like him, but Rufus didn't knew they were teasing and making fun on him. If his dad were alive, he would be more comfortable and his dad would be his friend.I would like to recommend this book to everyone whoever likes to read simple stories. I found this story very appealing and realistic."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This book is a classic of 20th century American literature. You don't need a review by an amatuer -- it has been covered well by professional critics.The narrative could justly be called the ultimate \\"family values\\" novel. Much, but by no means all, of the story is told through the eyes of six-year-old Rufus. However, James Agee also gives the reader fully grown-up glimpses into the hearts of all the main characters. We see the deepest bonds of love transcending profound differences. Devout Catholics and deeply conflicted agnostics cling to each other in the face of death's finality.This is no sweetness and light, easy answers book.

The novel also encompasses the rehabilitation of the family Late one night in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1915, Jay Follet receives a phone call that his father is on the verge of death. Jay urgently rushes out of his house to care for his dying father. It turns out that the phone call was a false alarm. While on his way home Jay Follet is killed in a car wreck. A Death in the family is a deeply descriptive novel. Agee took the time to describe things in order that the readers feel that they are actually experiencing the events that take place in the novel. Agee's lenghty descriptions could be compared to the lenghty descriptions of Charles Dickens. Through flashbacks to Jay with his son Rufus, James Agee beautifully illustrates the close relationship Jay Follet had with his family, especially his son. The flashbacks help to define the closeness of this one particular family. Without them the story would have lacked the strength that came across in the final product. Ithoroughly enjoyed a Death in the Family. It is a provocative novel that moved me to tears when I read it. I would recommend this novel to anybody who has lost somebody who was close to themselves."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee mastered the art of communication in his autobiographical novel, A Death in the Family. It is about Rufus, his mother, and his family as they try to cope with the loss of his father after a tragic car accident.I would not have chosen this book off the shelf. In fact, I found it dreadfully dull when I was reading it for a class deadline. It dragged on while I impatiently pushed further to see if anything else happened (nothing else happened). This novel is definitely not the remedy for boredom, as it will bore you even more. However, on a rainy Sunday afternoon, A Death in the Family is the perfect book. When the reader can take their time and enjoy every single detail in the book, you really get a good sense about what Agee had noticed as a child robbed as his father. It's not about the fights, or the actual death of his father, but about the subtleties humans use in communication and how people deal with pain. For about half an hour of reading, Rufus' mother is talking with Aunt Hannah about what she needs to do before she goes to bed. They address each other politely, becoming nauseatingly repetitive if you are in a hurry, but displaying realistic human shock and unspoken communication. His mother also hangs onto her rosary beads, crosses herself and prays non-stop through out the novel, but Agee did not put all of the prayers in so we knew which ones she was saying. It was clear that she was looking for confidence in her religion, but was not sure if her God had actually betrayed her. Perhaps she should abandon religion? The atheists in the book are jilted as the dead father is not allowed a proper funeral ceremony since he was never baptized. Perhaps they should adopt religion? Why is it exclusive? These are all questions of human interaction that Agee's novel provokes. Ideally, Agee arouses introspective analysis in the reader. That is, if you have the patience.Perhaps the book would have flowed better had Agee had a chance to edit it himself, but what the reader gets is the raw writing. Life with the family prior to the accident is exposed in two inserts of corresponding literature Agee wrote but did not originally put in the book. His widow and the publisher decided to stick the sections in to serve as dividers, creating three sections of the book and giving some perspective to the family. Those sections are some of the most beautiful sections of writing I have ever read. Agee turned Knoxville, Tennessee into the readers home, and made the front lawn something worthy of reading about."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This was a well crafted a book as I have ever read. It is a powerful story of what happens to a family in the immedaite aftermath of an unexpected death, and Agee is as pitch perfect as is possible in giving voice to the various characters in this book. His choice of words and phrases are such that each individual is entirely believable and authentic, with a unique voice and a complexity of character that leaves nothing wanting.Agee has a mastery of the language that rivals writing peers, and the resulting prose appears both effortless and flawless in its formation. He delivers complex experiences and emotions with simplicity, while never relegating himself to simplistic language or condescending construction. It is an easy read, not because it has light subject matter or rudimentary language, but rather because the story is written with such linguistic beauty that it seems as natural as if the reader him/herself were speaking.In the end, regardless of the emotional messiness of a family at loose ends, this is a satisfying read in every way. The story unfolds as it should, naturally, without a manufactured happy ending...just as one would expect in life. And Agee guides us through all of the emotional upheaval with aa sensitive voice and linguistic ease.If you have not read this book, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I am generally a tolerant, open-minded individual. But people who are not struck by the beauty and detail and wisdom in this book are not people who I understand. A Death in the Family illuminates the beauty and complexity of human relationships and will want to make you give your friends and family a hug. It is also really well-written. A must read."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"To read James Agee's \\"A death in the family\\" is a painful experience - not as painful as facing a death in the family itself, but the novel gets really close to it. Based on his personal experiences the book is sad because there is no other way to handle losing a relative. The writer is not interested in the poetry that one might search in such experience - the poetry and beauty of the narrative come as a consequence of the characters, not the event.There are moments in the novel when dialogue is overused, but, Agee seems to have a reason for that. He wants to convey the whole experience, he doesn't want to relive for the reader. We must read every single bit and stay close to those characters every single second. It is not an easy read because it is sad and painful - and, also, because of that, it is a great book."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee was born in Knoxville in 1909. At the age of 6 his father was killed in an automobile accident. The boy grew up to become a writer and then, in 1955, he died of a heart attack. He was working on \\"A Death in the Family\\" at the time and it was later pieced together, published in 1957 and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1958. I can well understand why. It is an amazing work that tore at my heartstrings and made it one of the saddest books I've ever read.Art follows life. The book is set in 1915 and is the story of a family and the loss of a young husband in a car accident. Parts of the book are narrated through the voice of a young boy in a way that clear, nuanced and a slightly skewed portrait of how he views his world. There is also a poetic artistic tone through his eyes as well as throughout the whole work. As I read it I couldn't help but appreciate the unique way the author described his world.In addition to the boy, we also meet the rest of the family - his mother, grandparents, aunt and uncle and younger sister. They become real and their feelings and reactions to the tragedy that befalls them is immediate and highly emotional. We go through all of this with them - the seed of disbelief, the agony of waiting to find out what happened and though it all there is a deep connection between the characters and the reader including flashbacks and conversations which help describe exactly who these people are. The father comes from mountain folk and his wife comes from the middle class. There is something rough and appealing about the father and I loved the way he was with his young son. The mother is religious and this gives her comfort but the Catholic priest she calls upon in her hour of need comes across in a negative way. All of the people seem absolutely real and the author gets into their hearts and souls. I especially loved his descriptions of the men - from the young boy whose confusion of the world around him is familiar and haunting to the companionship of the father and the honesty of his uncle.The book brings the reader into the world of Knoxville in 1915. There are family relationships as well as some simple and evocative descriptions of the racism of the time. And though it all, I felt the loss of the husband, identified with the sorrow and consider this book a beautiful and artistic questioning of the meaning of life and death."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Loss can be experienced, but never fully understood, Perhaps some revelation may come from the tumult of feeling, yet thechaotic jumble of diverse,conflicting emotions as a whole defies conscious, rational description. W. Somerset Maugham, someone who can be considered a master of introspective narrative, covered virtually the whole range of human emotion in \\"Of Human Bondage\\", yet failed to satisfactorarily explore grief over bereavement. Joan Didion in her Amazon.com Editors' Top Pick of 2005 nonfiction work \\"The Year of Magical Thinking\\" fell far short. Perhaps loss cannot be explained so much as put into perspective, either through the chronicling of its immediate impact, or its gradual dissipitation from consciousness.Or perhaps I haven't read enough on the subject, a possibility which is admittedly as high as that of my conjectures being correct. However, \\"A Death in the Family\\" goes some way in remedying this deficit.A Pulitzer Prize winner, \\"A Death in the Family\\" covers the short time span from just before the father of a family leaves on a journey in which he suddenly dies in a car accident, until his funeral.The thoughts and interactions between many characters central and peripheral to the incident, including his wife, their children, as well as the in-laws are painstakingly and vividly rendered, delining a portrait of - as the title plainly states - a death in the family.Unable to come to grips with the enormity of grief, the widow's mind first turns to irreverent matters (the blasphemy of trying out a mourning veil in front of the mirror before the funeral) and then to finding solace in her religion. The narrative gist regarding religion on the part of the author registers as part bafflement,and part sheer anger and frustration at the what he percieves as docile, imbecilic submission to such obvious capriciousness. \\"God, if You exist, come here and let me spit in Your face.\\", he has one character think.Such irreverency and inadequecy of mortal thought in face of something as unfathomable as death is convincing and uncontrived, as are the innocence of the dead man's children. ('Could I call myself a half-orphan?'wonders the son, thinking to impress his schoolmates.)Reading such a novel gives one a sense of catharsis, as well as something like the euphoria one has in waking from a nightmare. But however vivid or realistic a written work may be, can it truly prepare one for loss?"},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Agee has done something utterly amazing through this lyrical, slow-moving work. You often feel as if you moving through a dream - or, perhaps, a world running in slow motion where you can anticipate what will happen but you can't do anything to stop it.As the book starts off, a boy is making a trip to town with his dad. The boy worries about making his dad proud. The dad worries about his boy's perception of him. The dad is also incredibly lonely...and you begin to get attached to him, but you don't want to get too attached because you know he won't be around too much longer. (My apologies if this ruins the story, but I'm pretty sure this is well known.)As you become introduced to the rest of the characters, you realize that everyone is honorable (for the most part) and that their internal concerns &amp; worries just comes out of their being human. For example, though the father is lonely, it's not because he has a horrible wife. In fact, he has a wonderful wife...but he is trying to wade through the complexity of relationships, internal peace and life in general. And so are all the characters.The story progresses slowly, predictably, and you watch as the characters all act &amp; react in various ways. Agee allows you to see the world through each character's eyes, and then how the world perceives that character. This narrative style leaves you feeling compassionate for each member of the family whereas it would normally be easy to be annoyed with or dismissive of many of the characters.It is also worth mentioning how honest and thoughtful Agee is in showing his characters' motivations and flaws. When the little boy learns that his father has died, the loss completely goes over his head. Instead, he tries to leverage this event for popularity from the schoolchildren. &quot;Surely they will be nice to me today,&quot; he thinks.Later, when the mother kneels to pray, her aunt has amazing insight that the mother is praying not from her heart but rather from pride - praying what she thinks a holy woman would pray in such a circumstance. Such commentary on our actions and motivations can hit a little close to home...but I believe it must have come from his own experience. He never condemns his characters...he just lets them be fully human.As I said in the beginning, I believe this work to be a true masterpiece. Though I was often horrified by the true despairing picture he portrayed, my mind was also deeply impressed by the truth he conveyed. And he does give hope, after his own fashion."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"A fascinating tale of a &quot;death in the family&quot; experienced and seen through various eyes, wife's, brother-in-law, aunt and two small children. An unforgettable account of human emotions, empathy, love, misery, sadness, too gruesome to imagine. The irony is that this book was published after James Agee passed away. We can all relate to Rufus when he describes in detail the taunts, ridicule he endures from the older boys. It is a very shaky and unsafe world seen through young impressionable unsure eyes. A must read."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"My first interest is this book came after seeing a performance of Samuel Barber's &quot;Knoxville:Summer of 1915&quot;. Before the piece was performed there was a reading from &quot;A Death in the family&quot; upon which the opera was based. When I began reading I imediately understood why Agee's writing style would inspire such a beautiful piece of music. No, the book is not perfect. It is tedious in spots and parts of it just don't work, but it is some of the most beautiful prose I have ever read. It captures a world from a childs point of view: the dreamlike description of the child's environment, his love and trust in his parents, his sense of time etc. I believe this book is well-worth the read despite the rough spots.

This would be a typical conversation between to African American men in the 1940sThe setting is a very important aspect of this novel. Agee writes about what he sees in everyday life in the cold winter of the 1940s. If it had been set in the summer it would not have been as powerful. Also it would not have shown the struggles of an African American family if it was set at a different time.The diction in Agee's novel plays the most important role in telling the story. Agee writs what he hears people saying. Just as if it was right in front of a person.An example of this would be \\"till\\", \\"don't believe\\"The characters in this novel make the story come to life. These people are the typical people of this time. There's Jay, his wife, their two kids, Uncle Ralph, grandma and grandpa Follet.

If you read the first 20 pages you know everything you need to know."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee's 1955 novel &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; is considered a classic by some. To me, it is overhyped, and utterly joyless. Mixed in with an interesting story of a young family picking up the pieces after the father dies in a car accident, is the worst &quot;poetic&quot; ramlbings I've ever read. Did Agee really have to break through the flow of the story with annoying musings that make no sense? The mother, a morbid Catholic, tries to deal with death and her husband's lack of faith. Her brother, Andrew, is easily the best character. With skepticism of religion, and his conflicted emotions, he is an understandable character.

I read this book in the Tenth grade and garnered no sense of its raw literary power at that time since my teacher was more interested in using it to bash Catholicism than to explore its wonderful prose.Many years later I read the book again while living abroad. Since I was not in an English speaking environment the language and mood of the novel were even more evocative.I was astounded when I reread the essay called &quot;Knoxville Summer of 1915&quot; that precedes the rest of the novel. This is one of the most beautiful and most effective pieces of English I have ever come across. Agee describes a child's observation of his neighbors evening activities in their back yard in a subtle sequence of events. The essay mixes dreamy metaphor with detailed observation in a slow, rhythmic description. The child observes the rolled up shirt sleeves of fathers watering their lawn after dinner and then tells himself that now the night is a &quot;blue dew&quot;. The genius behind this is how the child makes the transition for detailed observation to poetic descriptions of the entire experience.The rest of the novel is wonderful in parts but hardly equals the opening essay. Agee is very talented at conveying character, dialog, and mood. We sense the warmth of family life before the father's death and the absolute confusion and bewilderment that follow. It is very painful to read about how the narrator, as an awkward child, is momentarily accepted by his classmates because his father's death is a new and interesting topic for them. It is a terrible thing that in a roundabout way, the callousness of the boy's classmates converts his father's death into a moment of joy. But it is also one of life's realistic irony.The subject matter of this book is tragic and even in its most poetic parts its mood is very grim. You may want to keep this in mind before reading it."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee's autobiographical novel A DEATH IN THE FAMILY, published posthumously in 1957 and winner of the Pulitzer Prize the following year, remains an American classic. In a nearly perfect treatise on how a family reacts to the death of a family member, Agee in beautiful, transparent prose as good as anything Christopher Isherwood or Truman Capote ever wrote, has given the world a novel that remains timeless. The story of course has universal appeal and touches everyone who reads it as all of us have lost or will lose a family member. It ultimately is about everything that matters.In 1915, Jay Follet at the age of 36 is killed in a freak automobile accident near Knoxville, Tennessee. Agee lets us see inside the minds of his wife, his children, his parents, his brother-in-law et al. as each character grapples with this new hole in his or her life, trying to grasp the loss and make sense of it. Jay's wife Mary and her Christian faith are contrasted with the indifference of the organized church in the character of Father Jackson who refuses to read the complete burial service over Jay because he had not been baptised. In a beautiful passage near the end of the novel Andrew, Mary's brother, describes the burial to the six-year-old Rufus (based on Agee) when a \\"perfectly magnicent butterfly\\" settled on the coffin. Andrew believes that \\"that butterfly has got more of God in him than Jackson [the priest] will ever see for the rest of eternity.\\" Mary's father, perhaps as only a loving parent can, gives her hard but honest advice: \\"It's bad enough right now, but it's going to take a while to sink in. . . It'll be so much worse you'll think it's more than you can bear. Or any other human being. And worse than that, you'll have to go through it alone, because there isn't a thing on earth any of us can do to help, beyond blind animal sympathy.\\"The novel opens with a prose poem \\"Knoxville: Summer 1915\\", later set to music by Samuel Barber. There are additional, similar lyrical prose pieces, usually seen through the eyes of Rufus, interspersed between the three divisions of the novel. Agee is a master at capturing the language and dialect of East Tennessee where children go snipe-hunting, they \\"waked up,\\" and adults use expressions such as \\"bless his heart\\" and \\"poor old soul.\\"With the recent publication by The Library of America of two volumes of practically all of the works of Agee, this great writer should reach a much wider reading audience he so richly deserves."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Agee, who gave us the words to Walker Evans' photoessay \\"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men\\" and the script for the African Queen, was a genius. Like may geniuses he was erratic. I cannot read Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. I find it Joycian in all the worst senses of that word. But A Death in the Family is a different story.If you read this and have the courage to really let it sink into you, you will feel the extraordinary pain of a family torn apart by a pedestrian but tragic event - an automobile crash. The shock hits you. The grief overcomes you. You feel the loss. In short, you understand. That is what all artists strive to do and what Agee stunningly succeeds at here.The beauty here is the beauty of truth, mainlined slowly into your being. This is a book that can and probably will change the reader.Several reviews have mentioned the breathtaking prelude \\"Knoxville: Summer of 1915\\" and some mention the Samuel Barber soprano version of this. To me that Barber piece ranks as one of the great American musical moments. That two such enormous accomplishments should derive from one small book is a tribute to the power and brilliance of James Agee at his finest."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This novel contains some of the most exquisite writing I have ever encountered. For those who enjoy the tender, glowing realism of authors such as William Maxwell, Marilynne Robinson or even Willa Cather, this novel will truly resonate. But A Death in the Family is more than just impressive writing - it is also the truly well crafted story of grief and loss told through the eyes of a series of family members. I read this in college and recall liking it, but the addition of the new pages brings the work into its own. From my understanding there are three distinct added sections - including the prelude. Admittedly, these added sections do not fit seamlessly into the narrative structure, but they each fit in arguably well with the tone and spirit of the work. It was quite obvious, at least to me, that Agee intended these incorporate these pages in the novel, but was unable to do so. (He died before the novel's completion.)The plot, itself, is simple: the naked reactions of a family to the unexpected death of a loved one. But the amazing aspect of this is Agee's grasp of voice and perspective as the narrative moves from one voice to the other. We hear from the spiritually questioning wife, the pathetic, alcoholic brother, the bewildered near-infant daughter and Rufus, the infinitely interesting five-year-old son. Anyone who has actually experienced a death in the family will identify freely with at least one of the characters. Rufus is particularly fascinating in his struggle to understand the situation. He experiences the very real, yet rarely discussed, emotions such as pride for being the center of attention, boredom at not being allowed to go anywhere, and exasperation at his little sister. He is endearingly human - as are all the characters, really.Since this is hardly a \\"new\\" novel, I will devote the most time to discussing this particular edition. It begins with the stunning addition of \\"Knoxville, Summer 1915\\" which just may be one of the most beautiful and effective prose poems in the English language (By the way, if you're as taken with Agee's prose poem as I was you might want to listen to the fabulous Barber setting of it for soprano and orchestra. I highly recommend the EMI Michael Tilson Thomas conducting and Barbara Hendricks, Soprano although the Eleanor Steber version is beautiful as well.) The next is a darker, more surreal passage telling the story of a boy (Rufus, son of Jay) and the quasi-anthropomorphized darkness. It is at once touching, chilling, endearing and unquestionably effective. But the final added section is, by far, the strongest in terms of narrative. It is essentially two stories of Rufus: one, in which he suffers at the mercy of grammar-school bullies and one in which he meets his great-great-grandmother. Like the other added passages, Rufus' stories by no means move the action forward, but the section does add depth and insight into his character.A Death in the Family is a beautiful novel that is not merely a good read, but an experience to savor. On the \\"downside\\", the novel is placid and gracefully paced - honestly not much happens - but it is also heart-wrenchingly beautiful. If you're looking for a thriller this is certainly not it. Nor is it exactly comforting. Instead it contains a delicate spirituality of its own. It's a work of depth and beauty that is easy to enjoy."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I do not know much about James Agee's personal history, but one wonders whether there was a degree of biography in this profound account of a family torn apart by an untimely death. The time and setting certainly fit with Agee's own upbringing. In any event, he poignantly captures the conflicting emotions of a wife who is trying to cope with the loss of her partner and mate in his prime, and how to reconcile that loss with her strong, self-effacing religious beliefs. The church, or religion in general, is not given a good face in this work, particularly in the guise of the Catholic Father, and in the struggle that Mary undergoes in trying to be strong and suppressing her emotional grief, in the name of that religion. I was appalled by the stern and unforgiving body language and words conveyed by the priest towards the young children who had just been given news of their father's death. His actions and attitudes may be a sign of those times, but the reactions of the children towards the priest, of guilt, shame and conflictedness, when all they should have felt was comfort and consolation, demonstrates the type of stern and unyielding religious arrogance that is at the heart of this story. Obviously, religious conflict had a long and divisive, in some senses unspoken, history in the family profiled here. Those differences exploded after the tragedy occurred. Also, the reactions and feelings of Rufus in particular, and also his younger sister, and his sense of pride and accomplishment in telling of his father's death to his schoolmates, is shocking, yet real. A child cannot adequately come to terms with the finality of death, and perhaps the saddest line in the book is Rufus pondering whether news of his father's death might prompt some of his schoolmates (who he obviously feels intimidated by and fearful of) to share their lunches with him. His reactions are bewildered, and his mother is unable to console him or help him cope with the devastation of his father's death, with she herself struggling with whether to grieve or praise God. This is a very profound work and while parts of it were difficult to access - some of the large parts in italics - the emotion was raw and real. It is a story I will remember for a long time."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"My interest in this book came about after seeing a performance of Samuel Barber's opera &quot;Knoxville Summer of 1915&quot;. Before the performance there was reading from &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; the book for which the opera was named. A few days later I purchased the book. When I began reading I immediately understood why Agee's writing would inspire such a beautiful piece of music. No, the book is not perfect. It is tedious and repetitive in spots and some parts just don't work, but it is some of the most beautiful prose I have ever read. Agee does a wonderful job of capturing the world from a child's point of view: the almost dream-like descriptions of the Rufus' environment; the love and trust he has invested in his parents,in God and in the world; the sleepy sense that time is moving slowly for him etc. I believe the book is well worth the read despite the rough spots. As another reviewer pointed out the book was unfinished at the time of the author's death, and I believe this certainly accounts for many of the rough spots. It also offers a unique chance to see a published novel as somewhat of a work in progress and to learn something about the writing process. This is one of my most cherished books."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Imagine, if you will, a group of family members, sitting around a recently deceased corpse arguing religion and theodicy - strong, literary, atheistic men on one side, weaker, pious women on the other- with the piquancy that only a recent death of one close to them all could possibly have brought about. Then, add to this a little boy looking upon all this and trying to make sense of it all, while trying to come to terms with his father's death. You now have the setting, if not the summary, of this book.The men reflect on Thomas Hardy and Macbeth (Joel) and Shelley (Andrew) while the women mumble prayers and are bullied by a priest. When they first learn of the death Joel ruminates about his falling out with his wife, Hannah, that, \\"...Besides, that had never been the real estrangement; it was the whole stinking morass of churchliness that really separated them, and now that was apt to get worse rather than better. Apt? Dead certain to.\\" And Joel is correct, it is \\"dead certain\\" to get worse. And it does.Agee portrays the women sympathetically, but as essentially weak, pulling out old rosaries and succumbing to a sanctimonious priest who keeps a figurative whip of morality beneath his soutane and true viciousness under his unctuous smile. The widow, Mary, is finally defeated thusly: \\"For before, she had at least been questioning, however gently. But now she was wholly defeated and entranced, and the transition to prayer was the moment and mark of her surrender.\\"The book does manage to convey of how terrible and heart-rending it is to deal with mortality through the autobiographical prose-poems in the mind of the boy, Rufus: \\"That this little boy whom he inhabited was only the cruelest of deceits. That he was but the nothingness of nothingness, condemned by some betrayal. That yet in that desolation, he was not without companions. For featureless on the abyss, invincible, moved monstrous intuitions. And from the depth and wide throat of eternity burned the cold, delirious chuckle of rare monsters beyond rare monsters, cruelty beyond cruelty.\\"It's all a bit plodding and belaboured for my taste, strong stuff for a lad. Agee, here and in Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, just couldn't seem to fashion from his work a convincing world. So many different worlds and styles war with another within the book that one is scarcely surprised at all that he died with it incomplete.Perhaps, as so many proclaim, this work is a masterpiece. But I myself just don't see it. There are some fine lines and paragraphs which, taken alone, are quite stellar. But plodding through this morass of death and religiosity, this mishmash of styles, does not comport with my experience of reading a masterwork.Please, feel free to disagree."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee's writing just does something to me. As I read his books, I go back and forth between loving and loathing what I'm reading--I finish his books with a vague feeling of disappointment--and then for YEARS afterward I can't stop thinking about them.It happened to me first with \\"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,\\" and it's happening again with \\"A Death in the Family.\\"\\"A Death in the Family\\" tells the story of a small Catholic family affected by the sudden death of their father/husband/brother-in-law/son-in-law/et cetera. The first half of the book examine several different characters as they gather around the soon-to-be-dead-man's old and suffering father. For all that time it seems as if the death alluded to by the book's title will be the death of the man's father. Instead, the man himself dies in a car accident on the way back home from his sick father's. The book flashes back to the childhood of the dead man's son, and hovers around many of the book's characters, seeming almost indecisive as to who it's going to be about, seeming nebulous and atemporal. The wife. The kids. A preacher. A neighbor. A sibling. At times the story feels scattered and unfocused, but the writing is always so beautiful that it the story almost doesn't seem to matter, and the vagueness seems to match the confusion that comes after the sudden death of a close loved one.The book deals well with the themes of death and loss and family relations and grieving and God and religion, and James Agee writes masterfully about the way children think. His descriptions of things and emotions are dead on, and his occasional experimental passages (like the man starting his car, and the sounds it makes for ten minutes) are a delight.If the author had not died early of a sudden heart attack, and had lived to finish the book's editing himself, I bet it would have been even better. I recommend this and any James Agee book to every literate person out there.It's something else, and it's something good."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"A Death in the Family is a timeless novel about the impact death causes within a family. The story is told through Rufus Follet, a six-year-old who loses his father in a car accident. This novel beautifully illustrates the numb reaction of family members to death.Agee uses the technique of flashbacks to give the reader background on some of the characters. Agee died while perfecting A Death in the Family and had not yet inserted these sections, so the publishers placed them at the beginning of each part of the novel. Because these flashbacks are not inserted logically, they are somewhat confusing, but they are not worthless. Flashbacks develop Rufus' personality and his longing to be accepted. They illustrate his relationship with his father and why he reacts in the manner that he does to his father's death. These flashbacks also reveal what life was like before the accident and how that happiness died along with Jay. They also give a detailed description of a middle class neighborhood in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1915.The story also illustrates the conflict between a man's wife and immediate family after his death. This conflict is portrayed through Jay's brother, Ralph. Ralph is an undertaker and wants to take care of Jay's body because he feels responsible for the death. It was his drunken phone call that caused Jay to drive out to see his family. Mary does not want Ralph to be the undertaker because Jay's body is already being taken care of and she does not want to move it. Ralph's feelings are hurt, but he can not do anything because a widow's wishes are more important than those of the family.Agee takes a critical tone towards the Catholic religion and especially with its priests. My favorite scene is the episode where Mary can feel the presence of her husband in the room. It brings up the conflict between Mary's father and her brother Andrew, who do not believe in God, and Mary and her aunt Hannah, who are strong believers of Catholicism. Agee showed his view of priests through the children's reaction to Father Jackson, the priest that visits their mother. The children listen in on their mother's conversation with the priest and feel that he is trying to hurt and defeat her. The children also fear the priest, and Rufus feels that his father would have killed him if he were still alive.One of the most poignant scenes in the novel occurs when Mary has to tell her children that their father is dead. Rufus understands almost right away that his father has died and he will never see him again. But his younger sister Catherine has a little more trouble. As their aunt is explaining the details of their father's death, Catherine asks the innocent question, &quot;When's Daddy coming home?&quot; My eyes welled up at reading this scene.I liked this book because it portrays an event that people can relate to at some time or another in their own lives. Agee did a wonderful job at giving the story the numb feeling that members of a family often feel immediately after a death. The characters are well developed and I found it easy to relate to them. I would recommend this book to those who have recently suffered a loss."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This book is one of those classics you've never heard of. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1958. I've had it on my shelf for a while. I probably would have had a completely different perspective on it had I read it six months ago. Recently, one of my best friends died in a freak bike accident. I'm not sure what made me decide to read this book now-if I was looking for insight, answers, or just trying to relive it again. I definitely relived it. I suppose anyone who has ever lost a loved one suddenly could relate to many parts of this story. But for me, the book was eerily similar to my own experience. It's about a man, Jay Follett, a father of two, who dies one night in a car crash. Through the eyes of Jay's wife, his son, and his brother, Agee paints an incredibly moving picture of a family struggling under the weight of Jay's death. By switching views, he blends innocence, anger, tenderness, and love in a way that, somehow, conveys all these emotions at once. I feel like I lived this story two months ago, and everything about it rang true to me. There were no answers to help explain anything, but this book is a beautiful articulation of what it's like to suddenly have life turned inside out in the worst way. And the opening chapter is one of the most touching I have ever read."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This is a beautiful book about a tragic occurance in the life of a very close family. It begins with a very interesting description of the daily life of the family that gives us a very powerful sense of the closeness of the family. Then when the father dies we see all of the mixed up feelings that each of the family members go through. There is everything from grief to greed to humor to depression in this book. It is at the same time a whirlwind of emotions and a slowly developed detailed account of those emotions. It is truly a masterpiece of writing. A TOUR DE FORCE!!!"},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee died in 1955, leaving A Death in the Family, barely finished, as his sole full-length novel. Agee was known for his poetry and non-fiction work, alongside movie reviews and screenplays. This was hailed as his masterpiece, and it obtained the Pulitzer Prize. But one wonders to what extent Agee's trajectory influenced the novel's reception.A Death in the Family is one of these slow pieces where the action is in the impressions formed by the characters from a single event, in this case the death of a family member. Set in Knoxville, Tennessee, 1915, the novel does include a few moving scenes in between soft canvases of Southern life. But it is also filled with much dull and monotonous dialogue. It skids slowly in between high points. Indeed, the best chapters concern the children's reaction to their father's death, their incomplete understanding of what has happened, and their struggle with adult grief and embarrassment. But these chapters are a small part of the novel. The rest deals with the numerous and sometimes interchangeable members of the storyline's extensive family. The effect is uneven and, I found, not as stirring as the hype promises."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"As other reviewers have stated, the opening passage \\"Knoxville: Summer 1915\\" (which was separate from the original manuscript)sets an impossible standard for the rest of the novel. It is undoubtedly one of the most adept, vivid, moving prose poems in the English language. The novel itself is characterized by a profound honesty and humanity-- these are some of the best-rendered characters I have ever encountered. The plot is very simple (the most crucial incident in the book takes place within the first fifty pages), and yet its message is beautiful and wise and sad. This is not a \\"perfect\\" book by any means, but it is a masterpiece in its own right."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"A thoroughly moving portrayal of death. The characters are beautifully simple people and because their lives are so ordinary, it is easier for a reader to empathize with their loss. I'm not sure that \\"Death\\" is what you would call a \\"great novel\\" - very little happens - but at the very least it's some \\"great writing\\" and almost always manages to strike an authentic chord."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"An oldie (1957) but a goodie. The work is set in 1915, so we have hand-crank cars and horses. This book is a poster child for truth in advertising. It is precisely what its title tells us. A young father is taken in the prime of his life. As the family gathers for the funeral, we hear every comforting word, every sob. The family arrives; the widow has drinks. We hear the prayers with the priest; the empty condolences; we sense the smell of the flowers. The child grief-stricken daughter hiding under the bed. Loading the hearse. In between we learn of the family squabbles; a Catholic woman in Tennessee who struggled to gain the acceptance of her husband's family. We get glimpses of that family: the alcoholic younger brother; the deaf mother-in-law; the spinster aunt. It's also a discussion of God interpreted by a young boy through the contradictory things he hears from adults. - is He out there or not? I read this book because the blurb said people talk about this book years after they have read it. I think that's a fair statement and good testimony for this book."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"With prose so beautiful it nearly makes one cry every other page, Agee traces the sudden change of a tranquil life better than anyone has before. This is a magical book as it seeks better understanding of humanity through loss. The prelude is about as good as anything ever written in the United States."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I don't know what prompted me to read this book. I don't read poetry, but I bet this novel has the same impact as a great poem on those that understand poetry. It explains the impact of death from the perceptive of everyone effected. When I recommend the book, the subject is unappealing. If you do not read this book, you will miss one of the great pieces of literature."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"My older Avon edition, with the far more appropriate cover of the empty easy chair, had only one \\"blurb\\" on the back, from the now defunct \\"Saturday Review,\\" which stopped publication in 1986. It said: \\"There's nothing quite like the excitement of coming upon a book and suddenly having it explode at you and fill you with wonder. Such a book is \`A Death in the Family'.\\" The quintessential blurb. I've remembered it for the 43 years since my first reading, and upon the second reading, find it equally appropriate and descriptive.James Agee starts the book with an equally memorable sentence, as well as introductory passage: \\"We are talking now of summer evenings in Knoxville, Tennessee in the time that I lived there so successfully disguised to myself as a child.\\" From the title to the section, you know that the year is 1915, a date that can evoke nostalgia. The men, and yes it was mainly men, came home from work, ate dinner at 6:00 pm, and with no TV, at 6:30 would go outside to water the lawn, and the evenings were enjoyed on the front porch. Agee has a brilliantly precise depiction of the ritual of watering the lawn, from the noise in the hose, to the bell-shaped film of water that the spray can assume. I've rarely been able to use a hose since without recalling this descriptive passage.The novel spans the two or three days which surround the death of Jay Follet in a car accident, and the subsequent impact his death had on his wife, their two small children, as well as the rest of the family. Yes, it was a simpler time, with cars in their infancy, and we learn that it was one cotter pin that fell out of the steering mechanism which resulted in the crash.Much of the book is told from the point of view of the Follet's son, Rufus. Rarely does an adult writer have the ability to tell a story through the eyes of a child without mudding the waters with adult sensibilities and knowledge. In Agee's case though, I thought he hit ever note true. It certainly brought back a flood of memories from my own childhood, and how I had rarely thought about certain aspects since. The scene in which the older children make a performance out of making fun of 5-year old Rufus, who is only seeking their recognition and approval, is heart-breaking. Ah, the cruelty of children.There were numerous other vignettes of equal intensity and insight, and these included a depiction of the alcoholism of Jay's younger brother Ralph; the conflicts in the marriage of Jay and Mary over alcohol and religion; a shopping trip with an aunt, with the importance of making your own style selections; the heartache of extreme age over 100; and a description of the night, from a child's bedroom. Agee's writing evokes deep emotion, again and again.Many of us have, or may have to explain what death is to a young child. Forget all the \\"How to...\\" books on this one. Agee has written the sine qua non account. Agee also had a dim view of the \\"men of the cloth,\\" and wrote a scathing portrait of the obtuse, pompous Father Jackson, who alienated both Rufus, and his sister Catherine, with numerous faux pas. Again, how much was projection of adult sentiments onto children? On the first reading, I obviously did not know, but on the second, something similar happened to my own children, when they were 6 and 7. They saw through the bad attitude of the \\"preacher man,\\" and said they never wanted to go back; and they haven't. But it is Mary's brother, Andrew who delivers the most scathing critique, because Father Jackson would not perform all the rites since Jay had never been baptized: \\"Genuflecting, and ducking and bowing and scraping, and basting themselves with signs of the Cross, and all that disgusting hocus-pocus, and you come to one simple, single act of Christian charity and what happens? The rules of the Church forbid it. He is not a member of our little club. I tell you, Rufus, its enough to make a man puke up his soul.\\"42 years ago I recommended this book to a well-read friend and mentor from East Tennessee, and he came back with the verdict that this was just a \\"simple story, OK, but of not much significance.\\" It has bothered me, in a low key way, lo' these many years. Was I originally right, or was his assessment correct? Surely I was right the first time... and the second reading has only confirmed, and even strengthened that assessment. I consider it one of the top 10 American novels ever written. A 6-star read."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This book is a beautifully written novel about life and death in the early 20th century as seen through the eyes of a young boy. It is almost lyrical in the way it is written. The story revolves around a young family's father being killed instantly and unexpectantly. The character portrayals are so sharp that the reader feels he knows them intimately, and it is easy to relate them to our everyday acquaintances and relatives. This book is a must-read true classic."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Agee's book is about loss, or should I say LOSS. The main character suffers the loss of the most important, or at least one of, the most important people in her life. She leans on the love of her family and God but even with those loves she's still essentially alone and lost in pain. Unfortunately most of us old folks have weathered such losses and gotten through them somehow. It's hard to let the loss make you a better, more loving, a stronger person but the only other alternative is to become hard or bitter. I've always thought that if I have to go through it I might as well look for the treasures in the pain.....things like greater compassion, ability to understand those you come into contact with rather than be understood by others, and mostly to stay or increase your ability to love yourself, others, your God, to value the eternal as well as the human."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"That's about the gist of it as the title implies. A Waltonesque tale of flowery passages describe the lives and dynamics of a turn of the century Southern family and the unexpected death of a recovering alcoholic father. The mother seeks solace in her religion and the young boy Rufus is conflicted primarily over his Negro sounding name and then his fathers death.This book is on alot of must read lists,best 50 books etc,and it even won a Pulitzer prize.Sorry, but I just don't see the big deal.There are lots of stuffy older relatives and in a flashback scene that was inserted into the book after the authors own death, the family visits an ancient, mummy of a great-great grandma way up in them thar hills who gets so excited the only sign that she is alive is that she urinates on herself.Religious hypocrisy is addressed over funeral rites with a 'lets get it over and get on with our lives' mentality.Some nice imagery, but all in all, not the great American novel I was expecting.I kept waiting for something spectacular to happen but the ending though sweet, was rather anti-climactic.Wish there was more to say but it left me flat.Read it because the lists say you should,that is, if they matter to you. They shouldn't,sometimes they are wrong, but it's your opinion that really matters in the end."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"The book was as described by the seller.We received it in a timely manner."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"a father's death provides focus to everyday issues such as family interactions, society views, childhood mockery, etc."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"In &quot;A Death in the Family,&quot; James Agee describes the pains and hardships endured by a family who has experienced a sudden death.Late one night, he is called to visit his father who is very near death. He leaves his warm bed to be by his father's side. The emergency turns out to be a mere false alarm, and Jay returns the next evening. Unfortunately, a technical problem causes the car to go out of control and jay is instantly killed in the accident. Jay's wife Mary and his two young children Rufus and Catherine are the focus of the novel as they react to the news.The heart-felt story is told through the eyes of Rufus, Mary and Jay's brother Ralph, which helps to personalize the evnt for the reader. Flashbacks are used by the author and placed randomly throughout the novel. These flashbacks personify Jay's character as a loving, devoted husband and father. Alhough overly descriptive and sometimes confusing, the flashbacks cause the reader to grow to regard Jay as a wonderful man.This style that Agee employs in his novel can be considered dull and boring. Without them, however, the novel as a whole would be meaningless. By enduring this difficult reading, one almost experience for him- or herself the anguish and grief of the family involved. Perhaps this poignancy expressed by Agee is due to his own experience with death when his father died.&quot;A Death in the Family&quot; left me heartbroken and deeply saddened. There were even points where I found myself near tears. Agee's writing made a deep impact on me. Anyone else who has experienced a death will feel the same way."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"As with other reviewers of this book, certain passages will remain with me a long time as descriptions particularly well done , e.g., Ralph agonizing over his manhood and his alcohol in the room with family members as his father lies ill in bed. The picture Agee paints of Jay's daughter, Catherine, whether dealing with eternal questions or merely trying to color in spite of her bothersome brother, also are priceless.With regard to questions of the church, which is so obviously Roman Catholic as evidenced by references to the rosary, Hail Marys, and family members 'crossing' themselves, one wonders why Agee included two distinctly Anglican prayers at the end. On p. 302 of the paperback edition, Mary and Hannah seem to recite the prayer For All Sorts and Conditions of Men (&quot;O God, the creator and preserver of all mankind....&quot;) and The General Thanksgiving (Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we thine unworthy servants do give thee most most humble and hearty thanks...&quot;) - both found in the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer (p. 58 and p.814)."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I borrowed this book from the library upon seeing it's cover and reading what it was about. I believe that Agee is very good at suspense. He spends two chapters devoted to Mary and Hannah discussing if Jay is dead or not. It's very heartbreaking. But, the only thing is, the character of Mary, when she found the news that he was dead, she and her family didn't act like they had just lost a loved one. Mary acted normal and her sweetness got rather annoying at times. it almost seemed like a 50's commercial the way she talked."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee's A Death in The Family is a challenging prospect for a 300-page text. It is a book that has received the most valuable award that one can bestowed upon an American writer: The Pulitzer Prize. While the depths of Agee's written skills are not in question, the flow and the nature of the text left much to be desired. While I was enraptured at time with the depth of the visual imagery and sheer emotion carried throughout the text, I thought that the general flow of the novel was a bit too fractured and laconic. Also, at least for me, the emotions of the children were not clear enough. As well, while the prose was marvelous, it was a pure chore to finish reading this book. The only part that I found engaging was the actual death in the family. They took a strong moment and made a comment about race? This narrative move did not make sense to me, and it helped to ruin the pace that it so slowly had gained from the pages upon pages of ink that were spilled about the breakfast and Jay making and not making the pancake along with generally bickering (in a playful way, of course) with his wife. While some may consider this a classic, I consider it an exercise in style over substance."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I had to read this for my college history class, and I was super excited because the author and I share the same name, but I was very disappointed with this book.

This is a true fact about my emotional state when I came to know about the news of their deaths so far."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Personally, I am not someone who enjoys long, drawn-out pages about the little things in life. I don't criticize those who do; I just don't myself. And that's what this novel is like - pages upon pages concerning little happenings that lead up to and then follow the death of family man Jay. Quibbles about religion, food, funerals, hearing...while the scope of the story contains genuine feeling, it's just not enough for me. And, sadly for the reader, author Agee died before truly completing his work on the novel. The editors have now tacked passages Agee had written (but not yet included) onto the ends of each section; it strikes me as invasive, somehow - who knows what Agee would have done with them? Maybe he wouldn't have put them in after all...I just felt like I wanted to see more of what his original plan was. It's a good book and for some (as apparent from the many positive reviews) it will speak volumes and touch souls. It just didn't do it for me. But, it's in no way something that's unreadable or bad. It's most interesting, surely."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This might have been a great work of literature, but before completing it James Agee died of a heart attack at age 45. It was released posthumously in 1957, as edited by David McDowell, a friend of Agee's. Appearing between Parts I and II and Parts II and III of the novel are a number of loose ends or scraps of text, as inserted by McDowell. In 2007, Michael Lofaro, a professor at the University of Tennessee, released another, longer, version of the novel, which he contends is closer to Agee's intent. Scholars and hardcore aficionados might also want the Lofaro edition, but this one by McDowell is the one for the general reader, inasmuch as it was the one awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1958.I know nothing about the manuscript(s) with which McDowell worked, and hence nothing about his editing decisions. But I advise other general readers to skip the scraps of text inserted between the Parts of this edition; in my opinion, they detract from the main text. (Several are worth reading, more or less as separate short stories, but read them after finishing the main text.) Even so, the main text strikes me as not fully realized. The novel is disconcertingly diffuse, especially in its admixture of styles and the proliferation of points of view. My guess is that Agee struggled mightily with the novel and that, before his sudden death, he recognized that it was far from ready for publication.Thus, in a sense, it really is impossible, and unfair, to assess A DEATH IN THE FAMILY as a novel. Besides its lack of sustained focus and consistent style, the narrative goes too far in finding the good in its characters, in justifying them despite their weaknesses; everyone is noble (except Father Jackson, but then religion clearly is a bugaboo of sorts for Agee). Further, there are occasional sentences or passages that are cloying. To be sure, there is much superb prose for which the novel is justly celebrated, especially the keenly observed and poetic descriptions of aspects of quotidian life. Yet, in an odd way, the wondrous lyricism of parts of the novel is offset by the tedious dialogue of other parts. (The contrast of styles is, for me, too stark.)Ironically, then, the novel is doubly autobiographical. It is set in Knoxville, Tennessee, and it opens with a scene featuring Rufus, a young boy. The \\"death in the family\\" occurs when Rufus's father is killed in a car accident. James Agee's middle name was Rufus, he was from Knoxville, and at age six his father was killed in a car accident. And, just as his father's life was cut short, so was James Agee's. The tragedy both IN the novel and WITH the novel is what might have been. Or, as Rufus's grandfather puts it, \\"You've got to bear it in mind that nobody that ever lived is specially privileged; the axe can fall at any moment, on any neck, without any warning or any regard for justice.\\"(Finally, I want to add a word of appreciation for the fine and heartfelt Introduction by Steve Earle to the 2009 Penguin edition that I read.)"},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I was kind of appalled to see only one review for what I consider to be one of the greatest novels ever written, so I thought I'd write another rousing endorsement for a book that is (literally) sheer poetry. If you read only ten works in your life, make this one of them; many parallels to James Still's \\"River of Earth\\" (another \\"coming of age\\" memoir), including the pure pleasure of reading the words as put together. All characterizations ring true, the \\"postcard\\" of a past now gone forever is unforgettable, and it's in parts quite funny (such as the young children's interpretations of what they don't quite understand being said and done around them). As explained in the prologue of the edition I found, Agee died before he'd finished refining the work; as a result, parts are left unassigned to a particular order. These were inserted, just as written, fairly skillfully after his death, although the italics got a bit tiresome to read. Overall, however, it works. Someone once said, \\"We read books to know we are not alone.\\" If ever you've suffered a loss and as a result seen your happy world turn dark and changed forever, you'll relate to and find comfort (and company) in this book."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This is one of the most touching books I've ever read. Agee has the greatest knack of talking in the language of the character under examination. His attention to minute detail brings the picture of what the characters see and do and feel in a way that I find rather profound. The language is never coarse or overly broad. You never have to guess what a sentence is conveying, it is so literate yet to the point. For instance, Agee names all the mourners, just the way a child would who was watching them pass by one by one, and creates an atmosphere of the burden of sadness but not understanding why the burden is put forth.Young Rufus' character and personality come across as the most touching of all. He is a young boy starting to mature but still captured in childhood, and trying to understand people and their behaviors toward him, trying to trust but knowing and feeling puzzled by the things people do to him to destroy that trust. And learning he can't trust himself either. Everyone can relate to his trials in this regard. All the folks who populate this book are folks you'd want to know more about. But the most touching aspect of all is the way Agee lets you know just how the death of one impacts so many, so very many others; how it hurts, how it forces growth, how much sadness it generates. I couldn't put it down. And my tears still flow thinking about it."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Agee is clearly a master wordsmith, as demonstrated by his ability to move freely among sharp reportage, dialogue, and impressionistic fantasia. But what distinguishes this book as a meaningful contemplation of the impact of death upon the lives that continue, and not just a well-crafted exercise in sentimentality, is Mr. Agee's exploration of how personalities of varing temperments, maturities, and religious perspectives react to both the death itself and to the other characters' responses to the tragedy. My only real criciticism is that some passages illustrating the children's perspective lapse into excesses of wonderment and, if you would, \\"childlikeness,\\" but it doesn't spoil the book."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee's posthumous novel, A Death in the Family, is very short . I think I read it over a weekend. As you can infer by the title, it's about a family that experiences a traumatic loss. The editors had a lot of extra material that they didn't know how to fit into the linear story; thus, they have inserted these extras every other chapter as vignettes, which give the reader a deeper insight into the life of the person who died. The omniscient narrative is most interesting when told from the children's point of view.Agee artfully crafts the child characters. They way the adults speak to the children and how the children then process that information is something that Agee masters in this novel. They ask all of the questions that adults tend to internalize or try to ignore. The little boy seems fascinated by death, which reminds me a of a short story by Jamaica Kincaid-later incorporated into her novel Annie John.Though it's a sad story, the way Agee weaves psychology of death, nuances of social and familial relationships, conflicts of religious belief and practice, and the difference in cognition of children versus adults, is beautiful and absolutely fascinating."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"'A Death in the Family' is, without doubt, one of the greatest American novels I have read. It was, at times, almost unbearable in its sadness. It re-connected me to feelings which are normally and, perhaps properly, stored away so securely that they rarely penetrate everyday consciousness. It is probably one-of-a-kind, and that is well, for I don't believe that it would be either necessary or healthy to undergo such a reading experience often.I think to appreciate(notice I don't say \\"enjoy\\")this book, you have to be willing, temporarily, to suspend the normal defenses most of us employ, on a more or less permanent basis, against having to contemplate the reality and inevitability of death. Of course, this will then leave you vulnerable in a way which some might find so unpleasant that they should avoid the book altogether.However, if you are willing to undertake this experience, knowing that it may dredge up strong and harrowing emotions, you may feel, as I do, that you have acquired something valuable in the process. I don't think the book, itself, so much has some special lesson to teach us, as that through relating to it's vivid and powerful evocation of a particular tragedy, it puts us in touch with our own personal experiences and feelings about death. When reflected on and assimilated, I think we may feel we have added to our store of self-knowledge and our perception of life in general.Distilled as it was from the personal experience, as a small child, of the death of the author's father, we experience the added poignancy of viewing this death through the eyes of a vulnerable and innocent boy. How awesome, mysterious, and terrible this revelation of death was to one who had been unaware, and how remindful it is to those of us whose memories of this phase may have become blunted with time.But the book is as much about life as it is about death. It is rich with the feelings and impressions of the people who must deal with the tragedy, feel the emotions, pay the proper respect, and somehow resume the course of life under altered circumstances, ever mindful of the void which can never be filled. From the minutiae connected with such an occurrence to the deeply profound suffering of the soul it causes, the novel immerses you in a drama which demands you experience it to the fullest.Of course, not every death generates such reactions. I think it's fairly safe to say that Southern ties of kinship in Knoxville of 1915 were probably generally stronger than in our highly urbanized society of today, and the death of a young husband and father might have affected more people more strongly. However, this contrast only serves to suggest, in my opinion, that there were some very positive aspects to the customs of that bygone era.There were negative aspects also to the strict and idealized model which people thought they had to live up to. There was prudishness and intolerance as well as intense love of family and strong ties to kin. There was conflict between stringent religious beliefs and more humanistic attitudes.The intensity of grief encountered at such a young age as well as the very ambivalent and conflicting feelings of the adults in his family circle was no doubt the major formative influence of the author's life. Many years later he summoned up these experiences, and with remarkably beautiful prose, shaped them into a work of art."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"When you read this book and I hope everyone gets a chance to....please....remember he died before the editing process was finished. I loved Rufus and Mary and Aunt Hannah. This is what death is like to a small child. Mysterious, scary, poignant and lonely. I hope someone will read this book and agree with me."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This is a great slow glacier of a novel. Imagine James Joyce, in Portrait of an Artist, going on and on detailing every nuance of young Stephen Dedalus's early memories, his repetitious conversations, his exhaustive introspections on this action and that word. The book is just not a good fit for our culture of 24 hour cable news, Ipods, and desire for instant gratification. Not that that stuff is bad, but it's not the place where this book comes from.I nearly gave up on it twice. One spot was the section on the desperate self loathing of alcoholic Uncle Ralph. Agee so carefully, and at such great length, spins out this man's pain it's hard to take. The other was the pre-dawn foreshadowing Rufus's father and mother engage in as his father prepares to leave his family - this nearly went beyond the pale with \\"...he would finish the pancakes if it was the last thing he did...\\"But I stuck with it and the book turns out to be wonderful. The payoff comes after the death in the family occurs. By this time you know, in particular, Rufus and his sister and his mother and his aunt, so well that when Agee turns their faculties from the minutia of ordinary life to coping with wrenching tragedy - just to see how they're going to manage it - he is able to build the kind of mighty suspense that carves deep valleys out of rock.A few notes: The real turning point for me was the section in which Rufus meets his great great grandmother; that was a wonderful self-contained piece of writing. Though I've loved Samuel Barber's setting of \\"Knoxville: Summer of 1915\\" for many years, I wouldn't say it's the best part of the book. It's more of an overture, introducing themes that will be fully explored in the rest of the work. Finally, I didn't read the print (I'm not sure I could have finished it). I listened to this book on CDs and I highly recommend the sensitive reading of it by Mark Hammer on Recorded Books."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Set in Knoxville, Tennessee shortly after the turn of the twentieth century, James Agee's novel, A Death in the Family, is a powerful story of a close-knit family whose happiness is destroyed when tragedy befalls them. Within the few days that the novel spans, Agee powerfully portrays a grief-stricken family struggling to cope with a death in their family.In this Pulitzer Prize winning novel, readers meet the Follets, a family bound tightly together by the love they share for one another....Throughout his novel, Agee explores several literary aspects. Although the narration varies, Agee primarily relays his story through the character of Rufus Follet, a six-year-old boy who can not comprehend the concept of death.....With a combination of young and older characters, Agee is able to successfully depict the typical reactions to death that people of various ages experience.As the title of the book reveals, it is not surprising that A Death in the Family contains a sympathetic tone. Since the time frame of the book spans only a few days, Agee is able to describe each character's response to the tragedy in detail. Therefore, readers get a real sense of feeling for the Follet family and what they are going through. By focusing solely on the few days leading up to and following the death, Agee draws readers into the plot and makes the story much more moving and heartfelt than it would be if the novel was about Jay's entire life. Thus, it is James Agee's exceptional use of techniques that makes A Death in the Family a literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"A Death in the Family is devastating and heart-breaking and a perfect narrative. Anyone who has suffered a shocking loss experiences many emotions and may not know how to give voice to them; Agee finds a way to express them in sharply tuned phrases and precise observations. Although written many years ago, this book is not dated in any way. I was stunned by the prose - the careful use of words, the economy of sentences and the attention to important details. Impressive."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This is the story of a father's untimely death and the family's reaction to it. At the beginning of this story you immediately know that this is a very close family. When the father is suddenly killed in an automobile accident we are taken on the journey the family must take as they realize the immediate and future changes to their family, their feelings and life. Agee did a great job of bringing the reader along. I felt the pain and grief due to the descriptive and emotional way this was written. He touched on other topics especially the church and the role it played in society during that time period. I found myself angry along with Mary's brother Andrew at the priest who refused to complete the service because her husband had not been baptized. This was definitely a good book."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Pulitizer Prize winner, A Death In The Family is a most serious intoxicating read, not about the death of an individual, but the experiences of those who live, love and the commitment to faith in religion.It is a tightly worded, well-described novel that doesn't miss a beat. The minds of of certain characters, their fears, their ideas, their issues, their mysteries, are all detailed, thoroughly. The narrative is filled with enough for the reader to completely grasp every detail, every thought, every step.The main characters are important and we learn quickly who they are, do we care, do we connect, do we support, do we feel for them, do we disagree?The basic theme in this novel religion first, death second. If your experience is to acquaint with the religious aspect, then here it is. But if you want to seek more on the aspects of death, love, family, you can absorb more than enough here. For sure, you can understand death anxiety, whether your own death or for a loved one.Like any good literature, this is a lengthy novel that should require TWO readings. One may need to connect with the lengthy dream sequence (in italics). You may want a more thorough understanding of how the wife copes through religion or how a death can affect someone too young to understand.The story involves a father of two, who en route to his own father's home because of illness, is killed in an accident. His wife Mary has absorbed herself into faith to cope, his son Rufus trying to understand the tauntings of playmates and the adult world, where the other family members explore different views.It is said that James Agee died before completing editing and therefore, there lies some controversy on certain profound sections inserted. Also, this movie can never really become depicted on the screen with enough understanding. Movie making just cannot delve into of what is told her. We feel in the story like we cannot in a movie. Just won't happen.I recommend other great dramatic plays:Ethan Frome (Penguin Classics)orThe Rope Dancers: A Play in Three ActsandThe Subject Was Roses (A Play in Two Acts)....Rizzo"},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Recently I read A death in the Family by James Agee.

After reading it I found out that the editor's put all of the italics in, because Agee had died before the book was completely finished and the editors were not sure where to put it, so they put it at the end of each section.

Before the piece was performed there was a reading from &quot;A Death in the family&quot; upon which the opera was based. When I began reading I imediately understood why Agee's writing style would inspire such a beautiful piece of music. No, the book is not perfect. It is tedious in spots and parts of it just don't work, but it is some of the most beautiful prose I have ever read. It captures a world from a childs point of view: the dreamlike description of the child's environment, his love and trust in his parents, his sense of time etc. I believe this book is well-worth the read despite the rough spots. As another reviewer pionted out it is good to remember that the author died before completing the editing process."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Agee was an excellent writer, and in this book he evokes both the joy of living and the numbness of loss masterfully. But after rereading this book a couple times (I felt its reputation warranted another chance), I cannot shake my initial impression that his portrayal of wife and daughter were a bit on the sentimental side. Mary in particular drove me crazy. Her sweetness was cloying, her strength undermined by breathy speeches--which are emphasized with too many italics for my taste. I wish I could agree with all the positive reviews, but for me the quality of writing could not make up for characters and dialogue that drove me bats."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Recently I read A death in the Family by James Agee.

My students absolutely loved the ending since it appears unresolved. It led to interesting dicussions over the differences between spirituality and religion.

Apparently also a renowned film critic, journalist, and poet, Agee applies a technique that finds modes and moods associated with other famous Southern writers, showing shades of Faulkner's descriptive flair and Eudora Welty's sensitivity to emotions and domestic despair, without overdoing any single aspect of his style.The story takes place in 1915 in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Jay Follet, an ordinary man approaching middle age, lives with his wife Mary and their two small children, Rufus, who is about six, and Catherine, who is almost four. One night he gets an anxious telephone call from his brother Ralph beckoning him to the bedside of their ailing father, who appears to be at death's door. Jay agrees to go, and in an excellent scene in which Mary makes breakfast for him before his departure, the reader gets a clear view of the kind of relationship they have. The alarm turns out to be a false one, but death is still in the cards: Returning home, Jay is killed in a car accident.The rest of the novel demonstrates the sudden impact on Mary and her well-meaning family. Her aunt Hannah is the most helpful and the most sympathetic to her piety; her father is an agnostic who takes a practical view of things while her partially deaf mother listens through an ear trumpet; her brother Andrew tries to console her by explaining the relatively merciful circumstances of Jay's death with an interesting forensic reconstruction of the accident. Andrew is a cynic who seems to derive his personality from his father; he is quick to detect sanctimoniousness and sourly decries the priest who refuses to give the unbaptized Jay full burial rites. And, in regard to a difficult telephone conversation with Jay's inarticulate brother, he delivers the novel's best line: \\"Talking to that fool is like trying to put socks on an octopus.\\"The text of the novel is interspersed with sections relating the young Rufus's memories of growing up and perspective on his father's death, the seriousness and finality of which he is not quite old enough to understand. There are nostalgic scenes depicting days and nights on the Knoxville streets, his expectations of a \\"surprise\\" which turns out to be the birth of his younger sister, an epiphanous lesson on race relations from his black nurse Victoria, the torment and ridicule he suffers from older, bigger boys when he starts school, and, most piquant of all, a Charlie Chaplin film to which his father takes him.Although religion plays a role, the novel is not filled with uplifting, hyperreligious cliches that try to find some higher purpose in the tragedy. Agee explores trauma and grief with the hard eye of a playwright, rendering his novel warm but not sentimental, melancholy but not depressing or humorless, melodramatic but not hysterical. \\"A Death in the Family\\" is as pure an elegy on the American family as any the previous century could conceive."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I came to this novel after reading extensively in the film criticism of James Agee, who was easily one of the great reviewers the genre has seen. As one critic pointed out, in his criticism, Agee takes the reader into the film, and not to concerns extraneous to the film, like so many reviewers (such as Pauline Kael, who writes beautifully, but whose comments sometimes seem to have very little to do with the film in question).After reading his film criticism, I have to confess that I was somewhat disappointed by this novel. It was good, but it did not stand out in any way. So, if all this volume had to offer was the novel itself, I would be able to recommend it, but without too much enthusiasm.But thankfully, that is not the case. In addition to the text of the novel A DEATH IN THE FAMILY, the volume contains as a sort of preface one of the most extraordinary short pieces in 20th century American fiction, the amazing &quot;Knoxville: Summer of 1915.&quot; This piece was not written as part of the novel, but the editors of the volume wisely included it because both dealt with Knoxville. Also, the piece is so amazing that I am certain that they also wanted to include it so that it would not so easily get lost.I read A DEATH IN THE FAMILY once. I have probably read &quot;Knoxville: Summer of 1915&quot; a good dozen times. So, if the idea of purchasing a book for the sake of a mere five pages seems extravagant, ask yourself, how many books do we reread bits of even a couple of times?The piece, which was turned into a marvelous composition for voice by Samuel Barber, records the impressions of a typical summer evening, with the narrator a young child. The descriptions are so precise and tactile, that the reader almost feels as if his or her own impressions are being recorded. And despite being merely the record of an average evening moving from late afternoon to dusk to evening, Agee is able to make of it something universal and sad and metaphysical. There are many, many fine moments in this piece, from the first paragraph {beginning &quot;We are talking now of summer evenings in Knoxville, Tennessee, in the time that I lived there so successfully disguised to myself as a child&quot;) to the absolutely amazing final paragraph (ending: &quot;Those receive me, who quietly treat me, as one familiar and well-beloved in that home: but will not, oh, will not, not now, not ever; but will not ever tell me who I am&quot;).I am not sure how strongly I would recommend this volume if it were for the novel alone, but anyone who loves great writing needs to own this volume so as to own one of the great short pieces in American literature."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I don't normally like sad stories, but this novel had a so many beautiful lines that it deserves the high praise it has received. Here are a few of them--what passion!I hope my efforts at finding these wonderful lines makes your reading of my review worthwhile:\\"Just one way, you do get back home. You have a boy or a girl of your own and now and then you remember, and you know how they feel, and its almost the same as if you were your own self again, as young as you could remember\\" (p. 94).\\"'Look at me, Poll,' he said. She looked at him. \`That's when you're going to need every ounce of common sense you've got,' he said. \`Just spunk won't be enough; you've got to have gumption. You've got to bear it in mind that nobody that ever lived is especially privileged; the axe can fall at any moment, on any neck, without any warning or any regard for justice. You've got to keep your mind off pitting your own rotten luck and setting up any kind of howl about it. You've got to remember that things as bad as this and a hell of a lot worse have happened to millions of people before and that they've come thought it and that you will too. You'll bear it because there isn't any choice--except to go to pieces. You've got two children to take care of. And regardless of that you owe it to yourself and you owe it to him. You understand me'\\" (p. 148-149).\\"One by one, million by million, in the prescience of dawn, every leaf in that part of the world was moved\\" (p. 201).\\"On the rough wet grass of the back yard my father and mother have spread quilts. We all lie there, my mother, my father, my uncle, my aunt, and I too am lying there....They are not talking much, and the talk is quiet, of nothing in particular, of nothing at all in particular, of nothing at all. The stars are wide and alive, they seem each like a smile of great sweetness, and they seem very near. All my people are larger bodies than mine, quiet, with voices gentle and meaningless like the voices of sleeping birds....By some chance, here they are, all on this earth; lying, on quilts, on the grass, in a summer evening, among the sounds of the night. May God bless my people, my uncle, my aunt, my mother, my good father, oh, remember them kindly in their time of trouble; and in the hour of their taking away\\" (p. 15).Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee's mid-century classic, based on his own experiences, skips between straightforward narration of the events surrounding the death of a young father and husband, and the interior thought streams of the family. Also included are fragmentary flashback scenes found with the manuscript at the time of the author's death - but the editors, without guidance, and to avoid writing awkward transitional material, append these character studies and backstory elements to the end of Parts I and II. The result is a hybrid of Agee's words and of editorial structure - one that, despite the limitations of unlucky circumstances, retains its strength and poignancy.For those who may wonder whether Agee's intentions were well served by his editors, a new edition has been published within the last few years edited by Michael A Lofaro that might answer that question -A Death in the Family: A Restoration of the Author's Text. A selection of four chapters left out of the original edition - describing events that take place before the father's death - were previewed in Harper's Magazine in 2007, and though these sections are stylistically the same as the 1957 version, imagining these 'lost chapters' combined with the measured pacing of the traditional storyline does not strike me as a more complete rendering of Agee's purpose. To invert an old baseball saying, it would seem like subtraction by addition - tinkering with this powerful and effective work could very well magnify the present flaws that are concealed within the writing and ruin a delicate balance.Agee's experience with losing his father at a young age was surely the drive behind this book, and no doubt much of what he writes is how he remembers it. But intentionally or no, the wealth of detail that he includes during his character's cultural response to their grief is noted with near anthropological care. And the characters are nearly primal in their emotions - unique to their time and place, they react in response to interior motivations rather than a melodramatic, homogeneous, learned set of emotions from popular media. It is an honest narrative.Two issues only, though they run through the entire book. One is Agee's use of dialogue, which in its attempt to convey the rhythms of the area's speech includes too many instances of chatter that the reader could have easily inferred, and also some early use (though discontinued later) of 'eye dialect', or phonetic representation of a southern accent. The other problem, somewhat more serious, is Agee's attempt to present the children's viewpoints. By the time the novel concludes, there is an aggregate suspicion that Rufus and Caroline's thoughts are less like children's thoughts than a condescending adult's imagining of what a child's thoughts might be. Some readers may also question Agee's commentary regarding the efficacy of religious orders during personal tragedy. Undoubtedly this bitter view was based on experience, and in 1957, may also have been a rather dramatic attack on a powerful institution - today it seems loud and unsubtle.Even with these flaws, (perhaps even because of them?), the book is strong and impressive in the examination of the thoughts of Jay Follett's family as they privately deal with the news of his death. Even more so, and worth the entire experience of the book is the introductory short, 'Knoxville: Summer of 1915', inserted by the editors as a prologue but originally published in 1938 - just excellent. For the remainder Agee sticks to the style pioneered by the modernist writers before him, most often reminding me of Dos Passos - but some of that is a product of the editors, and the structure they imposed on the manuscript. Still, the genuine effort at contemplative storytelling in 'A Death in the Family', as opposed to the jokey superficiality of more contemporary literature, feels like a restorative. An affecting, if tragic, self-portrait."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee's \\"A Death in the Family\\" is a moving novel about the struggles of a family trying to cope with the tragic loss of one of their own. The story, set in Knoxville, Tennessee, is a relatively easy read, despite the fact that some parts are unfinished. Rufus, the protagonist of the story, is shaken from his childhood innocence by the sudden death of his father. He does not fully comprehend what death is and how it will effect him, but by the end of the story he begins to understand.Religion is a major theme in \\"A Death in the Family\\". It also causes many disputes within the family and eventually leads to Rufus' confusion abvout what death really is. Another major theme in the novel is the childhood viewpoint that the story is told from. This helps you to understand what Rufus feels and allows you to sympathize with him.James Agee uses flashbacks in \\"A Death in the Family\\" to give the reader some background information about the family. This helps the reader understand what Jay, Rufus' father, was like. This also helps the reader feel the depth of Rufus' loss. Agee also uses symbolism in the end of the book to convey the thought that life goes on.\\"A Death in the Family\\" is all in all a very moving novel. The lack of vulgarity and profaneness is a nice change from most books. I would recomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"A Death in the Family is a timeless novel about the impact death causes within a family. The story is told through Rufus Follet, a six-year-old who loses his father in a car accident. This novel beautifully illustrates the numb reaction of family members to death. Agee uses the technique of flashbacks to give the reader background on some of the characters. Agee died while perfecting A Death in the Family and had not yet inserted these sections, so the publishers placed them at the beginning of each part of the novel. Because these flashbacks are not inserted logically, they are somewhat confusing, but they are not worthless. Flashbacks develop Rufus' personality and his longing to be accepted. They illustrate his relationship with his father and why he reacts in the manner that he does to his father's death. These flashbacks also reveal what life was like before the accident and how that happiness died along with Jay. They also give a detailed description of a middle class neighborhood in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1915. The story also illustrates the conflict between a man's wife and immediate family after his death. This conflict is illustrated by Jay's brother, Ralph. Ralph is an undertaker and wants to take care of Jay's body because he feels responsible for the death. It was his drunken phone call that caused Jay to drive out to see his family. Mary does not want Ralph to be the undertaker because Jay's body is already being taken care of, and she does not want to move it. Ralph's feelings are hurt, but he can not do anything because a widow's wishes are more important than those of the family. Agee takes a critical tone toward the Catholic religion and especially with its priests. My favorite scene is the episode where Mary can feel the presence of her husband in the room. It brings up the conflict between Mary's father and her brother Andrew, who do not believe in God, and Mary and her aunt Hannah, who are strong believers of Catholicism. Agee showed his view of priests through the children's reaction to Father Jackson, the priest that visits their mother. The children listen in on their mother's conversation with the priest and feel that he is trying to hurt and defeat her. The children also fear the priest, and Rufus feels that his father would have killed him if he were still alive. One of the most poignant scenes in the novel occurs when Mary has to tell her children that their father is dead. Rufus understands almost right away that his father has died and he will never see him again. But his younger sister Catherine has a little more trouble. As their aunt is explaining the details of their father's death, Catherine asks the innocent question, &quot;When's Daddy coming home?&quot; My eyes welled up at reading this scene. I liked this book because it portrays a theme that most people can relate to at some time or another in their own lives. Agee did a wonderful job at giving the story the numb feeling that members of a family often feel immediately after a death. The characters are well developed and I found it easy to relate to them. I would recommend this book to those who have recently suffered a loss."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I am currently &quot;re-reading&quot; this book in audio, by Recorded Books, Inc. The reading, by Mark Hammer, is superb. But what I really want to say is that, as a writer, I was shocked to realize that this book was a great influence on my own writing. I first read it when I was in my early twenties; now I am fifty and it is as exquisite as ever, and influencing me just as much as it did in my youth.It is the mysterious, hushed intimacy of the book; the perfect dialogue of grieving people; the child's view of huge loss; the minute-by-minute telling of a story that must unfold slowly. Wow. I recommend it highly to all those who love literature. Just one warning: lay in a store of tissues. It's a two-box-er, at least."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This book really is incredible. I disagree with people believing it is boring, I find it to be beautiful and intriguing. It made me think because it has so many layers. The partially autobiographical novel focuses on the affects of death on different characters, and the growth they have after this huge change.The way Agee treats the human consciousness in this book is incredible- you will wonder if he just stepped into your mind and read it like a book. The circular motion of the characters' thinking is suprisingly on target. The characters dont seem overplayed and seem very real; I cared about them. The only thing I did not enjoy about the book was the complete turn around of styles of writing from section to section. I found this to be confusing and I feel it stopped the rhythm of the book.Overall though, it was one of the most moving books I have ever read. Emotional and showing ways of living that work and ones that dont, I feel like it affected the way I view things. anyone who has read it-wasnt the butterfly part beautiful?"},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"In reading Agee's A Death in the Family again after 30 years, I discovered why it had compelled me when I read it as a young teenager: the power of Agee's language, his attention to the minute detail of grief, from inside to out--the way a child might, in the midst of her grief and fear, notice a robin on the front lawn; the way in which a family, dealing with shock and grief of a young family member, will find itself appreciating humor and at the same time wondering how to do the ordinary things of life.There should be more information on this writer and his work. I think he has captured grief and loss as well or better than any writer I've read."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Agee's posthumously published tale of a young father's tragic death may seem somewhat weak in plot. After all, within the first few chapters we already know whose the title-foreshadowed \\"death\\" it is (although Agee craftily tries to mislead his readers into believing it is the death of an aging parent, which pulls the plot along in the beginning and gives us time to connect with his various characters). The rest of the story seems to be quite simply about how the survivors cope and interact following such a sudden death.But even if the plot scheme is indeed simple, the story itself is rich in the culture, sociology, and religious aspects of 1920s Knoxville, Tennessee. Moreover, Agee's incredibly eloquent and powerful prose would pull readers along even without these additional elements.Contrary to some of the reviewers, I find that the book is not entirely \\"grim.\\" The family's almost eager repetition of the fine details of the auto accident is tongue-in-cheek reality, and the conversations with the near-deaf grandmother are actually comical at times. I also fully appreciated Agee's wit in juxtaposing the despicable priest's visit with that of the delightful Mr. Starr--one of the book's highlights, I think.I did find that the book lacked some editing--but in the preface it is freely admitted that because the book was published posthumously, the choice was made to respect Agee's original work (with a few exceptions), and some texts were simply inserted (in italics) as best as the editors could guess because the order was not clear. And in places, the descriptions given from the little boy's point of view became tiresome, particularly of the funeral, because he went into great physical detail of the things he witnessed, describing them with his limited, childlike vocabulary, and at some point it almost makes you want to say, \\"Yes, that's called a BURIAL.\\" Certainly a forgiveable fault, however--if even a fault at all or simply just a question of preference.Not an action or mystery film-type novel, but certainly a cherishable work of art and an enjoyable read which leaves the reader feeling enriched from the experience."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I first read A Death In The Family for a book report for my English class. At first, it started out slow and i wanted to quit, but i kept going and read the whole thing. When i finished the book, I realized that the book was one of the most touching books i have ever read. James Agee really brings the emotion of each character to life. I really recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I had to read this book for a class that I am taking. The author is wonderful and the novel is extremely well-written. There are entire scenes and paragraphs where you can feel every emotion simply by the way the narrator describes his surroundings. I recommend the book itself to anyone that enjoys novels where the language and descriptions take center stage. That is not to say that the character and plot are lacking, but if you are looking for the fast-paced style of a Palahniuk, this would not be for you. Agee takes his time introducing you to this world.That said, I bought this on the Kindle. I prefer to go digital whenever possible to avoid the manufacturing/shipping/printing costs to the environment of traditional books. I LOVE to hold a good book and curl up with it, but with my appetite for them I find digital to be a more responsible option for the planet. This book was significantly more as a digital edition than the paperback edition. I wrote to Amazon and Penguin to register my complaints. I understand that they are still working out how to price these, but let's no pretend that a digital book is less of a value to the consumer than a paper book in the long run.I cannot loan the digital copy to a friend. I cannot sell it to a secondhand bookstore when I am done with it. I can read it on my device or other devices that can handle that format but that is all. Yes, it is convenient but not several dollars more convenient. As an Amazon Prime customer I would receive the book in two days with no shipping charges if I ordered the printed version. The paperback was $10.88 (same at other retailers) and the Kindle edition was [...]. This is not a major price difference but we should not be forced to pay more for something that provides us with less. I hope Amazon and the book publishers will begin to price books more fairly for consumers. At the very least the prices should be consistent with the lowest price version still in print."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee wrote this book through the time of his death, and was so tramatized by his fathers death that he was never able to finish it. It spans 4 days in addition to selected prose inserted as memories of the main character Rufus' childhood. On some level, Rufus is a representation of Agee himself as a child. This is a fantastic book which thoroughly explains what death means and what the consequences of death are. I would reccomend this book to anyone, it is fantastically written, and contains an even more impressive message."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"No surprise, this is not an uplifting subject matter. Nevertheless, this is one of the most amazingly well written novels I have read in a long time. (To be honest, I try to read about one book a week - many of which are highly rated.) Those of you who have enjoyed this novel - take a minute, go to the library, check out or read Agee's biography; cuz this book is based on his father dying when he was six years old. Sooo, although it is fiction - and amazing - it is truly based on fact. Wonderful &amp; Enjoyable!"},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Originally being from Knoxville, TN I heard about this book my whole life. I had never picked it up until now and I am currently reading it. The amazing thing for me is the descriptions of Knoxville. Never have I read a book where I could actually SEE the scenes as Agee describes Forest Ave (my former room mate at UT moved there!) and the descriptions of the old Theatre and Gay Street are wonderful. The old Miller's building is now offices for UT but it still stands. Anyway, I have never been pulled into a novel like this one, but it may be the Knoxville connection. &quot;Death In The Family&quot; is an American classic and Mr. Agee passed on WAY before his time."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I did enjoy the prelude and first section of this classic very much. I thought they presented an excellent description of suburban life as seen through the eyes of a young boy, as well as the unspoken love criss crossing between a father and his son. But if the early sections are the best parts of this work, then I don't need to feel bad about the fact that I just couldn't finish the rest of it. I did get more than halfway through it but perhaps I've overdosed on memoirs and death since recently reading The Glass Castle, The Liars' Club, and The Year of Magical Thinking. Another book about childhood trauma, death, and shock was just too much for me. I can see that Agee was a careful, brilliant writer, but he was a starry eyed student of James Joyce and William Faulkner. Agee's type of stream of consciousness was his poetic own but closely echoed the masters and he owed them big time. At some point, I thought Agee was trying almost too hard to be \\"literary,\\" and this self-consciousness made me uneasy. Dear reader, please also be aware that you have to be prepared to patiently bear the religious piety and emotional repression of the accident victim's wife, the introverted internal monologs of his son, the long and somewhat uneventful conversations of family members, and the slow elucidation of social issues tumbling through this family. I'm sorry, but I just ran out of patience and had to pull the plug on it all."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"A good story as far as it goes, this book ended abruptly without bringing everything yo a satisfying end. Perhaps the writer had that in mind since it is a tale of death. Still, I thought just a little synopsis of the family was have drawn it to a real end."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"The opening sequence of this novel set in Knoxville, Tennessee is among the most vivid scenes ever written. You will feel you are there. The novel is a poignant coming of age for a child losing a parent. It's wonderful and unforgettable."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"There are good reads that satisfy and are thoughtful and have lovely writing. And then there are the truly great reads that leave the reader longing to start the book over and reread it just as soon as one turns to the final paragraph. A Death in the Family is a great read.The story is very simple. Jay Follet, the dad and the husband in the family, receives a call from his brother that his father is very ill and is near death. Jay goes to be with his father and on his return is killed in an automobile accident.But there is so much more to this book that makes it a great read. The writing is beautiful, filled with wonderful words and phrases that feel fresh and new without feeling artificial. Agee gets inside each character's head so that each character seems unique and genuine. The reader is left with the mysteries of the story that so often occur in real life: Had Jay been drinking when the accident took place? Was Jay's father really seriously ill and, if not, why did Jay's brother call? What will happen to Jay's wife and children? How will the accident change their lives?A must read."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Agee is one of those writers who, for some reason, I always want to read aloud. It's a fairly difficult thing to do, because his pace and construction is so dependent on the sentiments underlying each sentence. And these, as is normal (I think) can vary from moment to moment, sentence to sentence. And these are so tightly wrought, I have no doubt that each word was carefully weighed. The power of voicing these sentiments, struggling with them, can be uncanny. Thankfully, you don't need a guide to understand his direction - this is language picked straight out of his life, and made sacred.At first he seems to be playing games, faking you out with shifts in his foreshadowing. But despite awareness of the deployment of a strategy, I have never been able to sit down and read the whole thing straight through - my heart seems to stop, and I have to put it down. I get upset, viscerally. It tears me apart, up and down. A remarkable achievement- and if you have the time to look at an Agee biography, the vibrations only intensify."},{"Title":"The Barretts of wimpole Street","review":"Rudolf Besier's \\"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\\" is an excellent play based on a turbulent period in the life of the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Elizabeth is an invalid who along with her many brothers and sisters lives in terror of her borderline insane father. He rules his house with an iron fist, forbidding any of his children to marry or even have friends.Into this nightmare comes fellow poet Robert Browning, who through a combination of tender ardor and sheer stubbornness forever changes the life of Elizabeth, and ultimately all of the Barretts. The final scene, where the family comes to terms with a great shock, is both frightening and triumphant.Besier's play is rooted in fact and tightly paced, with an incredibly suspenseful ending, especially since most people know how Barrett's life turned out. Good, solid dialogue and an interesting historical backdrop make this play well worth reading.GRADE: A-"},{"Title":"The Barretts of wimpole Street","review":"Well this play started off slow, but once Robert Browning was introduced, I was completely entranced. The play is set in the bedroom of Elizabeth Barrett, and it tells of the dynamics of living in a home with a domineering father. I felt deeply for Elizabeth's situation, and the fact that it's based on her actual life is amazing. It helped me see how such great work can come forth from such a tortured soul.The point where she meets Robert Browning warmed my heart and sent excitement through me as I read it. Rudolf Besier did a wonderful job in conveying the depth of love and commitment of Robert Browning. I missed Robert Browning when he wasn't in a scene, and I relished every scene that had him.Also, the scenes with Elizabeth's father were electrifying. The way the play described the father's relationship with his children was very well done. Besier definitely walked the line without being too obvious.Overall this was a magnificent play.

So, I am so thankful that I bought this book. I am excited to use these very simple activities and lessons with my daughters. It only takes a few manipulatives (I have a basic variety of several different manipulatives) to give a child authentic ways to explore and work with geometric shapes.

Highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"1001 Christmas Facts and Fancies","review":"Author Alfred Hottes wrote in the Author's Foreword to this 1937 book, \\"the chapters reveal inspiring facts and fancies gathered over a period of years... Use the index freely. It contains hundreds of entries one would scarcely believe to be associated with Christmas. The teacher will find the book helpful as a source of authoritative pageant suggestions. The homemaker will enjoy new ideas for home fun, decorations and foods... Children will enjoy the Christmas tales as retold from these pages.\\" (Pg. 7)He observes, \\"The roots of Christmas observance, however, go deeply into the folklore of the Druids, Scandinavians, Romans, and Egyptians. What we may read of Christmas in ancient days finds its full flower in the past and present customs of our ancestral homes in Europe. There is not an American home that does not color its Christmas with some European observances---gift-giving, trees, greenery, food, games, or ritual.\\" (Pg. 10)He notes, \\"It was a much changed St. Nicholas which the Dutch settlers brought to the United States... The lean ascetic is now a fat, jolly old fellow, more humanist than saint. Laying aside his canonical robes, his miter, and his pastoral staff, he has chosen an ermine-trimmed red cap and suit. He had traded his old gray mare for reindeer and sleigh.\\" (Pg. 37)He points out, \\"Red and green are the conventional colors of Christmas, no doubt because of the green Holly with its red berries, but there is no historical or legendary reason for these two colors. White is really the true Christmas color if we are to observe the dictates of the church.\\" (Pg. 84) Later, he adds, \\"In ancient Britain [mistletoe] was the sacred plant of the Druids... The church never sanctioned the use of Mistletoe in the decoration of a religious ediface because of its heathen origin.\\" (Pg. 149-151)Although 75 years old, much of the historical information presented in this book is \\"timeless,\\" and still of considerable interest to a modern reader."},{"Title":"Robotics Demystified","review":"The folks at McGraw Hill graciously sent me a copy of Edwin Wise's new book, Robotics Demystified, for me to review. Unfortunately, I got it right around the time that I left for Hong Kong (study abroad) and I'm just now getting around to actually reviewing it.The title calls it a \\"self-teaching guide\\" and the back cover reads; \\"Now anyone with an interest in robotics can gain a deeper understanding - without formal training, unlimited time, or genius IQ.\\" So, I cracked open the book to find out if this is true or not.Demystified is a relatively short 295 pages and contains 18 chapters. Example chapter names include, \\"Simple Machines\\", \\"Starting with Electronics\\", and \\"Intelligent Behavior.\\" It is clear from the beginning that Wise is targeting this book to the complete novice. He says in the Preface, \\"There is no one 'robot technology,' so this book breaks the study of robots down into technology categories: the mechanics and framework of the robot, the electronics that make up its brain and nerves, and the control systems and programming that gives the robot life.\\" Each chapter concludes with quiz questions to test your knowledge of each chapter.The book starts off at a pretty low level (mechanical forces) and slowly (very slowly) builds on the knowledge. The forces chapter, and the following, \\"Simple Machines\\" discuss basic mechanical systems. All the mechanical systems described in the book deal only with LEGO pieces, so the reader never actually sees any other type of building materials. The mechanical systems are also presented as individual units and aren't ever assembled into a comprehensive \\"overall\\" system (aka, an actual robot).After an introduction to mechanical systems (which is where Wise really shines) the book turns towards electronics and spends an entire chapter discussing the building blocks of electronics (electrons, electric fields, magnetic fields, etc.) in what seems a bit too low level for most robot hobbyist's needs. Another disappointment was the chapter on circuits, which was sadly lacking in basic tools for analyzing circuits and their behavior (it only contained a brief description of Ohm's law).Another chapter dealt entirely with sequencing and programming, including Cam Control and Card Control - who seriously uses this anymore? The discussion on binary systems was also brief. The chapter on control systems didn't even mention block diagrams and discussed closed-loop feedback systems without any good examples in robotics (a good one would be a motor driver).Another chapter was devoted to semiconductors, with discussion of BJT's and FET's, but this was sadly disconnected from real-world applications and circuits. Which, is the biggest problem I have with this book - there isn't any real world applications in robotics. The book lacked any discussion of sensors or microcontrollers, and only mentioned programming in a high-level way. There were no pictures of actual robots anywhere in the book.I would say this book is definitely not for true beginners. It will only leave them more frustrated and confused. It builds a very nice foundation, but stops there, leaving the beginner to find yet another resource to link all the pieces together. Robotics Demystified only succeeds in clouding the really difficult part - putting everything together into a working robot.If you're an \\"advanced beginner\\" this book might be for you, to enhance your knowledge, but if you're completely clueless, stay away."},{"Title":"Robotics Demystified","review":"A breezy little book that gives a general explanation of how to make your own robots. Very much a hobbyist's flavour, with a hands on approach emphasised. Wise tries to take a lot of the mystique out of the subject. He downplays any complexity in the design. This may ultimately limit what you can get out of the book. But if you have never had any prior exposure to robotics, it is still not a bad choice for a first text."},{"Title":"Robotics Demystified","review":"I am scheduled to teach a low-level lab on introductory robotics. I chose to use this book as the course textbook because it is what the instructor before me used, so I ordered a copy and read through most of it. I'm stuck using it for this semester but if I were to teach this course again I would look high and low for another book.My two complaints are, #1. In trying to cover absolutely everything it ends up being very thin on anything specific. For example, including chapters on feedback control, electromagnetics and semiconductor physics provides the appearance of heft and technicality to the book but actually provides very little insight and practical application for the average person buying this book off the shelf. The schematics provided in chapter 10 (on capacitance) for a twin-T notch filter and diode-capacitor circuits look technical and interesting but what do they contribute to someone just picking up this book and interested in building a basic robot?And my complaint #2. (which goes hand in hand with complaint #1), is that in trying to discuss complex topics with an \\"awe shucks, ain't this easy\\" folksy kind of approach, the author completely mystifies what is happening. For example, the discussion of discrete electron levels includes the insight that if one bangs on an electron with a hammer, this will cause the electron to jump to a higher energy shell. And that electrons can have an energy of \\"1\\" or \\"2\\" but not \\"1.25\\". I know what he's driving at but the exposition is confusing in a number of places. Or invoking Einstein's theory of relativity to explain a screw going into wood doesn't help either.On the other hand I did enjoy the chapters on Simple Machines, Joints and Power Transmission. I suppose the mechanical engineering aspects are easier to pull of than the electrical engineering ideas which can be a little more abstract.But complaints aside, a book with this level of coverage cannot be easy to pull off and it must be easy to find faults with it somewhere. In the final analysis, my perception is that if I knew nothing about robotics and picked this book up, I would find it difficult to see the steps involved in putting together a non-trivial robot based upon the information contained in this book."},{"Title":"Robotics Demystified","review":"Thoroughly disappointed by this book, hard to believe McGraw-Hill's name is on it. What little practical information it contains is organized and prioritized poorly. The author wastes precious pages decribing atomic theory (doping, lattice, valence electrons) and obsolete mechanical control systems (cams).

Robotics DeMystified explains different issues and troubleshooting in a way that is useful and easy to absorb and run with.

Cams can be found everywhere!Okay, now a serious answer. I took the title seriously; I wanted to demystify robotics -- so I tried to find basic, fundamental illustrations to show the concepts involved in robotics. Cam control? To illustrate sequential control, a form of programming. Punch cards? As the camel's nose into the tent of information representation, or some such thing.Was this the right approach or not? Only the individual reader can decide; as an author, I take a chance, I shoot my ideas out into the air, and sometimes I hit the target and sometimes I miss.The main problem Mr. Cox seems to have with the text is the lack of complex circuits, examples, robot programming, or any actual complete robots! For these needs there are lots of excellent existing books on the shelves... in fact, any one robotic technology requires a full book to do it justice.I didn't want to write yet another robot or electronics cookbook. Instead, I wrote this -- a book with a different goal and perspective than what I already saw on the market. A book that tries to demystify what it means to be a robot, and to provide a look at the technologies and ideas that go into the making of a robot, with a number of simple examples to illustrate them.

In my humble opinion the current Pope is a brilliant theologian that explains very complex matters of theology that both pleases the novice and the expert of religious thought. In this title he explains such matters as the Biblical Belief in God, The Spirit and The Church to mention a few. It is a not a quick read and lends itself to be read in small passages at a time and then the reader should put the book down for a time of reflection and contemplation. A book that should be read by all people of faith so that they can understand the mind of one of our most important theologians.

Each word leads to a process of analysis from varied viewpoints, historical, philosophical, and theological. You feel like you are in a class lecture by a brilliant and entertaining professor."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"Despite the title, this book is not for beginners. It is an exposition of Christianity based on the Apostles' Creed, a brief avowal required of the new entrant to the Catholic Church (and many Protestant sects) during baptism. Since the Creed begins with a three-part statement of belief, the author begins with a defense of belief itself, which he acknowledges to be difficult. Everyone is subject to doubt. A number of pages battle the contemporary skepticism concerning anything beyond a phenomenal world..The Creed itself begins with \\"I believe\\". This sets the stage for a discussion of faith, God, and the Trinity. Ratzinger considers the monotheistic God of both the Jews and the Greeks and finds the two similar, but Yahweh speaks personally, unlike the God of Plato and the stoics. He notes the peculiar use of the name \\"Yahweh\\", which is God's way of saying \\"I have no name\\" in reply to Moses' question about his name. The monotheistic God is Being itself. Therefore, unlike the various local gods of related peoples, Yahweh is potentially universal, even though he remains attached to one people. The God of Christianity is an advance on this since he is universal but at the same time retains the quality of personal directness. At the same time he is an appropriate subject for reason (logos). The discussion here is frequently complex and seems ill-organized.Ratzinger then considers the recitation of belief in the Trinity (normally preceding the Creed itself), briefly explaining its various theological depictions (Subordinationism, Monarchialism, and Modalism), and shows how none of them are satisfactory. If the Son is intermediate between Man and the Father, then the direct contact between man and God is lost; if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are different modes of one entity, then human contact, while not lost, is limited. He leaves this \\"negative theology\\" as it is, comparing it with the situation in atomic physics where a single phenomenon can be explained in more than one way.Then Ratzinger moves to the Creed itself, beginning with \\"I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord\\". The name \\"Jesus Christ\\" has two parts Jesus (the man who lived long ago) and Christ (the anointed one). Which are we to adore? The answer is that there is no separate man, self, or teaching; on earth, the person, Jesus, is swallowed up by the actions and statements of his mission. Who to adore, then, seems clear, but Ratzinger still maintains that both Christ and Jesus are equally the objects of devotion. He spends some pages on various related concepts, not clear to me, and then provides a briefdiscussion of Teilhard de Chardin, to whom he gives a qualified endorsement. This is followed by \\"Excursus: Christian Structures\\" which explains the general aspects of the Christ that he has expounded. To me this is the most illuminating part of the book.The following parts of the Creed, concerning Jesus' birth, life, and death, being historical, are therefore subject to skepticism. Ratzinger refuses to see them as mythical, but discusses the mythical connections anyway, notably the miraculous birth from a virgin which has many parallels in the Old Testament. The Crucifixion and descent into hell is not a sacrifice on man's part, but on God's, expressing his love for man. The death on the cross was necessary: \\" ... \\"God\\", or rather the image they had formed of his promise, had to die so that he could live on a larger scale.\\" The final part of the Creed is \\"on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.\\" Here the exegesis is too long and complex for any sort of brief summary. There is a final discussion of the closing section beginning with \\"I believe in the Holy Spirit\\", likewise confusing, since Ratzinger states that this Holy Spirit is not the same as the one of the Trinity.For a somewhat skeptical reader like myself, this book provided an introduction to a kind of reasoning that appears to be common to theologians, involving modes of existence and aspects of ideal entities. The author is battling not just with skeptics but also other theologians with a vulgarized or over-simplified view, like Harnack and Bultmann. The only part that really stirred my full sympathy was the middle, dealing with the compelling personality of Christ."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger (born 1927) is of course now Pope Benedict XVI; however, at the time this 1969 book was published, he was simply a Professor of Dogmatic Theology at the University of Tubingen. He said in the Preface, \\"The book arose out of lectures which I gave at Tubingen in the summer term of 1967 for students from all faculties. It is an attempt to repeat, in the changed circumstances of our generation, what Karl Adam accomplished almost half a century ago with hisThe Spirit Of Catholicism.\\"He wrote, \\"For the basic question in an Introduction to Christianity, which must try to elucidate what it means when a person says 'I believe,' poses itself to us in a quite definite temporal context... it can only be posed in the form, 'What is the meaning and significance of the Christian profession 'I believe' TODAY, in the context of our present existence and our present attitude to reality as a whole?'\\" (Pg. 22)He suggests that \\"Christian belief is not merely concerned ... with the eternal, which as the 'quite other' would remain completely outside the human world and time; on the contrary it is much more concerned with God IN history, with God as man... by making us meet God as a man, the eternal as the temporal, as one of us, it knows itself as revelation.\\" (Pg. 27)He asserts, \\"Jesus did not leave behind him ... a body of teaching that could be separated from his 'I,' as one can collect and evaluate the ideas of great thinkers without going into the personalities of the thinkers themselves. The Creed offers no teachings of Jesus; evidently no one even conceived the---to us---obvious idea of attempting anything like this, because the operative understanding pointed in a completely different direction.\\" (Pg. 149-150)\\"We can now say that love always found some kind of immortality; even in its pre-human stage it points, in the form of preservation of the species, in this direction. Indeed, this founding of immortality is not something incidental to love, not one thing that it does among others, but what really gives it its specific character.\\" (Pg. 233)This early work has remained continuously in print for obvious reasons; it is indeed a clear statement of Catholic Christianity for the modern age."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"I have just begun reading the book. What I like so far is the way the author states the common objections to Christianity and then provides intriquing - new answers to those objectioins."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"With former Cardical Ratzinger becoming pope, internet and the streets are full with rumors and doubts about his past, and about his views. They say he's a Nazi, a conservative person, and well, anti-Catholics use that to take credibility from the church. Let's remember that Christians (or Protestants, however you prefer), began with Matin Luther. And Luther was more anti-Semitic than many Nazis. Also, many people belonged to Hitler's youth. It was a guarantee to keep your family safe. Like the people that belonged to the Communist party during Communist dictatorships. It is a way to live safe in a country where a megalomaniac tyrant control the lives of an entire country.So with the \\"Nazi question\\" behind, all the criticisms against this new pope are his \\"conservative\\" views. Now, I don't see many of his points as mistakes or as \\"stupid\\" opinions as some people consider. In \\"Introduction to Christianity\\", Benedict XVI shows his points in lectures he gave in the 60s to explain why the church is the best option, and how to call more people to join the church. So the book is old, but make don't mistake. It feels strong even today. Benedict XVI is an extremely intelligent man that dominates complex aspects of philosophy and theology. Benedict XVI is an extremely good debater, and you could see this in this book. Not because there are debates, but because of the way arguments are presented.I would suggest you to read this book. Whether you are a Catholic that wants to learn more about the new pope (and have arguments to defend him), or a Christian (or Protestant. Again, however you prefer) that wants to just read someone else's point of view, or even a Muslim or may just an atheist. Nobody can deny Benedict's XVI's intelligence and I think that this book will show you why he has such an impeccable reputation among Cardinals, Rabbis (yes, Rabbis) and even philosophy teachers in European universities."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"I have not read this book and will not because the reviews published here just reinforce my conclusions about Catholic dogma and its deviations from scriptures. So perhaps this review will not be permitted. I will leave the raves to others. However, I can point to several doctrinal errors that present barriers I cannot overcome. Reviewers state this book explains the Apostle's Creed line by line...so let's start there. It claims that after his crucifixion Jesus \\"descended into hell\\"...when the Bible says that he promised the repentent neighbor they would both be \\"in paradise.\\"...Jesus instructed to call no man on earth \\"Father\\" because we have one father in heaven...and there is no Biblical support for the doctrine of Purgatory...as for Peter being the first Pope, Jesus declared those who denied him in public would be denied before the Father, and Peter denied Christ three times...so my complaint about the Roman Catholic Church is that it deviates from the Bible and makes up its own theology as the Pope may declare from self-ascribed authority...as it reversed itself in declaring that infants who die before they are baptised go directly to heaven but still also claims that everyone is born in sin...which is opposed by several scriptures and even the account in Genesis...Cain was not punished for killing Abel and the text says nothing about the disobedience in the garden passing sin to all their descendents...go ahead, look it up... I have no doubt that Cardinal Ratzinger was and is a traditional Catholic Pope in public but his private thoughts may never be known. A hint may come from another classic book of his titled, Eschatology done in 1988...there he says that no one can tell what comes after death since the future is unknowable, and even God cannot know the unknowable. We cannot know for sure but perhaps as the Pope matured in understanding he ran into issues with Catholic dogma that posed insurmountable obstacles and politically incorrect tensions with the top cardinals. Therefore, I conclude those who rave about this book are blinded by the brilliance of his excellent mind and the blazing vestments of the office of Pope...for those who need magic, mystery, and authority the Church of Rome obliges, but for one with a critcal mind and a study of the Bible itself this introduction appears to leave too much distortion and uncertainty to be taken as gospel. The fact is that the Bible is full of indefinite uncertainties and the office of Pope does nothing to fill in the blanks, unless one cannot live with ambiguity and tolerance for superstition. Unless the mind of a child is captured before the age of reason, all religion seems to present more burdens than benefits for thinking rational people - of which Pope Benedict seems to be a prime example. I will leave the office of a parish priest for another review because this book apparently does little to support the claim for absolute obedience, celebacy, and poverty that obviously is too much to claim of many mere mortals who wear the vestments. What is more likely has come to be called Theofatalism, which presents God as generator, operator, destroyer...G.O.D...it does whatever it wants with whoever it wants whenever it wants and we must take what it gives and give what it takes...as concluded by Mother Teresa. This is heresy but all reformations begin that way and we sure need a new reformation.Theofatalism(TM): Personal Reformation for Troubled Souls"},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"the book is in really good shape for a used book. no highlighting, but there is some underlining in pencil which was easily erased."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"10 years ago when I was considering whether to convert to my wife's faith, a Baptist minister friend singled out this book as one of his own, all-time favorites - the one that best lived up to its title, as an \\"Introduction to Christianity.\\"First drafted in the summer of 1967, this book is based on a series of lectures father Joseph Ratzinger gave to students at Germany's university at Tubingen. As if it were written just this morning, it centers on the timeless communications dilemma faced by any Christian, trying to speak about God to young people in today's world.Writing the \\"Introduction to Christianity\\" 16 years after his ordination, the un-heralded priest from the land of Luther (who would one day have his arm twisted to remain in Rome for 24 years, by his predecessor as Pope) cited a famous story by Kierkegaard, about \\"the clown and the burning village\\" - to best sum up the difficulty faced by any Christian attempting to communicate theology to young people.\\"According to the story,\\" he wrote, \\"a travelling circus in Denmark had caught fire. The manager sent the clown, who was already dressed and made-up for the performance, into the neighboring village to fetch help, especially as there was a danger that the fire would spread across the fields of dry stubble and engulf the village itself. So, the clown hurried into the village and requested the inhabitants \`come as quickly as possible' and help put the fire out.\\"But the villagers took the clown's shouts simply for an excellent piece of advertising, meant to attract as many people as possible to the performance; they applauded the clown and laughed till they cried. The clown felt more like weeping than laughing; he tried in vain to get people to be serious, to make clear to them he was speaking in bitter earnest, that there really WAS a fire! His supplications only increased the laughter; people thought he was playing his part splendidly -- until finally the fire DID engulf the village, and both circus and village were burned to the ground.\\"And that, said Father Ratzinger, almost 40 years ago, is the \\"theologian's position today . . . the appearance of a clown trying in vain to make people listen to his message!\\"In his medieval, or at any rate old-fashioned clown's costume he is simply not taken seriously. Whatever he says, he is ticketed and classified, so to speak by his role. Whatever he does in his attempts to demonstrate his (seriousness) people always know in advance that he is in fact just --- a clown. They are already familiar with what he is talking about, and know he is just giving a performance which has little or nothing to do with reality.\\"So, they can listen to him quite happily without having to worry too seriously about what he is saying.\\"The German priest of 40 years ago, (who would no doubt express the same views on this day of his election as \\"Peter's successor\\") - will now face the same dilemma on a global scale -- when he reaches out to non-Catholics. The villagers in his story, by analogy, he says, are those OUTSIDE the church.And to communicate with those who comprise the five sixths of humanity who are NOT a part of his 2,000 year old Church, the young German priest states in this book it would not be enough to \\"take off our make-up and don the mufti of a secular vocabulary or a demythologized Christianity in order to make everything right\\" (in communicating 2,000 year old theology). That, he said, would be \\"rather naive.\\"\\"Anyone today,\\" he said then, \\"who makes an honest effort to give an account of the Christian faith to himself and to others must learn to see that he is not just someone in fancy dress who needs only to change his clothes in order to be able to impart his teaching successfully.\\"The man who would this day be named Pope Benedict Sixteen cites \\"that lovable saint Therese of Lisieux, who looked so naive (as a nun who would die of tuberculosis, age 24) . . . this very saint . . . apparently cocooned in complete security, left behind her in the final weeks of her passion, shattering admissions which her horrified sisters toned down in her literary remains. (She wrote of her dark night of the soul) \`I am assailed by the worst temptations of atheism. Everything has become questionable, everything is dark.' . . . what is at stake (for believers) is the whole (theological) structure; it is a question of all or nothing.\\"As reason for optimism about the ultimate triumph of Truth, the future pope then cited \\"a Jewish story, recounted by Martin Buber which presents in concrete form the above-mentioned dilemma (of being human):\\"An adherent of the Enlightenment, a very learned man, who had heard of the Rabbi of Berditchev, paid a visit in order to argue, as was his custom, and to shatter his old-fashioned proofs of the truth of his faith . . . but Rabbi Levi Jizchak (said) \`My son, the great scholars of the Torah with whom you have argued, wasted their words on you; as you departed you laughed at them. They were unable to lay God and his Kingdom on the table before you, and nor can I. But think my son - Perhaps it's true.' The exponent of the Enlightenment opposed him with all his strength; but this terrible \`Perhaps' which echoed back at him time after time, broke his resistance.\\"And that, said the German priest of almost 40 years ago, \\"in however strange a guise (is) a very precise description of the situation of man confronted with the question of God. No one can lay God and his kingdom \`on the table' for another; even the believer cannot do it for himself. But however strongly unbelief may feel itself thereby justified, it cannot forget the eerie feeling induced by the words, \`Yet perhaps it is true.' \\"(My copy of this terrific treatise is the out-of-print \\"Herder & Herder\\" edition of 1968, \`translated by J.R.

I read \\"Salt of the Earth\\" first and that should really be your starting point as it is very readable, the tone is conversational. BTW, this is the first edition, pick up the 2nd edition at the Ignatius website, the new preface is worth it.This is a book for thinkers. It is not for people who have a simple faith (no less authentic, of course) but rather for people who spend a lot of time in their own minds analyzing and questioning. Former Prefect Ratzinger approaches Christianity unapologetically, as you would expect. He is very well read in psychology, world religions, philosophy, history, and probably everything else. He makes his points eloquently as one who is convicted about Truth.I am still a little shocked. I expected the man to be a hard line conservative and hold to a very rigid and traditional point of view. He actually doesn't, instead he upholds the role of tradition in the face of modernism. He does not want to go back in time, but wants to move the Church forward using the time-tested truths of Christ in the Gospels. He brings to light the timeless voice of God for this and every generation.I loved JPII, but I fear this man will be greater. Even though many are already aluding to his soon-to-be short pontificate, he was already well-known and instrumental many years before. He only needs to be here long enough for people to understand what he has already said, and to put a capstone on JP's theology which he heavily influenced. JPII denied his resignation three times, I think he knew the role that this man needed to play in the Church. It was providence and grace at work."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"Perhaps given the situation with Cardinal Ratzinger becoming the newly-elected Pope Benedict XVI, no better book could be read as an insight into the general directions of the man than this - a text intended for use as a introductory textbook on Christian theology.Ratzinger takes the approach for a framework generally from the construction of the ancient Apostles Creed - his first section begins with the 'I believe...' and continues to look at the implications of what faith and belief are in terms of philosophy and biblical witness. Ratzinger is educated in the dominant traditions of philosophy from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when Germany was the centre of such scholarship. Echoes of or reactions to thinkers such as Heidegger, Nietzsche, Husserl and others will be found here, as well as later thinkers in the post-modern area of critical analysis.However, Ratzinger returns to the creedal foundation of doctrine, and the biblical underpinnings of the creeds as being more important than these philosophical developments (but never abandons the conversation with them). He proposes tentative defintions of faith and belief (one might hear the echo of Paul Tillich here, at least in general form if not in content), and looks at the foundations of dogma in the creeds.His sections are on Doctrine of God, Christology, and Ecclesiology and Pneumatology; it is significant that he does not use these theological terms, but rather the more accessible God, Jesus Christ, The Church and the Spirit. The faith is meant to be accessible and comprehensible.Ratzinger then goes line by line through the creeds as his headings, and proceeds to theologically analyse each assertion made. These are done in what might be termed a conservative fashion, and certainly some of Ratzinger's conclusions are on the conservative side, but once again there is an idea that conversation continues, and that there is room for interpretation in the creeds in substance and in application.Ratzinger uses a story derivative of Kierkegaard and 'The Secular City' by Harvey Cox to warn against the idea of placing too restrictive a classification on someone, theologians included, that might make it difficult to continue to be open to what is happening in the development of the relationship. Ratzinger speaks of the natural occurence of uncertainty, and how this kind of doubt and searching is in fact an aid to the theological enterprise.Ratzinger's erudition is evident here, with stories from the history of philosophy and literature, current events and recent artistic creations, stories from Jewish and Christian sources as well as inspirations from outside these religious traditions. This book can give a good insight into the general framework in which Ratzinger, as the new pope, tends to think and write about Christianity. It is probably essential reading for any who want a greater insight in the mind of the man now Pope Benedict XVI."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"This is a some what forgotten classic . It is almost forty years old and yet it is as relevant today as it was when it was first published.The Pope John Paull II is a tough act to follow. We first met him as a strong middle aged man who reached out to the young and built bridges between Catholicism and other faiths. There may be therefore some trepidation now that the Catholic church suddenly has a 78 year old German Pope. To make matters worse the Catholic haters have filled the Internet with rumors and half truths of Ratzinger's membership in the Hitler Youth.Anyone who reads this book will find it a comfort as we see in Ratzinger a man very much like the late John Paul II who like the recently deceased Pope is a scholar, mystic and humanitarian. And like John Paul II he is a principled man with backbone. And by that I mean not an unbending man but a man of conviction.This book works on many levels as it is both scholarly and approachable.Ratzinger uses the Apostle's creed as a jumping off point. He dusts it off and has us look at it in various ways. This approach is help not only to the Catholic but to all Christians and to any non-Christian who wants to gain insight into Christianity. It is an approach where he refers to and elucidates on both the mystical and the practical nature of man.Rather than being the stodgy figure some of the media has been painting him to be Ratzinger has his moments of cleverness and humor in this book which makes it all the more appealing.Yet as I said it has its scholarly side for Ratzinger not only refers to Catholic theologian but numerous philosophers from various periods and cultures to draw his points home. Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, shows in this book that he has the tools and the desire to continue the work of John Paul II to build bridges while keeping the doctrine of the Catholic Church intact.I strongly recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"I bought this because I thought it was about time I read something \`orthodox'. I'd been reading quite a bit that challenged the traditional teaching of the Church. I'd also never read anything by Cardinal Ratzinger/Pope Benedict XVI.Having read the book, I don't know if I'm any more comfortable with traditional teaching about the nativity, resurrection, descent into hell, ascension etc, but I am most impressed by Benedict XVI's presentation of the philosophy and spirituality that underpins the Apostle's Creed. The book is, after all, not so much a general \`introduction' to Christianity, but an unpacking of the earliest of the creeds we still use.I was aware that Benedict is a highly regarded man, even by those who have come to the disciplinary interest of his former office, and that he is recognized as a fine teacher, but I didn't have any idea when I began the book of the impact his thinking would have on me. His is truly a mind that soars above and beyond the mental categories and sequences I usually encounter.Benedict has invited us to think beyond the standard categories, to escape the \`dictatorship of the milieu' (p.250: 2000 edition) and to open ourselves to truths that lie beyond conventional interpretation.I was interested in his frequent reference to Teilhard de Chardin and application of his ideas in developing his own theses. Although he criticizes Teilhard for excessive biologism, he clearly approves of and uses his general thesis regarding the unfolding purpose of the cosmos. He has been severely criticized for this by the \`ultra-orthodox', who regard Teilhard as an apostate and a pantheist. So much for the view of Ratzinger as closed to non-conventional thought. I suppose that, Teilhard's thinking being speculative and not necessarily in conflict with Magisterial teaching, there's no reason why the younger Ratzinger should not incorporate it. I wonder if his views are still the same?I'm not sure how much it would help to have a good background in philosophy or Christian theology before picking up this book. I thought I had a reasonable layman's background, but found that the ideas are so fresh and so logically presented I was carried along without feeling much need to refer to what I already knew. I would think a reader with an interest but not a lot of background would still find the explication clear and the ideas illuminating."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"Having studied much of the former Cardinal's works, I thought those who are beginning to approach his thought should know a couple of things.First, even those who have not studied theology will get something out of this elementary work. It will take some work, but that is possibleSecond, it really helps to have studied ancient, mideval and most importantly modern philosophy. Descartes, Hegel, Kant and others are thrown around but not really explained in any substantive way. Ratzinger assumes the reader has some basic education in this area.Third, the text here is progressive, that is it builds ideas on top of other ideas. Reading the middle will not gain the reader a full understanding of what he is saying.Fourth, Ratzinger is dialoging with a modern and post modern mind set. This is why he begins with the nature of belief today, and then goes into what sense the faith can have. It is in short apologetic and world building. Introduction to Chr. is an attempt to create what the tradition preserves, the very context of faith as an opennes to the fullness of reality. Only therein can the facts make sense.Lastly, it is the work of a first rate mind. It takes intellectual work and wrestling with the meaning therein to really get to the meat of what he is saying. Beware the faint hearted. He is not really a conservative the way conservaives think he is and not liberal the way liberals think he is. In short he is actually a Catholic theologian.It is one of his few consolidated works. Most of his 23 odd books in english are collections of essays. If you want something a bit less theological, try his books that are dialogues and interviews. Therein he synthesizes his theology in a way that is more easily assimilated. I highly recommend it in any case.Good luck."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"This book takes the creed as it's launching point. Taking each segment apart phrase by phrase, and analyzing what it means in Christian belief. The insights that Pope Benedict XVI (then Cardinal Ratzinger) arrived at are dense and profound. When you have a 360 page book that spends 90 pages in laying an introductory foundation, you know that there is immesurable wealth of wisdom to come. I was not to be disappointed; I drew much insight and spiritual nourishment from it, but I'm sure that if I pick it up again in a few years after taking theology classes I'll be able to draw entirely new insights from it. The writing style is engaging and challenging, it is richly laced with scriptural references as well as pointing to many philosophers, some in agreement, and some which he uses to refute popular misconceptions. Through this work, Pope Benedict paints a beautiful picture of just who God is as He has revealed Himself to us. With this he then also elucidates who man is in relation to God and to each other. \\"The distinguishing mark of man, seen from above, is his being addressed by God, the fact that he is God's partner in a dialogue, the being called by God.\\" I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"This is the first Ratzinger book I have read. I wanted to see what this perportedly 'great thoelogian' was about.I think I expected some dogmatic sales pitch for Catholicism.

This book is challenging and engaging. In it, Ratzinger demonstrates amazing empathy with all of humanity. It's heavy, but for all it's theology it is attainable for us normal mortals!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"The pious, erudition of Joseph Ratzinger gives us this gem of a book which addresses the problem of Christian faith in the world today. Do not be dissuaded by the title of this text, thinking that it is a light, non-reflective, topical reader on generalities of Christianity. Instead, the future Pope addresses the core of Christianity by deeply reflecting upon the dialogue of faith in the Apostles' Creed.Perhaps the greatest strength of this text is that it utilizes more than historical reflection to elucidate the text of the Apostles' Creed. He defines the Creed is a dialogue of the new believer and the community (and God). Ratzinger speaks directly with modern man, addressing those issues most poignantly reflected upon in modernity making this dialogue possible anew. However, he does not abandon the traditions of the Church in addressing these modern concerns. Instead, he shows the necessity of such understandings and how they point toward the truth without being abrogated by modern reflection.The entire key to this work is the theme of dialogue of being. Because it is intrinsically tied to the community, the Creed necessitates the unity of the Church on Earth, among men through their unity with God. This is possible because God is relational in his very being and is related to his creation. Ratzinger reflects upon the articles of the Creed by always remembering the dialogical character of man and God. This dialogue is ultimately love, the love which unites man to God and hence man to man.Ratzinger argues his point by always addressing the issues raised by modernity in response to the possibility of faith. One has a remembrance of St. Thomas Aquinas' style of engaging opposition in the Summa Theologica. This desire to show the Faith fully to the modern mind makes this text a great read for all who wish to understand Christianity. I recommend it to all, believers and non-believers in mind. If you come to it with an open mind, you will not be able to leave it without having a refreshed outlook on what the Christian faith is."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"I was once told that for those students in the field of academic theology in the late 60s and into 70s, that this book was seen as THE comprehensive summary of introductory Christian theology.

What is also beneficial about this collection of essays is that it provides a significant synopsis of the thought of Joseph Ratzinger.

The intended readers seem to be late twentieth century European intellectuals. But in matters of religion, while experience can persuade, words alone seldom do.\\"And He called a child to Himself and set him before them, and said, 'Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.'\\" (Matthew 18:2-3)My comment on Amazoner's comment: I did not say or think that the Ratzinger has no spiritual content behind his words, nor that he was on a head trip. In fact, I tend to see Ratzinger on one side and late-twentieth century intellectuals on the other. I see him as addressing them as well as he can, with the obstacles and faults not being so much his as theirs. I said that words ALONE seldom persuade in matters of religion."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"Simply put, \\"Introduction to Christianity\\" is one of the most profound books of the 20th Century. The writings of Joseph Ratzinger and Pope Benedict are for the ages."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"First, my vantage point in a concise ad hoc auto-analysis: No formal training in theology. Pleasure reader. Good general education and state of knowledge by ordinary standards. A disposition to religiosity. Sixty-three.In my opinion prospective readers of this book would do well to realize that texts on such fundamentals as those it discusses are of necessity more subtle, and more prone to be understood by the reader in a way the writer may not have meant, than texts about, say, historical \\"facts\\", empirical sciences, or technicalities. I believe it is a matter of taste whether one likes such reading. Frequently one has to proceed slowly and cautiously, often taking a pause to ask oneself what the writer is trying to say. Not that there is anything that detracts from his ability to express himself. But we are moving about on slippery ground, at the very fringe of human understanding. The writer is - with absolute sincerity - trying to give us a glimpse of the truth beyond the visible and tangible, the actual reality outside our Plato's cave.His convictions are catching, and inevitably his book confers with it some of the beauty and serenity of pure Christianity, giving a reader tuned for receiving such vibes a notion of some inexplicable light shining from somewhere. The book is no \\"introduction\\" in the sense of being a statement of dogmas or an enumeration of the elements of the faith, as its title may be perceived as indicating. It is indeed an explanation of the elements of the faith, but in such fundamentals that one has long failed to realize that they are there. In that unexpected way, its title is true and descriptive. It makes challenging reading, which may, if one is interested in theological subtleties and explanations of the very grounds on which the dogmas stand, be much enjoyed in the manner of those who like to have a look at Hawking's Brief History of Time before going to sleep. It is not a book to read in a hurry, but it can be delicious in morsels of suitable size.The book is to a large extent a history of ideas, and yet another reminder that we really do not know of our own accord how, or even what, the world is - for us it is, and remains, what we think it is. Thus the book illustrates the necessity for firm ground from which we can reach out in order to understand (or rather try to). It is interesting and encouraging to access this scholar's reasoning and his explanations of what really took place in Palestine 2000 years ago, and how the most capable minds have interpreted it through the centuries.I am not a native speaker of English, but all the same I can readily see that special thanks are due the translator. It is no small job to translate a book of this kind. Such work demands a number of abilities that few persons can muster. Although I should be capable of detecting Germanisms, I haven't found a trace. The book reads to me as having been written in English from the start. As it happens, I know that exactly this is the hallmark of a good translation.So far, this critique of mine is in every respect positive. Why then only four stars? Well, I have not searched for or stumbled upon any rules for granting stars. Being conservative (strictly in the sense of \\"prudent\\"), it seems to me extravagant, as a matter of principle, to grant the maximum number of stars for any endeavour. One could be surprised by something still better some day. I may also mention that the sentences are sometimes longer than I suspect is necessary. Whether this is due to the author or the translator I can\`t say, but I happen to know that when translating, one must sometimes chase subtleties of meaning out along branches or into corners. This is because a term in one language seldom corresponds exactly to a term in another, and the translator can not depart from the meaning which he perceives as the author\`s. This demands words.The author is now Pope, with all the authority this entails. The question whether the book would have become as widely known if he were not Pope Benedict is one I cannot answer. While such a question may have a bearing on the book's publicity, it has no bearing on its value. All I can say is that heavy stuff as it is, I have found it enjoyable, and in reading it, a repetition of the self-discipline one all too seldom managed to summon in school really pays off. If you have interests in common with the writer - and if you feel capable, with regard to respect for your origins and affiliations, your historical, cultural, religious, national and regional identifications, and your relatives and friends, to study the writer's faith seriously, this book is capable of providing intellectual enjoyment and edification in large measure. It is a ruttier for navigation in very deep waters."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"Too often theological books jump right to the middle of intricate theological beliefs, e.g., importance of the Eucharist. This is not the case with Cardinal Ratzinger. He starts at the beginning. What is belief? Why believe? Is non-belief so different. The believer is troubled with non-belief. But so too is the non-believer troubled with belief. This is very refreshing and I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"Don't let the word \\"introduction\\" fool you. This is not a brief survey intended for beginners. Like all of Ratzinger's books it requires considerable time and effort to understand and appreciate; but the effort is well worthwhile. This book once again reveals the Pope's incredible erudition, his formidable intellect, and his absolute faith in the fundamental truths of Christianity as preached and practiced in the Catholic Church. Any Christian will come away from this book with a much greater appreciation for and a much deeper understanding of his faith."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"I was reading through Pope Benedict's first book on Jesus,Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfiguration, and I began to feel a little bit wobbly --- out of my depth, so to speak.So I \\"retreated\\" to this book, and found it even more compelling. For one thing, Benedict's first item for discussion is DOUBT, something which applies in roughly equal measures to believers and non-believers, although you will never find Richard Dawkins admitting to such a thing. \\"Yet, perhaps it is true...\\" is the thought echoing in the minds of some atheists.This is followed by a penetrating argument which actually startled me, because I had just written something similar in an Amazon review a few days before. What I said was that scientists who refused to discuss Intelligent Design because \\"it was not science\\" may have walled themselves off from the truth. What Benedict wrote was much more sweeping: because positivist science deals only with the visible and the material, it CANNOT discover the truth, because the most important things in human life are invisible.Now, think about that for a few moments: \\"the most important things in life are invisible.\\"That would, of course, include your soul, and God as well. If God is the root of all the meaning in life, well, science cannot possibly discover this, because they have ruled him out of the game by manipulating the rules!There are other \\"invisible\\" things which rule our lives; the most important is love. There are many ways to make love manifest on the physical level (flowers, kisses, etc.) but love itself cannot be touched or seen.Of course, I can think of a lot more things which make philosophical materialists ill at ease: information, ideas, music, poetry...the list is really quite long, and philosophical materialists who try to reduce these things to the billiard-ball view of the universe really go through quite remarkable contortions trying to do this. On the other hand, if we admit the existence of non-material things, the problems disappear.\\"What is belief really? We can now reply like this: It is a human way of taking up a stand in the totality of reality, a way that cannot be reduced to knowledge and is incommensurable with knowledge; it is the bestowal of meaning without which the totality of man would remain homeless, on which man's calculations and actions are based, and without which in the last resort he could not calculate and act, because he can only do this in the context of a meaning that bears him up. For in fact man does not live on the bread of practicability alone; he lives as man and, precisely in the intrinsically human part of his being, on the word, on love, on meaning.\\"In any case, if you are curious about Christianity, this is a superb book. And it puts some of the efforts of C.S. Lewis in the shade.Very high recommendation!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"Let not the unassuming title mislead you. This is not a simple introduction to Christianity but a bold philosophical treatise to the heart of Christianity. In this commentary on the Apostle's creed, Father Ratzinger first dissects what it means to assert, \\"We believe...\\" and continues to the conclusion on what (or rather who) is the essence of Christianity. Christianity is not a religion or a creed but a person. It is a challenge to the philosophies of men and their attempts to understand God outside the context of the Son.Father Ratzinger draws on unlikely philosophers and theologians such as Nietzsche and Luther to make his point. He finds and reveals truth in the Lutheran martyr Bonhoeffer and his passion. But Father Ratzinger takes us beyond simply finding deep philosophical truths and guides us to a passion and adoration of the personification of truth in Jesus. Father Ratzinger seems to echo Francis Bacon who said, \\"A little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion.\\" Only, the religion of Father Ratzinger is not a thing but a person. The book ends with the hope that is contained in that person, \\"A salvation of the world does exist - that is the confidence that supports the Christian and that still makes it rewarding even today to be a Christian.\\"There is enough philosophical insight here to challenge the most theoretical thinkers. But Father Ratzinger does not stop at mere theory but goes on to the concrete implications to the Christian found in that theory. There is perhaps no more thorough \\"introduction\\" than this to a vibrant faith. Well worth the investment of reading and re-reading to plumb the depths of philosophical truths contained in that faith. Very highly recommended for every Christian."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"Our Holy Father is great! He is so clear in his writing and conveying his ideas. He articulates and conveys theological ideas in ways that students can grasp, digest, and make their own. I know this was written long before he would even be considered for Pope- but it only goes to show that he has been doing the kind of work and prayer this work needs to be able to do for a long time. He is the kind of student who has done the work so well and sought such understanding as to teach well."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"For a layman, this is a difficult but fascinating \\"introduction\\" to serious reflection on the Catholic faith."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"It is still a book for neofite and for the theologian, both for Christians and for non-Christians.

And a good edition too."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"Most of us are familiar with that masterpiece 'Mere Christianity' by the esteemed writer C.S.Lewis. Ratzinger's book tackles some of the same subjects but has much more meat in it. I say that with no disrespect to Lewis for this book speaks to a different audience or to a person who is at a different part of the Christian journey. If you want an Introduction to Christianity that you are willing to spend some time digesting, this is probably it. Otherwise, if you want to capture the flavor of what Ratzinger has to say, read the book : 'God and the World',which is an interview that he gave, that covers the breadth of Christianity in simple language."},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"Written 40 years ago by Ratzinger, this book still resonates with the times. In itself, this shows that Ratzinger is focused on what really matters in the Christian mystery - he nevers gets side tracked into going down blind and fruitless alleys. It is only on my second reading of this book that I began to see how important a book this is. This book is an important exploration of the nature of belief and of the articles of belief set down in the Apostles creed. I believe that in this book Ratzinger surpasses his mentors, namely De Lubac and von Balthasar. His analysis of the kenosis of Christ is particularly impressive, Christ \\"being from\\" and \\"being for\\".Ratzinger first deals squarely with belief and points out that it is within the context of doubt that the theist and the atheist can enter into dialogue. After all, the Christian believes; he does not see. Likewise, the atheists \\"sees\\" what is optical and does not believe in what cannot be empirically verified. But, both the Christian and the atheist, if he is honest, must have doubts about the nature of his belief or non-belief. There must be times when the atheist says: \\"yet perhaps it is true (page 46).For Ratzinger the word credo means:\\"man does not regard seeing, hearing and touching as the totality of what concerns him, that he does not view the area of his world as marked off by what he can see and touch but seeks a second mode of access to reality, a mode he calls in fact belief, and in such a way that he finds in it the decisive enlargement of his whole view of the world\\" (page 50).For Ratzinger the radicality of Christianity is that \\"God has come so near to us that we can kill him and that he thereby, so it seems, ceases to be God for us\\".Ratzinger poses the question of whether \\"it would not have been much simpler to believe in the Mysterious Eternal... to leave us as at an infinite distance\\". (page 55)Ratzinger notes that belief does not come \\"though the private search for truth but through a process of reception.. Faith cannot and should not be a mere product of reflection\\" (page 92). Faith demands unity and calls for the fellow believer; it is by nature related to a Church.\\" (page 98).On the nature of the Trinity, he noted that: \\"He is one, but at as the exceedingly great, entirely Other, he himself transcends the bounds of singular and plural; he lies beyond the\\" (page 125).On the \\"I am who I am\\" scene in exodus, he notes that the words sound like a \\"rebuff\\",\\"like a refusal to give a name than the pronouncement of a name (page 127) \\"I am\\" is as much as to say \\"I am here for you\\" \\" a Being-for\\". (page 129).\\"The name is no longer merely a word, but a person: Jesus himself.\\" (page 133) Ratzinger goes on to say that the meaning of a \\"name\\" is its invocability. God, by having a name, becomes accessible to me. \\"He is handing himself over to men in such a way that he can be called upon\\".\\"And by doing this he enters into coexistence with them; he puts himself within reach; he is \\"there\\" for them\\". The name is no longer just a word at which we clutch; it is now flesh of our flesh, bone of our bone. God is one of us\\" (page 134/135).Ratzinger notes the great saying by Tertullian: \\"Christ called himself truth, not custom\\". (page 141)His thought then becomes even more metaphysical:\\"Whoever looks thoroughly at matter will discover that it is being-thought objectivised thought. So it cannot be ultimate. All being is ultimately being-thought and can be traced back to\\"Christian belief in God means that things are the being-thought of a creative consciousness of a creative freedom and that the creative conciousness that hears up all things has released what has been thought into the freedom of its own, independent existence\\". (page 137).\\"The doctrine of the triune God, means at bottom renouncing any solution and remaining content with a mystery that cannot be plumbed by man (page 168)\\". \\"Faith consists of a series of contradictions held together by grace\\". (page 171).\\"It now became clear that the dialogue, the relatio stands behind substance as an equally primordial form of being\\". I note here that Ratzinger preempts some of the philosophical work done by the great Jesuit Thomist, Norris Clarke and by the personalist, John F Crosby. \\"Father is purely a concept of relationship. Only in being for the other is he Father; in his own being in himself he is simply God\\". (page 183). \\"By calling the Lord \\"Son\\", John gives him a name that always points away from him and beyond him; he thus employs a term that denotes essentially a relatedness, He thereby puts his whole Christology into the context of the idea of relation\\" (page 185).Moving on to focus of the office and nature of Christ, he notes that Christ \\"performs himself and gives himself; his work is the giving of himself\\" (page 204). \\"The person of Jesus is his teaching and his teaching is he himself\\" \\"message and person are identical\\" (page 206). \\"Jesus is his work\\" \\"His being is pure actualitas of \\"from\\" and \\"for\\"(page 228).\\"For John, the picture of the pierced side forms the climax not only of the crucifixion scene but the whole story of Jesus... his existence is completely open. Now he is entirely \\"for\\"; now he is no longer a single individual but \\"Adam\\" from whose side, Eve, a new mankind is formed\\". (page 241) \\"The future of man hangs on the Criss - the redemption of Man is the Cross. And, he can only come to himself by letting the walls of his existence be broken down, by looking on him who has been pierced\\" (p242)\\"Talk of original sin means no man can start from scratch any more (completely unimpaired by history\\" (page 249). \\"Last judgement, on the other hand is the answer to these collective entanglements\\" (page 249).\\"Being a Christian means essentially changing over from being for oneself to being for one another\\". \\"Christ is the infinite self expenditure of God\\" (page 261).\\"Love demands infinity, indestructibility; indeed it is, so to love demands, infinity, indestructibility; indeed, it is, so to speak, a call for infinity\\" (page 302).Ratzinger's analysis of the resurrection and the Last judgement is deeply impressive, noting its deeply serious nature. Of hell, he notes that it \\"consists in man's being unwilling to receive anything, in his desire to be self sufficient. It is the expression of enclosure in one's own being alone.\\"Finally, on the Church, Ratzinger approaches the evil evident in the Church in a sober fashion. \\"At bottom there is always a hidden pride at work when criticism of the Church adopts that tone of rancorous bitterness which today is already becoming a fashionable habit\\"He notes that Christ in his earthly ministry scandalised others; is is surprising that he does so again when he gives himself over to be broken sacramentally on his altars, ministered, at times, by deeply sinful ministers and consumed also by those whose lifes often contradict the gospel. Don't we all in our own way contradict the gospel in our daily lives?"},{"Title":"Introduction to Christianity","review":"Although I found myself searching the web for various references and opening the dictionary often -- my classical Catholic training is sorely lacking -- I found the book a fast read.

It is a study of the biblical, philosophical and rational beliefs which make up the Christian faith.This book begins with a study of faith in the world today, followed by the form of faith offered by the Church. He presents the tenets of the Apostles Creed, line by line. In so doing he draws on the Bible, the writings of theologians and literary figures throughout the ages as well as his own reflections. He explains the meanings of the portions of the Creed. The reader is introduced to differing interpretations of some of the clauses. An example of this is the theology of the Incarnation, meaning that God becoming man is the most important fact, versus the theology of the Cross, which emphasizes the actions of Jesus. His Holiness examines difficulties, real and apparent, in the texts and concepts about them. For some he is able to provide guidance to what he regards as the correct conclusion, for others he just leaves the difficulty for our discernment.To my way of thinking, this is a deep book. For those with more theological training than me, it may be an introduction. Although it is deep, it is also rewarding. It has opened my eyes to new interpretations of the Creed. It has led me to think deeply about God and His relation to man and our relations to each other. I am sure that I will think often about what I have learned from this book and will refer to it in the future.
