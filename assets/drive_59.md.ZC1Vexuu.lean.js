I don't think the majority of 12th graders could read this book with ease."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Like the Star Wars movies, Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales were written out of sequence. In their chronological order, with their order of publication in parentheses, they are: The Deerslayer (5), The Last of the Mohicans (2), The Pathfinder (4), The Pioneers (1) and The Prairie (3). So if you want to read them in either chronological or published order, you should read Mohicans second. But each novel is self-contained, so if you want to try just one, to decide if the rest are worth reading, then Mohicans is the one to start with, as it is his most famous work and generally acknowledged to be his best.The hero of these tales, the improbably named Nathaniel Bumppo (or Natty, or Deerslayer, or Hawkeye, or The Long Rifle, or...etc, etc) was the first, and remains the quintessential, all-American fictional hero; brave, noble, honest and more at home in the wilderness than the town. He is not however, the strong, silent type. He has a habit of launching into long, rambling streams of homespun philosophy at the drop of a coonskin cap. Never mind that lead shot is flying thick and fast around his ears, he will lean on his rifle and expound on the different natures of Indians and whites, or the evils of literacy.The plot of Mohicans is action-packed, but is linear - no surprise twists, and no sub-plots - and contains some highly improbable elements. Well, would you be fooled by an enemy disguised as a beaver? Michael Mann's excellent 1992 screen version reworked the plot extensively, to its advantage.Cooper was the first distinctively American novelist and was inspired by Walter Scott, the inventor of the historical novel. He was consciously attempting to emulate Scott but, although he writes quite well, he lacks Scott's lyricism. And his characters, specially the women, are resiliently two-dimensional. But he did capture the spirit of the frontier, the pride and pain of a new and growing country, and in doing so created myths out of America's past that have survived, evolved, and have sustained the nation, ever since."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"I first read \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" many years ago. Recently, I was doing research on the Beaver Wars of the 17th century and learned a great deal about the history of the early colonies and the relationships between the various Native American nations and tribal groups. It's fascinating stuff, to say the least.After completing the research (which resulted in a two volume set of books entitled \\"Iroquois Wars\\" available on Amazon.com), I re-read Cooper's \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" with a more careful eye. Clearly, Cooper knew his stuff. He captures the true spirit of the American frontier spot on. He retains a mournful sensitivity toward the plight of the dwindling eastern woodland tribes while offering none of the absurd modern political correctness that makes every Indian wise, generous, and kind, and every European colonist vicious, greedy, and ignorant. While subject to the occasional novelist's hyperbole, Cooper also draws an accurate picture of Native military tactics and rituals. The various harangues and conversations he creates could have been lifted directly from the pages of the Jesuit Relations or other primary sources in which actual conversations were recorded by those who understood the various Algonquian and Iroquoian tongues.In short, I highly recommend \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" to anyone who enjoys historical novels or those with a particular interest in frontier history, the American colonial wars, or the native tribes of the eastern woodlands. The book truly is an American classic. (P.S., don't bother with the recent movie of the same name--it bears only passing resemblance to this book)."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Set in upstate New York in colonial times, Cooper here tells the story of the stolid colonial scout Hawkeye, nee Natty Bumppo (don't ask), who, with his two Indian companions Chingachgook (the Big Snake) and his son Uncas (apparently newly come to manhood), stumble on a party of British soldiers conducting two fair maidens to their father, the commander of British Fort William Henry during the French and Indian War. Under the watchful eyes of the young British officer who has the girls in his charge and led by a Huron scout, Magua, the party appears, to the indomitable Hawkeye, to be at greater risk than they realize as they trek through the wilderness toward the safety of the girls' father's garrison. And, indeed, Hawkeye's judgement is soon proved right as the scout Magua treacherously betrays the hapless girls in repayment, it seems, for a stint of corporal punishment inflicted on him previously by their absent parent. Since the Hurons, Magua's native tribe, are culturally akin to the Iroquois who are the herditary enemies of the Algonquin Delawares, from whom Chingachgook and his son hail and among whom Hawkeye has made his home and friendships, a natural antagonism has arisen almost at once between Hawkeye's party and the Huron and this proves salutary, when danger finally strikes. The tale quickly becomes a matter of flight and pursuit through thickly overgrown primeval forests, over rough mountains and across broad open lakes as the beleagured travelers first elude and then flee the dreaded Iroquois (allies of the French) who have joined the renegade Huron in an effort to seize the two girls. After a brief respite within the safety of William Henry however, the tables are once again turned as Magua's perfidy puts the girls once more at risk. And now the story shifts to a manic pursuit of the fleeing Magua who means to carry off his human prey in order to finally have his revenge on the girls' father, on the British and on the Europeans, generally, whose presence in his native country he blames (not altogether unjustifiably) for his myriad travails. Written in the fine tradition of the 19th century romance (which, of course, is what this book is), Cooper picked up where Sir Walter Scott (the venerable founder of this particular novelistic tradition) left off, creating a rich historical tale of adventure, nobility and marvelously sketched characters set against a brilliantly detailed natural landscape. If his characters are less keenly drawn than Scott's they are no less memorable for, in the quiet nobility of the scout Hawkeye lies the strong, silent hero of the wilderness which was to become the archetypical protagonist of the American western. And the Indians, Chingachgook and Uncas, are the very prototypes of the noble savage, so much used and over-used today. This is a tale of action first and foremost without much plot but so well told that you barely notice, as our heroes flee and pursue their enemies in turn until the very quickness of the prose seems to mirror and embody the speed of the action. Nor is this book only to be read for its rapid-fire rendition of flight and pursuit, for it touches the reader on another level as well, as the bold young Uncas moves out ahead of his comrades to place himself at risk for the others and the woman he loves. Although we never see Uncas at anything but a distance and never get to know the man he is supposed to be, he is yet a symbol of that people of whom he is the last chiefly descendant, the Delaware Mohicans. Nobly born into the finest of Mohican bloodlines, Uncas faces his final trial with heroic energy and resolve in order to defeat the nefarious and twisted Magua. Yet this struggle is also the final footnote in the story of a people, marking the closing chapter for all those Indians who, with the Mohicans, have seen, in Cooper's words, the morning of their nation and the inevitable nightfall which must follow. The book is a bit short on characterization and plotting and the prose is heavy for modern tastes, but the action is richly visualized in the flow of the narrative and the images are compelling. In the end, despite its flaws, this book of Cooper's is, in fact, the classic we have been told it is. -- S. W. Mirsky"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"It is easy to see that the modern action hero owes everything to Natty Bumppo. This is the best of the Leatherstocking Tales, though \\"Pathfinder\\" and \\"Deerslayer\\" are good too. \\"The Prairie\\" has its merits, but Natty is very old in that one, and \\"The Pioneers\\", the first to be published, deals only with Bumppo as a supporting character.\\"Last of the Mohicans\\", however, is a masterpiece of romantic fiction, and the birth of the American action novel. Cooper's knowledge of the American Indian is not always accurate, but it is easy to see the genesis of many legends that surrounded Native Americans in American lore into the 20th century in this and other books from the Leatherstocking Tales. The language is antiquated and may be a bit difficult for younger readers, but it is worth it.Also, a note on the film: The Daniel Day-Lewis movie is good--I enjoy that too, but it is incredibly different from the book. It is only VERY loosely based on Cooper's work, and Cooper's is unquestionably better.If you are curious as to why this book is regarded as a \\"classic\\", pick it up. I hope you get as much from it as I did."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Difficult to read as it is wordy in description and the phrasing is old.

Although not nearly the same experience, I recommend the Major Motion Picture as well. The cinematography and soundtrack are amazing."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Mark Twain took great pleasure in ridiculing Cooper's novel, gleefully pointing out plot inconsistencies, unbelievable events that led often to harder to believe conclusions, and the wooden dialog and petty philosophizing of the novel's principle character - all in an effort to prove that any way you might look at it, Copper could not, for his life, tell a tale. I think that Twain might be guilty of a bit of jealousy. Many of the faults that Twain found with Cooper can be found in his own writings, from Tom Sawyer to Huckleberry Finn; moreover, in none of Twain's work can you find the dramatic action that Cooper was able to create. Also, Twain was looking backward some fifty years and American English had undergone some major transformations, becoming less structured thus making earlier American literature, by contrast, seem formal, wordy and, to some, unreadable.Cooper's work must be evaluated from within its own time frame to prove just how revolutionary his writings were. Shaped by the traditions of the eighteenth century English novel and influenced by his contemporary, Sir Walter Scott, Cooper continued this tradition of the romance novel - with a peculiarly unique American twist: three of the major characters of this novel were not European whites (the almost universal character model of the literature with which Cooper was acquainted), but American Indians. Althought this was quite unique, Cooper was not free from the prejudices that was prevalent at the time of the novel's writing, and despite being associated with the idea of the \\"noble savage\\", created many more ignoble Indians than he did noble ones.The strengths of the novel are the descriptive prose that Cooper employs to paint his picture of frontier America - descriptions which, in fact, compare with some of the best nature descriptions in American literature - and the fine character development of two of his supporting characters, Magua and Cora. Twain was correct about Cooper's hero, Hawkeye - he is wooden, ignorant, and despite his close association with his two Mohican buddies, Chingachgook and Uncas, is openly santimonious about his pure \\"un-crossed\\" white blood and rails at anything that smacks of learnedness. Magua and Cora are much more complex characters.Magua is one of the best crafted characters in early American literature. He is not the stoical Indian character type represented by Chingachgook and Uncas, but combines the bravery of the Huron warrior witht the worse habits of the white man; he is ravaged by rage and hatred, having been cast out by his own tribe and used by both the French and English for their own colonial pursuits. He comes across as a sort of native American Ahab and is not without his sympathetic side. Cora is the antithesis of her fainthearted sister, the blond Alice. She is brave, resourceful and feminine; yet never could be considered (although Hawkeye does) a member of the \\"gentle sex\\". That there is a hidden aspect to her character, that her \\"charged color\\" hints at some dark mystery only makes her more appealing as a character.In short, Cooper did know how to tell a story, and if the contemporary reader will abate some of his biases and give the novel a chance, that reader will be not only captured by the action of the book but will realize that Cooper deserves his place as America's first novelist. Do not confuse the recent movie of the novel, starring Daniel Day-Lewis, as an honest portrayal. The screenplay, when compared to Cooper's text, seems to have been based on an entirely different novel."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans ..

A Narrative of 1757","review":"I disagree with anybody who found this book boring or tedious reading. At the tender age of 13 I picked up this book. Of course, at that age I would have had a right to dislike it ,but it turned out to be the highlight of my reading life. Ever since then I have compare every book to this one ,and in my mind's eye all have taken a backseat. I've read the whole series of Leatherstocking tales since then ,and they now hold the best seat in my library. Besides the Bible, I surely do consider the Leatherstocking tales my favorite books. In this fast paced world I can understand how people can grow weary of this book. It's much more than Indians and Pale faces running through the forest though. The reader must put as much thought and emotion into it as the author has done to develop his characters. As in the words of my English teacher ,&quot;Cooper reads like a smooth glass of lemonade--let him sit on your tongue for a moment.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans ..

Cora is a lady and is intimate with a major and goes along with her sister Alice on a trip guided by an indian who didn't adhere to the likings of a scout and a hunter whom were Canadians. I like the part where the mohicans have to venture out and kill a wild colt and all this so they could find shelter and the Iroquois won't get them by sunrise."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"In the old fashioned manner, each chapter of this novel written in 1825 is introduced with a quotation from another work, often by Shakespeare. In general, the writing style is quite formal and flowery, actually outright verbose. This makes it rather laborious to read and strikes a vivid contrast with the relative simplicity of the plot and of the characters. These, in a very confusing way, are often given many names. For example, the same person is called Natty Bumppo, Hawkeye, Oeil de Faucon and La Longue Carabine, all within a few paragraphs.There are definite incongruities in the plot. Beaver huts for instance are mistaken for a human settlement and a man disguised as a bear actually fools Indians who of course have lived in the woods all their lives! There are also anachronisms, such as referring constantly to the Canadas in the plural, whereas in 1757, when the novel is set, before the British Conquest, there was of course only one.This book's interest lies mainly with its North American setting and the fact it was one of the earliest novels to be written here. To the author's credit, it must be pointed out that he displays much respect for the Indians' wisdom and way of life, in marked contrast with general opinion later in the 19th century.Still, its qualities are not enough to make this work truly of major interest today."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Classic American stories are part of our lives. We read books on them, references in television series, and watch movies on them. But when we read the actual classic, we find that what we thought it was about is slightly different. The Last of the Mohicans is no different.James Fenimore Cooper wrote a classic that is read in most schools across the country. It's the story of 2 young English women on a journey to see their father who is a leader in the British Army. With an escort of British military and one native scout they find themselves ambushed. They are saved by a scout and 2 other natives. The fighting amongst the French, English, and native tribes gives Cooper a plethora of material for an intricate plot.This proved to more difficult of a read than I remember from high school when I read it. Maybe it is because I've read so many more contemporary versions and watched movies. There are several scenes were the dialogue is only in French. Sorry, I know about three words in that language. Also, so much description was placed that I'd forget what was happening in the scene.Now, I have to admit how movies ruined Cooper's book for me. The movie with Daniel Daye Lewis was great. I loved it. When I just reread the book, I was so disappointed because the storyline is so different. The book has Alice and Duncan in love. The move has Hawkeye and Cora. There are many other differences, but I would be spoiling the reading experience.If you have not read the book yet, try not to see any movies on it first. It will make the experience so much more enjoyable.Note: This book was free as a public domain piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"James Fenimore Cooper (1789-1851) is sometimes called the \\"American Scott\\". Like Sir Walter Scott who romanticized the Scottish past, Cooper focused readers attentions to the the American frontier. His most famous works are the Leatherstocking tales featuring Natty Bumpo. The novels in the series include: The Deerslayer; \\"The Pathfinder\\"; \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\"; \\"The Pioneers\\" and \\"The Prarie.\\" The most famous of these novels is \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" set during the French and Indian War in North America. Natty Bumpo the hero of the tale is said to be 40 years old; he is an experienced woodsman knowledgable in fieldcraft; Indian fighting and how to survive in a brutal frontier setting in upstate New York.The novel includes exciting fights with Indians; escapes from Indian captivity; word paintings of nature; a love story and a tale lamenting the passing of the last of the Mohicans.The characters are:Natty Bumpo-the intrepid scout for the British who rescues damsels in distress while escaping Indian capture. He is the hero of the novel and the Leatherstocking series.Duncan Heyward-A brave but inexperienced British major who is love with the inspidly portrayed Alice Murno. Alice is a stick figure with no depth or character development.Cora Munro is the sister of Alice. Both of these siblings are the daughters of British soldier Munro who is the commander at Fort William H enry. The fort is captured by the French and their Indian allies. Alice and Cora are captured and taken to an Indian village.Chingachgook and his son Uncas. Good friends of Hawk-eye (a nickname for Natty Bumpo). Uncas is the last of the Mohicans. He is love with the dark skinned Cora.Mauga. The evil Indian who is the major foe of the English and the friends of Hawkeye.The novel is written in an old fashioned literary style which lends itself to slow reading for moderns. The language does not, however, get in the way of the nonstop action. The book is one of the first novels written by an American author assisting at the birth of our literary heritage. Cooper's views on Indians is not politically correct. It is worth your time and effort to become acquainted with this literary milestone."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"I have been enjoying Steinbeck, Dickens, Plato, Shakespeare and just about everything else since I was small enough to listen to daddy read. Huck Fin, Buck, Kino...they are all my heroes. I read this one out loud to my parents - all of it unabriged - and did not have any trouble despite my fourteen year old mind. The manner Cooper uses to draw you into the story is fascinating...and strange in a world where no one has the patience to enjoy the manner of man that through his writings was discribing himself and trying to earn bread for his table that night. (Which is better than a lot of people can say.)Cooper's heroes are full of themselves. They are truly \\"men without a cross\\" as he, and they, say of themselves. Through the beautiful, melodius eloquence Cooper discribes the men that are much the same as Jonathan Seagull, Jesus Christ, Legolas and even Don Quixote. I respect him for the way that his characters DO what they believe and not wait for someone to back them up. Uncas prooved that well enough - in love or not.Most of us love The Lord Of The Rings movies, they too kill for the same reason. To save something they believe to be of worth (Read the book, they butchered the movie)I think that everyone would like to have the words honestly said over you that were said over Le Cerf Agile and Cora.TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHO THE MAN BEHIND THE COOPER MASK REALLY IS. you will then enjoy the adventure of a man's mind greater than any other."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"This book reads quickly, and really draws you in; Cooper paints each scene vividly. It's certainly romanticized, and by modern standards it's racist and sexist (which is understandable considering when Cooper wrote this book). Despite that, it's a great book. Uncas, the young Mohican warrior, is awesome and honorable. Cora, the main female character, has great attitude and stands up for herself. As a small warning, this book is actually more graphic than the movie version--I had to literally put the book down and focus my mind on something else to calm down after a certain part. I don't know, maybe other people aren't as bothered by that kind of thing. I definitely recommend this book, though. It is exciting to read!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"To be honest a story about the early frontier days is not the type of story that generally draws my attention, but since this book was on several lists as one of the top 100 books ever written I gave it a chance. Unlike others on these types of lists which did not live up to the hype, this one succeeded.You are brought into another world and given a perspective of another culture. I couldn't believe a book written at that time would contain so much graphic images. I had read books before who had characters in them which they called savages, but it was not until this book that I actually saw what savagery really was. The aftermath of the attack on Fort William Henry contains some very shocking descriptions. Indians have different morals and superstitions, and Cooper does a good job of explaining the differences while at the same time differentiating between good and evil. Bravery as always is still highly respected by all.The story was wonderful, and the characters were memorable. There is a lot of character development. Even the villain's character of Magua grows and grows, from a mer scout to a formidable opposing chief. Cora, is a very strong female character, which to me is unique for a story written during that time period. The character of David Gamut adds some humor and an image of a free spirit who stays true to his religion, but Hawkeye the scout, Uncas the warrior and his father Chingachgook are the powerful characters that anyone would want to emulate. Heyward the young British officer comes off a little stiff, but he is very honorable.I liked the fact that Cooper incorporated some actual real life characters into his story and gave us all a little history lesson. For instance Washington is mentioned briefly and Cooper insinuates that Washington probably learned his guerilla tactics for fighting the British during his days in the French and Indian Wars. He also mentions two other real life generals in a way which adds to the story without being accused of character defamation.I'm not sure if I would call this a love story since it was mostly filled with battle scenes and war tactics, but there was a lot of love to go around. Even with the differences in culture there is still a similarity between the love shown between the father Munro and his daughters, (as a father of two daughters myself I felt his anguish Munro felt in worrying about the safety of his girls), and the love shown between and the Indian father Chingachgook and his son Uncas. You have a special bond of brothers between Hawkeye and Uncas, and you also have the love story between Heyward and one of Munro's daughters as well.While I found the book to be excellent, there are three minor criticisms I will make. Every character seems to have at least three names which is confusing at times. One which is their real name, another their friends call them, and yet a third which their enemies may bestow upon them. Also I do not speak French, and there are a few discussions throughout the book in French which are not interpreted. It didn't ruin the story since I could guess what was probably said, but it was slightly annoying. Finally the book title itself gives away more of the story than I would have liked with it's foreboding.The character Alan Alda played on the old T.V. show M.A.S.H. had always said that his favorite book was \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" and his favorite character was Hawkeye. Now I know why."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"The Last of the Mohicans was a great book in sense of adventure and intrigue. It got down to the raw life of the people back in its time and really was detailed to where you could have a vivid picture in your mind. The writing was intelligent and crafty, but shall I say, CONFUSING due to the fact that the language within it was unlike that of the language we use today. I had to re-read a lot of sections for the reason that the wording had me confused and I had to try to take in what Cooper really meant. I am not in to this sort of book for pleasurable reading (it was a class assignment) and I would not recommend it for the non-rustic teenage girl, but it does display a valuable piece of history. I really enjoyed the love-related aspect of the book because I enjoy romantics and I liked how put that in. Otherwise, I might have disliked the majority of the book. All in all, this book was written very well and is a valuable piece of literature, but I do not consider it a favorite and would not wish to recommend it to others of my generation for it is sort of out of date, so to speak."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans ..

A Narrative of 1757","review":"The Last of the Mohicans takes place in New York state in 1757, during the French and Indian Wars. A troop of British colonials, led by the young Major Duncan Hayward, travels through the wilderness on their way to Fort William Henry. Accompanying the soldiers are Cora and Alice Munro, the daughters of the general who presides at the fort. By happenstance they encounter the frontiersman known as Hawkeye, his Indian companion Chingachgook, and the latter's son Uncas. Hawkeye informs the party that their Indian guide, Magua, has been leading them astray, and that he is a member of the Huron tribe who is friendly with the French. Magua escapes, but later returns with a band of Indians who take the two women captive, along with Hayward and David Gamut, a teacher of religious singing who seems to exist in the book only to serve as the Christian antithesis of the stoic Hawkeye. The only hope these four prisoners have for salvation is that Hawkeye and his Indian companions will rescue them from the clutches of their hostile captors.The settlement and founding of America is such a fascinating period in history, and James Fenimore Cooper brings it vividly to life. Like his idol Sir Walter Scott, Cooper combined his own experiences of the region and its inhabitants with extensive historical research to create a romanticized version of his country's past. I have read other works by Cooper (The Spy, The Deerslayer), and found his plotting to be too meandering and haphazard in its construction. The Last of the Mohicans, on the contrary, is expertly paced, with frequent moments of intense action and suspense punctuated by interludes of more quiet contemplation. The story is captivating from beginning to end, with the exception of a couple incongruous scenes in which characters don disguises that challenge the reader's belief. Despite these low points, Cooper's writing is beautiful throughout. He describes the Adirondack wilderness with the keen observation and lyrical expression of a Thoreau. His depiction of the Native Americans in the book may not be entirely accurate, but he is always very respectful toward them. He has a tendency to portray the Indians as being too cold in their demeanor and too reliant on superstition, though never so much as to the point where his characterizations become insulting. He exhibits great reverence for the land and the traditions of its native inhabitants.If there's an obstacle preventing today's readers from tackling The Last of the Mohicans, it's the language. While the text does not contain a great deal of archaic words, the sentences are constructed with the complex, convoluted syntax of a bygone era. Everyone in the book, from the highest general to the lowliest fur trapper, speaks with the poetic voice of a Lord Byron. A dictionary is not required, but every sentence does require some thought. After a while Cooper's narrative voice grows on you, and you'll come to enjoy the antiquated cadence of his prose. There is a dignity and a gravitas to the language that no longer exists in contemporary literature. Reading The Last of the Mohicans takes you back to a now forgotten time when those who wrote books were smarter than you, and they intended every work to be a masterpiece. To that end Cooper was largely successful. Almost two centuries after its publication this novel still provides a vital and invigorating reading experience."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Having read this years ago and finding it again for my Kindle is a treat. James Fenimore Cooper delivers a great story that allows the reader to understand the era, people, geography and lives they led. As one of the first classic American writers Cooper drew on his many experiences from his youth from the area around Cooperstown,New York. This lends credibility to the story that allows one to enjoy the characters and identify with their drama as the story unfolds. I enjoyed reading this as a freshman in college and it has been great rediscovering again as one of the great pieces in the American literature lexicon."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"There are several great movies of The Last of the Mohicans especially a silent version and the Daniel Day Lewis film that came out several years ago. I've always loved the story and knew I needed to read the book. I found it a very difficult read however. The story is great but I am bogged down by James Fenimore Cooper's writing style and ponderous wording. He obviously had a good understanding of the area in which he lived and the native peoples but I found his book hard going. So I can say I read it, appreciate the story but didn't enjoy the book. Sometimes the movies are better than the book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"I liked the book, Last of the Mohicans. I notice that many reviewers who gave it one or two stars are kids who had to read the book for an advanced English class or who saw the movie and decided to read the book. It is NOT an easy read (which is probably why many kids did not like the book), but I thought it was worth the effort. It was a little difficult keeping the characters straight at first because Cooper has several names for the key characters and switches between them freely.My favorite character was actually one that I would guess is an outlier - David Gamut. His manhood is often insulted by Hawkeye, (Hawkeye calls David's pitch pipe his \\"tooting weapon\\" and he pokes fun of his useless profession of psalmody) yet David's bravery is no less than the heroes of the tale. Sure he can't shoot a gun (it would be against his principles anyway), but he sticks with the sisters when they are kidnapped by Magua and is able to come and go freely among the Indians as he is viewed by them as not having all of his mental faculties. He saves Uncas' life by secretly switching places with him and tells Hawkeye not to avenge his death should he die for the ruse. His moral character is higher, I believe, than the vengeful Indians and Hawkeye. While Hawkeye tolerates or even disdains David at the beginning of the book, I think he grows to like and even admire David by the end.The plot was interesting to me and sure some of the language is convoluted and Cooper's vocabulary is admittedly far superior to mine. However, if you keep a dictionary nearby, you'll learn several new words and enjoy an exciting tale."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"\\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is a novel for the ages and its hero Hawkeye is a man who teaches life lessons with each page you turn. Many people believe that this novel has outlived its worthiness but once turn of the pages will reveal to the reader a world that is both savage and young, characters that are both civilized and savage, and a story that harkens back to the beginnings of the new world. Cooper's language is hard to swallow sometimes, and the movie is easier to watch, but the reader who settles into the pages of Hawkeye's life and world is rewarded with lessons about friendship, love, survival and the rite of passage that all people go through. It is a definite must read for both English and History classes as it explores the beginnings of this great country in which we live."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans ..

A Narrative of 1757","review":"Here is one of those books that is considered an American &quot;classic&quot; that few people have ever actually read. That is to say, fewer people than even the usual canon of classics. That's too bad, as this truly is an exceptional novel.Cooper's overly-formal language that he invokes for the dialogue of his characters is likely to appear stilted to the modern reader. Also, the occasions of &quot;conversation&quot; that he shares with his readers is bound to seem a bit awkward. However, the epoch in which the author lived was far different than that of today. The style of this novel is somewhat foreign, but it is a style that Cooper inherited from Europeon novels of the period.The narrative passages in the book are colorful and impressively descriptive. One cannot read this tale for long without getting the feeling that he / she is out in the forest (which is, of course, precisely the point). As a matter of fact, the novel has inspired me to someday visit the Hudson River, Lake George &amp; some other key locales described in its pages.One of the aspects of the story that surprised me was just how complicated the politics were between the Indian tribes. In truth, I knew very little about the Huron and Delaware tribes before I began reading. Since I finished the novel, I've found that Cooper's portrayal of the various races to be historically accurate. That's always a plus in any novel.For those who would like to learn more about Indian history, this book is a must-read. As the definitive novel of the French &amp; Indian war, the book would also be of interest to those who are intrigued by military history. In fact, one of the central scenes in the book details the horrifying massacre of the poor denizens of Fort William Henry, which is an actual historical event. Aside from these considerations, tho, it's just a good story - period."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"This book is an excellent read. Anyone who enjoys stories of Indian wars will love this novel. With romance and action-packed suspense with story line fits this book perfectly. James Fenimore Cooper's does a great job with the book and entices anyone who has reads it. Hawkeye acurate aim, Chingachgook's nativity, Uncas's daring thoughts, Alice's innocence, Cora's strength in mind and spirit, and Duncan's courage and love for Alice makes the book extremely breathtaking. Magua, is the evil Huron warrior who is a great enemy. His unusual love for Cora makes him extremely eery. Maguas is determined to destroy the last of the Mohicans."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"There are a vast amount of differences among the cultures and societies of different races. But what of the differences among peoples of the same race? Take for example the peoples of the United States. What are the differences between a person from California and a person from Louisiana? When looked at under a microscope, there are a great many comparisons to be made about a person from the south and a person from the west-coast. James Fenimore Cooper makes a like comparison in his classic The Last of the Mohicans. Cooper looks at the differences between white Europeans (primarily British and French) and two tribes of North American Indians: the Mohicans and the Hurons. Cooper compares the two tribes of Indians as well. Cooper sets his novel in eastern North America during the French and Indian War. His characters are of two different races: white Europeans, British and French; and North American Indians, the Mohicans and the Hurons. Cooper's description of the characters, the scenery, the sounds, the ways of the Indians-this author gives such vivid descriptions of everything that the reader gets a very clear picture of it all; almost like a movie playing inside the mind. Packed with some kind of action or adventure in every chapter, The Last of the Mohicans is a classic piece of literature that is recommended to anyone. The plot begins with the two daughters of a British general attempting to travel from the military station they are at presently to the station of their father. Accompanied by attendants and an Indian guide, they set out on the journey to their father. Not long after the party commenced travelling, they are met by three people; two Mohicans and a white scout, who is friend to the Mohicans and is well-accustomed to the ways of Indians and the wilderness. The British party's Indian guide leaves them, and they turn to the scout and the Mohicans for help. The scout and his friends agree to help them get to the station. Much action and adventure begins at this point in the novel, and continues to the very last page. The Last of the Mohicans is not only interesting to read because the plot flows and moves smoothly, but it provides historical insight as well. Cooper's look at two different tribes of Indians makes comparisons the reader may not have seen before. The author may even change the reader's mind about the opinions he may have had about Indians based on what he knew about them prior to reading the novel. The Last of the Mohicans is not exactly a short book; it has thirty-three chapters. And the action does not begin on page one, but the plot does flow smoothly and logically into it. Once action appears for the first time, it does elevate and decline throughout the novel, but not in a way that seems jumpy. The increase and decrease of action flows logically, as the plot moves from event to event. And as Cooper gives a multitude of details and description, one may find a particular chapter difficult to get through; but even so, the reader always has a mental picture of everything he is reading. The parts that one may find difficult aren't too hard, and it is well worth it when one comes to the last page. Cooper tells the story eloquently and smoothly, and in a way that the reader does not lose interest. His use of description and imagery make the plot clear and easy to follow. The plot in itself is intriguing and keeps the reader interested from the first chapter all the way through chapter thirty-three."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"This is a masterpiece that not only narrates action but explores minds and motives. If you have never read and enjoyed Dickens and Melville; don't bother with this one; it requires a reader with a brain. I was shocked by the first reviews here, and thought: &quot;Are these readers so egotistical as to think that people prior to the baby boom and going back 200 years didn't really talk like that, reason fluently in a crisis, or have deep thoughts about the meaning of life?&quot; People facing death do actually THINK (a lot) during the calm moments. This book is not always politically correct, but it is honest to a fault. It is not designed to be a romance novel; rather a novel in which romance (not sex) occurs. I HATED the movie because it tried to do a lot of anti-war, anti-imperialist moralizing.(Hollywood has no sense of history.) Did you ever read a story and think:&quot;This story is not believable. Like--when did these characters ever go to the toilet?&quot; This story is not like that. Yes it does slow down sometimes but so does life!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans ..

Cooper's writing is detailed, almost to the point of being tedious which can make the reading a bit laborious. Even so, I wholeheartedly recommend reading this great American classic.

I won't even deny that I enjoyed it, because I most certainly did. However, it's Cooper's style with which I take issue. Much of his language is superfluous, and renders the text more difficult to read. And, no, it's not simply the problem of an old-fashioned writing style. The text is so riddled with repetition and passive voice that it becomes tedious and boring (even during otherwise thrilling scenes).The only other major problem I have with this book is the lack of direction.

Also, when Uncas kills the Huron that killed Cora, but Mugua stabs Uncas three times and kills him is also really ironic. Magua's death was not very suspenseful. Rather than him just falling off the cliff, it would have been better if he died in a battle. The end of the story was very tragic since Chingachogook's son Uncas died and so did Colonel munro's daughter cora died. Alice and Duncan Heyward live happily ever after. Coooper shows how inter racial mixing can lead to bad consequences. From the Beginning Magua shows characteristics of an antagonist and his evil intentions that are to get revenge on Colonel Munro is one of the main things that lead to the death of Uncas, Cora, and to his own death. The main theme that Cooper is trying to get across in this book would be how the coming of the Europeans and how they brought such a different way of life that the Indians were not accustomed to, had destructed the way that the Indians in North America lived."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Reading this book is like walking through a landscape painting of 1770s America. The detail of leaf, feather, shadows and reflection are rendered as exquisitely as by the paintbrush of the master artist who is skilled in the use of light.To read this book, one must have the patience that is required to step into a painting and examine it layer by layer. But if one can, as Cooper puts it, take on \\"Indian eyes\\", a way of seeing that makes the forest read like a book, then one can enjoy a book that reads like a forest.Camouflaged within the panorama of Cooper's epic canvas is the classic story of a quest, with heroes and villains, of a heroine to be rescued, of blood and sacrifice. Although there is criticism that Cooper took liberties with history, the reader will come away more aware of history, how it was, how it might have been.--Debra Anne Wintsmith, author of Precious Jewels, A Seventh-Day Adventist Family Saga and voracious reader of other people's books."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Very different from the movies, but very good in its own right"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"This novel by James Cooper turned out surprisingly well. There are only two downfalls to this novel. The first is that I watched the movie. I kept expecting what happened in the movie to happen in the novel. I have to tell you, the book is much different from the movie, and the book is better. The only other negative is that I was raised and taught English in the 1990's and had some difficulty reading Cooper's style of writing. However, the imagery and detail Cooper uses far out weigh the difficulties in understanding his style. Being written in English, I could understand everything he wrote, it just took me longer to read.As I alluded to, Cooper did a tremendous job of painting a picture in mind. I want to visit the Northeastern United States after reading about its beauty. I immediately noticed the attention he paid to detail compared to more modern authors I have read. Additionally, I feel Cooper portrayed Native Americans in positive light uncommon to his era. Rather than berating Native Americans in ignorance, he explained there ways of thinking and ceremonies. More importantly, he showed that every race has common values. Foremost of these is love. The love shared by the chief for his son, the white scout with his Indian friend, the Indian for Cora, all demonstrate that love can touch everyone. The last pages of this novel had more emotion than any I can recall.I enjoyed reading this novel, and encourage all those who liked the movie or are looking for a good novel to read The Last of the Mohicans."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Cooper's &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is a classic novel that stands the test of time. The unforgettable characters, Hawkeye Uncas, Magua, and others all tie together for a climactic ending. The novel is sort of a romeo and juliet of sorts, and the romance between Uncas and Cora is a major plot line in the story. It also deals with themes of racism and Indian relations with white men. A good book that should be read by anyone who enjoys American literature or frontier novels."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"With the possible exception of Moby Dick, this book tested my stamina as a reader more than any other. Yes, it is a great adventure story but it is written in a convoluted prose style that was outdated in even Cooper's time. I was inspired to read this book by watching the Michael Mann film. If you go into this story expecting it to be sort of a novelization of the film, you'll probably be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans ..

Cooper demonstrates good charatcer development, but the characters themselves are unbelievable. The characters perform fantastic feats, such as tricking a hostile group of indians into thinking that one character is a bear, that we now recognize as being totally ridiculous. At the time it was written it was most likely commonplace for authors to prey upon the ignorance of their readers and I'm afraid Cooper did just that with this novel. The novel would be much more enjoyable if the reader had absolutely no knowledge of the eastern tribes of native americans or of the colonial lifestyle.

A Narrative of 1757","review":"\\"The Last of The Mohicans\\" is the second in the Leatherstocking series by America's first professional novelist, James Fenimore Cooper. Set in upstate New York during the French and Indian War, it introduces the reader to the Eighteenth Century world inhabited by settlers and Indians. This work contains both continuations and similarities to \\"The Deerlsayer\\" (see my Amazon reivew). The Deerlsayer is now known as Hawkeye and seems to be more a man of action and less a man of words. Chingachgook remains his loyal friend, although the Indian nature is more presented by his son, Unca. As in \\"Deerslayer\\", much of the story revolves around two sisters, in this case Cora and Alice, who are making their way in the wilderness with the aid of their companions. Like in \\"Deerlsayer\\" the saga finds its action in war and chase scenes involving American settlers and their Indian allies against Indians opposed to them. This series is rare among early American literature in that the Indians display characters of their own. A bit of comedy is introduced into the narrative by the character of David Gamut, the professional psalmodist who, despite having gifts so ill-suited to the environment of the story, still manages to play a helpful role in the conflict running throughout the book.I read this for \\"mood setting\\" during a trip to Cooperstown and other areas in which the book is set and in which the author lived. I was also interested in a familiarity with this classic of American literature. As a reader of my Amazon reviews is aware, I tend much more toward history than to novels and, generally, enjoy them much more. That being said, this novel is a keeper. It is an enjoyable and edifying read, even if classical novels are not your forte."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"I never really had any intention of ever reading this booking, having assumed that it was romanticized nonesense, but after watching the movie, and, for some reason, enjoying it, I decided that the time had come: I had to read the book.So I did. At first, I'll admit, the going was a little slow, as the writing is somewhat fanciful and the dialogue stilted, but this awkwardness became less of an issue the more I became enthralled by the story.Having seen the movie in advance, it was interesting to see how much the movie had in fact diverged from the story. Actually, aside from many of the characters, the setting, and the general premise of the story, the movie is quite different from the book. So much so, that it is safe to say that the movie has totally failed to capture the true spirit of the novel, and is little more than the typical Hollywood historical romance. The most unfortunate aspect of the movie, however, is how the &quot;patriotic&quot; element was incorporated--this is simply not in the book. I do have to say that the movie in its own right is good, but it utterly fails as an adaptation.The is no doubt that Last of the Mohicans is a classic. It is a book that I know will be reread a number of times before my time comes, and I'm sure with each reading, new meaning and insight will be found in its pages."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"I read The Last of the Mohicans for my English class. I found the first few chapters difficult to read, but as the book progressed I became accustomed to the 1800s style of writing. Once used to Cooper's writing, I cruised through the book with keen interest. Survival in the forest with hostile Indians is the idea, fighting through a few skirmishes. I am impressed with the skills Cooper bestows his characters, and enjoy learning of the Indians. The characters become well-known as reading progresses, and near the end of the novel I knew I had chosen a good book. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys an interesting writing style and a good outdoor adventure. The only bad part in the book is in the end, which I wouldn't be mean enough to relate as of yet. Stick with the first few chapters, and surely you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"This book is wonderful. The movie is equally wonderful. This is one of the rare cases when a movie and a book are BOTH enjoyable. If you enjoyed the movie, then reading the book is a necessity.The movie portrays an entirely different main character than does the book, and it is important to understand that Old Leather Stockings is a man the age of 70. The Last of the Mohicans is the last story in a collection of tales, and if one loses sight of that, then all is lost.This story is a wonderful tale about love and war--two of human natures most powerful forces. We are led on a sad journey where a man's seed dies with him, and the impact that has on the psyche.I loved this book, and could not stop reading it. Perhaps it takes a more mature eye to understand and/or appreciate the meaning in this novel. I also am a major in English, and I feel that this book has more to offer than meets the eye, you need only have the key to open the treasure chest."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"If familiarity does indeed breed contempt, then perhaps that explains why my opinion of Cooper's most famous novel has weakened over time. I recently reread the book after an interval of many years; not only was I disappointed (and somewhat bored), but I realized that it has become my least favorite of the five Leatherstocking novels.In \\"Last of the Mohicans,\\" Cooper aimed brazenly for a melodramatic adventure story in the Romantic tradition of the novels of Walter Scott. Reading it as an adult, the farcical caricatures that delighted me as a boy made me cringe at times, almost with embarrassment. (In particular, the psalmist named David Gamut is Cooper's Jar Jar Binks.) And the overwrought dialogue can be cumbersome and even unintentionally comical; only Natty (\\"Hawk-eye\\") Bumppo would deliver a 300-word speech to hush his compatriots in order to avoid the imminent risk of a possible ambush.Several things save the novel from its maudlin prose, and they alone justify its status as a \\"classic.\\" First is the unexpected depth of the portrayal of Cora. By modern standards, her character is stereotypically feminine, but she is a pioneering heroine whose depiction violates nearly every preconception of the era. A second aspect is the unhesitant and (for its time) graphic horror with which Cooper depicts hand-to-hand combat; the shocking episode that opens the massacre of the garrison still has the ability to give me nightmares. And, finally, there is Cooper's decidedly \\"unromantic\\" willingness to surprise the reader by killing off major characters with startling (and believable) twists in the plot. Set aside the cartoonish characters, the overstylized prose, the speechifying dialogue--the story alone is worth the read.So it's not a bad book by any means, and opinions will depend on taste. I prefer the character-driven narratives and the almost pastoral mood of \\"The Pioneers\\" or \\"The Prairie,\\" which at times seem to anticipate the survivalist novels of Willa Cather. For those who prefer the swashbuckling action of \\"Ivanhoe,\\" however, this is the book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Reading this, it's easy to see why James Fennimore Cooper is considered the first true American novelist. A comparison with the rather talky, and overly descriptive English novels of the time, shows that this is vastly different.First, of course, this is about the exploits of the common man. Hawkeye, the main white character, is the quintessential rugged individualist, eschewing society to live in the woods and travel with his Indian companions.Then there is the natural setting--the woods and streams and waterfalls of upstate New York, which appear almost as characters, themselves in the novel. And then, of course, there is that most American of stories, the decimation of the Indian populations.Having not read this book since I was in grade school, I found it suprisingly enjoyable. I was also surprised to find that the true emphasis of the story was the relationship between Hawkeye, the white scout,and the Mohicans, rather than the love story cooked up for the 1991 movie, and that a love interest also exhisted between the young Mohican, Uncas, and Munro's daughter, Cora,who, expediently, turned out to be of mixed race herself.As historical fiction, this is very accurate. And though the Indians are generally depicted,at their worst, as inhuman savages, and, at their best, as surprisingly bright and sensitive savages, for the time in which it was written, it was probably rather daring, and the most one could expect toward bridging the gap between the races.I would definitely recommend that those who think of this as one of those classics they were forced to read in school, give it a second try. You may be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"I do not know if I have too much to add to the outstanding reviews of this book on 'Amazon'. by Peter Reeve and B.

In one sense this perhaps symbolizes the triumph of 'civilization'. But in another it suggests a great crime and loss.Cooper as Mark Twain perhaps too hilariously taught us writes awkwardly.

This is a magnificent book that captures the ruggedness of the American wilderness and creates the American Hero, Hawkeye- the loner who rejects the institutions and the relationships that most men need and who stand alone for what is right. This motif has been picked up in countless American heros ranging from Hammetts Sam Spade to John Wayne.Although written in a style that may be difficult for the contemporary reader to grasp, it is, nevertheless, a beautifully written novel. Cooper has a way of describing the savage beauty of the American wilderness that is unequaled in literature. An example of this is his description of the forest swallowing up the European armies only to spit them out in ragged pieces- armies larger than those that often dispose of the scepters of the mother countries were seen to bury themselves in these forest, whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands that were haggard with care or dejected by defeat. Raised in western Oregon and spending much of my youth in the Oregon wilderness, I know exactly what Cooper describes. There is a terrible beauty about the wilderness that both invites and destroys. It is a beauty that draws on into its inner recesses can quickly turn into terror as the weather turns foul, ones sense of direction is lost and the forest seems to close in around one fights off the feeling of terror and loneliness. It gives an rush that city folks cannot even imagine.The story is set in the geo-political struggle between the France and England for control of colonial empires both in the Americans and India. It is a story of savagery, slaughter, betrayal and courage. Of course, this book would offend the sensibilities of politically correct. Yes, Indians are describes as savages and yes, they massacre innocent women and children. Yes, Europeans get better press; but Cooper, like Melville, addresses the race issue. Hero's and villains are been on both sides of the conflict. This is a great book and should be on your must read list of American literature."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"It's hard to imagine that this novel was written over a hundred years ago, because its daring message of anti-imperialism and its detailed and sensitive study of the Native American culture. Apparently, a hundred years later, the interracial romance was still too taboo for Hollywood, so this theme was white-washed. The movie also reduced the complex Indian characters to cardboard cartoons. Read the original literary masterpiece when your brain is active, and watch the movie when your brain is near-dead."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Set in upstate New York in colonial times, Cooper here tells the story of the stolid colonial scout Hawkeye, nee Natty Bumppo (don't ask), who, with his two Indian companions Chingachgook (the Big Snake) and his son Uncas (apparently newly come to manhood), stumble on a party of British soldiers conducting two fair maidens to their father, the commander of British Fort William Henry during the French and Indian War. Under the watchful eyes of the young British officer who has the girls in his charge and led by a Huron scout, Magua, the party appears, to the indomitable Hawkeye, to be at greater risk than they realize as they trek through the wilderness toward the safety of the girls' father's garrison. And, indeed, Hawkeye's judgement is soon proved right as the scout Magua treacherously betrays the hapless girls in repayment, it seems, for a stint of corporal punishment inflicted on him previously by their absent parent. Since the Hurons, Magua's native tribe, are culturally akin to the Iroquois who are the herditary enemies of the Algonquin Delawares, from whom Chingachgook and his son hail and among whom Hawkeye has made his home and friendships, a natural antagonism has arisen almost at once between Hawkeye's party and the Huron and this proves salutary, when danger finally strikes. The tale quickly becomes a matter of flight and pursuit through thickly overgrown primeval forests, over rough mountains and across broad open lakes as the beleagured travelers first elude and then flee the dreaded Iroquois (allies of the French) who have joined the renegade Huron in an effort to seize the two girls. After a brief respite within the safety of William Henry however, the tables are once again turned as Magua's perfidy puts the girls once more at risk. And now the story shifts to a manic pursuit of the fleeing Magua who means to carry off his human prey in order to finally have his revenge on the girls' father, on the British and on the Europeans, generally, whose presence in his native country he blames (not altogether unjustifiably) for his myriad travails. Written in the fine tradition of the 19th century romance (which, of course, is what this book is), Cooper picked up where Sir Walter Scott (the venerable founder of this novelistic tradition) left off, creating a rich historical tale of adventure, nobility and marvelously sketched characters set against a brilliantly detailed natural landscape. If his characters are less keenly drawn than Scott's they are no less memorable for, in the quiet nobility of the scout Hawkeye lies the strong, silent hero of the wilderness which has become the archetypical protagonist in our own American westerns. And the Indians, Chingachgook and Uncas, are the very prototypes of the noble savage, so much used and over-used today. This is a tale of action first and foremost without much plot but so well told that you barely notice, as our heroes flee and pursue their enemies in turn until the very quickness of the prose seems to mirror and embody the speed of the action. Nor is this book only to be read for its rapid-fire rendition of flight and pursuit, for it touches the reader on another level as well, as the bold young Uncas moves out ahead of his comrades to place himself at risk for the others and the woman he loves. Although we never see Uncas at anything but a distance and never get to know the man he is supposed to be, he is yet a symbol of that people of whom he is the last chiefly descendant, the Delaware Mohicans. Nobly born into the finest of Mohican bloodlines, Uncas faces his final trial with heroic energy and resolve in order to defeat the nefarious and twisted Magua. Yet this struggle is also the final footnote in the story of a people, marking the closing chapter for all those Indians who, with the Mohicans, have seen, in Cooper's own words, the morning of their nation and the inevitable nightfall which must follow. -- Stuart W. Mirsky (mirsky@ix.netcom.com"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"I had a sort of love/hate relationship with this book. Cooper's writing style is so difficult to read and there were many times that I would read and reread sections and still have no idea what Cooper was trying to say. However, I was basically able to follow the plot, and even though the book is way too long, the story is really good.I saw the movie with Daniel Day-Lewis and was completely disgusted. Cooper's book deserved so much better than it got in that movie. I can understand the movie-makers wanting to have Hawkeye be a hunky young man instead of a middle-aged man who has a tendency to talk all the time, but come on, couldn't they have stayed more true to the basic plot of the book than they did? All that crap about the Colonial Militia and Hawkeye being imprisoned for helping some of the colonists escape the fort was just irritating and stupid."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Reading this, it's easy to see why James Fennimore Cooper is considered the first true American novelist. A comparison with the rather talky, and overly descriptive English novels of the time, shows that this is vastly different.First, of course, this is about the exploits of the common man. Hawkeye, the main white character, is the quintessential rugged individualist, eschewing society to live in the woods and travel with his Indian companions.Then there is the natural setting--the woods and streams and waterfalls of upstate New York, which appear almost as characters themselves in the novel. And then, of course, there is that most American of stories, the decimation of the Indian populations.Having not read this book since I was in grade school, I found it suprisingly enjoyable. I was also surprised to find that the true emphasis of the story was the relationship between Hawkeye, the white scout,and the Mohicans, rather than the love story cooked up for the 1991 movie, and that a love interest also exhisted between the young Mohican, Uncas, and Munro's daughter, Cora,who, expediently, turned out to be of mixed race herself.There are some qualifiers here. It stands up well in its non-Indian history of the French and Indian War. However, on the Indian side Cooper tends to get his nations a little mixed up. Also, it is important to point out that the Mohicans today are a federally recognized tribe, so the title is, shall we say, a little misleading. And, of course, the major criticism from those of us who have studied American Indian history is the creation of that seemingly invincible stereotype--The Noble Savage.However, novels must be read in the context of their times and with regard for what the author meant to achieve. In this case Cooper wanted to write a truly American novel as opposed to the English novels so popular at the time, and in that sense I think he succeeded.In this edition, the N.C.Wyeth illustrations were a real asset. I wish we could go back to the days when books were beautifully bound and contained artistically rendered illustrations. It really adds to the total reading experience.If you are one of those who simply remembers this as a classic you were forced to read in school, give it a second try. You may be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"If you've read this book without Wyeth's illustrations, you've really missed something. His ability to capture the violence and vibrancy of the scenes depicted is amazing. I can feel the warmth of a dawn sun, see the dappling of sunlight in the forest, and experience the strength of the indians. If you want your children to experience a classic classic, this is one!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"This review pertains to the Penguin Classic edition, which has a fascinating introductory essay by Professor Richard Slatkin. But I would save the essay for last; it's so pedagogic in nature, it almost strips Cooper's French & Indian War masterpiece of the fundamental magnetism that has drawn countless readers to it for over 150 years.For this reader, that \\"magnetism\\" is the sheer awe-inspiring beauty and terror of the North American primal forest. Slatkin's essay is rather bloodless, but I can assure you that this novel is not. And the idea of constantly running and hiding from an archetypical villain, like Magua, and his band of warrior Hurons, who feel quite comfortable with the act of cleaving one's skull with a hatchet, is quite unsettling.Of course, \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is not a depiction of Native Americans through the lens of 21st Century sensibilities. Unquestionably, the modern day reader should be at least a little horrified at the near extinction of the Native American population. But no matter how sensitive one is about their tragic, inexorable decline, it is still an unalterable fact that -- under the alliance they entered into with the French -- several Eastern tribes struck abject terror into the hearts of 18th Century British Colonials. (May I suggest a casual inquiry into the colonial history of Deerfield, Massachusetts? The hatchet marks can still be seen on the wooden doors.)The setting for \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is the great waterway formed by Lake Champlain, Lake George and the Hudson River. The last glacial retreat laid down a perfect invasion route for the French moving south from Quebec, or the British moving north from Albany. That is why the area is studded with old colonial forts at strategic choke points. It is on the way to Ft. William Henry that the heroines, Cora and Alice Munro, are betrayed by Magua, who was charged with guiding the defenseless daughters to their beloved father -- an old Scottish warhorse, who serves as commander of the fort. How the daughters are captured, escape, nearly massacred and recaptured occupy the first half of the book. Their eventual rescue forms the second half.Cooper's action-packed narrative is an artful blend of history and fiction. There was, indeed, a siege of Ft. William Henry by the French General, the Marquis de Montcalm. And there was some sort of trouble with Montcalm's Indian allies, but there is now serious doubt about a full-scale massacre of the fort's inhabitants. Indeed, Cooper has been criticized for botching numerous historical facts, but the \\"massacre myth\\" cannot be laid solely at his door. No less than the preeminent American historian, Francis Parkman, devoted several pages to the supposed incident.What is outright fiction is Cooper's heroic protagonist, Hawk-eye. He is the central character throughout Cooper's 5-book Leatherstocking Series of which \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is the second installment. Hawk-eye (better known as \\"Natty Bumppo\\" in the other 4 volumes) is one of the most enduring figures in all of American Literature. The honest-speaking, self-reliant, nature-loving, chaste woodsman/warrior is indelibly etched in our national psyche. It's no exaggeration to say he has influenced generations of Americans. Surely our military has taken to the man -- the Hawkeye missile is just one explicit manifestation.Juxtaposed to Hawk-eye is the Huron Chieftain, Magua, who wreaks havoc on everyone, including himself. Trust me -- he's not the sort of fellow you'd want over for a weekend barbecue. His descent into darkness began with a fondness for the bottle, which led to the expulsion from his own tribe. And his kidnapping of Colonel Munro's daughters stems from a humiliating whipping ordered by their father. Magua lives in the obscure half-world betwixt the tribe that abandoned him and the British Army that he betrayed.Cooper has seemingly placed Hawk-eye and Magua at opposite ends on the continuum of good and evil. But perhaps they are not quite that far apart. There's something a bit unsettling about the heroic Hawk-eye. Like Magua, he occupies a strange middle ground, shunning white civilization (into which he was born), but hardly embracing Native American culture (with the exception of his friendship with Chingachgook and his son, Uncas.) And while I would not lable Hawk-eye an outright racist, he does ridicule and dehumanize his Indian foes. And as for exterminating them, he has no scruple about that. He'd shoot every one of them given the chance.Say this for Magua -- he is no racist. He offers his wigwam (albeit in forced circumstances) to Colonel Munro's eldest daughter, Cora, whose dark hair and dusky complexion are traceable to her Caribbean slave ancestry. As Slatkin points out in his essay, the commingling of their blood would unite the three great races of our nation's history. Such an amalgamation is unthinkable to Hawk-eye. In the final scene of the book, Colonel Monroe asks Hawk-eye to translate for the Delaware maidens the hope that one day all of God's children, regardless of color, will assemble around his throne. What is Hawk-eye's response? \\"To tell them this, would be to tell them that the snows come not in winter...\\"Perhaps Hawk-eye's response is his cold calculus that our country could never become part white/part red, and that the latter must inevitably fade away. Magua understands this all too well. Native Americans are playing a losing hand, especially when they end up fighting one another. Afterall, notwithstanding the honor of saving Cora and Alice, what's really in it for Hawk-eye's Mohican allies in their battle with the Hurons? In a word, extinction. In some ways, Magua is spiritually akin to the real-life Pontiac, Chief of the Ottawa Nation, who asked his tribesmen if they knew what happened to the Great Narragansett? I'll tell the reader. More than one hundred years before Cooper's haunting tale, the Puritans exterminated the Rhode Island tribe, and the Iroquois hunted down the few ragged survivors."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"The Last of the Mohicans takes place during the French and Indian War, and it covers the fall of Ft. William Henry in 1757 to the French. In the vast woods travel Chingachgook, his son Uncas, and Hawkeye, a white man who is more comfortable with Indians. Chingachgook and Uncas are the last of the Mohicans, an Indian tribe. Although Hawkeye's niche is clearly with the Mohicans, he constantly asserts throughout the book that he is white and does not have Indian blood.One day, this group meets with travelers heading to the fort. In this group are Cora and Alice Munro, Major Duncan Heyward, their Indian guide Magua, and later a minstrel named David Gamut. The girls want to meet with their father, British Colonel Munro at the fort. Magua has deliberately led them astray, but when confronted, he escapes. Magua is a Huron whose loyalities lie with the French, and he harbors deep resentment to Colonel Munro. The group arrives at the fort, but the fort falls to the French. The French and British have terms of peace, but the Indian allies of the French do not heed these terms, causing much bloodshed. Alice, Cora, and Gamut are captured, and the rest of the book covers the wild \\"rescue\\" of these three. Action and adventure depict the wild frontier, and there are also hints of love. Heyward and Alice are kind but \\"delicate\\" while Uncas and Cora are bold and courageous.Great book. The plot moves quickly, although sometimes it is a little stagnant. However, the need to know what happens next drives the reader to continue reading. In addition, Cooper does a good job describing each character. One can imagine courageous Hawkeye standing there on the hills, a white man in deerskin, with his rifle, or the laconic but admirable Uncas emanating with courage and skill. Cooper describes the setting well--the wild frontier, complete with the sound effects of nature. The Indian skirmishes are described graphically, which is all the better for forming mental images.Although this book is wonderful, I do have some complaints. In the beginning, there are long footnotes, and they distracted me. Also, there is some conversation in French but no translation! As one person pointed out, yes, a lot of characters have more than one name in the book. For example, Major Heyward is called Heyward, Duncan (his first name), the major, etc... It is not bad for Heyward, but for others, it can get a little confusing, especially in dialogue, if there are just titles (ie: \\"the Indian\\", \\"the latter,\\" \\"the scout\\"). Also, there are tons of Indian tribes mentioned--Mohawk, Delawares, Huron, Mingo, Yengeese, Maquas--some of them are one in the same, but especially in the earlier parts, it can be hard to discern who's who.I am glad I picked up The Last of the Mohicans. I am impressed by the first great American novelist, James Fenimore Cooper, and he deserves that title 100%."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"This is a book that captures the imagination of young and old. Mr. Cooper's descriptions of the wilderness and his familiarity with Indian lore are captivating. Cooper's plotting skills which manifest themselves in his stories, is incredible! This is a rip-roaring read that will keep you turning pages well into the night. His characters are also unforgettable. The relationship that develops between Hawkeye and his Indian friend Chingachgook is wonderfully told. This is an action story that could arguably be the first of the modern-day adventure story genre. It's hard to believe that this one was written in 1826."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Cora and Alice are damsels in distress. They've had a hard day. Captured by Injuns, tied to stakes to be burned alive, set free only to be recaptured later. In the 18th Century they didn't have aspirin for headaches.This may not be the most realistic book on the shelf, nor the most psychologically deep, but it is a good enough adventure story to have me reading the last 150 pages in one day.The heroes are white hunter Hawkeye with supernatural accuracy using that rifle of his, Mohican Indian chief Chingachgook, and his son Uncas. You want these guys on your side if you ever get in trouble in a bar.I learned so much from this book. I learned that the Delaware Indians, also known as Lenni-Lenape and Mohican, are all noble and brave. I learned that the Mingo Indians, also known as Maqua or Iroquois, are all lying and treacherous. Oh-kay.My guess is that at the time the book was written, the Delawares had already been defeated and dislocated off the eastern seaboard, so it was safe to glorify them. The Iroquois were probably still a threat.The folly in leading Cora and Alice through Indian territory during time of war, behind a treacherous Indian guide named Le Renard Subtil, reminds me of the folly of Friar Lawrence in Romeo And Juliet, coming up with his foolish scheme of drugging Juliet into a zombie state instead of just coming clean and telling her parents that she was married to Romeo.Anyway, good book. Read it."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"A famous classic written in a style that would confound most writers today. The use of language, vocabulary etc. shows a grasp of the English language that is unheard of today."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"The second instalment to the five novel \`Leatherstocking Tales' collection, Cooper tells the tale of a daring search and rescue mission led by uber-naturalist and Loyalist hero, Hawk-eye, in colonial America during the French and Indian War. Attended by his various sidekicks (aboriginal or otherwise), our gallant hero seeks to recover General Munro's two daughters, apparently for no other reason than it gives him something to do.The text liberally borrows from the worst tendencies of 18th century English Literature (haughty oratorical tone, frequent character soliloquies, ridiculous emotional and romantic characterizations, constant quotations from important English writers - in this case Shakespeare). This makes for a tough read. The plot is rather lumbering at times, as well. Cooper really has no time for any significant character development; what we see from the characters in the book's early pages is what we get at the end. Some characters seemingly have little or no purpose i.e. General Munro after his daughters have been abducted; a formerly confident and assertive person instantaneously becomes a doddering old fool whose sole contribution is to infrequently mewl about the loss of his \`babes.'The exception to the book's poor use of characterization is Magua, the villainous Huron Indian. Cooper's paradoxical characterizations of this \`wily Indian' often combine hatred with admiration. Cooper is never really sure what to make of him; while Magua embodies the \`savage' excesses of his race, he is also extremely charismatic, and a born leader.As this book is 180-years old, uncomfortable stereotypes and lingering racism are scattered throughout the text. Cooper's respect for aboriginal peoples really depends on which tribe he is describing. For example, when describing the eyes of Uncas, a Mohican, the narrator seemingly exclaims without irony they were beaming \\"with a sympathy that elevated him far above the intelligence, and advanced him probably centuries before the practices, of his nation.\\" Cooper also demonstrates discomfort with interracial relations, particularly of the aboriginal/Caucasian kind, preferring to change the racial backgrounds of some of his characters that may catch the fancy of the culturally inferior Indians.If nothing else, the book is a fascinating historical document that demonstrates the struggle for the formation of a unique American identity in early post-colonial times. Tendering Hawk-eye as a prototype, for Cooper, the new American is a composite of Native American, English, and colonial cultural values: brave, resourceful, judicious and cultured. While what comprises \`Americanism' is certainly more complex and ambiguous, this book comprises an early contribution to the canon of American literature and unique American experiences."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans ..

Wonder why they had to change the movie so much from the book?And, of course, it was much too long-winded for a reader, like myself, that does not &quot;skim&quot;.I thought the ending was a bit too abrupt, especially when considering the marathon pace of the rest of the book. Perhaps Cooper meant this to be taken so...Also, The insight into racism was astonishing for something that was written in the 1800's (NOT the 1500's like another reviewer mentions)."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"While \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" by James Fennimore Cooper is considered to be a classic novel that everyone should read, I suggest otherwise. Granted, once I finally became adapted to reading Cooper's overly exaggerated descriptive scenes, and could sift through the endless lines of details, I grew to enjoy the story.In \\"The Last of the Mohicans,\\" a group of travelers consisting of a singer, a Major of the British army, two general's daughters, and an Indian guide decide to take a shortcut to meet up with the girl's fathers at a distant British camp. The Indian guide leads them off trial and they wander around the wilderness until two other Indians, Uncas and Chicangook, as well as their white companion Hawk -Eye, decide to guide them to their destination. Along the way the travelers go through everything from a battle to two separate kidnappings. Overall the story was enjoyable but It dragged on several hundred pages longer than it had to be.In short, I recommend \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" to a true fan of 1800 era war and Native stories who have enough time on their hands to read the 430 page novel and enjoy the language used some 200 years ago."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"I know this book is a classic, and James Fenimore Cooper sought to fatten these pages with epic sagas of Indian and White-Men wars, placing special emphasis on the pride of every Indian tribe and their greatly diverse natures. He succeeded. The proud and somewhat glorious adventures of these doomed warriors is on every page. The Indian tribes are richly described in their bravery and cunning at war, their knowledge of the land they love and know so much better than the White Man. In the wilderness of the 16th century, we have the Mohicans and the Mingos at war with each other and the white man. It is significant to the author to point out the last of the great Mohican tribe as a symbolic reference that, during this time frame, one tribe at least was near extinction, an omen and future yet to befall the rest of the \\"owners\\" of a country much loved and revered by the Indian. What becomes tough for the reader to sort out is this: Some tribes are referred to by three different names - or more, and within these tribes, some Indians themselves by many names. Adventure and fighting are abundant of course, and James Fenimore Cooper even adds a bit of romance and intrigue as a quest for two loved ones underlies much of the story. I am sorry to say I was lost in trying to keep it all straight, and the book put me to sleep more often than not. Still, if you are an adventure lover and particularly interested in 16th century sagas, you may thrill to these pages.

Granted, I knew the book would not reflect the movie perfectly, but geez louise, Hawkeye was about as romantic as a block of stale cheese in the book.

The book at least doled out a little action here and there, but overall it was an endurance test to finish the book. I wouldn't recommend the book simply because you loved the movie. It's totally different, with the exception that Magua is still the quintessential evil son of a *bleep*. I'm glad I read it in terms of its value as one of the first American literary classics, but for classic entertainment in general, I'd much rather read Robert Louis Stephenson or Mark Twain.

But what surprised me is how poor the novel by James Fenimore Cooper is. Two-dimensional characterisation (eg Duncan Heyward - gallant hero?) worsens a tale which seems to lack any proper structure apart from shoving in as many scenes of fighting and dramatic escape as possible. There are positive elements, such as the cunning but subtle personage of Magua and the basic premise of battles in the forested wilderness of North America.

A Narrative of 1757","review":"This is my most beloved adventure/romance; however, it took me about the first 50 pages to \\"catch the groove\\" of Fenimore Cooper's writing style. In that way, the writing style is much like Henry James. If you can \\"acclimate\\" to the style, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Cooper's second book of the Leatherstocking Tales, in which the young chief Uncas joins his father Chingachgook and Nathaniel Bumppo in battling the French and their Huron allies, is quite possibly one of the best pieces of fiction ever written. The reader can almost feel the leafy canopy closing upon them and hear the rustle of the forest floor as the intrepid woodsmen range throughout the northeastern lakes region of upstate New York. Armed conflict, the pathos of human drama, exquisitely wrought characters, and Cooper's singular ability to bring the environment to bear on the reader's sensibilities equals a reading experience rarely paralleled regardless of the 150+ years that have passed since it's creation.I can always measure my level of involvement with a historically-based novel when I am compelled to employ the atlas to find the exact locations in which the story takes place. James Fenimore Cooper had me tracing the path of Bumppo and company by index finger as I was easily transported to an age when England, France, and their Native American allies confronted each other in the backwoods of a new world to determine the ultimate mastery of a continent. It is a mark of historical irony that none of the chief competitors were ultimately successful as a fledgling United States of America emerged. Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales provide latter-day Americans a fine opportunity to relive America's early past and see it for the uncertain and exciting period it was. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"This book has a powerful tale. It is just difficult for modern readers to read. Once I got used to his style of writing I liked Cooper's plot and characterization. I fell in love with Scout and Chingagook. I didn't want anything to happen to them. This book is a classic because it puts a story in the context of a time period and does it well. Again, its only downfall is its language, but that goes with the territory."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"This was a good story. It was completly different from the film. At first the language is a little challenging, I found myself re-reading passages to understand them better. After about 50 pages the reader understands it and the book comes to life. I enjoyed this story about Hawk Eye and his companions. It makes me want to buy the other books in the Leatherstocking Tales and read them as well."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Cooper's &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is a classic novel that stands the test of time. The unforgettable characters, Hawkeye Uncas, Magua, and others all tie together for a climactic ending. It is sort of confusing though, and hard to follow at times. The novel like a romeo and juliet of sorts, and the romance between Uncas and Cora is a major plot line in the story. It also deals with themes of racism and Indian relations with white men. An ok book that should be read by anyone who enjoys American literature or frontier novels. In my opinion, watch the movie, it's a lot better."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"well, as I said, if you have watched the film and then read the book, you will probably be disappointed...

A Narrative of 1757","review":"This book is a must read. Anyone who enjoys stories of the old days would love this novel. With romance and action tied into the story line perfectly this book is a riveting read. James Fenimore Cooper's great writing enchants anyone who has read this book. there werent really any gory scenes and the romance wasnt too thick.(actually it wasnt thick enough) Emotions are very deep and well put. Hawkeyes overly acurate aim, Chingachgook's native prescence, Uncas's daring ways and tender heart, Alice's innocence, Cora's strength, and Duncan's love for Alice all make the story exciting and eventful. But because of its complicated plot and length the book does seem to drag on a bit. Magua, the evil Huron warrior makes a great enemy. He will fight to the death to avenge his lost warriors. his unusual liking for Cora makes him even more eery. Maguas determination to destroy the last of the Mohicans is even more scary."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans ..

Within two days of reading it I got into my car and drove to the Fort William Henry historical site (which is now bordered by an amusement park and hotel, but that is another story). Standing there at the Fort, it was a wonderful feeling trying to picture some of the scenes from the book. Or, of Fenimore Cooper being there in the early 1820's, looking for inspiration for the text. Forget the movie, it doesn't do the story justice!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans ..

I do hope some day to even finish the darn thing (it's nearly 400 pages long, I'm on page 102). I did give it two stars because the action scenes are so well written.

A Narrative of 1757","review":"I had a really hard time with this \\"classic\\" of American literature, but then, I've never been really thrilled with early 19th century American writers. The style of the period is over-wordy by today's standards, with a great deal of what is essentially sermonizing both on the part of the author and the characters and very little real dialogue or character development. I'm a person who can generally consume any 400 page novel in a day or so, but I found I could not read more than about a chapter of LOTM at a time, and my attention wandered a lot.The story by itself it a pretty good one, dealing with the middle part of the French and Indian War. There is a great deal of fighting, striving with the wilderness, being exposed to alien cultures, and a dash of romance thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately, the story suffers from the over-abundance of words. Every encounter is melodramatized to the point of boredom, and the actual events get lost. Hawkeye, that redoubtable woodsman, never shuts up, and after a while everything he says is the same. Likewise for the other characters. There isn't any growth or development.I became increasingly offended by the portrayal of the Indians, both hostile and friendly, as either noble savages or just savages, obviously inferior to the white man. I also became increasingly offended with the portrayal of the two women, both of whom represented stereotypes of femininity popular at the time. I realise that Cooper was writing at a time when it was not much the practice to see value in native cultures and the memory, if not the actual experience, of the real violence between the American aborigines and the European immigrants was still close to the surface, but that didn't keep me from being disgusted at his overbearing and superior attitude.I'm glad I read this book, because it is held a classic. But that's the only thing that kept me going."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans ..

Im sure that if it was a modern book you wouldn't be so enthusiastic! I've saw modern melodramatic crap like this on the best sellers rack at Krogers.

The plot never really appeared in the book untill a 1/3 of the way in. this book is like me because the Mohicans fought for what they belived in. i'd relate this book to the Cherokee Indians becaus they were forced out of their homes in the east coast and ended the trail in Oklahoma.

It was inspiring to read books from a time when honesty and virtue were highly honored in a character. It's also fun to learn a little history from the stories.Important note: The book is different than the movie, and in my opinion is much better than the movie. Hollywood had to warp the story and even changed the nature of Natty Bumppo, who is supposed to be a homely man whose charm really is his impeccable honesty and strength. The movie folks even changed who falls in love with whom, but it still was a good movie, even though it's not this story."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Some of you readers of &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; might be interestested in knowing a juicy little tidbit. I just happened to be browsing through books in the library and came across a book by Sara Donati entitled &quot;Into the Wilderness&quot;. What caught my attention was a review by my absolutely all time favorite author, Diana Gabaldon. She has a review on the cover of this book that states &quot;One of those rare stories that let you breathe the air of another time, and leave your footprints on the snow of a wild, strange place&quot;. So I checked it out figuring if Diana Gabaldon endorses this book I have to read it. And as I begin this book, imagine my surprise as I'm introduced to the stories characters... a much older Hawkeye and his very elderly adoptive father...Chingachgook! This story, &quot;Into the wilderness&quot; is the sequel to last of the Mohicans and is the story of Hawkeye's and Cora's son Nathaniel. I'm only a quarter of the way through it and enjoying it very much. I can not compare to the book &quot;last of the Mohicans&quot; because I only saw the movie but in my opinion, Sara is a good writer and I am enjoying the continuation of a great story and interesting characters. I understand Nathaniel's and Elizabeth's story continues in a third book entitled &quot;Dawn on a distant shore&quot; coming out in March of 2000. Just thought some of you might be interested. Also if any of you are interested in the best series of books of all time...read Diana Gabaldon's Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber, Voyager and The Drums of Autumn. I can promise one and all, You WILL NOT be dissappointed. I couldn't put them down and eagerly await the 5th book in the series."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"The Last of the Mohicans ranks on the lower tier of classics I have read. Cooper's style is tedious, and the captivating action scenes that are so abundant in the movie are few and far between in the novel. I will admit, I enjoy excerpts of Cooper's works, and the plot, if it wasn't so drawn out, would be engaging. You can spare yourself from 400 pages of monotony and excruciating discernment by just reading a couple of pages from the climactic scenes. Although I rarely do this, I can unhesitantly say that in this instance, the movie is far better than the book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS is an adventure story set in the frontier wilderness of New York during the French and Indian War (1756-1763). The war is fought between the British and the French. The latter make alliances with several Native American tribes.The main characters of the novel are Hawkeye, Magua, Duncan Heyward, Uncas, Cora Munro, Alice Munro, Colonel Munro and General Montcalm. Hawkeye is a scout and woodsman. Magua is a rogue member of the Huron tribe and the villain of the story. Duncan Heyward is a young major in the British Army. Uncas is the last member of the Mohican tribe and a protege of Hawkeye. Cora Munro is the daughter of Colonel Munro who is the commander of the British Army at Fort William Henry. Cora is partly of African descent. Alice Munro is Cora's younger half-sister. General Montcalm is a famous French general.THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS is mostly a tale of adventure but it is also a love story which explores the challenges of interracial friendship and romance. The book's writing style is typical of an early nineteenth century novel and for that reason it is not always easy to understand. THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS is a classic which raises questions that still remain relevant today."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"I am a High School student and have read &#8220;The Last of the Mohicans&#8221; for my American Studies Class. We just finished studying the Native Nations and I have read a few articles on the Native Americans. The Last of the Mohicans, written by James Fenimore Cooper, is the paramount of American Literature. Unlike other books of its time, it ignores the stereotypes and common misconceptions of the Native Americans, concentrating only on reality. Throughout the book Cooper outlines his views on race, love and hatred between individuals from different groups within the American society of that time.The story is set in the French and Indian War. The two daughters of Colonel Munro set off into the wilderness to meet their father in Fort William Henry. They are accompanied by Major Heyward, and are guided by Magua, an Indian. They meet the scout Hawkeye and his companions Chingachgook and Uncas in the forest. The last of the Mohicans is about the treachery, loyalty, challenges, and allegiances that this group encounters during this perilous journey through the wilderness.This book might be a challenge for many readers, since the language used is not common in present-day literature. However once the reader overcomes this barrier, the true power and complexity of this story reveals itself. Cooper does not label Indians as savages in this story; instead, he shows the honorable side of them, such as the bravery and determination of Uncas, or the wit and intelligence of Chingachgook. He also presented the interaction between races, for example the doomed relationship between Uncas and Cora. Cooper&#8217;s writing style is extremely detailed and vivid. His description of fighting scenes and the emotions of individuals lets the reader experience the incident as if they were watching the event personally.The Last of the Mohicans is an extremely well written master piece by James Fenimore Cooper. In the book Cooper illustrates the greatness of Native Americans. He also outlines his views on race, love and hatred between certain groups of individuals during the French and Indian War. This book is great for people interested in understanding Native American culture, but be prepared for a fairly challenging read."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Since there are already over 100 reviews of this book and probably thousands have been written over the years, I'll do this one without benefit of book in hand, from memory and without a lot of details. It took me many years to get over the antiquated language barrier and to finally read the book. The classics are always harder to read than contemporary fiction, but sometimes it's worth the effort.What tipped the scales for me and piqued my curiosity was watching the recent movie with Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, and Eric Schweig, and realizing that this was a good story. Also, I'm very familiar with the setting in upstate NY: Lake George, Balston Spa, Glenns Falls, Scroon Lake, and surrounding area--at least as it is now, and it was fun imagining what it would have been like in those days, when the land was virgin, settlers could lose their scalps if they weren't careful, and the France contested with Britain for supremacy of the land.The book wasn't a romance--at least not in the modern sense of the word--with love scenes and the like. But it was a romance in the old sense in that the three main characters; Hawk-eye, and the two Mohicans, were larger than life heroes; in the moral, physical, and spiritual meanings of the term. The elder sister Cora was also a well developed, strong willed and heroic character, which surprised me a little considering the age in which the book was written.For me the most interesting character of the novel was Chingachgook's son, Uncas, who was the \\"last of the Mohicans,\\" a noble race of American Indians, which formerly occupied the lands by the \\"salt lake,\\" (i.e., the Atlantic Ocean), and were dispossessed and robbed of their lands and heritage by the original Dutch settlers and others. Uncas was a tracker extraordinaire, even better than the indomitable Hawk-eye in this respect. But he was young, inexperienced, and impetuous, which was eventually his undoing when he came up against the evil, and formidable Magua. But before he died, he was recognized as a king or great chief of his people, an heir apparent. So decreed the venerable Tamenund, a 100 year old patriarch and judge of the Delaware peoples, a related tribe to the Mohicans. This episode would have been difficult to write into an action movie, but it would have been great if it had been.Another interesting character completely eliminated from both the 1934 and 1992 movies was David Gamut, a preacher psalmist, whose moral presence and as a comic relief, was an integral part of the novel.All in all, this is still a book worth reading, if only to get a glimse of the way things were then and might be again."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Nathanial Bumppo, otherwise known as Leatherstocking, Deerslayer, and Long Rifle, is without a doubt the quintessential American version of Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan. To be sure, Cooper's frontier character saw print long before Burrough's creation did in 1912. This in no way invalidates the creation of ERB, but it does give more literary impact to a wholly American character who appears in what can only be defined, if one is truthful, as wholly flawed novels.The five novels which feature Bumppo were written by Cooper out of sequence. This doesn't necessarily impair the fictive underpinnings of the stories themselves, but it does give rise to certain elements which writhe like a murky thread throughout the main arc.We will, as expected, consider the best known, at least as far as the general public goes, work of Cooper, that being \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" and examine just what makes this novel tick, and why you should read it.Cooper believed that Indian culture must needs be crushed by the Anglo Saxon wheels of religion and technology. He saw no other way around this inevitability. Though he wasn't himself racist by the definitions which we adhere to today, he did have certain beliefs of superiority of his own culture which \\"dark-skinned\\" individuals had to bow down to. \\"Mohicans\\", with its poignant idea that there will come a time the \\"last\\" of this noble race will pass from the ken of men (that is to say the ken of White Men), has through this very self-same literary device carved for itself a spot of prominence withing American literature.Not everyone liked Cooper's work. He was always viewed much more favorably in Europe than by home-grown American authors. Mark Twain famously savaged Cooper's work and the savagery resonates even to this day. Yet, something about the novels, especially \\"Mohicans\\" endures. Perhaps it is the idea of a race of men passing, the thread of virgin forests and pure lakes, the savagery of life on the frontier, the fog of war, the blood-curdling violence. Whatever the reason for its longevity, and Twain notwithstanding, this book endures. Thank God.As one might expect there is very little of this book that is recognizable in the 1992 film remake of the same name. In fact, the film stole much of the story line which was rewritten in the 1920 silent film. In the modern film Hawk-eye, at the height of his powers, is taciturn to a fault but still capable of a normal sexual relationship. In the novel Natty Bumppo is not only naive sexually, he won't shut up, period. He discourses on everything, even to the halt of the action being described around him. Leaning on his rifle he has no problem detailing, to exhaustion, his opinion on events around him.Another big difference, aside from the often awkward descriptions, stereotypes of women and just plain ignorance of Native American ethnicities, is the fact a major character dies in the novel yet is allowed to survive in film. I suppose this would come as a shock to someone who saw the movie first, but there it is. Cooper has no problem dispatching that which, if allowed to live, would intercede in the future life of Hawk-eye. Natty Bumppo must remain pure. He must be allowed to view and accept nature as a powerful motivation than the love of another human being. It is his past, it is his destiny. He is akin to the figure of Greek tragedy in this way. He has a duty to perform and he will accomplish it, but he himself cannot lose the connection he has to the pristine land he loves and calls home.I highly recommend this book, though the new reader must approach it with a few caveats and not a little caution. Cooper is simply not that great a writer. I am not the first to say that nor will I be the last. Many of the passages go on far too long and the long-winded philosophies of Bumppo grate. Nevertheless, there is power here, along with pathos, grandeur, and yes, love -- though it's love on Bumppo's, and Cooper's, own terms.Despite its many flaws this is a major American novel by any definition. If you like adventure, and don't mind a little (okay, a lot) lagging, I think you will enjoy reading \\"The Last of the Mohicans.\\""},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Cooper is recognized as the father of American literature and for firmly placing America at the forefront of the literary world.His classic tale takes place in New York state in the late 1700's set against the backdrop of it's beautiful idyllic terrain which he so vividly describes and contrasts with the complex conflicts erupting within it.French against English. Indians against English. Indians against Indians.The story has a simple plot consisting of a repetition of capture and escape with frequent role reversals punctuated by brief reprieves serving to build tension.Although truly an action story, complete with a mythic hero ( Hawkeye ) who will serve as the foundation for the modern day cowboy, the tale touches on deeper issues in a subtle way.The friction of interracial amour is personified in Uncas and Cora. Their demise perhaps reflecting the authors views on transcultural relationships.The stereotyping of blonde women is brought into sharp focus in Alice's helplessness which seems never to leave her. Her character undergoes little development beyond a cardboard cutout set on a richly detailed stage adding to the effect. In contrast the dark haired Cora is seen to be a courageous practical woman embodying the frontierswoman.The struggle between civilization and savagery in the frontier is continually brought out in the conflicts with Magua, although Cooper is careful to balance his character avoiding simple dichotomous categorization into evil and good . Magua is cruel spiteful and villainous from the protagonist's perspective yet we are allowed access to Magua's thoughts and realize he wishes to live a good life in his own way and earn the respect of his people. His unslaked vengeance is his ultimate downfall.I wasnt particularly fond of the movie which is two dimensional ( literally and figuratively ) and strongly suggest reading the book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"My initial reaction to the novel The Last of the Mohicans was, \\"wow! I am reading one of the greatest classic novels ever written.\\" When I began to read, my expectations were high, but were quickly extinguished by what I read. From what I understood, the book was quite exciting, but very wordy. It seemed to make me think very hard; perhaps harder than what I care to when I am reading. I do, however, think the book lived up to its reputation as a classic.In the book, Major Duncan Heyward is ordered to lead the Monro sisters, Cora and Alice, from Fort Edward to Fort William Henry where their father is stationed during the French and Indian War. An Indian named Magua who is supposed to know shortcut to Fort William Henry leads the group.During their travels, they come across a woodsman named Hawkeye who is accompanied by a Mohican named Chingachgook. Hawkeye explains to Duncan that Chingachgook is the last of the Mohicans.Duncan quickly explains that their guide, Magua, has become lost and cannot show them the way to Fort William Henry. Hawkeye asks Duncan of his guide's Indian background and is outraged when he learns that Magua is of the Huron tribe. Magua over hears the conversation and slips away into the forest unnoticed. He now knows that his plan to lead the group into a trap is foiled.Hawkeye, Chingachgook, and Uncas agree to lead the small group to Fort William Henry since they sense the group is in danger of being attacked by the Huron Indian tribe. The group spends the night in a cave behind a waterfall but is found by the Huron Indians. The group is attacked and Cora convinces Hawkeye and the two Mohicans to escape by swimming underwater downriver.The group is captured, and Magua leads Cora and Alice deep in the forest. He tells them of his plan to marry Cora as part of his revenge on Colonel Monro. Colonel Monro ordered Magua publicly beaten after getting drunk and not handling himself properly.Cora refused to marry Magua. This angered him greatly and was about to kill the whole group, when Hawkeye and the Mohicans rushed in to the camp, killing all the Hurons except Magua.At dawn the next day, the group drew near Fort William Henry. As they closed in, they realized that the fort was under attack by French troops and Iroquois Indians. The group moved slowly to the fort and entered uninjured, reuniting the girls with their father.I thought James Fenimore Cooper's book is an exciting, borderline thriller. What you just read is a small sample of what the book has in store for you. The best parts are yet to come. You just have to read the book to understand what I am talking about. The setting, plot, and the characters make it seem like it was a real true story that keep you on the edge of your seat the whole way through.I loved the story, but sometimes, it seemed so hard to get to the point Mr. Cooper was trying to make. His use of multiple adjectives to describe absolutely everything was quite repetitive and bothersome. I think the book would have been fifty pages shorter if he would have just got right down to the point instead of over describing the simplest of things.All of the characters in the book are quite realistic. They all seem as though they lived the time period instead of just being part of the author's imagination. The whole story is believable and realistic. I loved the book.I would recommend the book to anyone who likes this type of novel. I would even recommend this book to people who are not overly impressed by the time period, setting or plot. It is a great classic novel and it did not get to be that way by being terrible. It is complicated reading but very worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Having seen and enjoyed Last of the Mohicans movies, I knew I wanted to read the novel someday. The book, as many have noted, is challenging due to its wordy old English style, the many different characters, places and events, often referred to by different names, etc. But, if you just go with it and get the gist, and not worry about not understanding some words or phrases, it is a thoroughly engrossing read. As much as I loved the great Daniel Day Lewis LotM movie, it is only loosely related to the book. More like pieces/scenes from the book are recreated, but following a very different screenplay. For example: there is no love story, at all, between Hawkeye and Cora (and no cheesy, \\"Stay alive- I will find you!!!\\"). No murder of Munro by Magua. Duncan actually loves Alice, who both survive, while Cora is brutally murdered by Magua. And so on. While reading the book I was very aware that it would be almost impossible to make a coherent movie following the book. And, as is always true, the book provides so much more interesting detail than can be covered in a 2-3 hour movie. For example, the description of how Chingotchgook, Uncas and Hawkeye became separated from their tribe many years before, and then are emotionally reunited with their descendant tribe-a turtle tattoo figures prominently (read the book!:)- is very touching and deep. I would have loved to have seen that, somehow, in the movie.If you like early American history, Native American history at the time of the revolution, etc. this original novel of the genre is a must read. Just know that there will be sections that are kind of hard to follow. The book, despite its age and flaws, is emotionally powerful and thrilling."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"This is a flat-out great book. A classic of American adventure, it holds its own today. Granted, you have to settle into the writing style, but once you do you are invested in an adventure that is well worth the time and attention it requires."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"As a young reader who in the past had not been able to experience the glory of James Fenimore Cooper's writing, I was immensely impressed with his amazing depictions of the scenes. Armed with the biased view of the first inhabitants of this country developed through study in school, my view of the ancestors of this land changed dramatically with each page of this book. The character of Uncas, the young warrior of the Mohican race, captured my heart and I followed his tracks through the book breathlessly. I had endless confidence in the scout Hawkeye and the father of Uncas, Chingachgook. Duncan and David forever added to the flavor of the book. Every character will take on life and dance about the plot, thickening it and twirling through the words chosen by the great author Cooper. Each time I thought that I knew what would happen next, a twist would hit me unexpectedly and cause me to commend the author once again. The trials of the beautiful sisters, the fatal accuracy of &quot;Killdeer,&quot; the calm resolution of Indian warriors, and the treachery of the Huron Magua will force you to continue reading. To miss out on the unforgettable journey James Fenimore Cooper takes you through in The Last of the Mohicans would only be your loss. This classic piece of literature will not fail to enthrall you and will take your mind through a torrent of emotions invoked by the unrivaled story-telling ability of one who is called the first great American author. Grounded in the resolution of nobility, the steadfastness of a warrior, and the basis of revenge, I guarantee that this book will take hold of your senses and not let go until you've read every last word. For your own sake, give yourself a treat and grant Cooper yet another reader."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Any book illustrated by N.C. Wyeth is worth having. I have 6 classics illustrated by this great painter, and I find all of them a letdown if I read them after looking at the illustrations. The stories never live up to this master, and Cooper's classic is no exception."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"\\"Mohicans\\" has long been on my \\"I'll read that someday\\" list, and I finally found the time to read it over the last few months. And while I'm glad I did, it must be stated matter-of-factly that James Fenimore Cooper's writing style is not very kind to the reader. He tended to write some long-winded passages and descriptions, with sometimes a little too much detail, and his use of multiple names for the same character became annoying after a while. \\"Hawkeye,\\" one of the main characters in the story, might also be called \\"the scout,\\" \\"the Long Rifle,\\" \\"pale-face\\" and some other names, all in the same paragraph! And Cooper did this with many of his characters. It's not the most effective story-telling device.As for the story itself, I liked it very much. Set in 1757, during the Seven Years' War in America (or the French and Indian War, as it is also known), it follows the fortunes of a group of misfits caught up in the struggles between the British and French empires, as well as various Native American tribes. Strongest among these characters is Hawkeye, a white man who has nevertheless shunned living the \\"civilized life,\\" and instead lives off the land, like the Native Americans. Indeed, some of his closest friends are Mohicans, probably a novel concept when this book was written in the 1820s. Whenever I was reading about Hawkeye, I couldn't help thinking of the \\"real\\" early pioneer heroes Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett; his actions and deeds evoked images of a coonskin-capped hero \\"saving the day\\" time and again, whenever duty called. Finally, although I will not mention the ending of the story, I will say it did not have the typical \\"Hollywood Ending,\\" which, frankly, I was expecting. It was a pleasant surprise to find that Cooper did not fall prey to the \\"feel-good\\" story.It was for these reasons that I give this a favorable rating, despite the random difficulties with Cooper's writing style. \\"Mohicans\\" is worth your time, but be aware you must also be patient; for long stretches this is not a page-turner.Four stars."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"This was a very intertaining book. I love reading it. Just good all around product. I have read it several times."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans .. A Narrative of 1757","review":"Have you ever seen a movie and wondered if the book it was based on was as good as the movie? Well, that's pretty much why I read \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" by James Fenimore Cooper.This novel is a classic, true; but it is written in the overly turgid, stilted language that was popular at the time it was first released, and may be somewhat burdensome to contemporary readers.Need an example? Here, try to decipher this: \\"At each change in the evolutions of the latter, the former raised his tall person in the stirrups; producing, in this matter, by the undue elongation of his legs, such sudden growths and diminishings of the stature as baffled every conjecture that might be made as to his dimensions.\\" That sentence, from Chapter II, describes the character David Gamut, a psalmodist, as he rode a horse, attempting to catch up with the party of Cora and Alice Munro. No, he was not featured in the movie, at least not in the 1992 version which starred Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, and Wes Studi. And if you want to know what a psalmodist was, you'll just have to read the book (or look it up). Gamut was actually one of my favorite characters, and the source of most of the humor contained in the text.In fact, the novel, first published in 1826, is a good bit different in plot and characters from the 1992 film. It has been noted elsewhere that the 1992 film was based heavily on an earlier film released in 1936, and not so much on the book. Most movie critics which I have read found the film to be more entertaining than the book.As an exercise in reading an American classic, however, the book is worth the time it takes to read it. Although the language is, at times, difficult to follow, it does give the reader an appreciation of what our ancestors found to be \\"can't-put-it-down\\" reading. The book is also a window, of sorts, through which we may look to a time in our nation's earliest years. Although it may be subject to some historical criticism, it is at least a popular (at the time) rendition of how American culture viewed its recent conflicts with the French and Native Americans.If you have to read this book as a school assignment, you should not watch the movie (any of them) first. Your appreciation of the book will be keener for waiting on the film, and you will enjoy the film more for the waiting.Note: This review was originally posted to the Penguin Classics edition of this work, but for some reason, the review did not include the correct title. I have reposted to this edition in order that my review might be more helpful (can't help if can't be found). The Penguin Popular Classics version included an informative forward and footnotes which helped in putting this novel into somewhat better context.As a final note, the fictional Chingachgook was not actually the \\"last of the Mohicans.\\" There are Mohican bands in existence today, and the Tribe is federally recognized. Chingachgook can more accurately be characterized as the last in an old line of Mohican nobility, as envisioned by the author."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans ..

The main character, Hawkeye, is probably one of the most exciting heroes I've come across in fiction. His constantly drawn contrasts between \\"book smarts\\" and \\"woods smarts\\" really turned the notion of what a 'savage' is on its head.Though I don't want to give anything away, the book has some surprises at the end that will surly shock you and make you re-read the passage to make sure you actually saw what you think you saw."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans ..

Paul's style is very readable and the book provides extensive coverage of the exam material.In fact, the book is so extensive because it was written not only by Paul, but by Carsten Pedersen, certification manager at MySQL AB. The book was written by the people who created the exam, and it shows. I can tell you right now that if you read the certification study guide and know its content, you will pass the certification exam. There is not a question on the exam that is not covered by this study guide.The exercises are good, though not always formatted the same as what you will encounter on the actual exam. Doing the exercises should reveal how well you understand a given topic in the guide.Here's an overview of what the book covers:* MySQL and MySQL AB* MySQL Software* Using MySQL Client Programs* Data Definition Language* The SELECT Statement* Basic SQL* Update Statements* Joins* Importing and Exporting Data* MySQL Architecture* MySQL Installation and Configuration* Security Issues* Optimizing for Query Speed* MyISAM Tables* InnoDB Tables* Advanced Server FeaturesFinally, here is the best part about the MySQL Certification Study Guide: it's free. In the back of the guide is a voucher code for 25% off the cost of a certification exam, or roughly the price of the book. If you are serious about taking the MySQL Certification exams, you can't go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"MySQL 5.0 Certification Study Guide","review":"I love this book, but I am outraged that VUE refuses to honor the included voucher code for MySQL 5 exams. The book is targeted for MySQL 5, and the text in the book clearly states the voucher is for ANY MySQL exam. But VUE claims the included voucher is only valid for MySQL 4 exams.I attempted to escalate this issue but was told by VUE that it is Amazon's fault for including the wrong voucher number. The code is clearly printed by the book publisher, not Amazon, so this is just very poor finger pointing by VUE trying to blame Amazon.The book is worth every penny despite the false advertising related to the voucher.UPDATE: I contacted the publisher and got a quick response. The publisher is working on fixing VUE's screw-up, so hopefully this will be resolved soon."},{"Title":"MySQL 5.0 Certification Study Guide","review":"I found myself wanting more when it came time to try the practice exam questions. The book comes with PDF's that serve as the practice exam. What I expected was software that would simulate the test. I'm taking the DBA class next month and I don't expect any issues passing the exam, though I would feel more comfortable forking out the $ to take it if I had a wider pool of questions to study from.The book does a fairly good job of covering both exam tracks (DBD & DBA) from what I've seen thus far and is laid out in a practical way for those preparing for the exam. This book is not intended as a reference, though some new admins may choose to use it like that.----Post-exam follow-up:The certification study guide did a good job of helping me pass the exams the first time through. Primary goal - accomplished. If you plan to attend the MySQL 5.0 DBA class, I got a copy of my own in the class so I wound up with an extra (so I keep one at work and one at home). Combine this with the on-line resources available and the value of this book increases.I do find myself recommending this book to other developers and administrators to learn how to improve their MySQL skills, but I don't recommend it as a reference. It accomplishes its purpose well, however, I think it could have been better by having more of the information we need after the exam is over. This is not a manual for MySQL and clearly does not stand on its own for that purpose. If your goal is to get certified as a DBD or DBA, this book will likely help. If your goal is to use this book as your only manual for MySQL, this is not the best investment of resources to that end.Hits:o Helped me pass the MySQL DBA exam first-time with very thorough study and having taken the MySQL 5 DBA class.o PDF files for exam prep materials and a full PDF of the book itselfo Has some nice query optimization explanations in it.o Provides nice resources for those who are upgrading their skills from MySQL 3.x, 4.x.Misses:o Does not cover MySQL Cluster.o CD did not contain software that helped me take practice exams.o Resource not intended to be used as a full reference of MySQL.o Many of the prep questions were given before the material to answer the questions were presented.Note: I would increase my rating of this book to four stars, but Amazon won't let me change the rating in my review."},{"Title":"MySQL 5.0 Certification Study Guide","review":"This is an excellent book covering MySQL in great detail.I did buy this book not because I want to be certified, but because I wanted to have detailed information about MySQL version 5 and all the new functionality it has.

If you want to learn SQL or database design you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"MySQL 5.0 Certification Study Guide","review":"The book is quite big and my first impression was it's going to take a long time and it's full of useless info. But once I started reading, I had a nice surprise. The book actually covers 2 certifications (Dev and DBA), 2 exams each. I can't speak for the Dev part, but the DBA part was very well structured and each exam required less than 200 pages of reading. The information was dense enough and always up to the point. The practice questions were really not a question samples, but more like a 60 pages summary of possible exam topics.I also liked the style very much. It's very proffesional but not too dry and reading is not boring.There are a few glitches here and there (table of content is off, the CD ROM didn't work well), but they are not really impacting your study.Overall, I liked it very much and I wish more vendors would adopt that format and style.And, by the way, I passed both exams at the first try using this book only (well, I've been working with MySQL a bit in the past, but I clearly had holes in my knowledge before).So I highly recommend this book as a perfect MySQL certification guide and general reference."},{"Title":"MySQL 5.0 Certification Study Guide","review":"This book is a necessary but not entirely sufficient resource if you plan to complete the 5.x developer and/or DBA exams with self-study. Most of the subject areas present on the exams are covered in enough detail to easily pass if you are experienced with another database product and can apply that experience. (FYI, I have 15+ years working with Oracle/SQL Server and have dabbled with MySQL since 3.x, passed all 4 exams using this guide).That said, you will likely need to supplement the book by reading the MySQL documentation if you wish to get as much knowledge as possible from the study process. Certainly try out each command on a test MySQL instance multiple times using version 5.x (NOT 5.1 where some behaviors have changed).The practice questions provided are not all in multiple-choice format as you will encounter on the exam, which can be a good mental exercise for review, but the answer formats can be frustrating in some cases, as in the case of a multiple-choice question with five possible letter choices, wherein the answer is a paragraph that doesn't indicate the correct letter choices. Trivial but annoying.Be sure you complete all practice questions from the accompanying CD and understand why your answers were right or wrong. There are no labs or practical exercises included, although a sample schema is included from which many of the practice questions are drawn.If you are not taking the exams, this is still a good primer on MySQL."},{"Title":"MySQL 5.0 Certification Study Guide","review":"I studied for the MySQL DBA exam using this book, chapters 23-42. I passed both exams on the first try two weeks apart. I can truthfully say that in order to pass both exams, you must know certain facts from several different chapters to answer a single question.

While there are many typos and changes to MySQL since the books release, just go to the URL http://www.mysql.com/certification/studyguides/errata50.html and make those corrections, and you will find that this book is indeed a complete study guide.

This book is consistent with the quality of writing in Norman Spinrad's \`No Direction Home', and which I would like to see more of."},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"In the late 1960s, the \\"new wave\\" of science fiction writers unleashed a flood of mind-expanded and civil rights-obsessed product that probably seemed brilliant and insightful at the time, but most of which now seems laughably dated and self-indulgent. But just like any cultural craze, a few specimens have long-term staying power, as long as future readers can get past the crusty slang and political references. This 1969 offering from Norman Spinrad, his fourth novel and the one that really made his name, sometimes threatens to collapse under creaky hipster dialogue and the social paranoia of its times. But underneath is a brilliantly constructed political thriller in a (then-) near future.The promise of immortality leads to a massive power struggle between a corrupt plutocrat and the title character, a self-righteous media manipulator whose attack-dog style is a downright eerie premonition of the O'Reillys that the real world has since delivered. (But at least Barron eventually develops a bit of a conscience.) Spinrad concocted an equally impressive exploration of the bleak future possibilities of around-the-clock media saturation and image-obsessed politics, and also delivered winning messages on the true natures of power and inequality. In 1969, such messages were in Spinrad's near future and are now in our near past. While some aspects of this book are definitely showing their age, the underlying messages of techno-political corruption and social paranoia are timeless, not to mention expertly constructed in this relentlessly brutal story.

Apparently denounced as depraved on the floor of parliament, beneath the toungue in cheek it's a disturbing discourse on the corrupting nature of money and power, in a world where your bank balance decides whether you will be granted life eternal. Comment on the power of media is prescient, with the title character's eponymous TV talk show's grip on the masses the only thing in the way of the nefarious plans of a mad, necrophobic billionare who throws gobs of money at private research into cryogenics and immortality, and is willing to go to any lengths to get his sinister 'freezer bill' through congress, and avert 'a million years of worm eaten nothingness'. The title character is so laid back he's teetering, aided by Spinrad's ear for slick dialogue. His wonderful pre-emptive speech in the presence of political heavies about cutting to the chase through the standard smoke-filled room rhetoric and double talk schtick is side splitting. The 'near-future' setting is somewhat dated but this matters little against the searing satire and shamelessly wicked characters.

One thing I've noticed about all futuristic novels, is they never factor in different storage media, be it tape or floppy.

The hero, star of a TV show that's a cross between Nightline and Jerry Springer, uses his position in a high-stakes poker game of power, politics, and medical immortality. As can be expected, the references are outdated and Spinrad's vision of the near future from 1969 is hardly 20/20; the plot itself is somewhat linear and predictable. Nevertheless, Spinrad's extraordinarily vivid writing style, unique to this novel and almost Pynchon-esque in its imagery, make this novel one to reread over the years in order to resample the savor of the work. A must-read for television fans and critics alike"},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"Think \\"Bug Jack Barron\\" missed winning the Nebula Award the year it was published. Although some of Spinrad's short stories should have won the Nebula, this book was not Nebula material. There are a number of flaws in the book and it is extremely dated if read today, and several of the main characters seem to speak in the same way and in the same cadence.Even so, Spinrad is a remarable writer and almost anything he has written is worth reading. Barron was one of the new wave novels of the late sixties, early seventies and has a place in sf history. Spinrad's shorter works were the best in the field but his novels, I thought, never reached the high quality of his short stories, but they are still worth reading."},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"...this work was dated, it is dated in its language, it is dated in the world view that it presented, but it is perhaps most dated in presenting a \\"media\\" figure who has retained some morality and who refuses to completely sell out to the powers to be.In a nut shell, a once powerful leader of a left leaning political group has sold out his ideals, to become the host of the best rating current affairs show in America. By chance he is offered the chance to break a story on the most powerful corporate figure in America, a story which could change the fabric of America. Does he break the story, or does he accept the very attractive offer made by the corporate figure - after all wouldn't we all like to forever."},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"Within the world of science fiction, I suppose you could view me as both an aficionado and a practitioner. Given that dual citizenship, and the fact that not only my close friends but any number of passing acquaintances -- not to mention more than a few absolute strangers! -- have been either lent or given books from my collection, I occasionally find myself being asked about other genre writers, and where a novice would best begin exploring their works. (Yes, sometimes this is in the hope of sidelining my enthusiasm by making copious notes and then escaping on pretext of finding a bookstore, in lieu of buying me a drink. I'd like to believe that it is also, at least on select occasions, borne out of genuine interest.)Norman Spinrad is an author whose stories I've been asked about on numerous instances, by readers and aspiring young authors alike, and my advice has never wavered: Begin with BUG JACK BARON, and follow up with THE LAST HURRAH OF THE GOLDEN HORDE. You will then either want to read everything else you can find, or you will hurl imprecations at anyone who mentions Spinrad's name, within earshot.The physical version of this book occupies a permanent space upon my shelves."},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"Jack Barron is the prototype for Larry King/Ted Koppel.

Read it!"},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"This was probably a much better book back in its day. One of the problems with a lot of older stories is they're one-trick ponies. There's a single plot line and that's it. Over time readers have demanded more and more intricate and complex plots and subplots, and books that don't rise to that challenge seem dull in comparison. I think that's why it took so long for me to read Bug Jack Barron. You have Howards the rich evil guy trying to pull one over on America, and you have Barron the media celebrity with a direct line to the public standing in his way; and that's the whole of conflict in the entire story.So while an interesting read as far as seeing the ideas Spinrad had and the world he's created, unless you're going to pick this up just to check another off your 'classics' list, go with something fresher."},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"Not what I consider science fiction.

All in all a great story that will keep younger readers (and many older ones!) invoved to the end!"},{"Title":"A Plague of Sorcerers","review":"Though not the most gripping or imaginative tale of wizardry, \\"Plague of Sorcerers\\" is a nice read with some decidedly cute moments, nice twists, and a mystery that will keep readers guessing till the end.In a country of wizards ruled by a council of wizards, a boy Jermyn wants to become one more than anything else. An orphan living with his Aunt Merry, he struggles to perform magic and can't even attract a familiar. When a feud between his aunt and the snobby weather-wizard Fulke ends in a vicious curse, Jermyn sends Fulke back to his home, and by doing so attracts an animal. Except it isn't the cat that was expected, but a skunk. Jermyn reluctantly accepts the skunk Delia as his familiar.But the curse from Fulke has rendered Aunt Merry unable to do magic. She sends Jermyn to be apprenticed to the Theoretician Eschar, and for a while things seem to be working out fine. But then wizards begin to fall into strange magical comas, hideous weather threatens to destroy the city, and a malevolent Marquis from an anti-wizardry land seems to be connected to it all. Jermyn and Delia must uncover the truth about the magical plague before it's too late.Jermyn is the classic \\"bright kid who just doesn't work well under normal circumstances.\\" He has a lot of power, but it works under peculiar circumstances, usually under stress. Aunt Merry, Fulke, Eschar, and Eschar's pretty ward Meggan are a little less developed, but they are easily recognizable with individual personalities. Unusually endearing is Delia, with her baby-talk thoughts and willingness to spray anyone that she sees as being a threat to \\"Je'm'n.\\"The only problem, perhaps, is the pacing. Zambreno keeps pretty much the same pace throughout the book, regardless of the situation. She also needs to work a little on atmosphere. The descriptions are pretty average, while the humorous situations and dialogue are excellent. And, of course, her idea about a country that wizards emigrated to from a repressive homeland is brilliant. The mystery is twisted and well-written, with hints sprinkled through the book as to who the guilty party is, but readers probably won't guess who it is until the climax.A nice, suspenseful story for fans of wizards and mystery. Now, if only they'd bring \\"Journeyman Wizard\\" back into print..."},{"Title":"A Plague of Sorcerers","review":"\\"A Plague of Sorcerers\\" is an easy and fun read.

Coming from a magical family he is waiting for his familiar to appear so he can start his magical training. Sometimes he doubts that he has magic at all, but his aunt is convinced that he does. So she isn't surprised when his familiar finally appears. What she is surprised about is what type of animal Jermyn's familiar is - a skunk!I liked this book allot and I can't see why it got such low ratings. The plot makes sense, it has humor and good characters. Advice for 9-12 year olds who like fantasy: Read it."},{"Title":"A Plague of Sorcerers","review":"A quick look at the jacket will tell you that this is a book about a not so skilled apprentice wizard with a skunk familiar. He is different from all of the other children and is picked on a bit because of it. That may seem cliched, and there isn't much here that hasn't been done before, but I still enjoyed it. Apprentice wizards are my favorite thing to read about, and A Plague of Sorcerers delivers. The author puts us right in the midst of the action and doesn't let up. There is no introductory section about what the country is called, what every type of wizard does, who rules, and what the town looks like. I love it. All of the characters are interesting, and the mystery is enjoyable. There are a few twists as well and I wasn't able to figure out the bad guy, so points for that. While I enjoyed those things, I did have some issues. I may not be a fan introductory details, but I do like plenty of information that pertains to the characters and the plot. I think there could have been a bit more explanation of the types of wizards and the way spells work. The main character's master would mention things that I didn't understand, and they were never explored in more detail. I understand that it has value to the student, but it seemed pointless to mention it in the grand scheme of things. The characters are also a bit flat, but I expected that since this is mostly a mystery. I had no other issues, but there isn't enough depth to this story to make it more than ok. As others have said, there is nothing really special about it. A Plague of Sorcerers is just a fun mystery to occupy a bit of time."},{"Title":"A Plague of Sorcerers","review":"This has been my favorite book since I was twelve years old, and I continue to enjoy it every time I pick it up.Jermyn Graves is young man facing decisions about his career as a wizard - and since he has not yet called a familiar, it doesn't look too good. His aunt, who has raised him, believes strongly in his talent and schemes to help Jermyn release his power and find a familiar. But when it happens, she isn't pleased; who ever heard of a skunk for a familiar? The story that ensues is filled with excitement and mystery (including spells gone wrong, magical curses, and a strange plague that threatens to consume their entire city.)I think this is a well-crafted, page-turning story with very vivid characters and a highly imaginative world.

THANK YOU!!"},{"Title":"A Shropshire Lad","review":"Recently, I was appalled to discover that the top one hundred hits under the heading \\"A. E. Housman\\" do not disclose a single volume of his collected poetry to be in print, save for a ridiculously overpriced and bloated scholarly edition of interest only to plodding, dry-as-dust, doctoral candidates. This is a disgraceful state for one of the great poets of the turn of the Twentieth Century, one who in his miniaturist way was a peer of Elliott and Pound.Alfred Edward Housman was born in 1859. At Oxford, he was universally regarded as a high-flyer, an odds-on favorite to win a \\"First in Greats.\\" All went well until his final term in 1881, when he crashed and burned during a disastrous final examination. Not only did he fail to get his \\"First,\\" he managed to get his degree only after months of delay, and that was a lowly, utterly undistinguished \\"pass\\".Housman was, to say the least, not loquacious about his life. What seems to have happened was that he fell hopelessly, eternally, absurdly, romantically in love with one of his roommates, a stolidly athletic young man named Moses Jackson. Jackson, alas for Housman's hopes, proved to be inconveniently and irredeemably straight. Not long before the final examinations, Housman apparently declared his passion for Jackson, who seems politely, even kindly to have said something on the order of \\"No, thanks.\\" In cricket terms, Housman was \\"hit for six\\" and he never recovered to the day he died.Housman's expectations of an academic career went down in flames along with his \\"First.\\" He slunk away from Oxford to work in the Patent Office, where--surprise, surprise--Jackson was also working, although the latter drew a higher salary because of his better degree. For ten years Housman toiled in these unfertile fields while on the side he contributed learned articles on classical subjects to the leading scholarly journals.Such was the brilliance of the man that in 1892 he was unprecedentedly plucked directly from the academic sterility of the Patent Office to become Professor of Latin at London University College. In 1911, he moved up a very large notch to become a professor at Cambridge, a very unusual thing, then, for an Oxford man. He remained at Cambridge, recognized as one of the jewels in the University's crown, until he died.Housman remained quietly attached to Jackson, even through Jackson's marriage and after he moved thousands of miles away to live in Vancouver, British Columbia (where I am writing this). Housman became the godfather for one of Jackson's children. When Jackson was on his deathbed in 1923, Housman rushed to him a copy of his second book of poetry, \\"Final Poems,\\" so that Jackson might read it in his last hours. Jackson, of course, was the unnamed subject of some of the poems in that book, just as he had been in Housman's first, \\"A Shropshire Lad.\\"After Housman's death in 1936, his younger brother, the novelist Laurence Housman, rummaged through his papers and from them published the third slender volume of Housman' poetry, \\"More Poems.\\"Housman was not prolific. He seems to have worked in short, intense spurts of creativity no more than three or four times in his life. He devoted far more time and effort to his life-long magnum opus, a multi-volume critical edition and study of Manilius, a late Roman poet of truly breathtaking obscurity, dullness and unimportance. Housman appears to have had the very last word on Manilius, largely because it is hard to conceive that anyone else would care enough to add another. Housman's lasting fame rests on just three slender volumes of poetry, respectively 96, 71 and 66 pages in length.Housman is the bard of tiny, perfect, miniatures. He is always formal in structure. One critic quite acutely called him the last Roman poet. There are no sprawling epics in him, hardly any smiling pastorals. He writes in a fit of sustained and remarkably entertaining depression, a poetic equivalent of film noir.Here is Housman the Roman, writing of Britain's standing army of regular soldiers, all but destroyed in 1914:These, in the day when heaven was falling,The hour when earth's foundations fled,Followed their mercenary callingAnd took their wages and are dead.Their shoulders held the sky suspended;They stood, and earth's foundations stay;What God abandoned, these defended,And saved the sum of things for pay.(\\"Last Poems,\\" XXXVII)Here is Housman in gaudily Romantic despair:The Queen of air and darknessBegins to shrill and cry,\\"O young man, O my slayer,To-morrow you shall die.\\"O Queen of air and darkness,I think \`tis truth you say,And I shall die to-morrow;But you will die today.(\\"Last Poems,\\" III)And here is Housman in his first and most famous volume of poetry, \\"A Shropshire Lad\\":When I was one-and-twentyI heard a wise man say,\`Give crowns and pounds and guineasBut not your heart away;Give pearls away and rubiesBut keep your fancy free.'But I was one-and-twenty,No use to talk to me.When I was one-and-twentyI heard him say again,\`The heart out of the bosomWas never given in vain;\`Tis paid with sighs a plentyAnd sold for endless rue.'And I am two-and-twenty,And oh, \`tis true, \`tis true.(\\"A Shropshire Lad,\\" XIII)\\"A Shropshire Lad\\" was first published in 1896. \\"When I was one-and-twenty\\" was written in January 1895, at which time Housman was thirty-five and a professor of Latin. When Housman was twenty-one, though, he was an undergraduate at Oxford and sharing space with Moses Jackson. Despite the warnings he must have heard, he gave his heart away, no use to talk to him. When he was two-and-twenty, he paid with sighs a plenty and examination's rue, and oh, \`twas true, \`twas true.Housman was a great poet in a small package. Grab anything of his that you come across. He'll make it worth your while.Full five stars / For many a rose-lipt maiden / And many a lightfoot lad."},{"Title":"A Shropshire Lad","review":"Without getting too analytical of the poetry itself or the meaning of Housman's works, I will say that I throughly enjoy \\"A Shropshire Lad\\" many times over. Although Housman's words at times may seem a bit harsh or sometimes even depressing,he seems to speak from the heart and wisely about the cycle of life. The never ending scheme of things.The seasons and the earth changing year by year. Young men falling in love, going off to war, coming home wounded, dead, or finding their loves no longer want them. It brings to mind for me, the Peter, Paul and Mary song, \\"Where Have All The Flowers Gone\\".Although these words were first published well over 100 years ago, I found they are still most meaningful in today's world, as the cycle repeats. Many of the lines in this book I found to still be quoted today. For example in poem LVI-\\"The Day of Battle\\", he ponders this:\\"Comrade, if to turn and flyMade a soldier never die,Fly I would, for who would not?Tis sure no pleasure to be shotBut since the man that runs awayLives to die another day,And cowards' funerals, when they come,Are not wept so well at home,.........\\"All sixty-three original poems of \\"A Shropshire Lad\\" including XIX-\\"To An Athlete Dying Young\\"(which you've heard if you have seen the film \\"Out of Africa\\") are contained here. A wonderful book of poetry that knows no age. One that may be read often and aloud.Beautifully written,Enjoy...Laurie"},{"Title":"Fishes","review":"This title is actually one of the earliest in a very successful list of Golden Guides. It quickly brings the reader up to speed on the subject of insects in general and proceeds to lure him onward with fascinating information about each of the referenced insects in turn. When I arrived in New England, after an early childhood of city dwelling, my forays into woods and field, guidebook in hand, were some of the most educational times of my young life. I still have my original, ragged, copy of &quot;American Insects&quot; and treasure it."},{"Title":"Fishes","review":"Almost the first book on insects that I ever acquired was a hardbound edition of this little guide in the early 1950s. Indeed, I wore out several copies before I graduated to Lutz's \\"Field Book of Insects\\" and later more up to date guides. While a bit behind in modern systematics, this guide still has enchanting pictures, mostly the same ones I poured over during my childhood. It was here I first caught the insect \\"bug\\" that eventually propelled me into a career in biological sciences. Zim's early \\"Golden Guide to Insects\\" was a magic carpet into the fantastic world of insects and I think that it must still be luring young people to at least appreciate the six-legged crowd. I know that the images in this book are still burned into my brain, especially that of the beautiful buckeye butterfly and the various horned scarab and carrion beetles.I highly recommend this book for children as a first insect book, but I sort of wish they had kept the original yellow cover!"},{"Title":"Fishes","review":"This book is the best first step into the fascinating world of insects even after all those years.

You'll find it hard to stop reading once you'll get into it. Colorful illustrations are superbs. Many insects are illustrated beside their larva stage and typical environment wich is great.

Outstanding as a field guide, the photos are excellent, and often include inset photos of larvae. Handy ID notes right on the photos point out details of the insect to make identification easier. A photo Table of Contents will help you zero right in on the order of the insect in question. This is not the only bug book I have, but by far the most used. Though featuring insects of all of North America, each photo and description tell you the range so you know if the insect you are questioning is even in your area. If you even have a mild interest in insects, this makes a great \\"picture book\\" to peruse, but for those who are seriously interested in ID'ing and learning it is an indispensable tool."},{"Title":"Fishes","review":"This is the first book I remember owning.

I'd give it five stars."},{"Title":"Fishes","review":"These Golden books have changed little over the years but there is little need to. They provide an inexpensive guide for kids and adults in a pocket size that often proves more usefull than larger, more expensive versions.

This book was my introduction to entomology, and I still remember how much fun the book was to use 40 years later, and how much I learned from it.Some people have criticized the exclusive use of drawings and paintings rather than color photographs in the guides, but when these were first being printed back in the late 40s and early 50s, color photo reproduction was still quite an expensive printing process, and keeping the guides cheap and affordable was a major consideration.I was led to buy many other Golden Guides, and still have several dozen of these guides in my library over 40 years later as the collection has too much sentimental value for me to throw out. As the series branched out and expanded, the subjects became more specialized, such as Landforms (an intro to structural geology, following up on the success of Rocks and Minerals and Geology),The Heart (actually somewhat technical for a Golden Guide), and Non-Flowering Plants (again, quite a respectable level of technical detail for such a supposedly basic book). And there were at least two more books on insects and arachnids that I know of, which were Insect Pests, and Spiders and their Relatives, which followed up on the popularity of the first Insects book.The series was edited by the late, great Herbert S. Zim, who wrote something like 90 books during his career and edited about as many as he'd written. It's a little gem of nature writing just as with all the other early guides like Birds, Mammals, The Seashore, and so on. These terrific little guides were the first windows into the wonders of our natural world and planet for millions of young readers, and like several of the other reviewers here, it led me into undergrad and grad school in a biological area. I know there are other series out there for young people but I hope these books are still in print so new generations of young readers can enjoy them too."},{"Title":"Fishes","review":"I really enjoy Golden Guide books from St. Martin Press. They have been around for a long time where I enjoyed their small, colorful illustrative books as a child. It is fairly accurate in illustations and a brief description of the various insects that can be found. For those children who enjoy science and the curiousity of insects, this book is handy and a nice presentation of introducing them to the world of insects."},{"Title":"Relics","review":"The unearthing of an ancient sacrificial site leads to a lot of ominous happenings and gruesome deaths. Relentless gore-- a person or animal is disemboweled about every thirty pages with clockwork regularity. Despite the onslaught of weird goings-on and the rash of mutilation deaths in this small town, the inhabitants do not seem unduly alarmed and, in fact, DO NOT EVEN TAKE ORDINARY PRECAUTIONS, resulting in people wandering around alone for a mysterious entity to kill them off one by one (!!!). Is this normal in Britain? I read the FORTEAN TIMES, which is full of inexplicable events, but they aren't so commonplace as to not raise an alarm, but I've never been to that country, so what do I know? The fact that mysterious stone tablets seem to have unearthly (and possibly deadly) properties does not deter an archeologist from deciphering its ancient script. There are also two or three false alarm scares, just like a bad horror movie. On the plus side, Hutson only uses the word \\"fusty\\" once..."},{"Title":"Relics","review":"This was the first ever book i read of Shaun's, followed by Slugs and Breeding Ground, I have to say that I am absolutely hooked on his books, this one in particular was superb to read, had some very shocking moments in it, in fact some very very very shocking moments in it.

A relative read this book to my children because she found it so funny but my 6-year-old told me later that the book made her feel \\"sad\\" and that the \\"mommy didn't like her kids.\\" The story is about the mom being annoyed by her kids who were trying to share their accomplishments her. Their efforts were ill-timed on her part and she shows no tolerance for such. In fact she seems to show contempt for their efforts to connect with her. There are much better ways to address a parent's need for time away from their children. From a child's perspective, this book is just not right. I would not recommend reading this book to kids."},{"Title":"Five Minutes' Peace","review":"I used to read this book to my kids, and have now bought it to share with my granddaughter.

It will be all too soon, when I may be a grandma, and saying the same thing, or most likely, my kids will be bringing my grand babies over, and saying, \\"just give me 10 minutes mom\\"!

Based on reviews I had read,I thought this was a Mother's Day book. Cute story, but I didn't like that the Mom wanted time away from the kids. She seemed annoyed with them.

Not a story I would read at a preschool."},{"Title":"Five Minutes' Peace","review":"I had this book when I had 3 small children and not much help around the house and worked full time.

All stay-at-home moms or dads can relate to this story. My children couldn't understand why I liked it so much until they were older. I can't understand the one review that thinks it shows such disrespect. The story is so funny! It is so true! It is exaggerated, but that makes it all the funnier. The children (though elephants) are children, and act like children. They can't understand why their mother would want to have 5 minutes away from them. Don't we all feel like that sometimes!

This book does one truly amazing thing, it makes a child laugh."},{"Title":"Five Minutes' Peace","review":"My husband and I each have a fairly good sense of humour. So does our 3 year old. We love sharing books, especially funny ones. But this one didn't do it for us. In a home where we practise respect for each other while setting firm, loving boundaries, the mother in this book came across as weak, unfair, inconsistent towards, and contemptuous of her children. Not to mention far from being a fun, kind mom. We just got the impression she hated her life and her family. The concept had so much potential (don't we moms all need a break!), but this was very poorly delivered. Don't understand the positive reviews at all. These reviewers must not be exposed to very many good childrens books. There is nothing for us to enjoy about this book, aside from the artwork. It was a gift from my well-meaning mother-in-law, but we promptly passed it on."},{"Title":"Five Minutes' Peace","review":"I don't understand all the positive reviews for this book. It goes against so much of the parenting we practice in our house. First of all, the mother, Mrs. Large, says something we'd consider hurtful in our house--she says she wants a bath \\"Because I want five minutes' peace from all of YOU.\\" The artwork shows a really cross mom looking at sad, hurt little kids.Then, to top that off, the pattern of the book is that the mother lets the kids walk all over her. She asks them to stay downstairs and they don't (no consequences from the mom). When interrupted in her bath, she asks her older son to limit his interruption to one song, then he plays it over three times (no consequences from the mom). She asks her daughter to read one page, and her daughter reads five (no consequences from the mom). All the while, Mrs. Large looks more and more frustrated, and more and more the \\"pity-me\\" victim.Finally, fed up with the kids trying to be with her and not listening to her, she leaves the bathroom and again (angry looking while her kids look sad) says \\"I want five minutes' peace from all of YOU.\\"Seriously, this book is a twisted view of how we should communicate and treat our kids--and a really sad portrayal of how some moms think they're the victim of their own kids, when really all the kids want is clear communication, fairness, and respect. If you don't want your kids to treat you like a doormat, don't *be* a doormat...and certainly, don't get angry at your kids because you've taught them you ARE a doormat.If you're looking for a book with this same theme, but not nearly so troubling, try \\"The Seven Silly Eaters.\\" There, too, the mother gets stressed and overworked by her kids, but there isn't passive aggressive nastiness in that book...and in the end the children learn how to help out."},{"Title":"Five Minutes' Peace","review":"This book will make any parent laugh. Mrs. Large is a lovable and relatable character and kids love this book because of the imagery of the animals in the bath."},{"Title":"Five Minutes' Peace","review":"I had this book read to me a lot as a child, it was one of my mother's favorites. She'd laugh along with it - very much relating to the mother in the book.As a child, I saw that the mother wanted peace and quiet, the kids made the mother upset. In my waking memory, roughly the third time the book was read - I saw that my mother really identified with the mother, and saw how much the mother wanted to get away from the children, and how much the mother didn't enjoy having the children around most of the time - even though all is well in the end - and because my mother liked this book so much, I came to realize that perhaps my mother didn't like having her children (us) around very much.I don't think this is a good book for parents to read to their children a lot. Perhaps once or twice, but too many times, your child will get the impression that children, and children doing what they do best, are unwelcome and unwanted - which is not what a child should feel in relation to their parents.To parents, the book may be entertaining and well intentioned, but children take things too literally and personally, and may ultimately be hurt by the book."},{"Title":"Five Minutes' Peace","review":"I thought this book was going to be funny and then at the end have the realization that it's nice to be around the kids, but it didn't do that. I was going to give it as part of a gift of a bunch of books, but when I read the whole thing I decided not to. Pass on this one."},{"Title":"Five Minutes' Peace","review":"All mothers will easily be able to relate to Mrs. Large.

Finally she has had enough, and goes downstairs \\"where she had three minutes and forty-five seconds of peace before they all came to join her.\\"Mrs. Large and her family are all elephants, which causes for some absolutely wonderful drawings. My favorite is probably when she is sitting in the bathtub, sipping tea, while wearing a yellow flowered shower cap. The pictures in general are really cute, colorful and expressive. The story is told in a very straightforward, endearing manner. In my opinion, this is a great book.Loggie-log-log-log"},{"Title":"Five Minutes' Peace","review":"Has a plot that EVERY mother will know all too well.

What a gift! It was a huge hit for the whole family! It made me laugh because it captured my exasperation with mothering toddlers in an honest and humorous way. My girls loved Jill Murphy's amusing illustrations and the funny chaos that the Large kids create. And most importantly, they were able to empathize with Mrs. Large. Woo hoo! It gave us the perfect set up to teach our kids that parents need breaks too (and that even a shortened break of 3 minutes and 45 seconds is a welcome respite to refuel the zapped energy!)"},{"Title":"Five Minutes' Peace","review":"I love to give this book to new mothers.

I'm very happy. Very Good reference book. thanks"},{"Title":"A Shakespeare Glossary","review":"The original version of this glossary, done by C.T. Onions, was certainly a landmark publication. Indeed, there are some things in it (not many) which over the years I have discovered Eagleson has unaccountably omitted in his revised version. On the whole, Eagleson does, however, offer quite a bit of extra material, though the claims made on this score by both the publisher and some reviewers seem to me exaggerated (and I have used Onions's text and Eagleson side by side for many years).How good is the present compendium for today's purposes? Certainly very good for what it does within its limits, but those limits are significant. By now there have, for example, been a good many books proving the existence of bawdy puns and various related kinds of slang within Shakespeare, and for proper understanding of that author a glossary should certainly explain such Elizabethan usages. In common with *The Oxford English Dictionary* (for which Onions did a great deal of important work), *A Shakespeare Glossary* is - and remains even in its present form - largely silent and uninformative on these matters, with the result that modern readers who look up a word suspecting that it may have a bawdy sense now no longer current will find themselves almost always frustrated (in strictly scholarly terms!).Such readers will have to turn to e.g. Eric Partridge's *Shakespeare's Bawdy*, which remains invaluable, but is itself coming to look less than complete now that we know so much more, perhaps especially since the publication of Gordon Williams's *A Dictionary of Sexual Language and Imagery in Shakespearean and Stuart Literature* (expensive and not easy to use, but a real mine of information).Despite these reservations I would still recommend the Onions-Eagleson glossary as a worthwhile component on &quot;the Shakespeare shelf&quot;. It should be added - but this is not a fault of the volume - that in many cases a modern reader is simply not AWARE that a word in Shakespeare does not mean what it means today, and therefore will not look it up in any glossary or dictionary. This makes detailed well-annotated volumes such as are published with the New Cambridge, Oxford, and Arden series (or the one-volume Bevington Shakespeare) essential for anyone wishing to understand what he or she is reading: in such editions, the necessary glosses are volunteered by editors who ARE aware of the fact that many words have changed in meaning since Shakespeare's time . - Joost Daalder, Professor of English, Flinders University, South Australia"},{"Title":"A Shakespeare Glossary","review":"If you are a reader, actor or spectator of Shakespeare you must have this book. It is an indispensable guide to the speech and hidden meanings of Shakespeare's words. I especially stress the hidden meanings aspect of the glossary--- a feature you may not find in a footnoted version of the play. This glossary also allows for a fast reference to finding a word in any Shakespeare play. A word will have the meaning and examples of the when it is used in a play. This comes in handy when trying to locate a quotation or a scene. The binding is sturdy and the book is easy to carry and reference to. There is no reason not to have this book if you love Shakespeare.

Anyone woman who's ever identified with smart, sexy and somewhat overweight Loretta and her seemingly hopeless crush on a co-worker who is not only sexy but also one of the few remaining truly nice guys on the planet will find herself cheering. But the two New Jersey &quot;Jump Squad&quot; officers soon have more to worry about than being caught making out in an empty cell at the Parole unit... When the usual hilarious plot complications set in, Marvelli is sent on assignment to San Franciso, but instead of taking Loretta with him, his partner is the ultimate sex vixen, Elvissa Mylowe. Loretta, wracked with jealous insecurity (can we relate?), decides to call in sick, don a wig and follow the two to San Francisco. There the story twists and snakes down into the more sordid and bizarre aspects of SF's extremely alternative sex scene, as the three pursuers race to track down cruel and creepy Ira Krupnick, crook-turned-gourmet-ice-cream-manufacturer, who's screwing two women--Dorrie, his business partner's wife,and Sunny (one very hard-hearted dominatrix with a well-trained, vicious dog and a fully equippped S&amp;M dungeon). The plot is as rich as the book's title, and the pace is fast: I ate -- er, read-- it all in one sitting--and a single paragraph can travel from sadistically sordid to funny to painful to heartwrenching.

In other words - if you are serious buy Addison-Wesley or Prentice-Hall books - do not buy SAMS!The book attempt to do two things at once: 1. To introduce gaming to the amateur. 2. To introduce DirectX 1.0 (presently at version 7.0)For the amateur the book is not appropriate, because it is assumed that the reader knows MFC and windows programming beforehand. It is not good for the professional either, because a lot of pages is used telling how to use painting and sound utilities that come for free. Everybody knows that.It *does* introduce directX, but only fairly briefly and in conjunction with lengthly code examples and a code library supplied in the book. Much of the directX introduction is merely a alphabetical listing of API functions that is just as clearly written in the on-line help.I *could* run the code examples (at least those that I tried), although this required some minor editing. I ran them under DirectX using Watcom 11.0. It is not fair to expect code to compile directly out of a book as C++ is not entirely portable. All non-portable code should have been left out of the book, though."},{"Title":"Windows 95 Game Developers Guide Using the Game Sdk","review":"The code doesn't run well and the games only run full-screen, 8 bit.

Out of all of them the only one I found that covered playing MIDI files was this book. This was a godsend. The class, covered in chapter 17, is called CMIDIStream. Playing a midi file seems to be horribly complex even with windows multimedia functions. This book provides you a class and enough documentation to get you started to put midi playing functionality into your game. The class itself isn't wonderfully implimented, but its a START and at least it works. Also, something that really threw me of when trying to use it was that midi files need to be converted into MSU format by the MID2STRM program provided at www.microsoft.com. (do a search).

This was code right out of the book, no changes.If this book taught about directx, it would still be useful, even if the code didn't work properly. But it isn't about directx.

Yes, there were some innovative ideas in the book. Several of them were downright clever. Maybe four or 5 were worth trying. That's about all I have good to say.The book does list over 50 ways to pay paintball. What it doesn't say (until you get the book) is that half of those are repeats of the same things. For example it explains some of the basic games such as capture the flag with two teams or elimination (free for all). That's good. It then counts variations such as \`capture the flag with three teams' or \`team elimination' (two teams) or \`elimination with 3 teams'. The book goes on and basically repeats the same thing over, stating what anyone who is old enough to play paintball could figure out on their own. Another example is a description of downed pilot (with no gun) and then one of \`downed pilot: armed variant' where the pilot gets a gun.The author has a rambling style that makes a lot of the book just \`fluff', and manages to turn a game description that should take two lines (i.e. this game is exactly like downed pilot except the pilot gets a gun) into a page or two. There are even places in the book that the author outright admits that he has never tried the game (or anyone he knows), but thinks it would be fun.In short, there is not a lot new here and a 62 page book is really just 10 pages worth of material stretched out six times longer than needs be."},{"Title":"50+ Ways to Play with Your Paintballs","review":"This is a decent book, but below my expectations.

It not only explain how to develop a application, but also how you do your HELP-system, the plugin update mechanism, dynamic plugins, brand and package your application. Also chapter 25 called 'The last mile' explain Native Installers, Webstart and multi user install scenario. SO:it explains the whole cycle, for creating windows/views, creating the help, and distributing the application!* It offers a tutorial for building a real world application what the authors have called Hyperbola (a Chat client). This tutorial has a good level, compared to books like '... for dummies', '... in 24 hours' and '... unleashed'.* The tutorial application EVOLVES over the chapters. So after the end of every chapter the application is running, and more (complex) functionality is added every chapter. So you don't need to follow all chapters before you see results of your work (it's not a big bang application). This keep you motivated to follow the book and play arround.Or how the authors call it in the book:\\"The next few chapters focus on iteratively developing Hyperbola. This next interation is interesting because it allows you to quickly get something running you can show to your mom, your boss, or your friends. It's also a lot more fun to learn RCP while developing something concrete.\\"* Every chapter starts with the goals of this chapter,e.g. what you will add to the application in this chapter.* This book does NOT contains cheap fillers (some books repeat things endless, starts with chapters introducing Java, prints the Java Doc of a library,etc.). It is simply to the point.* The tutorial is very complete and contains a lot of explaination about what you're doing. It is not one big listing. E.g. it explain what Actions are, what you can do with it, where to code them, and of course how to code them in your Hyperbola application.* It is very complete because it e.g. starts how to install Eclipse and the Eclipse RCP SDK and how you need to configure them. This is a real timesaver for novice Eclipse people. You just need to follow the steps in the introduction chapter.So this is a learning-by-doing book with a good level.

It explains the structure of the RCP very well, as well as I have seen anywhere. Parts I, III, IV and V are excellent.This is a great introduction to Eclipse RCP ... _IF_ you are happy to stay with Eclipse 3.1 and Java 1.4. _BUT_ sadly, Eclipse 3.2 has obsoleted some of the techniques used in Part II, the tutorial, which is the main part of the book. For in 3.2 example you no longer need to create a target manually yourself. Also the tutorial's code uses APIs that are deprecated in Eclipse 3.2, and it uses code seen as undesirable by Java 1.5's generics support. In addition Eclipse 3.2 mandates the com.ibm.icu (International Components for Unicode) package which means that the tutorial as delivered simply will not deploy as-is when you get to the packaged product level in Chapter 9.Yes, all these problems are fixable. But be careful because you will have to fix these problems manually, which cuts you off from the cool \\"Samples Manager\\" tool which synchronizes your code at the end of each chapter."},{"Title":"Eclipse Rich Client Platform: Designing, Coding, and Packaging Java Applications","review":"This book starts out in a very promising manner - coming in from a 10,000 ft view to a 1,000 ft view. After reading Part I, I felt that I had a great book in my hands. With Part II however came the big let down: you're suddenly dropped into a chaotic sea of microscopic views. With its (basically laudable) approach by example, it turns essentially into a collection of recipes, that does very little to the understanding of the underlying structure and concepts of RCP. This is probably a great book if you know what you want to do and why, it is however inadequate if you are in search of the why. It leaves too many loose ends, and in numerous instances assumes that you have fully absorbed the superficial ideas of earlier sections and hence leaves you hanging there. Calling the CD to the rescue - again a great idea how it is integrated - does not always help: for instance Chapter 10 seems to be totally messed up. The text and examples contain a number of misleading typos or omissions, and references are given to Eclipse code that I could not find.In hindsight I sense that much of the frustration with Part II could be avoided by starting with Parts III and IV: after working through these latter parts, I felt more at ease filling out the unfortunate and time consuming gaps in Part II.I suspect also that both the code and the book will need to be updated for release 3.2."},{"Title":"Eclipse Rich Client Platform: Designing, Coding, and Packaging Java Applications","review":"Good book, except..., the code samples are embedded in a plugin that only works with Eclipse 3.1.

This results in compile errors until you manually debug the code.Some are just irritating, as their Ch 12 sample code not including the login code developed in the previous chapter. This causes a NullPointerException in ContactsView.Or their Ch 16 drag-and-drop that doesn't drop until you manuallly make extension point IDs match.Operationally, their IM example relies on a server at their book site.Over the several weeks I was using their book, their server was down. Fortunately, our company has an accessble XMPP server, else I could not have run their examples.And fortunately folks on the book's forum were helpful.So with some debugging, I was able to run most of their examples.DO buy this book if the above don't trouble you.Their example is broken into manageable chunks. There appear to be no major gaps in their progression. Their example code is clear and concise, if buggy. And their writing is clear, concise, and complete.Also, their book thoroughly covers plug-in management and updating, and the use of OSGi.For more on this saga, go to the book's Web site, [...], and look at the forum entries.Would I buy this book again?

The authors have done a splendid job of creating a technical book that serves well as both a tutorial and as a reference.Through the development of a single example, the book covers everything you need to get started building and packaging an Eclipse RCP application. The book even includes a CD containing all the software you'll need to work through the tutorials and build your own RCP applications.While a single book could never describe every aspect of the Eclipse Platform, this book is certainly all you need to get started with Eclipse RCP, and then once you've found your feet, there are other books in the Eclipse Series that will help expand your knowledge of the Eclipse Platform and Eclipse plug-in development.This book has been produced extremely well: The text is well written, the pages are full of easy to follow code snippets, and there are sidebars that share best practices and handy tips, as well as plenty of good quality screen shots and diagrams.Buy this book.

Found here: [...]. And I've decided to read this book again with errata. So I change my rating to 3 stars. I'll not give them 4 or 5 stars; because their sloppy work cost my valuable time. They had enough time for an error-free version before the 2nd edition.for ERRATA: [...]MY OLD COMMENT for 1 star.Even the authors promise to follow Galileo (Eclipse 3.5) release, the book does not follow Galileo. The very first class of the RCP example project Hyberbola, namely the Application class, implements IApplication.run() which is obsolete. New release should implement start() and stop() methods instead. The screen shots of wizard dialogs in this book, does not follow the actual wizard dialogs of Galileo.

It is well written and easy to comprehend. The chapters follow a logical sequence and I particularly like the way that \\"Notes\\" and \\"Tips\\" clarify and support the rest of the material.My team is in the later stages of implementing a Rich Client product, and \\"Eclipse Rich Client Platform\\" has helped us with both small details and broad concepts. We referenced it extensively when creating and debugging an automated build (Chapter 24), adding Update Actions to our product (Chapter 14) and Reporting Status (Chapter 17). Although we took the \\"tossed salad\\" approach to using the book it also works very well as a step by step tutorial. You don't need to be a Java guru or Eclipse expert to understand the book, yet it is still useful for the relative beginner.The last time I wrote in praise of a book, it was to JRR Tolkien for Lord of the Rings. I distribute my praise sparingly and this book deserves it."},{"Title":"Eclipse Rich Client Platform: Designing, Coding, and Packaging Java Applications","review":"I bought this book because online references for this material are woefully inadequate and just plain outdated. Every resource I could find said this is THE BOOK to get to get a thorough walk-through on the technology. I bit and shelled out the $$$ for the book. The first few chapters are okay, if not really engaging. They give an \\"okay\\" review of the platform and how it works, if you can overlook them constantly tooting their own horn about how great the Eclipse IDE is (the application that led to the development of the Eclipse RCP).I was looking forward to building the application the book uses to teach the technology, an instant message client they call \\"Hyperbole\\". I figured once we started development, things would get exciting.The problems began in Chapter 3. The walkthrough of how to create a \\"Target platform\\" bore no resemblance to what needed to be done in the IDE. I knew that the IDE had gone through a version or two since this book was published--only in May, for crying out loud--so I tried to struggle through. It was hopeless. There is no way to resolve what was described in the book with what the IDE contains.Skipping that, since it was optional anyway, I sallied forth to the following chapters. Resolving the differences between the current version of the IDE and what the book contained was still troublesome, but I was able to figure out what the author(s) meant and create the initial application. I actually got the application running, but then it all fell apart in Chapter 5. One of the first tasks is to create a \\"View\\". I was able to add the view as described in the book, but it failed to show in the application. Debugging it was fruitless since the platform changes the fundamentals of how applications operate.Either the platform totally changed or the book is wrong. Checking the online errata was fruitless: the book does have some errata, but nothing addresses this problem. And that's where it stands. I unable (and unwilling) to progress any more through this this book simply because it's too frustrating.But I'm not the only one who found this technology (and book) frustrating: several co-workers met with the same problems and are confounded by the unreliable information on the Internet about this technology. Either this book needs to be updated for the numerous changes in the IDE, or RCP needs to settle down and stop changing so much, or both.I DO NOT recommend this book as a guide for the Eclipse RCP, despite the fact it is hailed as THE BIBLE of this technology."},{"Title":"Eclipse Rich Client Platform: Designing, Coding, and Packaging Java Applications","review":"Eclipse Rich Client Platform is an excellent book for both introduction to Eclipse RCP, and for the more experienced programmer.They take a tutorial approach to introducing Eclipse RCP, and describe the building of an Instant Messaging client as an RCP application. This works very well, as it allows the reader to connect their own application-level needs to the mechanisms that RCP provides.Then they shift gears and discuss user interface concepts like the Workbench, Perspectives, Views, Editors, Actions, etc more abstractly, so that the reader can get a very thorough understanding of the main patterns and concepts in the APIs available to Eclipse RCP client applications. Finally they discuss development and deployment processes made possible by the basic plugin model, the update mechanisms, and product configurations.The authors do an excellent job of making RCP accessible for the uninitiated, while still presenting plenty of details for the more experienced RCP developer."},{"Title":"Eclipse Rich Client Platform: Designing, Coding, and Packaging Java Applications","review":"I'm only on chapter 4 but this seems to be a really great book so far. I am giving a 5 rating because I'm not finished reading it and I cannot leave the field blank -- and the average rating is 5.I'm adding this review as a warning for Windows 98 Java programmers: Eclipse 3.1 and above appears to crash on Windows 98, constantly.Previously I had no problems whatsoever running and developing on Eclipse 2.x on Windows 98. After buying the book I started using Eclipse 3.1.0, installed from the book's CD and thought perhaps the Eclipse feature on the book's CD was causing the Java crashes. But now I believe there are bugs in Eclipse from 3.1 and later that are causing the crashes. From bug reports on eclipse.org it appears it may be SWT and not the core runtime that is the problem, but I can't be sure.Today, Feb. 17, 2006, I uninstalled Eclipse 3.1.0 and tried the latest stable build from eclipse.org, 3.2M5. I still have crashes, within minutes of using eclipse.This makes me worry that I can't create an RCP app to run on Windows 98, a common platform.If you are running Windows 98 as a development platform, I suggest you reconsider using Eclipse 3.1 and above for a while until this is resolved. If you are on another platform, consider that you might not be able to deploy to Windows 98 until this problem is resolved by the Eclipse development community.This book however, is not at fault. It is quite a gold mine of information."},{"Title":"Eclipse Rich Client Platform: Designing, Coding, and Packaging Java Applications","review":"The book look like it has some promise.

On a quick thumb-through in the bookstore this book seemed about as good as any, but I particularly liked that they application they proposed to build as part of the learning process was something that incorporated many key aspects of most RCP projects -- UI, network, database, etc.Up through chapter 3 it does a fair job of bootstrapping you into an Eclipse IDE, target, and plug-in development environment to where you can, by typing in the example code, and, skulling around to figure out the parts they left out, get the initial though as yet useless client to come up. Once you get past that initial section, however, you're basically on your own as they start to leave out more and more of critical parts. Oh, you can load each \\"stage\\" of the application from the CD provided with the book, but understanding how you got from one incomplete stage to the next is harder when you're just looking at someone else's code, rather than building it up yourself.If you never intend to build your own RCP, it's probably as good as any other book. If, however, you want something that gets down to nuts and bolts, makes you get your hands dirty with code, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Eclipse Rich Client Platform: Designing, Coding, and Packaging Java Applications","review":"The authors describe how Eclipse is growing in ways perhaps not foreseen to its earlier designers and users. Eclipse is of course a powerful Integrated Development Environment, and other books in this series have comprehensively explained it as such. But here, we see a relatively new aspect to Eclipse.In detail, it is explained how Eclipse can function as a framework for making a user interface program (the \\"client\\") with sophisticated (\\"rich\\") functionality. For you, the programmer, there are ways to plug your project-specific code into Eclipse. Why? The payoff is that Eclipse offers a lot of useful code, perhaps best described as plumbing, to do a lot of the routine stuff common to many UI programs.To be sure, there are numerous details about how to do this. Not trivial. Which accounts for the length of the book. But, with just moderate experience as a Java programmer, the narrative should be comprehensible.The basic idea in the book is that you gain two advantages by using Eclipse in this fashion. You get more productivity, by not having to code common and mundane functionality. Plus, debugging may be easier. Because the Eclipse code is very solid and well tested. And hence you can focus debugging attention on your specific code."},{"Title":"Eclipse Rich Client Platform: Designing, Coding, and Packaging Java Applications","review":"This book starts off really well, but becomes tougher to follow along with the sample project as they simply highlight pieces of the code rather than walking through the changes. The authors understand RCP very well and provide some unique insight only possible from those involved in creating Eclipse RCP. However, this benefit is overshadowed by the difficulty in getting the sample code to work. There are many discrepancies in the sample code available online when compared to the sample code in the book (likely due to changes from edition 1 to edition 2). Also, using the latest available versions of Eclipse are going to cause lots of headaches. Overall, I found I spent more time trying to figure out why the sample code wasn't working then I spent learning RCP. Get ready to spend lots of time searching for missing plug-ins, trying to determine how the APIs have changed, etc.The sad thing is, this is the best resource I could find.

Part I and II look like a tutorial, but the rest of the book goes far beyond. First, you will create a chat application, adding views, editors, actions, help, integrating a third party library... The style is clear, and the progression is logical. API details are left for Part III, where RCP indispensable components are discussed, and that is where the simple tutorial ends.Part IV introduces more advanced features like p2, dynamic plug-ins, product configurations for various platforms, testing... I found that this part required more thinking than the rest of the book, but it is invaluable if you aim at making a professional application. The last part is a reference about Eclipse and OSGi.If you plan to make an Eclipse RCP application, if you have some interest in it or in Eclipse plug-ins, if you just like the Eclipse IDE, this book is for you. You'll learn a lot about the Eclipse architecture, and you will learn it the easy way. I also own another book of the Eclipse Series, Eclipse Plug-ins, 3rd Edition, which I enjoyed a lot.

This was an especially important concept since most RCP applications are doing just tha -- putting a UI on top of a service.

Action and Commands. A chapter has been added to discuss the newer Commands API, as well as their differences with Actions.3. Installing and Updating with P2. More p2 information4. PDE build. PDE Build is one of the more error-prone and time consuming aspects of working with Eclipse products. (It's also powerful and useful. This chapter is completely reworked. Lots of clarification as well as updated information.5. Testing. A new chapter on testing an RCP application. A great addition to the book.6.

I was not looking forward to the drudgery and complexity of building all the required infrastructure over OSGI to build an actual product - what a wonderful discovery to see this gleaming system with smoothly integrated parts ready to do my bidding!The authors make the apt analogy of launching a payload into space - so much of the work goes into the launch vehicle and ground control,etc, whereas to the payload designer the only interesting work is at the very tip of the rocket. As software developers we love generating the cool idea (the payload) and are not so excited about the other 90% which makes the real product - complex UI workflows, help, update, packaging, etc. Eclipse provides all the mechanisms and plenty of automated assistance for putting together your total system.Perhaps you will find some disparities between the book and your downloaded version of Eclipse (I haven't yet) but this is not Visual Basic, this is a relatively deep but elegantly designed system which does require a certain level of understanding before you really get cooking with it, but this book does an excellent job with that.

This is only the second IT book I have actually enjoyed reading, and working through the project was great. The authors have been quite systematic in their approach for presenting all you might reasonably want to know for developing and delivering an RCP based application.My only criticism, and it is more a criticism of Java than of the book, is that really this book isn't enough... You would need an equivalent book on JFace, SWT, Spring, Hibernate...Although the example in this book was great fun (a fully working chat client) and the principles learnt can be generally applied, its a shame the example was a 'one off', i.e. a chat client is a chat client. It may have been better if the project had used Hibernate or something similar - which would have provided a better foundation for a far wider range of projects. However, I guess the authors wisely avoided doing that, since they may well have got embroiled in all kinds of things outside the main purpose of the book.So although I enjoyed the book, it did confirm to me that Java is still the wrong language. I have always avoided learning it in the past since all the projects I have known to use it have all suffered very low productivity rates - and the end results haven't always been that pretty. Eclipse RCP does a lot to remedy that, so my conclusion is: if you already know Java, read this book.

The novel allows the reader to dive again deep into Alexandrian life and see everything what happens already in \\"Justine\\" from a different angle.Darley, the narrator, still living in seclusion on the remote Greek Island, has sent the story (i.e. Justine) to one of the Alexandrian friends, Balthazar, the Jewish, gay doctor interested in philosophy and theology, initiator of the Kabbalah group, suspected of spying activity. Balthazar during his short visit on the island gives Darley the manuscript back together with a substantial amount of notes, which (with Darley's comments) are reconstituted in this volume. Darley was prompted to add a lot of the notes, as, reflecting upon them, he realized that despite his doubts, expressed in \\"Justine\\", many things he took for granted are completely different than he thought.Balthazar sees the events described in \\"Justine\\" from his own point of view, and, having often more information or just different sources than Darley, his versions of events add to or change the descriptions from the first volume. New characters are introduced, and those, who were merely mentioned or hinted upon (Pursewarden, Mountolive, Leila, Narouz), become central, and their preoccupations and emotions are at the first plane. These shifts, instead of clarifying things that were blurred and mysterious in \\"Justine\\" make the narrative even more slippery and allusive. New avenues open for each event, tales within tales are discovered, which need their own explanation, and the atmosphere is even more dreamy... The motivations of ome characters, especially Nessim, seem to change completely from what Darley perceived, as new events are revealed. The search for the truth obviously cannot end here, so the reader needs to proceed to \\"Mountolive\\".Alexandria becomes even more of a main character in this novel, and definitely the one with the strongest and versatile personality. Most of the other characters, struck by destructive love (again the analysis of love is one of the main themes, although the secret service intrigue gets more momentum), are impressionable, prone to spontaneous, sudden behaviors, and transient. The climactic event, as the hunting party was in Justine, is this time the carnival ball, where the reader roams the streets together with the characters in disguise... and is a witness to another death.\\"Balthazar\\" is even more full of aphorisms than \\"Justine\\" - there seems to be a sentence for any occasion, and whereas the generalizations of love may appear trivial, childish even, the truths about literature and theoretical background of Durrell's enterprise to create a novel which would reflect its times, are amazingly formulated and put into the mouth of the surprising number of the writer characters (look especially for what Pursewarden has to say).In summary, this is another delightful volume, different than \\"Justine\\" and only giving the reader the appetite for more of Durrell's Alexandria!"},{"Title":"Balthazar","review":"As I read the second of Durrell's Alexandria Quartet, I first looked for another focus. (I had been so impressed with the watercolor decriptions of the first.) In the beginning of the novel, I thought Durrell had decided to be more desciptive in the area of sounds and thought he had impishly personified this goal with a focus on a strange talking parrot.However, I was soon drawn into the story. I forget my efforts at intellectualizing and found that the characters had broadened for me. I wanted to read about what was happening to them and what had happened to them. I found myself changed from a distant observer into one who empathized with the characters. I noticed that I had been jealous of Justine in the first novel and found myself happy that she was no longer worshipped in the second novel.Durrell's desciptions went past lush and ripe into fascinating, fermenting, and magnetic. Intrigue is introduced. Other sides of incidents are shown. I loved this book and intend to read the other two in the series.Sometimes I get the impression that Durrell had a life time stash of pithy quotes he just had to get worked in somewhere. In this book he has an addendum titled &quot;Consequential Data.&quot; Don't miss these. For example, &quot;Gamblers and lovers always play to lose.&quot;"},{"Title":"Balthazar","review":"BALTHAZAR, the second novel in Lawrence Durrell's ALEXANDRIA QUARTET, is a less daunting proposition than its predecessor,JUSTINE. The author points out that the first three novels (these two plusMOUNTOLIVE) all overlap in time, looking at the same events from different perspectives; only the fourth book,CLEA, is a true sequel. Nonetheless, it is essential to read JUSTINE first; the greater clarity and expansiveness of BALTHAZAR is possible only because the reader already knows most of the characters and events; there is not enough explanation for the story to stand on its own.The set-up is simple. The narrator (who now has a name, Darley) receives a surprise visitor to his Greek island, Balthazar, the doctor who had played a secondary role in the earlier novel. He bears with him the manuscript of JUSTINE, which Darley had sent him for comment, and has just time to return it together with his own interleaved notes and marginalia, before his ship leaves again. So Darley/Durrell is left with this huge volume of new material, which he calls \\"the great Interlinear\\" as though it were a sacred text. He realizes that several of his assumptions in the original story were mistaken, and so is forced to tell it again, sometimes quoting Balthazar directly, sometimes reimagining it in his own voice.The book is clearer than JUSTINE in several respects, as though emerging from smoke into light. Durrell seems to use fewer unexplained foreign words, though he still breaks into French at the drop of a hat. The chapters are shorter and more clearly marked. The narrative dwells longer on a few connected characters, or a linear sequence of events. While the climactic duck shoot was the only action set-piece in the earlier book, there are many here: Nessim's ride into the desert with his brother Narouz, the street festival of Sitna Mariam, the Venetian-style masked carnival, and several others. The effective addition of a second narrator (Balthazar) means that not everything is filtered through Darley's sensibility, so other characters develop greater individuality through the cross-lighting. I am not sure that they all become more likeable -- in particular, there is one scene with Clea near the end which strains my previous view of her as a hovering angel -- but it is easier to understand them. There is also more use of direct speech, so that the two older British characters, the writer Pursewarden and Scobie the old sailor, develop distinct (and rather funny) voices.Add there is still the rich color and cadence of Durrell's descriptive language, a little overdone perhaps, but full of surprising word-choices and sharp observations, especially when capturing sounds: \\"From the throat of a narrow alley, spilled like a widening circle of fire upon the darkness, burst a long tilting gallery of human beings headed by the leaping acrobats and dwards of Alexandria, and followed at a dancing measure by the long grotesque cavalcade of gonfalons, rising and falling in a tide of mystical light, treading the peristaltic measure of the wild music -- nibbled out everywhere by the tattling flutes and the pang of drums or the long shivering orgasm of tembourines struck by the dervishes in their habits as they moved towards the site of the festival.\\" No longer does this writing overwhelm the narrative it contains, nor does it merely decorate; rather, it articulates and propels the action, as this four-book sequence comes to seem less an outr&eacute; experiment and more like a true novel of impressive scope."},{"Title":"Balthazar","review":"Like \\"Justine\\", written in a hauntingly sensual style, but far more readable. Took me a much shorter time to read it. There are so many memorable passages of beauty and wisdom in both, one could fill a small notebook - on love and the human condition, and the beauty of nature. Durrell certainly had an alert and unusually articulate mind, writing both with poetry and precision. Published in 1957, yet timeless, as all classics are. I think it is supposed to take place before World War II. \\"Balthazar\\" has far more excitement than \\"Justine\\", moves at a quicker pace. Here we see all the same characters, yet all in a new light; we see farther and grasp what we see with new understanding. We get fresh info about Pursewarden, Nissim, Narouz, Justine, Darley (the narrator), Melissa, Clea, Pombal, Amaril, Leila, Mountolive, and the outrageous comic scenes built around Scobie. Throughout the entire four volumes that comprise \\"The Alexandria Quartet\\", Durrell is constantly backfilling, a technique I particularly love, until at the last, all is revealed. That same technique was also used by Sir Charles Percy Snow in his 11 volume series \\"Strangers and \\"Brothers\\", but perhaps to a lesser extant. Durrell is the master here in letting us see only so much, no further, until the last volume. A rave review"},{"Title":"Balthazar","review":"I admit that I have not read \\"Justine\\", the first novel of Durrell's famous Alexandria Quartet. Perhaps if I had started at the beginning, I might have had a more favorable impression. Yet I do feel that BALTHAZAR can stand alone as a novel, even if a reader were to be better served by reading all four in order. Durrell's writing is fabulous. Lemon-scented, mauve, pearly Alexandria with the white stalks of its minarets, \\"the town that breaks open at sunset like a rose\\"; beggars beside the Rolls Royces, the human flotsam of the Mediterranean, the tawdry revels of the Christian carnival---all appear so pleasingly haunting and decrepit. Durrell's novel is full of \\"wisdom\\"--perhaps a lifetime's supply of epigrams on every conceivable subject, saved over the years by the author as he thought of them on sleepless nights, or written down as he heard them at the cafes and salons of the Middle East. To paraphrase the author, \\"reading joins you to a work, then divides you\\". I plunged headlong into BALTHAZAR, hoping for a good read, but came out worse off. I felt I had been offered a plate of decadence and cynicism, and not wanting to play the chicken, taken several bites. I didn't like the taste. What I felt, most of all, was that I was an outsider; the observer of a clique or in-group. The author/narrator knew, all the characters knew, but I didn't know. The prose was designed to keep me from knowing. I had to guess or intrigue with myself in order to find out where this novel was going and who all these people were. I did not enjoy the experience very much, though I admit that it might be just the ticket for some. I repeatedly asked myself, \\"Is it worth finding out ? Do you really care ? Or are these just a bunch of people hopelessly sunk in jealousy, perversion, sex and substance abuse, who prize infidelity above all ? Is this what the author considers usual life ? Why should I try to discover who really loved or cared about whom ?\\" I concluded that it didn't matter to me very much.The group broke apart through death, anger, jealousy, and fatigue. BALTHAZAR traces the collapse of this in-grown little society within colonial Alexandria, before the tides of nationalism drowned its international, \\"Levantine\\" character forever. If you admire style, eliptical narrative, and skillful description laced with epigrams, this could be a five star novel. Not for me."},{"Title":"Balthazar","review":"The abridged version of events will be difficult to understand without a summary knowledge of what happened in \\"Justine,\\" so please read my review of that novel, the \\"sibling companion\\" of \\"Balthazar,\\" for a fuller appreciation of both. This review also gives away plot spoilers for both.\\"Balthazar\\" continues the narrative started in the first volume of the Alexandria Quartet, \\"Justine.\\" This time, we read of many of the events recounted in \\"Justine\\" from another perspective, that of the psychiatrist Balthazar, who unceremoniously disrupts and complicates our understanding of the events in \\"Justine.\\" A few years after the events, the narrator, whose name we finally learn is Darley, has moved to an island with the child that Melissa has had with Nessim. Here, Balthazar drops off what he refers to as his \\"interlinear,\\" (a literary recounting of previous events from his point of view) that Darley spends much of the novel reading and meditating upon. His account completely undermines Darley's understanding, telling him that Justine was really in love with the novelist Pursewarden, and just used him as a decoy to cheat on her husband. And we read about Scobie, a mutual friend of almost everyone in the book, including Clea, Justine, Melissa, and Darley, who is killed while in drag, possibly trying to pick up sailor for a trick.In \\"Balthazar,\\" Durrell draws the reader to the meta-fictional aspects of the story in at least two ways. His account completely reconfigures Darley's understanding of events in the previous volume, telling him that Justine was really in love with the novelist Pursewarden, and just used him as a decoy to cheat on her husband. In this sense, Balthazar's \\"interlinear\\" almost serves to turn the entire narrative into a series of suspect, but all equally likely, Rashomon-like perspectival takes, without any single one being allowed to be account for the entire truth. Durrell also uses Pursewarden as a kind of a novelist-cipher to shed light on the plight of the novelist - or, more broadly, the artist's - task. This ambiguity, which can at times seem heavy-handed, seems to mirror much of what Durrell is really saying about love, and especially erotic relationships in general: that they are a series of shadows, lies, deceptions, and figments of our own fragile imaginations. As with the first volume, the language is stunning, so just as in the first review, I'd like to end with a bit of what I'm talking about - those wonderful ambiguities and mysteries which so wholly constitute Alexandria and its residents for Durrell:\\"I feel I want to sound a note of ... affirmation - though not in the specific terms of a philosophy or religion. It should have the curvature of an embrace, the wordlessness of a lover's code. It should convey some feeling that the world we live in is founded in something too simple to be over-described as cosmic law - but as easy to grasp as, say, an act of tenderness, simple tenderness in the primal relation between animal and plant, rain and soil, seed and trees, man and God. A relationship so delicate that it is all too easily broken by the inquiring mind and conscience in the French sense which of course has its own rights and its own field of deployment. I'd like to think of my work simply as a cradle in which philosophy could rock itself to sleep, thumb in mouth. What do you say to this? After all, this is not simply what we most need in the world, but really what describes the state of pure process in it. Keep silent awhile you feel a comprehension of this act of tenderness - not power or glory: and certainly not Mercy, that vulgarity of the Jewish mind which can only imagine man as crouching under the whip. No, for the sort of tenderness I mean is utterly merciless!\\" (p. 238)."},{"Title":"Balthazar","review":"A new layer of history, interpersonal intricacies, told through another point of view, was added to the characters of Justine, while the persona of the city Alexandria and theme of love and desires permeates and ferments like aged wines. Durrell's masterly prose is further enriched by germinating characters and maturing plots."},{"Title":"Balthazar","review":"Balthazar is the second volume of Durrell's Alexandria Quartet. In the first book, Justine, the narrator Darley, an Irish expatriate living and teahing in Alexandria, described his fascination with the ancient Egyptian city and his immersion into the complex social life of the Alexandrians. As a writer, he wants to capture the essence of the city.The second volume is the Darley's review of an interlinear sent to him by Balthazar a psychiatrist acquaintence who presents another more informed view of the situation described in Justine. Key information not earlier available is supplied and the historical accuracy of events are supplemented by another layer of experience and interpretation. The personalities of the characters are shown to be less fixed and more determined by planned and chance events and locations than the narrator presented in volume one of the quartet.When there is limited information and insight, a point of view relies on Darley's projections of his own personality and life history necessarily limiting the understanding of a city, its citizens, and the artistic conception of the characters. Balthazar is a psychiatrist who focuses on realistic interpretations of emotions related to character interactions rather than presenting psychoanalytic jargon to obfuscate psychological history. Darley gains startling insight from the writing of Balthazar, his perspective broadens and deepens, and he adds the relativity of time as a factor in his understanding of emotions, especially love and betrayal.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and look forward to the next layer of the story, Mountolive, the third dimension of this evolving work of art. The analysis will continue in the third volume from the point of view of Mountolive, a British Ambassador."},{"Title":"Balthazar","review":"\\"Balthazar\\" has always been my favorite novel of the \\"Alexandria Quartet\\".I just finished reading \\"Justine\\" again for the first time in 30 years. In doing so I've discovered how different I am now. 30 years ago, I found \\"Justine\\" magical, rich, complex, psychological. And it requires a huge vocabulary (reading it expanded mine tremendously). I could rarely read more than a couple of pages without having to stop to absorb it.Now, as a man in his 50s, I was less charmed by \\"Justine\\". But I also look forward to reading \\"Balthazar\\" again, because I remember the way it takes \\"Justine\\" and stands it on its head, takes every assumption the author of \\"Justine\\" was making, and explaining it in an entirely new light. Because that's what \\"Balthazar\\" does -- the conceit is that the \\"author\\" of \\"Justine\\" sends his manuscript to the character Balthazar for his input. Balthazar, writes what is called the \\"interlinear\\", where Balthazar writes the \\"truth\\" in between the lines. Brilliant.So I finally \\"get it\\" (I'm sorry for all the quotes). Durrell was influenced by the ideas of Einstein -- Three dimensions of space, one of time, so three novels that tell the same story from three different perspectives (Justine, Balthazar, and Mountolive) and one of time (Clea, which is the sequel, which departs in time from the first three novels).This is a wonderful work (the quartet as a whole, I mean). Justine can be difficult to take, unless you are into endless, poetic descriptions of place and time (and they are amazing). Balthazar is fascinating; Mountolive is distant and the only 3rd person narrative in the set, so feels very different from the others. And then Clea, which is again first person but disappointing.I think what Durrell wanted to do here was hugely admirable; I'm not sure he accomplished it. But this is great literature, without a doubt."},{"Title":"Balthazar","review":"The conceit in Balthazar is that the narrator of the first novel in this series of four (Justine) has sent the first manuscript to his friend, Balthazar, who has returned it with inter-linear notes. As we would expect, Balthazar upsets the notions of the first book, revealing secrets and sowing doubt about the veracity of events. And this is the genius of the Alexandria Quartet: it is constantly upsetting our notions of the characters and their motivations while at the same time deepening our understanding of their lives and struggles. Mysteries are revealed, but new ones are planted."},{"Title":"Balthazar","review":"The second novel in Durrell's Alexandria Quartet, \\"Balthazar\\" is very much in the same vein as its predecessor, \\"Justine\\": rollicking eloquence, elusive plot, and characters viewed dimly through layers of mystery. The writing is excellent and rich with emotion. Sometimes, however, the deliberately enigmatic nature of the story results in confusion; I simply didn't always know what was going on or which characters were being discussed. For such a short novel it can be a bit of a slog, especially if impatience is even an occasional vice of the reader. Almost a year passed between my reading of these first two novels, and I suspect that my comprehension level would have been markedly better if I had picked up the second novel sooner."},{"Title":"Balthazar","review":"'Balthazar' picks up where Durrell left off in 'Justine' not chronologically, but from a different perspective. The doctor Balthazar has paid a visit to the narrator of Justine, and gives him a text called the Great Intilinear, which details what has already unfolded in the previous novel. The fact that Lawrence Durrell was trying to explore the idea of relativity in the Alexandria Quartet is almost completely inconsequential to what makes it any good. What remains interesting in this text is his rich prose and broad canvas. He his building a world that is situated in both the real and the imaginary. Even as 'Balthazar' devolves into elements of Orientalism, it remains an extremely fine novel."},{"Title":"Balthazar","review":"The second book of the Alexandrian Quartet mirrors all the happenings in the first, only this time from Balthazar's perspective. Beautifully written, this books gives the characters more depth than the naive and intellectual Darley first perceived. Here the complexities of love and obsession are seen in the light of curiosity, not rationalism."},{"Title":"Balthazar","review":"This sequence of four novels has a tremendous reputation, but fishing around on the internet, it's hard to make out why. Certainly not for Durrell's ideas: there are not many of those. For his lyrical prose? I guess.The big \\"idea,\\" if any, purports to be an exploration of the theory of relativity in literature.So basically what you've got here is a less brilliant \\"Rashomon,\\" where there are a series of events and each novel, for the most part, explores them from the differing points-of-view of the characters involved. Get it? We're exploring relativity! Deep, baby, deep.In the end this is nothing more than a set of four literary novels about intrigue and adultery among British expats in Alexandria during the 50's. Yet, as another reviewer so poignantly wrote, it's hard to see why I should give a toss about any of it.And as for the insinuations that, if I had any artistic sense, I'd be poring over them again and again? Yeesh! Once is more than enough for me.Note: the novels do not have to be read in order. I would suggest starting with \\"Balthazar,\\" then \\"Mountolive.\\" Otherwise you're likely to get lost, very lost."},{"Title":"Balthazar","review":"The second in Durrell,s Alexandria Quartet, Balthazar further develops this story of infidelity, jealousy, and murder.

The characters have depth and are believeable. The motivations and actions of the hero and heroine were understandable. After finishing the book, I found myself thinking about Mitch and Katerina, their feelings, and how Mitch came to a greater understanding of himself, and Katerina came to understand Mitch's love for her and her own feelings after her injury. I thought the story was very touching. Once, again, I'm struck by how the quality of writing in a category romance can be excellent.

Since she can't remember so many years of her life (basically their entire marriage) she's ready to leave him, but the way they work on it is very well written.Added to it is a little bit of mystery and suspense regarding the circumstances of her memory loss and the little boy who she befriends and helps.The story did move a little slowly in places and could have done with a bit of tightening in the editing, but on the whole it's a lovely, well written and thought out story dealing with loss, changing relationships and solving a crime.As for the cover!

Pamela Dalton is a multi-talented writer who has written a real page-turner. The hero and heroine were wonderful, and the little boy, Jacob, stole my heart. Pamela took a favorite theme of mine and gave it a new twist that I enjoyed. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lord Byron Selected Poems (Penguin Classics)","review":"A legend in his own lifetime, Lord Byron stamped contemporary Western culture with the mark of his dark imagination, and his poetry has lost none of its iconoclastic power today. Without a doubt, this is the finest single-volume edition of Byron currently available. By omitting the rambling satirical romp \\"Don Juan\\" (widely available separately), editors Wolfson and Manning leave themselves enough space to provide a truly representative selection of Byron's greatest works. Jerome McGann's \\"Oxford Authors\\" volume is a strong competitor, and benefits from superior notes, but only this Penguin collection offers unabridged texts of the three Oriental Tales with which Byron followed \\"The Giaour\\"--\\"The Bride of Abydos,\\" \\"The Corsair,\\" and \\"Lara\\"--all of which are thrilling narratives, and indispensable for tracing the development of that towering figure of English Romanticism, the Byronic Hero. Thus, this edition presents (for the first time in one volume) a complete portrait of the Byronic Hero in his many guises, from vampire (\\"The Giaour\\") to pirate (\\"The Corsair\\") to necromancer (\\"Manfred\\") to fallen angel (\\"Cain\\"). Furthermore, Wolfson and Manning supply the complete text of \\"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage\\" (the work that established Byron's reputation in his own lifetime), along with many other rousing verse romances, including \\"The Siege of Corinth,\\" \\"The Prisoner of Chillon,\\" and \\"Mazeppa,\\" as well as a generous selection of Byron's most arresting shorter poems, such as \\"The Destruction of Sennacherib,\\" \\"Promethus,\\" and the nightmarish, end-of-the-world fantasy, \\"Darkness.\\" Fans of Byron's ironic mode will welcome the inclusion of three of his satirical works; however, the strength of this volume rests on the fact that it presents Byron at his most Byronic. These are his most sublime creations--the works that defined the Romantic movement--and to read them is to discover anew why he is still ranked, throughout the world, as the greatest English-language writer after Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Lord Byron Selected Poems (Penguin Classics)","review":"A legend in his own lifetime, Lord Byron stamped contemporary Western culture with the mark of his dark imagination, and his poetry has lost none of its iconoclastic power today.

Book is in fine condition and was delivered quickly."},{"Title":"Lord Byron Selected Poems (Penguin Classics)","review":"Byron's poems don't seem to seek to make any statements. Unlike his Romantic contemporaries Keats, Coleride, and Wordsworth, (even Shelley, to some extent) Byron puts forth no idealogy as to what poetry should be. Instead, he relies on certain aspects of that Romantic idealogy, such as frequent parallels between the state of man and the state of nature... however, with few excceptions, this fails to create unique insights, comments, or even descriptions in his writings. What results is florid, wordy, rhyming travel writing, often promoting British or macho ideals. This edition receives a low grade because it fails to lead me to any better of an impression of a poet that has obviously been influential and looked on as an esteemed figure for so many years. This book can be read as an interesting historical document, and, perhaps most importantly, as Romantic poetry falls out of favor, Byron's poetry as collected within helps to explain the reason why."},{"Title":"Protocols in Primary Care Geriatrics","review":"A required reading topic for our nursing program. Printed in 1991 but still close to the 2007 edition with useful information.....No joking the 2007 edition has a different cover page but the information is almost the same.

NO go to a office supply store and get some of those sticky note tabs \\"Arrows\\" make the whole book a quick guide. The textbook industry is a joke ! This book is excellent and a great source of information. Great to read and understand the backround if you have aging parents or ones you care for.......Protocols in Primary Care Geriatrics, Second Edition, is a completely rewritten and updated version of the successful first edition. Its strength lies in its clear presentation and readable approach to the daily challenges of community geriatrics.

I had wanted to do such a book twenty years ago, but I lacked the skill. A master of the Greek tongue, he found the best translations of texts often misunderstood or bowdlerized, and when he couldn't find any, he translated them himself or commissioned others to do so. He additionally placed extensive and erudite introductions along with very useful bibliographic notes at the beginning of each of chapter. Each chapter is well footnoted, and as Hubbard says in his preface, \\"The footnotes are geared to a general undergraduate audience that has little previous knowledge of classical civilization and may need explanation of basic cultural artifacts or historical references. The notes also include points of interpretation, which should interest both the general and the more knowledgeable reader.\\"He effectively demolished the absurdities of John Boswell and David Halperin, and criticized the less reprehensible but still erroneous theses of Dover and Foucault. True, Hubbard did not do much with lesbianism, but then it didn't appear often in the sources. His subtle but devastating attacks on social constructionists, extreme feminists, lesbiterians, and Socarides, the other (dying-off) old-time American Freudians, and the child abuse industry make his work not only intellectually unassailable but socially and legally relevant. It is the first of its kind and will not conceivably be surpassed. Reviewers and others may over time be able to add a few items or even quibble a bit with the translations offered. It is plausible, at the most, that a second edition may be needed in a decade or two."},{"Title":"Homosexuality in Greece and Rome: A Sourcebook of Basic Documents","review":"It is a long book but it is so skilfully written that the reader looks forward to the next page! It is broken up with little stories, poems, arguments and anecdotes from famous names and not so famous names all in different stages of wooing a boy.It is interesting to read about Socrates, Plato and poems from ordinary men trying to woo their love interest. Some successfully..other poems show the anger with the boy or the loss of his love.There are wonderful arguments and debates regardinge the erastes/eromenus relationship. There are anecdotes about cross-dressers, lesbians, male prostitutes, lesbians (not so much) and spurned lovers. There are lessons on how to be successful courting a boy...what to look for and what to expect. Only families of the wealthy allowed their boys to be courted.There were many rules of courtship and in this world the boys' virtue is protected by the father until he approves of the suitor..or the boy accepts.The descriptions of where men can meet boys: the gymnasia, the baths, and sleeping outside a potential lovers door!The poetry is some of the most beautiful I have ever read.So much information but easy to digest. So much was uncovered (excuse the pun)It was wonderful to read actual notes and speeches from Socrates,Plato and others. It provided a vivid snapshot of male love in Ancient times."},{"Title":"Homosexuality in Greece and Rome: A Sourcebook of Basic Documents","review":"This is an exhaustive, absolutely fascinating compendium of a vast number of ancient texts, all of which make reference to classical attitudes concerning homosexuality. The array is fascinating, the conclusions myriad. For anyone who really wants to get down the the nitty gritty of ancient opinions -- or to see what day to day ancient life was like -- this book is indispensible."},{"Title":"Wedding Invitations, Announcements, Place Cards, and More","review":"With this book -- and a lot of practice -- I was able to do the calligraphy for my daughter's wedding.The book includes a number of romantic alphabets in styles from Celtic to modern, forms for invitations, many examples of custom woprk, and step-by-step instructions for projects ranging from favors to menu cards to guest books. There are also suggestions for working with a professional calligrapher.This is a practical book for anyone planning a wedding."},{"Title":"Wedding Invitations, Announcements, Place Cards, and More","review":"I don't know what the people who rated this book 2 stars are talking about. The subtitle clearly says \\"A Bride's Guide to Simple Calligraphy\\". This is a calligraphy book.That said, there were also plenty examples of finished pieces--on every other page! The examples are a little old-fashioned for my taste and don't have that Martha Stewart look that I love, but are still helpful in envisioning the application of the calligraphy techniques on an invitation. This book also helps you apply the proper wording to an invitation if you're at a loss when it comes to etiquette. This can come in very handy when trying to figure out how to word an invitation under special circumstances such as when the bride or groom have parents who are divorced or deceased.I used this book to address the envelopes for my wedding invitations as well as the placecards and I got tons of compliments. You should have a minor background in calligraphy or at least good penmanship to really benefit from these alphabets. This is the biggest collection of alphabets I've come by. They are all gorgeous in their own right. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to hand-letter a wedding invitation."},{"Title":"Wedding Invitations, Announcements, Place Cards, and More","review":"This book was certainly not what I expected. I'm always on the lookout for new ideas and creative invitation samples. This book fell short of my expectations because it had very few actual pieces featured.

Unfortunately, I didn't find the inspiration I was looking for."},{"Title":"Wedding Invitations, Announcements, Place Cards, and More","review":"Lucky I'm a HUGE Lettering and Calligraphy Lover (in addition to wedding invitations). This is a fantastic resource if you're looking for a book to show you some fun, funky and elegant calligraphy ideas. In my opinion, the title is misleading because it's definitely more of a cool calligraphy / handwriting book (although there are definitely some cute invitations in there, too.) Had I not been a calligraphy lover, I probably would have returned the book, but since I'm always looking for fun new styles of calligraphy, I found this to be a great book. I would describe this more of a modern, fun calligraphy book with a few invitation ideas. I really like how it shows you, step by step, how to do each lettering style."},{"Title":"Wedding Invitations, Announcements, Place Cards, and More","review":"Love the book gave me great ideas for my cards and canvas stuff that i make.

She then returns to the U.S. for her introspective observations in the southwestern desert. She and her husband travel by camper, for flexibility of itinerary, and to insulate themselves from other tourists. She positions a chapter of affectionate reflections on her historic hometown of Litchfield, Connecticut, as a transition to the themes which find voice in her other writings. When Sunny shifts from intrepid foreign correspondent to more contemplative musings, the reader must depress the clutch and speed-shift to catch up. In the earlier chapters of the book she entertains; with the latter she engages our intellect. Herein she addresses the struggles for the soul of modernity, including population versus natural resources, labor versus management, technology versus mankind, urbanism versus ruralism, democracy versus totalitarinism, church versus state, idealism versus realism, and capitalism versus socialism. In the end, we'll have filled our daily requirements in history, ethics, politics, economics, geography, and philosophy; all in 126 pages."},{"Title":"The Complete Australian Cattle Dog","review":"This book has the best breed specific information I have found.

Also, the history of this breed, according to this book, will lead you down the road of half truths and myths regarding the true origin of the Australian Cattle Dog. I would suggest Scott Lithgow's book, Training and Working Dogs even if a companion to this breed doesn't wish to work their dog. It has valuable information on raising this particular breed and others like them.

There's dirt, drama, and dancing -- my daughter has begged for this one from the library so many times that I'm finally tracking down a copy to buy. She also loves the Scholastic video version of the story."},{"Title":"Ernie O'Malley: IRA Intellectual","review":"Professor English, of Queen's University, Belfast, divides up this critical biography into sections that investigate Ernie O'Malley's life, his ideas, his writings, and his career after the publication of his well-known memoir On Another Man's Wound. The title refers, as English reminds us, not to (as Gerry Adams propounded) the slogan that one generation's freedom fighters must rise up upon the fallen bodies of a previous generation's failed fighters to seek victory, but to the fact that it's easy to withhold pity when someone else is doing the bleeding and the dying. As a medical student before the 1916 Rising, O'Malley knew this to be more than a metaphor. His choice in a few years to take up arms against the Crown only deepened his empathy, and his awareness of the divisions that tore Irish into pro- and anti-British soldiers and then pro- and anti-postwar Treaty soldiers once the British had left--most of the island. He never confused anti-British tactics with anti-British prejudice, and one of the most memorable parts of his memoir is when he tells of his love for Shakespeare's sonnets, a copy of which he took into battle.O'Malley was a rarity among those who were involved in the Irish war against Britain for independence that followed the failed Rising. He only was periphally involved, if at all, in 1916, but his powerfully described, deeply detailed accounts of his involvement in the war that followed show a university-educated, well-mannered, upper/middle-class Catholic who chose to lead troops most often from disparate backgrounds than his own into a guerrilla war to obtain the ideal Republic as a reality.If you want to read \\"Another Man's..\\" follow it up with his unfortunately incomplete \\"The Singing Flame,\\" which tells of the civil war that followed the war for independence and his involvement in more pain, idealism, and compromise. English, by separating the life from the critical accounts, avoids having to recapitulate too lengthily what O'Malley himself conveys so well of his war experiences. He makes the biography briefer of the early years to elaborate upon his later wanderings in the Western US, his art collecting and book collecting interests, and his troubled domestic life.English succeeds best when he goes beyond the facts of O'Malley's life. He then provides valuable considerations of how one could be \\"IRA & intellectual\\" by considering how the Catholic intellectual class both succeeded and failed in its attempts to make the Free State into what the Republicans had fought for, and then failed to achieve. The writers from the struggles tended to be on the losing side to a man, and the sense of futility and frustration, English shows, made it imperative for many of the most capable and talented leaders Ireland could have kept to guide the new nation instead to seek exile from the state that emerged, full of censorship and censoriousness.This is not a long book, but one finishes it with a sense of sadness for the ultimate disappointments O'Malley and his peers endured as they sought aesthetic satisfactions to replace the loss of an Ireland for which they had fought so long, and to escape or endure the reality of a narrower state, intellectually and ideally, than they had lived and seen others die to achieve.Prof. English has subsequently published \\"Armed Struggle,\\" an IRA history, and earlier had produced \\"Radicals & the Republic\\"--an account of the leftists who tried to advance 1916 ideals in a post-1922-39 Free State unsuccessfully. He has co-edited \\"Raids & Rallies,\\" the Civil War letters of O'Malley."},{"Title":"Julia France and Her Times; a Novel","review":"Gertrude Atherton was nothing if not an ambitious writer. No subject or setting seemed beyond her powers. This book is a long, episodic novel about Julia Edis: her marriage to the monstrous Lt. France, heir to a dukedom; dull years spent in England; her escape from her tyrannical husband; her becoming a suffragette (a favorite Atherton theme); and her eventually falling in love with Daniel Tay. It was bold for its day (another Atherton trait), but she was not able to draw Julia France in such a way that she remains in our memory for long. All that she suffers, all that she does to give meaning to her life, evaporates almost as quickly as it takes to turn the page."},{"Title":"Chewsday a Sex Novel","review":"This is one of the funniest books ever written: absurd sex and wonderful wordplay between two goofy Hamptons summer-rental couples -- from one of our most brilliant humorists."},{"Title":"Chewsday a Sex Novel","review":"When the laws (or the law enforcement) changed in the 1960s, it suddenly became possible to have actual sex scenes in novels. They weren't long, or detailed, or in most cases all that interesting; but they were there. This led to an efflorescence of paperback novels in which everybody was Doing It all the time, and the plot became a structure on which to hang as many of these episodes as possible.Chewsday is not one of those books. It's a parody of all of them at once, and it has the wit, inventiveness, and uncanny control of tone that they so badly needed but didn't have. The ending alone is worth the price of the book several times over. It's far better than _Naked Came the Stranger_, which is the other great parody of the 1960s sexy novel; and I've always been surprised that it isn't better known."},{"Title":"The Heart's Companion","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this tale of the \\"Ice Witch\\" and the \\"Devil's Disciple.\\" Both the heroine and hero have retreated behind the facades that society has labeled them with. Although the tangled past of each character is a little hard to follow, the details do eventually come out. Jane Grantly and Vernon (The Earl of Royce) are both wonderful characters. I loved how each sees behind their masks of indifference to fall in love! Jane's Aunt Elsbeth and her own romance is a wonderful side story.All the secondary characters are well fleshed out. The children added a nice element to the story also. The story preaches a bit about not believing everything you hear (namely all that horrible gossip) which I found a little tiresome. I supppose the author wanted to bring the point home since much revolves around looking past what is said to what a person does. Some of the incidents that occur are unbelievable but this is fiction! Read it with an open mind and you will find a fun tale with the requisite happy ending.This is my first book by this author. She has others that I will be checking out for."},{"Title":"All About the St. Bernard (World of Dogs S.)","review":"This is exactly the book I was looking for as someone with a brand new St. Bernard puppy. The history helps to know how the St. Bernard developed its temperment and size. The care and training sections are excellent, giving everything from diet suggestions to tips and cautions in training, housing, and playing with your puppy. Although I will probably never have a show dog, I also appreciated those sections that explained what breeders are striving to achieve with the St. Bernard with size, coloring, and build."},{"Title":"All About the St. Bernard (World of Dogs S.)","review":"i have been breeding saints for several years now, and this is a very good resource book...some of the information is not practical(like make him tripe to eat); but you are able to infer and obtain basic information....saint bernards are the most loveable dogs in the world, if possible everyone should have one!!"},{"Title":"On the Pragmatics of Communication (Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought)","review":"While reading of On the Pragmatics of Communication, I enjoyed a mild but indispensable conceptual breakthrough: viz., that in order to grasp thoroughly Habermas's notion of &quot;universal pragmatics&quot; and its relationship to linguistics, one must first understand the tenets of the later Wittgenstein's (i.e., Wittgenstein of Philosophical Investigations) thought, particularly his metaphor of the fly in the bottle. Specifically, Wittgenstein asks, &quot;What is your aim in philosophy?&quot; (309), and preemptively supplies the answer himself: &quot;To shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle&quot; (309).1 I understand this metaphor to be an elegant refiguration of the same idea underlying The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which the second edition of The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy defines as &quot;the statement in quantum mechanics, formulated by Werner Heisenberg, that it is impossible to measure two properties of a quantum object, such as its position and momentum (or energy and time), simultaneously with infinite precision.&quot;2 A simple substitution of terms makes the relevance of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to Wittgenstein's &quot;fly&quot; metaphor much clearer. If the fly in Wittgenstein's metaphor is analogous to the quantum object in the above definition, then it stands to reason that the former's presence in the bottle represents its more precise isolation in space, its position. Thus it is more amenable to observation; one can gather quite an accurate sense of the physical features of the fly. However, because the fly is isolated from its natural environment and is moreover constrained to such a small, artificial and featureless environment, i.e., &quot;the fly-bottle,&quot; one cannot get an accurate sense of the fly's function, to which one presumes that the fly's physiology is suited. In other words, if the notion of the fly's &quot;fly-ness&quot; depends on understanding both its form and function, then liberating the fly from its environmental rarefaction in the bottle appears to be the only way of achieving a more precise understanding of &quot;fly-ness.&quot; Chances are, however, that upon its liberation from the fly-bottle, the fly would quickly escape our observation of it. Therefore, both the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and Wittgenstein's &quot;fly&quot; metaphor reveal a certain economy of perspective intrinsic to empirical observation.For Wittgenstein, then, philosophy is the bottling of the fly, because the former seeks to isolate human concerns and practices from the context in which they are articulated, i.e., the world, which is &quot;the totality of possible states of affairs&quot; in Wittgenstein's philosophical idiom. For instance, the &quot;proposition&quot; of logical positivism is in essence an alembicated version of a given utterance used in a workaday context, and is therefore submitted to an evaluation (e.g., of its truth content) which in itself has no relation to a workaday context, but rather to the highly specialized and jargon-laden philosophical context of logic. In so doing, philosophy &quot;bottles up&quot; an utterance and thereby effectively estranges it functionality. Therefore, it is incumbent upon every philosopher to avoid this tendency, which Wittgenstein considers to be philosophy's failing.Enter Habermas. His theory of &quot;universal pragmatics&quot; strikes me as an attempt to overcome the limitations imposed on philosophy by Wittgenstein. Ever mindful of the philosophy's ineluctable tendency to alembicate the meaning of utterances, Habermas endeavors-to extend the &quot;fly metaphor&quot;-to discover a bottle large enough to accommodate both observer and observed. To accomplish this goal, he privileges the human impulse to sociality, and thus never interrogates the validity of this tendency, because to do so is to risk &quot;bottling up&quot; sociality from the context it instantiates, i.e., &quot;the lifeworld.&quot; I understand Habermas's notion of the lifeworld as a mediating and mediated conceptual aggregate (complex of ideologies?), similar to Althusser's notion of humankind's &quot;lived relation to the real,&quot; which is so multifarious and protean (i.e., historically contingent [in a non-metanarrativistic sense]) that one cannot cognize but a minute fraction of its totality at any given time. It is also quite similar to Wittgenstein's concept of the largely inscrutable, ever-shifting &quot;background,&quot; as well as to Wilhelm Reich's concept of the &quot;work-democratic.&quot;Habermas has a lot at stake in privileging the human propensity for sociality: for him, human endeavor cannot be the, discursively palliated (concealed?) but fundamentally Hobbesian bellum omnium contra omnes that such poststructuralist thinkers as Michel Foucault and Jean-Franois Lyotard assume it to be. Human affairs must instead be a negotiable and coordinated effort in the first instance. Any perversion of this cooperative endeavor, resulting from the naked self-interest of one of the participants or otherwise, is parasitic upon the initial cooperation, and is therefore a posteriori, not a priori, as Foucault et al would have it.Habermas certainly has a lot at stake, but his philosophical gambit, i.e., privileging sociality, is cagily pragmatist in nature. That is, Habermas refrains from invoking any sort of metaphysics; rather, he simply adopts human sociality as his fundamental presupposition because of its relative incontestability: one cannot deny that humans tend to be social, for whatever reason (beware the &quot;bottle&quot; of Hobbesian depredation!), and that sociality necessarily requires a modicum of sociality from among its members, again, for whatever reason. Therefore, sociality as a fundamental supposition has tremendous explanatory power-Jamesian &quot;cash value,&quot; as it were-when applied to phenomenological concerns such as the form and function of language.An interesting implication: dismissing Habermas's theory of &quot;universal pragmatics&quot; (rest assured that I am well aware of the oxymoronic nature of the terms) in favor of postructuralist assumptions, or vice versa, is itself a pragmatist proposition inasmuch as one must inevitably resort to evaluating either set of assumptions for their respective &quot;cash values,&quot; and find in favor of one or the other with no more metaphysical certainty than ever-unless of course one goes back to &quot;the bottle.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ten Commitments to Your Success","review":"I read this book the day I got it.It's written in such a simple and straight forward way that gets the ideas through to you very quickly.Some very good advice there.10 commitments, I knew the importance of some, and had no idea about the rest.I just need to work on all of them gradually to have them all going on in my life (as the author advices) and get the success I desire.Thank you Steve for the great book :)"},{"Title":"Ten Commitments to Your Success","review":"I am disappointed in the shallowness of the book.As an earlier review indicates, \\"it is like a fantasy retreat with the world's greatest poets, artists, philosophers, scientists, entrepreneurs and self-help gurus.

How and what other people in this group contribute to your success has little relationship to another persons success. Each of these persons were successful in their own right are most likely not related to your DNA for success - great stories, little help.One must understand and pursue success using a systematic model and process based on the tried and true valid success factors (not the single minded approach of most authors - setting goals, planning, meditating, buying or selling, networking/marketing, etc.). No one or even a combination of two or three factors insure success, but may be part of valid success model.He does recognize the critical factor in success - commitment. But, the elements covered in the chapters don't tie together to form a model for individual success.Even after being entertained by the stories I read only half the book, my time was to valuable to waste on a \\"C\\" priority when I had \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" priorities.

No matter how many self help books you had read before, you would still be satisfied. Great return for your time and money. Highly recommended!p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.Fuller found that when he created a plan, and then made a series of first moves, he was creating and producing his life with action. Most people wait for the first moves to happen to them. They let the the world around them make the first moves and then they respond, living a life of second moves, all in response to others. pg3Children are unhappy about 12 times a day and they are happy about 67 times a day. But it is not permanent. And they know it's not, which is why they always very quickly move on from unhappiness to happiness. Adults try to make it permanent, like trying to nail Jell-o to the wall. pg8We are not troubled by things, but by the opinion we have of things. - Epictetus pg8You can find a third world person with the highest IQ in his country and he wont be able to use the Google search engine ...while a low IQ person who understands Google could have gotten it for him in twenty seconds...Because intelligence is vastly overrated as to how far it can take you...it didnt save me at all from being suicidal about my ineffectiveness at making the very basic things in life work for me. pg18The past cannot affect you in any way if you are not thinking about it. Notice, when you step back, that you are not your thought. You are whatever is witnessing your thought. pg20When I feel something unpleasant it is my body's signal to me that my thought is contaminated and I am not longer free flowing....my body is trying to tell me to shift my thinking back to its natural resourceful, whole-brain state. (Or, even better, to drop thinking altogether for a while) pg22Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear. - Ambrose Redmoon pg24Start by doing what's necessary, then what's possible, and suddenly you are doing the impossible. - St. Francis of Assisi pg29Without a plan, you run your day based on your fears. You check in each morning with your sense of dread....If people will take time, they will be able to come up with a way, a routine, a structure, to deal with any fear they ahve in grown up life. A way that does not scare them. But they dont take the time to figure this out because they're too afraid to even look at the fear. Avoidance feeds the fear. pg29/30If my outcome goal is to have ten new clients every month, then that's the outcome that I want. I can use process goals to produce my outcome. Most people dont do this. All their goal setting is outcome based so their minds remain anxiously focused on what they dont have. They live in the future, which is the root of all anxiety. They cant relax into the process of now. pg32The Buddha, the most practical of teachers, defined the wise man or woman in a thoroughly practical way: \\"One who will gladly give up a smaller pleasure to gain a greater joy.\\" pg35It's not how you feel. It's what has to be done. pg57A committment to career is a committment to my communications always delivering value. pg70What gets measured gets done. pg78Discipline is remembering what you want. - David Campbell pg83"},{"Title":"Ten Commitments to Your Success","review":"For those of you who measure success as the number of zeros in your paycheck, or the size of your empire, please move on.

Steve's stories and illustrations guide the reader in applying these strategies to life transforming principles. Steve explains, \\"The beauty of a life organized around all ten commitments...is that one will experience life to the fullest.\\"Chandler often draws on his own life experiences in providing a broad range of creative ways to access the priceless gift and power of synergy. Steve has an easy, enjoyable, writing style. He provides common sense clarity and simplicity in application of the principles of commitment.Chapter one is an introduction and helps the reader organize their energy. Steve starts with a reminder of the importance of balance and focus as keys to making things happen.I found the story of Buckminster Fuller intriguing. Fuller introduced the concept of redesigning self, becoming a newly created personality. I was reminded of the importance of meditation in the commitment to use my mind while allowing the spirit to work through me in my commitment to spirit.The ten chapters that follow each contain a commitment to success. These commitments are arranged in a logical progression from committing to your spirit, to your mind, and to action. Commitments to wealth, friends, partner and career are among the remaining seven considered.When all ten commitments are in balance, you will find your life is in harmony with your career, you will experience the joy of celebrating and serving those your care fore, you will experience financial freedom, and peace of mind. \\"Ten Commitments to Your Success\\" is Steve Chandler, making a difference, one reader at a time."},{"Title":"Ten Commitments to Your Success","review":"This slim volume has not only been my favorite Steve Chandler book for over two years now; it's also been my favorite book. It's not the kind of book to read from front to back in a sitting or two, then set aside. Instead, it's a book you can open to any chapter, or even any page, and begin reading. Or, if you're like me, you'll keep it on your bedside table and turn to an earmarked page or underlined section (of which I have created many dozens)and read and reflect upon it before falling asleep.Chandler is different from other personal development authors in a ways that I find truly refreshing:1. His writing is very raw, almost like conversation. Lots of half-formed sentences, almost amateurish at times. Then POW! along comes a thought so beautifully put and unique that it nearly knocks your pajamas off!2. While most self-help authors pack their books with obviously second-hand inspirational stories about people they've obviously never met, Chandler writes almost exclusively about personal friends and clients he's worked with who've made breakthroughs in their lives by applying the principles Chandler writes about.3. While it has been said that there's nothing really new in the world of personal development, that it's all been said before, Chandler somehow makes it sound new. There's no other contemporary author who has provided me with as many refreshing insights to ponder.The amazing thing to me is that this beautiful little book has only a dozen reviews.

Even when I had no idea I was looking for it.I too was someone who thought I needed to go \\"obsessively\\" into a project (life, job, relationship) for it to be a success.

According to the author, spirit is most easily noticed in our lives when we take a step back and watch from afar, seeing spirit for what it really is and letting it appear in its true light. Spirit is present in each of our lives and it is only when we realize that it is there, that we can fully appreciate it and grow from its existence within us. And so this book continues from this point.As the author covers all ten of the commitments he feels are vital to a satisfying and complete life, he illustrates that it is only with the commitment of all ten of these areas, that we can truly be content within our lives for who and what we are. In this day and age of discontent around every corner; from the man on the street complaining about politics or the salesclerk in the corner store, feeling \\"down\\" about his dead end job, it seems to me that would the average person, implement this author's ideas, that life would not only be more pleasant for those individuals but for all those who come in contact with them as well.I must admit, when I picked up this book I was a bit reluctant to begin reading it and, in fact, placed it at the bottom of a stack of books I was to review. But when the stack came to the end and I was faced with this book, once opened, I found it's information not dry and typical as I expected it to be, but easy, not only to read, but to envision applying to my life as well. There are a lot of books on the market today that promise a \\"quick change\\" to ones life or a \\"miraculous, revolutionary way to improve ones being.\\" This book is not that way. It speaks to the common man in language that is easily absorbed, with practical advice and everyday stories which illustrate well the author's intentions within its covers.I would suggest \\"Ten Commitments to Your Success\\" book to all those who are sincerely looking for a way to change their lives through solid commitment. One caution though with this book. Don't read it expecting to only apply one or two principles to your life. This book is the total package and one that must be sincerely and completely read with the intention of applying and working with all ten commitments to better ones life. All ten commitments work together like pieces of a puzzle to give the user the total picture. And it is only when all ten pieces are placed in the right areas within our lives that the true puzzle is solved and the final image revealed. Be prepared to think differently about your life and the commitments you make within it after reading this book. \\"Ten Commitments to Your Success\\" is a book that will change your perspective simply by committing yourself to its principles within its pages and by making the decision to begin a new commitment to your life and yourself as well.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"Love's Fire: Beyond Mortal Boundaries","review":"Wow, this inspiring love story really got my juices flowing!

The biggest clues to her death are a letter in code addressed to a woman Sylvia worked for at an insurance agency and a hand-delivered envelope large enough to have contained a significant amount of money. Running parallel with this investigation of Sylvia, her friends, and her free-wheeling lifestyle, is the story of Oxford dons, one of whom is hoping to become the new department chair, a position his wife is very anxious for him to attain.Morse and Sgt. Lewis show only hints of the personalities that will develop later as the series continues. The beer-drinking Morse is a student of literature, and he enjoys discussing the poetry of Herbert Spenser and John Wilmot with Angie Hartman, a young Oxford student. Depicted as something of a young hot-shot, Morse relies on Sgt. Lewis, who, surprisingly, is described as older than Morse in this book and somewhat more adept at police procedure, another difference from later novels and from the TV series.As Morse investigates the insurance agency where Sylvia worked, the young man she was supposed to meet, and life at Oxford, the plot lines, most of them involving \\"illicit\\" sex, begin to converge. Max, the pathologist in the series, makes his first brief appearance here, and several quirky characters give life to the mystery as Morse investigates a fairly standard but well-plotted whodunit. Fans of the series will be intrigued to see the characters as Colin Dexter first conceived of them and will delight in making comparisons between this first novel and his later ones. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"I have known of Inspector Morse (the hero(?)) of this book, for years through TV, so I had a set ideas of what he, and his cases, were like before I read this book. I should not have been so narrow minded. The plot appears quite simple, and at the start, boring. A young, somewhat &quot;tarty&quot; girl gets nastily murdered outside an Oxford pub. She was seen before the murder with a female companion hitch hiking. The obvious suspect (the owner of the car which picks the girls up) comes forward...and all hell breaks loose. The story is quite difficult to follow and slow, but the character of Morse, the Inspector in charge, and his relationship with his new &quot;sidekick&quot; Sergent Lewis, make the book good, and quite compelling. The &quot;shock&quot; ending is not so great a shock, but more a sad one. What makes the story better than average is Dexter's description of Morse's character and the way his mind works, his little quirks and habits. For a first book in a series it is slow, but still compelling enough to make me want to read more. I would not recommend this book if you are one for skipping ahead, or you get bored easily. The slow build up is something that adds to the whole book, if not the basic plot."},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"I confess to an unfair advantage .... I was living near Oxford when Colin Dexter first introduced his character, Morse. Dexter was not well known at the time but 'Last Bus ...' was a big success locally. I remember walking or driving the same streets that came to life in his book and I was immediately captivated by the way he brought out the atmosphere of the city and the guilty 'looking over the shoulder' mannerism of the characters. Yes, this was the first of the Morse books and a superb launchpad for those to follow. The way he introduced the setting, the characters to his new readershhip ... Of course, the rest is history. Curiously, I still think this is the best of his books.Terence Hardiman must have been a perfect choice as story reader - he appeared as one of the characters in the TV production - and would have made a good 'Morse'. Gems of literary devices are many, but I particularly liked the bit about the batsman checking the scorebook. A bit like when another character in a different TV series, coincidentally also played by Hardiman, opens an envelope to read the one word denouement, 'Voltaire.' Have I given it away? I think not, but if you can deduce the guilty party from this, you could do Morse's job better than he can. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"Colin Dexter was born in 1930 and, over the course of his writing career, has won CWA Gold Dagger and Silver Dagger awards. \\"Last Bus to Woostock\\" was his debut novel, was first published in 1975 and introduced the world to the famous Inspector Morse.However, the book's victim is introduced before the hero. Sylvia Kaye and a friend are travelling into Ocford city centre for a night out - unfortunately, believing they had missed the last bus, the pair had hitched into town. Several hours later, Sylvia's body is found in the car park at the back of the Black Prince, with the murder weapon - a heavy tyre spanner - conveniently lying beside her. The case sees Morse paired up with Sergeant Lewis for the first time. The pair seem to have little in common : where Lewis is married and reads the Daily Mirror, Morse is single, lives alone and enjoys the cryptic crosswords in the Times. Morse is fussy about spelling and grammar, enjoys classical music and is partial to a few drinks. The crime scene, being a pub, would appear to be a case of the Inspector mixing work and pleasure - and, although he isn't supposed to drink on the job, he happily bends that rule once in a while. (He also seems to take great pleasure in refusing to allow Lewis do the same). When the investigation gets up and running, Morse is very curious about two people in particular : Sylvia's friend - who, strangely, remains anonymous and doesn't come forward - and whoever it was picked the pair up.\\"Last Bus to Woodstock\\" is quite possibly the politest murder-mystery book I have ever read - for example, Morse's arrival at the scene of the crime is announced with the exclamation \\"How he hated sex murders !\\". There didn't really seem to be much method to the investigation - it's built on assumptions and leaps of faith - while I found it a little odd there was no apparent lab work. (The murder weapon, which was found at the scene, was roundly ignored !). I realise the book was written in the 1970s, but surely some fingerprinting and forensics work would have been available - even in Oxford? Overall, the book is a little slow and plodding, and by the time the book reached its climax - where Morse revealed all - I really didn't care all that much. Based on Morse's popularity, I can only assume the series improves drastically as it goes along."},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"Inspector Morse is known to millions through the excellent BBC/PBS television series. While I am a huge fan of the TV episodes, due in no small part to the work of John Thaw as he portays our hero, I find the level of detail offered by the books even more captivating.This book tells the story of the first case that Morse and his sidekick Sergent Lewis are assigned to. A young woman last seen hitchhiking with a friend is found battered to death in a pub yard later the same night. Morse and Lewis are human and make many mistakes as they fight through lies and deceit to finally uncover the truth. The twist at the end is a real shock, cleverly worked leaving a feeling of sadness with the reader.But the quality of the Morse series by Colin Dexter is not the interesting stories or clever twists that are a requirement of a good mystery. The real attraction is the character of Morse, a hugely complex man, alcoholic, lovable, egotistic, vunerable, cultured, bad tempered, lonely, this is no infallible super hero. Morse also uses his intelligence not his athletic brawn to sift through the clues, something not seen often in murder mystery these days (probably because if the detective has to think so does the author).There are only a few quality mystery writers out there still writing, Mr Dexter is one of the best exponents of his craft and well worth your attention."},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse now reigns quite alone among the post-Christie detectives. This may annoy any number of readers who prefer other modern writers' detectives, but none of their authors enjoyed the remarkable recreation John Thaw brought to the televised series. There was an almost declasse Cary Grant attraction to his character in the films: it was impossible not to be just a little dazzled by such heady charm. Indeed, along with Alec Guinness as Smiley and David Suchet as Poirot, Thaw's performance was a touchstone, and quite moved Dexter's detective right to the top of public awareness. Will Inspector Morse remain there? I suspect he might. The public adores mysteries, but the memorable characters set the best ones apart from the pack. And Morse appears a most memorable creation.This novel, the very first in the series, quickly showcases Inspector Morse's idiosycrasies in so charming a way that when he's not around the book falters. I noticed a similar reaction of my own when first reading Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles - with Holmes so out of the way the plot frequently dragged. Fortunately Morse is far more involved here, and up front, and the story moves along.In many ways Morse seems a predecesor of television's House - they both are very eccentric and brusque, anti-establishment, and creative - both enjoy solving very stumping problems; both play against straight-arrow subalterns; and both tend to make a lot of ego misjudgements before resolving a mystery. With House it's usually - though not always - a medical issue, while with Morse naturally it's solving a murder. Both too are crippled emotionally and resort to pain-killing drugs - House his vicodin, Morse enormous quantities of bitters. The analogy could easily be extended in many other directions.The Last Bus to Woodstock won a well-deserved mystery award in England. Local color - Oxford - rings true, if not all the characterizations, which vary in quality from quite good to paper-thin. Strong sexual content doubtless helped publish in the first place - such are the requirements of editors. For a first in the series it's quite good. Future books elaborate many of the charms of the Inspector.Along with Jasper Fford's way out stuff, Dexter's series must be considered one of the major works of popular detective fiction coming out of England."},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"Last Bus To Woodstock introduces the reader to Chief Inspector Morse of Oxford, England. Morse is quirky, at times cantankerous, persistent, and even brilliant, particularly when solving murders. He is a fan of the English language, likes his crossword puzzles and poetry, and takes it personally when folks abuse their privilege while either speaking or writing. We also meet Sgt. Lewis, who is teamed up with Morse for the first time, much to his delight and consternation.The crime here is the murder of a young, very attractive woman, who may or may not have been a \\"tart\\" - her body found in a pub's parking lot. As Morse and Lewis investigate, it soon becomes clear they need a scorecard to keep track of who is having an affair with whom, their victim's romantic adventures by no means an exception to the rule in Oxford. (Our hero even falls head over heels for one of the victim's room-mates.) And the ending/conclusion is a tad overly-complicated.It has been a while since I've read a Morse mystery - the last one published in 1999 - and it's probably been at least 20 years since I read this one. Last Bus To Woodstock is slow to start and the reader gets just a flavor of who Morse and Lewis \\"become\\" in the later books. Interestingly, considering the \\"topic\\" - sex - I didn't find the writing/reading dated.If you're new to Morse and start here - and enjoy the book - you're in for a treat, for the later books are \\"better\\". So don't hesitate to continue on. If like me, it's been a while since you've visited with Morse and Lewis - it's worth the read."},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"An average mystery, likely because this is the author's first effort in the series. Certain parts seemed draggy. Some clues were not shown to the reader and narrated only at the point of revelation. This minimised the reader's \\"Why didn't I think of that before?!\\" impact. I'm still game for another book by Mr. Dexter."},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"I have faithfully watched the Inspector Morse series on television and have really enjoyed each episode, and I never felt the urge to read the series that the TV show was based on because the TV series is very well done indeed. Well, I'm glad that I decided to read the series finally. Yes, the TV series is quite consistent with the story which in itself is unusual, but the books (this one anyway) are masterpieces! Dexter knows how to build a plot and how to have the reader chasing countless red herrings. And Morse is a wonderful character! John Thaw plays the part very well, but the Morse in the books is even more irascible and testy than Thaw's portrayal. He is brilliant, but somehow vulnerable. A true enigma of a man. I can hardly wait to read the other books in this series now. I'm sure it will put all the shows that I've seen in a new light as Last Bus to Woodstock did."},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"You won't regret this read. Just when you think you know how it is going to end, you are fooled.Good plot. Good characters. Great dialogue. I now have to find time to read the remaining works of this author - my only regret!"},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"Last Bus to Woodstock is a fine novel in the police procedural genre of detective fiction. The book was first published in London in 1975. The novel has a good plot, fascinating characters and will keep you turning the pages until the end! The novel is the first in the series featuring the brilliant and quirky Inspector Morse of the Thames Valley Police Department. The beat is in Oxford and its local villages. Throughout the novel we begin to care for Morse. He is a middle aged Oxford graduate who is single and loves beautiful women. Morse is adept at crossword puzzles and clues; tippling at the local pub and listening on a rainy afternoon to a segment of Richard Wagner's immense Ring Cycle. The novel also introduces us to Sergeant Lewis who will feature in all the Morse books. PBS has made Colin Dexter a rich man! Dexter is witty and wise to the ways of the world. Colin Dexter quotes from literary sources but writes in an easy to read style which draws the reader into the story. Dexter is also a master of snappy dialogue moving the story on until its surprising and poignant denoument.The Plot: Two young ladies are waiting for a bus to Woodstock which is a town close to Oxford. One of them whose name is Sylvia Kaye is found later to have been brutally murdered and raped. Morse and Lewis are called upon to solve the crime. During the course of the investigation, Morse falls in love with a friend of Sylvia's.If you want to peruse the best in British crime writing this is a good place to begin your journey with the inimitable Messrs Morse and Lewis!"},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"This novel gets off to a suspenseful start. It is beautifully, thoughtfully and cleverly written--no question. However, you need to pay attention or you might get lost along the way. Characters are at times reintroduced with no reminder as to who they are. You might get the Bakers and Palmers in the story confused, or just have forgotten who they are. The denouement was quite intricate and threatened to give me a headache, I was trying so hard to follow the thread and make sure I had picked up on everything. And, finally, the propensity of young girls to fall for middle-aged men in this book is amusing (a wishful-thinking trait endemic to many male written mysteries). These are the only reasons I did not give LAST BUS TO WOODSTOCK five stars; it is just this side of brilliant, and Colin Dexter's depiction of Sergeant Lewis, in particular, is truly masterful."},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"I have been reading a lot of mysteries lately and Last Bus to Woodstock is by far the best novel I've read this year. I've only seen a few of the Inspector Morse television episodes so I decided to start with this, the first novel. Written in 1975, I kept in mind that the Morse I would read about in this novel may be somewhat different from the later television series. He is. And that's what makes it interesting!While in the myriad detective novels out there (Poirot excluded) the detective usually slugs a couple baddies with fists and bullets. Dexter, however, presents the thinking man's detective, a realistic detective. The mystery is not resolved in a few days; it takes nearly a month. Each chapter opens with the day and time, and like in real life, there are days when no work is done and days when Morse must attend to other duties. There are several suspects and the author leaves you guessing till the end."},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"I love the Inspector Morse mysteries on TV and have been listening to the book tapes whenever I can find them. This seems to have been an early Morse story, since it seems that Lewis and Morse had not worked together before. But it was an enjoyable read (or rather listen). My only problem was with the real murderer. I don't want to give the secret away, but I felt that Dexter had not sufficiently developed the character enough for us to understand why this person could have been in a position to commit the crime. In fact, Dexter misleads us (perhaps a mystery writer should do that) by giving us selective glimpses of the murderer's thoughts which give us no clue as to motives or envolvement. Still, I did enjoy it. The reader, Terrence Hardiman did a great job."},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"Morse never fails to keep you hooked as you try to keep pace with his ever flowing mind. Colin Dexter is a pure genious in the art of writing a thriller - his novels are addictive. Followed close by Lewis, the hen-pecked side kick, who Morse truly feels at home with, they battle along together trying to unsolve the mystery."},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"This is the first book by Colin Dexter featuring Inspector Morse...loved this book...will buy more...very pleased with product and delivery.*****"},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"I am a particular fan of British mystery/procedurals and have read and re-read Dorothy Sayers, P.D.James, Deboria Crombie, Peter Robinson and Charles Todd with unabated delight, but after plodding through the first three of the Morse books I have struck Colin Dexter from my list. I had not watched the Inspector Morse series on TV, had no preconceived ideas about the characters or the format, and relied only on the enthusiasm expressed by other readers. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I found the characters unappealing and the plots flat and tedious."},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse is one of the best known coppers in British crime fiction -- especially to fans of \\"Mystery!\\" on PBS. But while I have no difficulty picturing John Thaw in my mind as I reread this series (though Morse in this first book seems borderline schizo at times), Sgt. Robbie Lewis is another matter. The original book-Lewis actually is older than Morse himself -- a career sergeant, more or less. Still, Lewis is Morse's foil, his Sancho Panza, asking for explanations of his boss's thought processes on behalf of the reader and giving Morse someone to yell at without fear of retribution.The plot here revolves around two young women trying to hitch-hike the eight miles from Oxford to Woodstock -- looking for fun and romantic games, one assumes at the outset, as does Morse. But it's not that simple -- it's *never* that simple -- and the things each of them is involved in go much deeper than that. And one of them turns up brutally murdered in the car park of an upscale hotel bar. But who was the other girl? Morse would dearly like to find that out, but no one's talking. Then there's Bernard Crowther, a college lecturer in English literature, who is having a desultory affair with an unknown woman and hoping his wife, Margaret, doesn't find out. But, of course, she's figured that out months ago. And there's Sue Widdowson, a nurse at the local hospital, and to whom Morse has precipitously lost his heart. The last major player is Jennifer Coleby, housemate of the dead girl and (Morse is quickly convinced) a lying little bitch. She has secrets, too, possibly important ones for the investigation.The plot is complex and the characters are complex, especially Inspector Morse himself. He goes through mood swings, drinks on duty, makes unsound assumptions, ignores procedure and thereby misses useful evidence, and generally behaves in an unprofessional manner. In real life, Morse wouldn't last a week on a homicide squad, but this is fiction and if you will suspend your disbelief for a few hours, you will find this a very, very enjoyable mystery."},{"Title":"Last Bus to Woodstock","review":"\\"How can one drive a car up a dark alley if the headlights are not working?

The real work is much deeper than the popularized versions of this story, which is unfortunate. This is read well byt he talented Miachael York, but isn't nearly as entertaining as it could have been. It just seems to fall flat. Running time 3 hours."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"For the record: there is no such thing as a classic; only authors who ran out of copyright. This is literature, not a museum. Books do date and become moldy like everything else: only a few, like wine improve their vintage, but many just lose their bloom. The worst thing that can happen is a college teacher who plants into the students mind a notion that a book is great and an absolute must read, because, well guess, because his own teacher told him so. And so the poor student sets out on the quest, to find out what the heck could possibly be so great about this blasted thing. And that is when it even gets worse. Not to look retarded or uneducated, the student becomes a teacher himself and instructs his students how great a book this is ... . This doesnt mean that old books have always to be an easy read. It is quite alright if a teacher is doing his job and actually points out where to look, and what to look for, and is telling his students what kind of gear is needed to get there. If it is there, the student will find it, whatever &Ograve;it&Oacute; might be. If not see above. Having said all this, Don Quixote definitely is a book that grew under the authors hand and turned into something Cervantes hadnt anticipated when he wrote the first chapter. The lack of plan in the first part is painfully obvious, we really could do without the inlaid novelettes from Cervantes potboiler. Apparently, the book had a bad editor, or none at all. What compensates is the fact that Cervantes managed the rarest of all feats: to create the books own legend almost from the moment it was publicized. The legend has lasted and still lasts, which is every add-executives dream. Cervantes did it single-handed and all by himself but never earned even a fraction of an add-executives income. Makes you wonder. Why the hell do we write books? I venture a bold proposition: if children or men beyond the viagra-barrier (the equivalent of the menopause) are telling you they like the Don Quixote, even enjoy it, they probably speak the truth. If girls and women and most men in their full sexual prowess make such claim, they are probably lying through their teeth. Just try recalling all the incidents of this book: isnt it the melancholic fantasy of a man who knows that he has passed his prime? Who can see himself doing childish things again, because he just found out, that nothing really matters? But Cervantes was not a nihilist, he would rather live in a world where the rules of chivalry maintain a modicum of application. He also knows they dont. So he sits down and daydreams a character that is not exactly his alter ego but an object of his empathy, someone who found a way to live through Cervantes own predicament, and in the end he simply let him die a &Ograve;good&Oacute; death. Kafka even suspected, that Don Quixote is just a dream in Sancho's mind a child might agree; the elderly will nod knowingly to the Dons kidney condition. And the rest of us? Do we really want to know? Not every old translation is outmoded or &Ograve;bad.&Oacute; Ovid was a wit; so to translate his Metamorphoses into Drydens mock-heroic couplets is perfectly adequate, and a riot for Brocas centre. However, the same standard applied on Virgil destroys the very qualities of his style: subtlety and melos. Drydens vigor juggernauts roughshod across Virgils delicate world of veiled suggestions and carefully arranged low key settings here more modern attempts are certainly justified. In fact I still dont see an English Virgil anywhere yet. On the other hand would anybody actually dream to read Rabelais in any other translation than Sir Thomas Urquards? Not if we want to read Rabelais! Cervantes Don Quixote had been &Ograve;done&Ograve; by Thomas Shelton, P.A. Motteux, John Ormsby, Samuel Putnam, and lately Barton Raffel. Each and everyone has merits. None of them are downright bad, but if you want to hear the authors voice in a version that is still close enough to the time and life of Cervantes to catch some of the smells (it stank!) the brutal gusto of practical humor, the cruelties of the general outlook without the ballast of romantic notions a modern reader is often asked to read into the book then, well then, Motteuxs translation is the only option, and it is a good option. Of course it requires a reader who actually is interested in what the author has to say; a reader who understands that despite portions of a more universal appeal, there speaks a voice from the past and a witness to the paraphernalia of a very different world. To &Ograve;translate&Ograve; this into a &Ograve;modern&Oacute; idiom, slick and slangy that would suit our TV-trained Pavlovian giggle-response to silly sound-bites, would be the next thing to publicly performed necrophilia. I repeat: not every modern translation is junk, some are competent and full of good intentions, the kind that pave the road to hell, but translating should not replace an authors carefully crafted style with the jargon of another period, even if this should strike the naive reader as catching. But then, this is Cervantes, an author who couldnt care less about the stylistic obsessions that possessed a Flaubert or Joyce. Yet it has at least to be the style of his period to get the right feel for the Dons adventures. And even Cervantes had moments when his dialog developed wings and soared, though not too often."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"Don Quixote is a touching, often funny, often sad novel. Since everybody knows what the book is about more or less I won't spend my time on it. However I do feel that this book could have used a lot of editing. The story diverges from the main plot (which is not really coherent) quite often by telling totally irrelevant tales. One such tale makes up about 250 pages of the book, and is totally unrelated to Don Quixote's travels. I know it was meant to serve (at its time) as a parody of such knightly tales, but this parody has lost all of its relevance today. I would personally recommend skipping those parts entirely (gasp!). Had it not been for them I would easily given this book 4 stars, probably 5."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"Note: Amazon.com seems to have a hard time linking reviews to specific editions - it makes a difference. This review is of the Modern Library edition, ISBN-0679602860, translated by Samuel Putnam. I am reposting it, hoping it will link correctly this time).-----------------------------------------------------------When you approach reading (or rereading) a \\"classic\\" work you really, mostly, don't have to think about whether to read it -- that decision was either made by someone assigning it to you or, more wonderfully, by you, yourself deciding to swim contra-current against the cultural waters... following Neil Young's advice to \\"turn off that MTV.\\"So. You are going to read it. And, if you are paddling the Amazon.com, here, you are going to buy and OWN it. The question really becomes which edition you should own.This is the one.Its a fine translation - surprising in its avoidance of archaic language. It has a nice structure - the inevitable notes are available but not obtrusive.This edition, the Modern Library hardback edition, translated by Putnam, is also a nice book to own. It isn't one of those pretty faux-leather \\"shelf-candy\\" copies that'll break your wallet first. This is a hardworking book - the essence of the Modern Library idea. But it is a wonderful packaging of the whole 1000+ pages that is both readable and shelvable. No thousand-page paperback will survive an actual reading as anything you would want excepting as backup next to the latrine.Did I mention that it is a great book, great story? Well, others over the years have managed that :-). But I will loudly agree. I'm rereading it only now after a 35 year hiatus (yes, indeed, classics can be lost on the young - thats why you want books that last. In 35 more years, when you turn your lance back toward targets you thought you left behind, a copy will cost you [a lot of money]). It is just plain startling in its innovations and story. I always thought Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepard were the first to break down that \\"third wall\\" and talk to the audience - yet here is Cervantes doing so five centuries back ! Wow.Even if you've been made to buy it and to read it, buy a nice copy. Read the \\"Cliff notes\\" if you must, but someday you'll be a crazy old coot like Don Q.

We were not expected to read every chapter, but once I started, I couldn't dream of skipping anything. Don Quixote, Book 1, tells the story of a man more optimistic and idealistic than any other in literature. He sets out as a &quot;righter of wrongs and injustices&quot; and doesn't let anything stand in his way. Book one is also incredibly funny in many parts, both physically and intellectually. Book 2, although a somewhat difficult read and much less humorous, is by far the better work of art. At first, I was apalled at the ending of the book, but I now feel that Cervantes was justified in his ending because he wanted us to mourn the absence of chivalry and hope in our world. I cannot express how much perspective this book will add to your life. Tip: If you are reading Don Quixote in English, I reccommend the Putnam translation."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"If you want to make going through \\"Don Quixote\\" as painless as possible, get the Samuel Putnam translation from the 1950's (ISBN: 0679602860), published these days by the Modern Library.The Modern Library edition also has copious footnotes at the back of the book (Putnam's original ones), which is quite nice.For my money, nobody has ever come close to matching the natural grace and power Putnam summoned when he pulled this one off.If you can't find the Putnam, the Charles Jarvis translation (used in the Oxford World's Classics edition, ISBN: 0192834835) is, despite having originally been published in the 1600's (!), a serviceable second choice.

I read Don Quixote while in college and aside from it being a portrait of decadent Spanish society at the height of Spain's glorious empire, the book is often vulgar and downright hillarious. A true work of comedy. I recommend this book to everyone. Give it a chance even if it is so long. It's well worth it.

This book is an abridged version of Don Quixote. It says so on the title page, which unfortunately the publisher doesn't allow Amazon readers to see (at least at the time of my review).It's a shame, too, because it is a nice edition at a more than reasonable price (currently $7.49): it is a hardback edition with a sturdy spine and binding; the pages are thick; and the font is clear. Overall, in my opinion, it's an aesthetically pleasing book.I did check the publisher's website before purchasing Don Quixote to see if I could obtain certain information (e.g. translator), but at the time when I checked, I couldn't find such information anywhere.I hope Ann Arbor Media Group will consider placing this sort of information on their website and/or online catalog one day."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"One of the great classics of world literature, Don Quixote is very often called the greatest novel of all-time. Many also see it as the first modern novel, the precursor to all novels that have come since; some, indeed, even call it the first true novel ever written. Certainly, it is both world-famous -- almost all people, whether they've tackled this 1,000+page monster or not, seem to know about the &quot;terrifying and never-before-heard of adventure of the windmills&quot; -- and extremely influential upon all literature that has come since. The great Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky thought it was the best thing ever written; it was clearly one of Mark Twain's primary inspirations for Huck Finn.The book has endured and remained popular and influential for four hundred years for several reasons. For one, the character of Don Quixote himself is immortal. One of the most famous characters in all literature, he has appeared in various forms throughout the centuries -- on the page, on the stage, on the screen. Clearly a huge influence upon a multitude of subsequent literary characters, he is one of the great archetypes in literature. Also, the story itself works on several levels. On one level, it is a highly comic adventure that can be read and enjoyed by everyone; a hugely-popular both upon release and still today, this is probably the main reason why it has lasted four centuries. Even at this later date, the book contains scenes that are laugh-out-loud funny, its jokes running the gamut from the most base level of slapstick to ringing burlesque and satire. Despite the novel's length, it is a very entertaining book and rarely slow: it can actually be an exciting and fast-paced read, if one chooses to view it merely as an adventure. However, on a deeper level, the novel, fascinatingly, does several different things at once, and all very well. To begin with, it is a truly immortal satire, both on the outdated and hopelessly idealistic chivalric code itself and on the romantic books of knight-errantry that proclaimed their virtues and were extremely popular at the time Cervantes wrote this work. Wit is abundant and ever-present.As an author, Cervantes clearly had several tricks up his proverbial sleeve when writing this; he employs literary devices so charming, amusing, and inventive that they have never been equaled since. Indeed, this book was so very far ahead of its time that it makes many of the supposedly revolutionary post-modern novels seem mainstream and absolutely traditional by comparison. For, after all, this is a book about books; it is, thus, the ultimate self-reflexive text. As the introduction in this edition points out, the book actually tells two stories: that of Don Quixote, and that of the novel's composition itself. The number of self-references made in it can only be called ingenious. Several circumstances informed this. The mammoth book, as we know it today, was originally published in two halves, over a decade apart. Throughout, Cervantes constantly reminds us that the book is a book; in the second part, even the characters are aware of this, making for an intensely amusing and clever read. Also, before Cervantes published the second part, an impostor author released his own spurious sequel. Cervantes, responding in kind, changed the course of the book and wrote the apocryphal sequel into his own sequel, in addition to the first part of his own narrative! It isn't as confusing as it sounds -- indeed, it's quite delightful and inventive -- but the author himself, infamously, lost the course of his own narrative several times and lapsed into error. Of course, this, too, is noted later on in the book and commented upon as well. Literature as a whole is also commented upon. The author, in the second part, even addresses the criticisms of the first part, such as its digressions (which he defends, but stays away from in Part II) and its loose ends. The scene where the curate is selecting which books to burn and which to save is one of the most satirically-amusing ever written.The book, for all of its burlesque and even occasional lack of seriousness, also brings several important questions to light. What is reality? What makes one noble? If one does noble and brave deeds only because one is deluded, is one then noble in reality, or merely a poor farce and a walking joke? For these, and many other reasons, Don Quixote is a classic that deserves to be read by all."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"The definition of classic. Dostoyevsky considered Don Quixote the most beautiful of people and I cannot disagree. Cervantes wraps all things human into one book and almost always has you feeling every emotion all at once - slapstick humor, dark tragedy, dogged optimisim, dry realism, love, insanity, poetry vs utility, and wit, tons and tons of wit. If you read the information about Cervantes life you get more out of this book. You will see that this book is written about and from its author's soul, not a thought out plot. Disfigured through war and a hostage sitting in prison for the better part of his life, Cervantes knew what it meant to be taken in by the romance of war and how it contrasts with its harsh reality. He knew what love was and how it is related to \\"irrationality\\" or a poetic insanity that makes us human.If I was approached by an alien who asked me to give it a description of the soul of a human, this is the book I would give it. At certain times in the book I laughed and on second readings I felt sorrow over the same part.It is written in the 1400s, but is not a difficult read whatsoever. ..."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"Don QuixoteWritten by the author Miguel de Cervantes, during a time known as the enlightenment, this novel tells a classic tale of chivalry. But it wasn't really classic, because this book was set in a time when chivalry, and knight errantry had all but disappeared. Knight errantry is the practice of being a knight errant, or someone who wanders and aids others, following a strict code of chivalry or in this case, someone who interferes in other's affairs, as it would seem from Don Quixote's portrayal.Don Quixote was not always of this manner of people. He was originally a regular man, who lived in a village, in the region of La Mancha, Spain, with his niece and a housekeeper. His actual name was not Quixote, but Quixada, or Quesada. He loved reading books of chivalry, and of knights, that he became obsessive. He eventually got to the point where he decided that he was going to be a knight errant. He got some armor belonging to one of his ancestors, a sword, a lance, and a helmet with a fake visor if his own creation. Having done this, he mounted his horse Rocinante, and left to wander the countryside in search of those in need. Later he gained what he called a squire, a simple peasant named Sancho Panza, who came with due to the promise of wealthHad this been several hundred years prior to this time, it may have been more acceptable, but for someone to do this even in the late 1600's was hardly commonplace. The most interesting aspect of his quest was not this being out of place, so much as his vivid imagination.Don Quixote's imagination, which at times was borderline insanity, was really what made this book what it is. He imagined everything from prostitutes being maidens, to windmills being giants. This imagination of his got him in to trouble numerous times, but all the time made the book more enjoyable. While those who observed him thought him to be mad, he was quite convinced of the truth of what he saw. This was especially true of Sancho Panza. Sancho was constantly trying to show Don Quixote his error. Despite Don Quixote believed himself right, and even started to convince Sancho at times.The truth was revealed about his delusions later on, that he did most likely understand that they were false, but didn't care all the same. He wanted to escape reality, and live in a time when people were courtly and followed strict moral codes. He accomplished this by convincing himself that things were not as they appeared. And though others try to convince him of his errors, he still convinces himself of the validity of his ideas.While a tale of chivalry may seem boring to some, this is clearly not a traditional tale. Imagine if a story of King Arthur had been set in present times, this story accomplishes this. Because Don Quixote is so out of his place in time, it seems positively ludicrous. To counter act this, Cervantes Makes the book seem more credible, by making it seem as though historians, and sages were telling it.From the start, the book keeps the attention of the reader by telling the reader of Don Quixote's incredible encounter at an inn. This sets the reader up for what is to come. Also, while Don Quixote's apparent stupidity may aggravate the reader, it is worth reading it all the same, because it is justified, and makes more sense as the story progresses.Despite these grievances the book is indeed truly outstanding. The description, and humor of this novel are exceptionally well done. Cervantes makes the book seem so credible that it is not hard to believe that it really happened. Cervantes uses language that while being especially formal it still gives vivid descriptions of the surroundings, down to the last detail. The characters didn't simply gather near trees, they gathered near cork trees. Along with the vivid descriptions, came humor, portrayed as being serious. When Don Quixote attacked a barber and stole his brass basin, he was so convinced that it was the Golden Helmet of Mambrino that the reader couldn't help but be amused by how seriously Cervantes told of Don Quixote wearing it on his head.It is also good to note that there is much to gain by reading this book. Not only an intimate knowledge of the laws of chivalry is gained, but also many deeper insights. From reading Don Quixote the reader can understand what it was like at the time the novel was written, and can gain insight into what drives a person to do crazy things. The overall message seemed to be, that times have not changed for the better, and that sometimes people live in a fantasy world because of this prevailed, and should be considered a valuable lesson.Overall this is a very meritorious book. It shows insight by telling a tale of chivalry, but not in a traditional sense. The tale it tells is of a man so convinced that he is a knight errant, that he can no longer accept reality. Others, such as Sancho, try to convince him of this, but are unsuccessful, but despite all this, he still maintains his ideas of chivalry and knight errantry."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"The Adventures of Don Quixote is a must read classic for everyone. I thoroughly enjoyed the charm and wit of Cervantes tale of misadventure of the great knight. Don Quixote's imaginary spirit and pure devotion to chivalry is a noble quality often lost in this modern day and age. I dearly loved this book, and often found myself laughing aloud at humor written ages past. The world needs more Don Quixote's indeed."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"Anyone who's put his heart into a large, failed project, has to identify with the Knight of the Rueful Countenance and his faithful Squire. The combination of great wisdom and intelligence in most things but complete blindness when it comes to the great Quest, is common to many modern visionaries too -- not just Don Quixote. And the faithful, hardworking squire who follows him and supports him -- and tries to ignore the evidence that the great dream is really madness -- still works for the Don in countless enterprises across the world.So even across four centuries, this book still speaks to us, and far from being a difficult read, it rolls right along -- sometimes funny, sometimes sad, and sometimes very painful, but seldom dull."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"I have a couple versions of Don Quixote, and I've looked at others, and this version, translated by J. M. Cohen, is my personal favorite. From his introduction you find that he has a great love for Spanish literature in general, and this book in particular. His translation of the first sentence alone makes the book; &quot;Idle reader, you can believe without any oath of mine that I would wish this book, as the child of my brain, to be the most beautiful, the liveliest and the cleverest imaginable.&quot; Due to the subtlety of languages, every version I've read of this sentence is different, and I don't know much Spanish, nor do I have a Spanish copy to ask a friend to translate it for me, so I couldn't tell you what version is most accurate, but I can tell you that J. M. Cohen's version seems to fit the tone and tempo of the rest of the book.This version also collects both the first and second Don Quixote novels by Cervantes. I haven't seen any other collection which has this, and I can't find the sequel on it's own.The book itself is very funny. Unlike the way Don Quixote is often protrayed, Don Quixote doesn't go mad, he simply chooses to see the world differently, to see himself as a knight, to see windmills as giants, to see inn's as castles. His exploits cause him to have quite a bit of painful accidents, but he continues on. Sancho Panza, often described as a &quot;simple fool&quot; I believe may have been mentally retarded, because he genuinely believed the things his master told him, despite all evidence to the contrary. At times, he would make up stories to get out of errands Don Quixote sent him on, and, like a child, would come to believe his own fictions.In their journeys they meet a variety of characters, some boring which Don Quixote makes interesting, some interesting which Don Quixote ignores, thinking them boring. They find adventures where none are to be had, and sleep while genuine adventurs occur all around them.It's a brilliant story which still holds up over four hundred years after it origionally saw print, and in this translation, including both books, is quite a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"Miguel De Cervantes fought at the Battle of Lepanto, where the Spanish decisively defeated the Ottoman Empire. Cervantes, however, was imprisoned for several years by the Moors.Reading Don Quixote this past winter, I was struck by how that experience is woven through Don Quixote. Part novel, part collection of tales, Don Quixote's world is one of flux and change. This world is the setting for many quests: Moors seeking true love and acceptance in Spain, enslaved Spaniards yearning for freedom, Don Quixote striving to disenchant his Dulcinea, and Sancho Panza looking for an island to govern.Is the world being enchanted or drained of magic? Both readings are plausible. Don Quixote distrusts appearances, and we can't tell if he's genius or fool for doing so.If this sounds highfalutin, let me add that this novel includes great slapstick that made me put down the book and laugh out loud. While there are some slow passages (maybe an abridgement would be best to read), they can be gotten through with a little effort. The best passages are priceless."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"I was afraid that I might give up in the middle of the book- which I hate to do. There are so many versions and translations of this work, but having finished the book, I'd say that Putnam's translation is among the best.A man who thinks he's a knight traveling all over the country with his squire; his misfortunes are strange, often hilarious. Some parts of this knights adventures seem repetitious. Sometimes I found it hard to read 20 pgs at a time, but reading about Cervantes' characters it's difficult to not grow close to them. Really...where can you possibly find such a true and brave knight who will battle windmills- everything - to prove himself worthy of his Dulcinea?"},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote obviously centers around the title character, Don Quixote. Quixote was originally known as Alonso Quixano, La Manchan noble, who was content with reading stories of knighthood and chivalry and tending to his estate. Eventually, after reading these books, he decided it is his responsibility to set out with someone else in his village (Sancho Panza, his squire) to right the wrongs of people across Spain. Sancho Panza seems to be a very grounded person, but he admires Don Quixote so much his good sense disappears. In the beginning, Panza agreed to leave his family and travel with Quixote only because he promised Panza he would become the governor of the first island they came to; when this doesn't happen, Panza doesn't leave because he loves to company of the eccentric Quixote.All the adventures Don Quixote goes on are in the name of his love Dulcinia, and although she never makes an appearance in the book she seems to embody chivalric ideals. Unfortunately for our protagonists, Don Quixote often has confusion with the real and imaginary, mistaking inns for castles, grazing sheep for conflicting armies, windmills for enemy enchanters and traveling monks for wizards transporting a princess against her will. All mistakes are blamed on a powerful necromancer, who is Don Quixote's mortal enemy (since all knights have them.) Although Quixote is mocked by many, in the end they mimic his restlessness and discomfort for what is considered \\"normal\\" in society.Overall, I'm glad I read Don Quixote even though it was longer then I bargained for. The book helped me get a better picture of what life was like in Spain during the Renaissance period. I learned simple things like there actually were windmills in other parts of Europe besides the Netherlands and more complex things like exactly what chivalry and its ideals consist of."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"The novel Don Quixote is actually a collection of several stories loosely intertwined into a single novel. There is the overarching story of Don Quixote himself; there are also a number of shorter internal stories, most of which bear no relationship whatsoever to the Don Quixote story, other than the fact that the action of the Quixote story is sometimes driven by the characters' reading and listening to the internal stories. Given the multiple story lines, the reader's reaction to this novel will naturally be split among (1) the Quixote story, (2) the internal stories, and (3) the interaction between the Quixote story and the internal stories. Some readers will love all three aspects of the novel, some may find themselves enjoy one aspect and disliking another.My personal reaction to aspects 1-3 are as follows: (1) The Quixote story is boring, stupid, and repetitive. I know that this story is one of the great works of literature, and I've read the reasons why, but in spite of all that, it is still boring. How many times must we watch this delusional man attack innocent travelers, under the mistaken impression that the travelers are some form of aggressors, and then get beaten up as a result? Yes, each incident is different in the surface details, but all these incidents are basically the same incident, told over and over again. It is barely funny the first time; it is certainly not funny when it happens for the 20th time on page 500. Yes, the characterization of Sancho is wonderful, and yes, some of the interactions between these two men are delightful, but nothing can rescue this story from its boring, stupid, and repetitive nature.(2) The internal stories may not be as good literature as the Quixote story, but unlike the Quixote story they are fun to read and hard to put down. I read the unabridged novel; abridged versions shorten or delete some of the internal stories. Given that the internal stories are so entertaining, I recommend that you read the unabridged novel and skip over the Quixote story when you aren't enjoying it. Be aware that the internal stories do not begin until around page 250, so take heart and keep slogging away until you get to the better parts, which are worth the wait.(3) The interaction between the Quixote story and the internal stories is a relief, because without the internal stories, the external story would be *only* about Quixote's delusional attacks, which would make the external story even more tedious than it is.Given the nature of this novel, assigning it a single rating number is problematic; given that I read it only in translation, and so did not experience the rhythmic beauty of the original prose, giving it a rating at all is questionable. Aware of those limitations, I give the novel a 3. The writing is first-class, of course, but I cannot bring myself to give anything higher than a 3 to a novel that contains so much boring, stupid, and repetitive material."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"Great book, great publisher (my favorite for quality and hand-holdability), but the font heremakes it nearly unreadable. PLEASE, Everyman, change the font and I'll buy another one."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"Don Quixote is a classic piece of literature. If someone could produce a more up to date, vernacular translation, it would rival any comedy made today. This is a story about one man caught up in so many chivalry books that he becomes insane and starts traveling through Spain acting as a heroic knight while fighting made up villains and monsters. By his side is his gullible yet loyal servant Sancho.It's nice to know that during the Renaissance period such humor existed. The first part of the book deals with him traveling throughout and mixing up inns for castles, random people as kings or knights, and a random woman as his unrequited love for which all of the world must know. It's a tragic comedy where one man's insanity and futility provide worry for a few, concern for others, and great entertainment for most of the characters.What's interesting is the \\"twist\\" in the middle that leads to the second part, where after one man wrote a book about Don Quixote's wild adventures, a rich family, upon seeing the actual man who was in the book, decide to play along in probably the cruelest hoax in history. Claiming there Duke and Duchess, and promising the most absurd things. One of which was giving Sancho an actual province to rule over.The one thing that irked me about this book was that even though it needs to be translated for English readers, no translator has yet made the book as fluid or readable as it deserves to be.All in all, it's a good book, but hopefully a general author, and not some stuffy scholar, could translate it what it should be - a really funny and tragic story."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"I read this book in its original language, spanish (since it is my first language too), and I found Don Quijote's adventures fascinating, comical, and sometimes even slightly pathetic.\\"El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quijote de la Mancha\\" is about a man, Alonso Quijana, who reads so many books of knights from the middle ages (this was written in the baroque times, NOT the renaissance or the enlightement as other reviews say) that he loses his mind and decides to become a knight as well. This anacronysm is the first clue of the comic life Don Quijote leads from then on.The whole novel is a mockery of other books about knights (although not about the knights themselves), as Don Quijote continually struggles to do justice and to right wrongs, but is met with nothing but sad defeats.Overall, although it is very long and uses somewhat complicated language (it is written in spanish from the 1600s, although I suppose that the translation makes it simpler as it is to modern day words), Don Quijote and his adventures are something that I'd reccomend to anyone with the patience to read it."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"Hard to believe it's the greatest novel ever written, but I did read the abridged and tranlated version.

I agree with the readers who say hang in there for part 2--it's much more polished &amp; readable.To readers who don't like the way The Knight of the Doleful Countenance ended up, consider looking at it as if Don Quixote grew to become Sancho, and that Sancho grew to become Don Quixote--in itself sort of a statement about relationships, the life of a person, and the life of mankind."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"Everyone knows the windmills might be giants from cartoons and blurbs in high school English Books.

The original Spanish book is very inpersonal, even anthypatic, and that is teh spitir of it. Also, the paragraphs were a lot longer. Cervantes only separeted them when in was going to use dialogs.

In its original language is better, so be careful with your edition."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"For the record: there is no such thing as a classic; only authors who ran out of copyright. This is literature, not a museum. Books do date and become moldy like everything else: only a few, like wine improve their vintage, but many just lose their bloom. The worst thing that can happen is a college teacher who plants into the students mind a notion that a book is great and an absolute must read, because, well guess, because his own teacher told him so. And so the poor student sets out on the quest, to find out what the heck could possibly be so great about this blasted thing. And that is when it even gets worse. Not to look retarded or uneducated, the student becomes a teacher himself and instructs his students how great a book this is ... . This doesnt mean that old books have always to be an easy read. It is quite alright if a teacher is doing his job and actually points out where to look, and what to look for, and is telling his students what kind of gear is needed to get there. If it is there, the student will find it, whatever &Ograve;it&Oacute; might be. If not -- see above. Having said all this, Don Quixote definitely is a book that grew under the authors hand and turned into something Cervantes hadnt anticipated when he wrote the first chapter. The lack of plan in the first part is painfully obvious, we really could do without the inlaid novelettes from Cervantes potboiler. Apparently, the book had had a bad editor, or none at all. What compensates is the fact that Cervantes managed the rarest of all feats: to create the books own legend almost from the moment it was publicized. The legend has lasted and still lasts, which is every add-executives dream. Cervantes did it single-handed and all by himself -- but never earned even a fraction of an add-executives income. Makes you wonder. Why the hell do we write books? I venture a bold proposition: if children or men beyond the viagra-barrier (the equivalent of the menopause) are telling you they like the Don Quixote, even enjoy it, they probably speak the truth. If girls and women and most men in their full sexual prowess make such claim, they are probably lying through their teeth. Just try recalling all the incidents of this book: isnt it the melancholic fantasy of a man who knows that he has passed his prime? Who can see himself doing childish things again, because he just found out, that nothing really matters? But Cervantes was not a nihilist, he would rather live in a world where the rules of chivalry maintain a modicum of application. He also knows they dont. So he sits down and daydreams a character that is not exactly his alter ego but an object of his empathy, someone who found a way to live through Cervantes own predicament, and in the end he simply let him die a &Ograve;good&Oacute; death. Kafka even suspected, that Don Quixote is just a dream in Sancho's mind -- a child might agree; the elderly will nod knowingly to the Dons kidney condition. And the rest of us? Do we really want to know? Not every old translation is outmoded or &Ograve;bad.&Oacute; Ovid was a wit; so to translate his Metamorphoses into Drydens mock-heroic couplets is perfectly adequate, and a riot for Brocas centre. However, the same standard applied on Virgil destroys the very qualities of his style: subtlety and melos. Drydens vigor juggernauts roughshod across Virgils delicate world of veiled suggestions and carefully arranged low key settings here, more modern attempts are certainly justified. In fact I still dont see an English Virgil anywhere yet. On the other hand would anybody actually dream to read Rabelais in any other translation than Sir Thomas Urquards? Not if we want to read Rabelais! Cervantes Don Quixote had been &Ograve;done&Ograve; by Thomas Shelton (1612), P.A. Motteux (1743), John Ormsby (sometime in the 1800), Samuel Putnam, and lately Barton Raffel. Each and everyone has merits. None of them are downright bad, but if you want to hear the authors voice in a version that is still close enough to the time and life of Cervantes to catch some of the smells (it stank!), the brutal gusto of practical humor, the cruelties of the general outlook without the ballast of romantic notions a modern reader is often asked to read into the book -- then, well then, Motteuxs translation is the only option, and it is a good option. Of course it requires a reader who actually is interested in what the author has to say; a reader who understands that despite portions of a more universal appeal, there speaks a voice from the past and a witness to the paraphernalia of a very different world. To &Ograve;translate&Ograve; this into a &Ograve;modern&Oacute; idiom, slick and slangy that would suit our TV-trained Pavlovian giggle-response to silly sound-bites, would be the next thing to publicly performed necrophilia. I repeat: not every modern translation is junk, some are competent and full of good intentions, the kind that pave the road to hell, but translating should not replace an authors carefully crafted style with the jargon of another period, even if this should strike the naive reader as catching. But then, this is Cervantes, an author who couldnt care less about the stylistic obsessions that possessed a Flaubert or Joyce. Yet it has at least to be the style of his period to get the right feel for the Dons adventures. And even Cervantes had moments when his dialog spread wings and soared, though not too often."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"For any one that has heard the story of the windmills and thought &quot;Sounds funny but stupid,&quot; BUY THIS BOOK. The story of the windmills is not at all funny compared to Cervantes' subtle humor and satire masterfully woven throughout this book. If you think the book is a bit long after the first part (I was beginging to think so), READ ON. Part two is much better than Part One. Cervantes is never-suffiently-to-be-praised!"},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"The tale of Alonzo Quixana, or as he calls himself, Don Quixote, and his partner, Sancho Panza, is one of the greatest works of satirical literature I have ever read. Making fun of religion, chivalry, and more, this book is not one to be forgotten over the ages!"},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"There's more to Don Quixote then tilting with windmills! (All though that was a fun part. ;) )Cervantes' character is one whom I've come to love because he is a he is a man who goes his own way. Fans of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; should go DIRECTLY for Cervantes' book as it is far more than what was conveyed on the stage. Samuel Putnam's translation is the greatest! I found his notes to be very very useful."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"O most valiant and courageous Knight of the Rueful Figure! Through your exploits and conquests the great deeds of chivalry still pervade our consciousness. Don Quixote, you, who suffer the occurrences of malignant and frequent enchanters, whose sole objective is to persecute you, still remain wholeheartedly the one who exists and lives for the greater good of honor and for your beautiful lady, Dulcinea. Do endeavor to continue this great history, and sally forth with your loyal and droll squire Sancho Panza to conquer the evils that flourish within our world!Miguel Cervantes' Don Quixote has been dubbed many things: 1) the greatest book in the Modern English language, 2) a bitter satire aimed at dispelling the superfluous books on the theme of chivalry and romance, 3) an adventure tale with master and servant going forth into the world in search of conquests. It would be accurate to say this work is all these and then some.We may or may not think only of the \\"windmill\\" scene when the book Don Quixote is mentioned, but this is only one part of a book so rich in characters, details, adventures, and prose that, even though it a rather lengthy \\"classic,\\" it is hard to put down. Perhaps this is because Cervantes does an excellent job of intertwining comedy and adventure, illusion and reality, satire and seriousness, in the knight's exploits. The book delves into the notion that chivalry and honor can be a form of madness.The differences between Don Quixote and his loyal squire, Sancho, are quite apparent. Sancho, although labeled simple and dense, transforms in some respects from the beginning to the book's second part. Although he keeps his realistic view of the world, he is able to acquire the role of governor (at least in his mind), and he begins to come to a better understanding of Don Quixote's view of knight errantry. Don Quixote, meanwhile, lives in an idealistic world for most of the book, and believes that forces outside his control (such as enchanters, evil, etc) are the reason for their many disasters and ordeals. He truly believes that an ideal world will exist if he follows the rules of knight-errantry. Even when he feels he is beaten, he continually strives to do pick himself up: \\"I risked everything for adventure; I did my best, and was overthrown, and though it cost me my honor, I did not lose, nor could I lose my integrity, and I can still fulfill my promise.\\" (pg 1000)One of my favorite aspects of the novel was the adventures with the Duke and the Duchess. They concoct such an extravagant illusion to get Don Quixote and Sancho to believe in their roles of honor and worth, presenting Don Quixote excessive illusions to confirm his greatness and Sancho with his long-awaited role of governorship. However, along the way to doing this, there seems to be a feeling that the duke and the duchess are seemingly the \\"crazy\\" ones because of the depth to which they go to keep this illusion alive. The importance that Don Quixote and Sancho exert is depicted during the Duke and Duchess' games because there is a sense that they never want the adventure to end also, even if it is just a gag, and so they become almost equals in certain respects to the knight and his squire.Overall, this is an enjoyable and fun tale, one that will have you laughing out loud sometimes. Entertaining, funny, and wonderfully written, Don Quixote is one of the best classics out there, and , although quite lengthy, it is a book that can be picked up after a while and continued because each chapter is another story."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"As I look over the reviews of the classic works of literature, I am appalled by how often I see the word boring being used. I guess it's because great books don't come with big screens, speakers and a joy stick. Welcome to the Millenium"},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"this is a pretty funny book about an errant-knight and his many misadventures. only problem is, there's really only one joke in this massive (1000+ page) book, namely, what a fool and madman this gallant knight is. after a while, the joke begins to wear thin. i don't think this is the greatest novel ever written. it's too poorly stuctured and one-dimensional for that grand distinction. i think the reason this book IS so famous is because of the character of don quixote himself. the image of the mad don charging giant windmills is one of the most colorful and memorable in all fiction. don quixote is one of the few examples of a character who transcends the book that created him. hamlet and falstaff are two other examples.a good read, but doesn't live up to the hype."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"I used this book to help me fall asleep each night... just 5-10 pages each night (it took me 6 months to finish it). After having plowed through War and Peace and Les Miserables in a similar fashion over the last few years, this book was initially refreshing. I found the first part (first half) to be very interesting... though it was repetitive. 1. Don Quixote and Sancho stumble on random group of people 2. Don Quixote attacks random group 3. Don Quixote gets his *** kicked 4. Rinse 5. Repeat. The second half of this book was very difficult for me to get through. The plot really seemed to break down, and the author spent far too much time dealing with non-sensical things like enchantments by the duke and duchess. Although Sancho being governor was refreshing. He was a very good governor. Overall, what I liked about this book was the dialog between Sancho and Don Quixote. As I read it, I jotted down quotes by Don Quixote that are as true today as they were 500 years ago. Some of his quotes about love and humanity really struck a chord with me. Overall I'm glad I read this book, and got a lot out of it, but it really was rough going in a lot of places. Going back to comparing the first and second parts... the first part had a lot of anecdotes that had nothing to do with either Don Quixote or Sancho. This really bothered me as I read it. But as I read through the second part, I was wishing for more of these anecdotes (the author apparently recieved complaints about the anecdotes during the 10 years between parts). It would have broken up the monotony of the drivel of much of the second part."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"The translation is perfect except, as the translator has noted, on the poems found through out the book. The book itself is just plain beautiful, the author, Cervantes, is a master of prose and creativity, not to mention he has a great sense of humor. In my opinion, he is not too far off from Shakespeare. A+"},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"What Monte Python did for the King Arthur legend in their movie &quot;The Search for the Holy Grail&quot;, Cervantes did four hundred years ealier with the entire medieval knighthood tradition of chivalry and fighting. If you read some of the original stories about &quot;knights errant&quot;, such as Le Morte d'Arthur, you can appreciate to a greater degree Cervantes fine parody. If you can read Spanish (and I can't) you will also enjoy Cervantes puns throughout the text. I laughed myself silly while reading this. Don Quixote is as ridiculous in the adventures he undertakes while looking for his fair lady, Dulcinea, as his shrewd squire Sancho Panza is comically pragmatic. Together they make an interesting pair. It's true this is a rather long novel, but the rewards of humor (and occasional wise comments from Sancho) are well worth the time."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"Almost everyone knows about Don Quixote battling the windmills that he mistakes for giants. Of course, that is only one very, very small part of the story. The many adventures encountered (and created) by the brave Knight of Mournful Countenance and his faithful squire Sancho Panza make for enjoyable, if sometimes frustrating reading. The frustrating part is the tendency of Cervantes to veer off the path of the central story onto side roads that deals with the stories of peripheral characters. However, Cervantes himself realizes this by the time he composes Part Two, which was written ten years later than the first part, and his self-depracation makes the meanderings of the first part forgivable.Everything else is purely enjoyable. Some sections of the novel are hysterical, but there is always a melancholy undertone because, the fact is, Don Quixote is a man living in a state of unreality, an object of ridicule and sport (and sometimes, suprisingly, admiration) to the world. The faithfulness of more aware, though simpleminded Sancho Panza is a testament to the loyalty of friendship, although the limits of friendship are tested often. Sancho's character is more fully developed in Part Two, as he is shown to be somewhat of an idiot savant, a prattler of endless proverbs who sometimes stumbles into near genius. By the end of the book, I found Sancho to be a more interesting character, to me, than Don Quixote himself.This book took me several months to read. Although an extremely long book, it lends itself to being read in bits and pieces, sometimes with long intervals between readings. While I felt a sense of accomplishment in reading the almost 1200 pages, I was almost sad to see it end, which is high praise for a book such as this. &quot;Don Quixote&quot; is a classic in the best sense of the word."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"The play Man of La Mancha was uplifting in its way, but was also very depressing. The movie versions of Don Quixote were also downers. But the book ... this is a winner! It's beautiful. It's also really funny.There are no major villains in the book. The rich and powerful people who mock the old man do it gently, in fun, almost lovingly. Even the man who defeats Don Quixote isn't evil - he's just trying to help. In the end, his supposed enemies are by his side, encouraging him to continue his quest.Don Quixote is a man who actually lives out his dreams. That's one thing I'll never do. He's very brave, although that starts to slip in Part Two. He's a dear man. His squire Sancho Panza is a riot. Sometimes it's hard to tell which of the two is the star.This book is a love story, not between Don Quixote and Dulcinea, but between him and his friend Sancho, between him and most of the characters he meets, and between Sancho and his donkey. It can also be a love story between the reader and the characters.There are some faults. Every book is a product of its time and place, and this book was written in an offensively authoritarian and antisemitic place and time. Somehow even though Cervantes soaked up the faults of his society he still wrote a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"Don Quixote well deserves its place in the pantheon of world classics. For me, it's the ultimate desert island book. It is simply an indescribable jewel, full of fun, hilarity, adventure, beauty, wisdom, social commentary, tragedy, and entertainment. And I believe that J.M. Cohen's translation is the best there is. He obviously had a love for the material and left us a beautifully rendered work. The encomium in his Times obituary was on the mark when it said that he was \\"the translator of foreign prose classics for our times.\\""},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"When I was thirteen, I was told to read a four-volume book, in Spanish, which was supposed to be funny. For me the vocabulary level was pretty hard, though I found a simple though sensible portrait of Idealism. I longed for being like him.Now, I read this book, in English, ten years later. It reminds me that grown-ups tend to lose sensitiveness. This noble man, who fought for what he thought was worthwhile regardless of anybody else, contradicts what we see in our current reality: people who don't dream about anything."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"This is not a book to read in a few long sittings; its short chapters and diversified plot allows you to read bits of it slowly, to enjoy its subtle messages and subplots. I just took a tour of reviews here, and the simple fact that it spurs so much controversy and different interpretations attests to its grandiosity.The &quot;plot&quot; is well-known: an old gentleman reads so many chivalry stories that he comes to think of himself as one great knight, and so sets about to find adventures, to &quot;right wrongs and injustices&quot;. He takes his neighbor Sancho Panza as his servant. There's much you can see in the book: analogies, metaphors, allegories. Idealism/pragmatism; honor/convenience, etc. It's funny, it's crude, it's tough, it's tender, it's rude.Some value-added is the glimpse on Medieval-turning-Renacentist Spain, the life on the roads, the bandits, the &quot;hotels&quot; and the idiosincracy of the time. Other characters are also memorable, and some of the sub-stories, which bother some readers, I think they're great.So this very old book deserves all the praise it gets, although negative opinions are also respectable. It has aged well in my opinion, because it is about eternal features of us humans."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"This is a mammoth of a book. Spanning about 750 pages of small text in my edition, Don Quixote tells a story of how the Don became crazy from reading too many knight-romances and imagined the world to really be like that. Together with his faithful squire Sancho Panca, they traveled through Spain getting into adventure after adventure and beating after thrashing.That's the basic story. But the book has long ago been heralded as a profound one. Indeed, the two main characters are one of the strongest western archetypes. Firstly, it satirises texts like epics and romances which were very popular in the Middla Ages. Secondly, it presents Quixote's misguided idealism juxtaposed with the pragamatism of the world at large. As a result, we grow to love him and empathise with him. There may be no damsels in distress to save from monsters in Quixote's Spain but we still think of him as a noble spirit. This, I think is one of the main points of the book. Thirdly, the book being so long and complete gives so many details about life in Spain that it's an interesting feature in itself.The translation I read (Motteux) is ok but at times quite hard to follow. Be warned that the text is not an easy read! But the way it's told is rich with stories within stories and everything has a both a point and satiric value.The only reason I don't give the book 5 stars is that it really IS too long. I know Cervantes had all this to say but it gets a little counterproductive to have the Don struggle through sooo much. Still, I don't recommend abridged versions as so many incidents contain a gem that will get you to either smile or shudder that it's worth struggling through the masterpiece.All must read this amazing book. Funny, tragic, great."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"DON QUIXOTE, Cervantes classic novel of a world-weary dreamer who imagines himself to be a knight in the modern world has been retold countless times since it was first written. It has been the basis for books, movies, songs, musicals, comics, etc. The story is a wonderful yarn filled with wit and humor, vivid images, and just the right amount of inspiring messages. Candlewick Press has recently released this latest retelling of the novel by Martin Jenkins and illustrated by Chris Riddell. DON QUIXOTE is a massive novel and its size often discourages modern readers from even taking a glance at the book. Using the language of a modern master storyteller, Jenkins has kept the major events and overarching story arc of the novel and condensed it into a shorter format that retains the essence of the original story both in style and substance. He is assisted in his efforts by the lavish illustrations of Riddell whose images bring to life the vivid characters and situations the novel describes. In fact, in this version of the story, the illustrations are key as each page of written word has been supplanted over black and white drawings of things happening in the story while every five to ten pages there are full page colored illustrations without any text at all.I love the story of Don Quixote and though I personally do not like abridgements or written retellings of previously published works, I am quite sure that Jenkins retelling of DON QUIXOTE will introduce many younger readers to some great characters and situations and hopefully lead them to eventually reading the complete novel.Recommended for parents to read as a bedtime story for very young children, for advanced elementary students, and for early middle school students."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"I once read that if, while hobnobbing with the educated crowd, you are asked if you had read Don Quijote, a good way to impress with out lying is by simply responding, &quot;Not in English.&quot; This is supposed to imply that a.) you are fluent in other languages, b.) you have read the novel, and c.) you are not willing to settle for a mere translation. I was quite willing to settle for this line for several years, until I did something I had never expected myself to do before. Radically, I read the book, and not in English at that. I was amazed that such a hilarious farce could be written so long ago by someone who seemed to have so little going for him. Once you really commit yourself to reading the book, it truly colors your outlook on life. You start to see things from the viewpoint of our good old, clueless hero, Don Quijote. So much of our modern literature has attempted to recreate the style of this novel it is amazing. As I have said it is hilarious on the surface, and don't even get me started on its polical overtones.

There is two parts. The second was written ten years later; it has a different feel, perhaps not delivering the punch as the first. Helpful footnotes abound (unusual for a novel) to help the reader. It was a surprisingly good read, although, I can't help but wonder what was lost in translation.Cervantes' unique word play overflows; he proclaims Christian thought and wisdom, even though his Catholic upbringing is evident. Allow me to share a humorous morsel: \\"[a]nd I wouldn't dare put the point of a pin between a woman's yes and no, because it wouldn't fit.\\"The focus of the story is of course, the quest and exploits of the mounted, errant knight, Don Quixote; and a knight would not be complete without a squire.

But it is a wonderful packaging of the whole 1000+ pages that is both readable and shelvable. No thousand-page paperback will survive an actual reading as anything you would want excepting as backup next to the latrine.Did I mention that it is a great book, great story? Well, others over the years have managed that :-). But I will loudly agree. I'm rereading it only now after a 35 year hiatus (yes, indeed, classics can be lost on the young - thats why you want books that last. In 35 more years, when you turn your lance back toward targets you thought you left behind, a copy will cost you [a lot of money]). It is just plain startling in its innovations and story.

Don Quixote is convinced that the windmill is a giant and fights him fiercely. When people (mostly Sancho) points out to him that the giant is really a windmill he draws upon the explanations given in all the knight books: The transformation of the giant into a windmill is the work of an evil wizard. As we see through the book this is a general way of explaining metamorphosis. The only reason Don Quioxte is considered a madman is that his way of explaining phenomena is not accepted in this period of time. What often surprises people meeting Don Quixote is that in all other aspects than knighthood he speaks very sensible! When Don Q. gives his speach about soldierlife vs. scholarlife everybody consider this wise and profound. If someone said anything like that today he would be considered a complete fool. So everything in the world, even the most 'banal and real' thing as a windmill, does not stand alone but is connected to the theories and language we use to describe them."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"In response to the author from NYC, I have to say that one must understand when reading this book, that Cervantes was a forerunner of his time. In 1600, the modern literary tradition of the novel was not yet a tradition, the printing press having not yet existed for full two centuries. In fact, many of have argued that this book started that tradition.In Don Quixote, Cervantes sucessfully and humorously mocks contemporary Spanish literature while at the same time, inadvertently, gives the modern reader a glimpse into Spain and the rest of the 16th century world with various stories from Barbary and the Americas interwoven into the plot.However, for anyone interested in the development of the novel or the history of Spain and Spanish culture around 1600, you will love Don Quixote. For others, it may be a small struggle to get through the plot, which can be sluggish at times, but the humor that Cervantes sprinkles throughout should make it bearable.Finally, I must mention that the translation by J.M. Cohen is one of the best translations of any foreign language novel I have ever come across."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"This is one of the greatest novels of all time, but parts of it are dated.

There are abridged versions, to be sure, even &quot;kids&quot; versions, but if you're going to do this at all, I say swallow the pill and go for a full translation (1,000+ pages).Since the main story has been covered further down the list, I'll just touch on a point or two that were pertinent to my experience. There were more than a few digressions from the main story in the first part (I thought they'd NEVER leave the inn the second time). To keep it short, everything that bothered me about Part One bothered Sanson Carrasco, too (that chapter was definitely and interesting way for the author to meet his critics halfway). I'm going to give you the advice you're probably going to get from EVERYBODY: if part one leaves you shaking your head, keep moving, because part two delivers undiluted Knight of the Rueful Figure with very few middlemen.In the Signet edition, Mr. Starkie also throws in an introductory essay about Cervantes and a decent amount of footnotes to point out the references to genuine chivalric literature...always a good thing.If your project this summer (this fall, this year, or whenever) is to fill your head with interesting ideas, Don Quixote is a good book to visit."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"Don Quixote is a true classic.

And I have to admit that, yes, Cervantes does drag on a bit. But critics of the novel's length are doing the work a misservice. We must remember that this book was written well over four centuries ago, when the very concept of a linked narrative must have been more than enough to hold the reader's interest. Cervantes's energy sizzles off the page at times, and you can tell he's really having fun with the work. I loved almost everything about this book, and while I might have liked to see it trimmed a bit, I still think Cervantes did a bang up job. Oh. One more thing. I lot of people seem to like Sancho more than Quixote. I'm totally the opposite. Quixote is the dreamer, the one who dares to look at things that never were and say &quot; They might be giants &quot;. I for one think thats boss."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"If you care about textual integrity, Starkie's is the translation for you. I've compared certain phrases from the original Spanish by Cervantes and, of all the English versions I've seen, this is the most faithful. There is another version out there, often Nortonized, that leads the reader possibly astray from author intention. For instance, in Part One, Chapter Five, Putnam quotes Quixote as saying, \\"I know who I am, and who I may be, if I choose...\\" The original says, \\"I know who I am...\\" and proceeds with a catalogue of medieval romance characters. Samuel Putnam's translation appears in Modern Library and some Norton anthologies: don't buy it unless you're 19 and want to be inspired with a Sartrian sort of freedom that I'm not sure Cervantes advocates. Be it admitted, Norton anthologies target the young, and if you don't want to grow old before your time, then buy a Norton anthology with Putnam's translation of _Don Quixote_. Norton gives you a focus that may not be too off-target. Plus, it'll be an abridgement that'll save you many hundreds of pages of reading.The Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces, 4th editionSorry for the length."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"How do I, a literary amateur, rate a book nearly 400 years old that has been acclaimed by not a few scholarly experts as the greatest novel ever written? I feel a bit like the boy who had the temerity to point out that the emperor was naked, for I have failed to award Don Quixote five stars. Judged by modern-day standards, Cervantes could be accused of sloppiness. He confuses the chronology of his own storyline in several places, though this is as charming as it is perplexing. Seeking to satirically skewer the tales of chivalrous knights-errant popular at the time, Cervantes presents us with Quixote, a loveable madman, and his squire, Sancho Panza, who fluctuates between utter naivete and admirable sagacity throughout. The pair are nothing if not endearing. Sallying forth to right wrongs, assist the down-trodden, and punish the wicked, the two find themselves in a pragmatic and cynical world, astonished and humored by the lunatic idealism of Quixote and the simpleminded fealty of his squire.Over the course of 5 weeks I read Don Quixote and the experience was varied. At times enthralled, at times merely mildly amused, I looked eagerly forward to resuming the book and, on occasion, half-heartedly attempted to avoid it. To be blunt, there is much in the book that borders on childlike innocence, but there is much as well that strikes a deep chord of love, idealism, perserverence, and grace. On the surface, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza could be regarded as fools. Beneath this foolishness, however, lie the hearts of lions and an unconquerable spirit which provide the ultimate reward to the reader.The book ends abruptly and badly. After so many adventures through so many pages it was disappointing to behold the manner in which Cervantes opted to close. However, this should by no means dissuade the potential reader. Indeed, Don Quixote, for everything wonderful contained within it, should be read by all. For those who choose to do so, the Putnam translation is outstanding and footnoted with excellent detail."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"What else can someone say about &quot;Don Quixote&quot;?I have Pablo Picasso's pen and ink drawing of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza hanging on the wall.

But if you have never read the book, you don't remember other things about the story.You don't remember how the old man went insane when they walled up his library? You don't remember in &quot;Don Quixote, Part Two,&quot; the old man and Sancho Panza at the printers reading about themselves in the new book titled &quot;Don Quixote, Part Two&quot;?Sancho picks up the galley sheets and reads about themselves up tp the very point where they are at the printers reading about themselves. The author of those galley sheets is Miguel Cervantes, whom they have heard of and like very much.Who can imagine characters in a novel approving of the author who created them? We had to wait five hundred years before Luigi Pirandello wrote something similar in his play, &quot;Sic Characters In Search of an Author.&quot;Sancho reads part of the new book entitled &quot;Don Quixote, Part Two&quot; by a different author.

I listened to this on a road trip to California and found it very enjoyable. They did cut a major section, but I guess that is what you contend with in an abridged version."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"My conception of the quixotic dreamer is someone who has the courage to dream big, in spite of the nay-sayers of the world. I was surprised to see that Cervantes did not share my sympathy for dreamers- it was obvious he felt that Don Quixote was simply a fool, and nuts to boot. I kept hoping that Quixote would be vindicated at some point, that something good would come of his grandiose fantasies, but instead, he repents of his adventures on his deathbed, and dies a normal man, rather than a noble knight. I was crushed. I think part of the problem is that Cervantes was bitter about something, and this was written as a biting satire of the politics and society of Spain in the early 1600's. I often got the feeling that a certain misadventure of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza (his trusty squire) was supposed to be funny or socially relevant, but I just wasn't getting the joke. Note to self- political satire doesn't age well. Plus, it was really long. On the positive side, I loved Sancho, and I was glad that Cervantes showed him some sympathy at least. He develops throughout the book from a dopey yokel into a mature, wise, yet uncomplicated man. In a sense he is the novel's true hero, and its saving point for me."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"The book I read was entitled Don Quixote by Miguel Cervantes. The book is a very long and exhausting book. However, the story line is a very popular one. In fact I found that within the first 50 pages, the story seemed strangely resemble that of the movie Toy Story. I will tell you why that is a little later. I found this book to be a very good one, even though it was hard to understand at times, I still enjoyed it. The vocabulary of this book is extensive and in order to understand it, one must have a large vocabulary. I do not believe I would recommend this book to anyone who was not looking for a challenge because this book is very challenging. I was not looking for a challenge, but I had one anyway. I even read abridgement of the book. This book is almost identical to that of the movie Toy Story. Allow me to explain. In the movie, Buzz Lightyear &quot;comes to earth after being thrown off course.&quot; Of course he is not a space ranger like he says. The same is true for Don Quixote, he believes himself to be a knight, but in fact he is not. Like any good knight, there is a horse, just like that of Buzz's spaceship. Try to follow along. Like in any story there is always a girl. That girl in this story is Dulcinea del Toboso. Don Quixote is going to Toboso to find his fair lady. Now someone must keep Don Quixote in line, or try to, and he is Sancho Panza. Sancho could be compared to Woody. Woody continually reminds Buzz that he is not a space ranger instead he is a toy. Sancho is much more respectful that Woody, but he still constantly reminding Don Quixote that he is a knight, but not a very good one. Don Quixote proves himself to be &quot;a few bricks short of a full load&quot; after he attacks a field full of windmills mistaking them for giant beasts. Don Quixote also kills many peasants while on his journey to Toboso. Most of these murders were because of mistakes. Don Quixote thought that a group of Monks with a carriage had two women tied up in the carriage and they were going to imprison them. So Don Quixote attacks them and kills a monk, when in fact they were merely traveling. There are many more examples of this. Finally, when Don Quixote reaches Toboso only to find his lady not there, he is arrested and thrown into a cage and sent back home. Sancho Panza was Don Quixote's squire, and every squire of a knight is awarded an island to govern. Sancho received his island and after only ten days he decided to go bak. On his way back, he and Dapple, his donkey, fall into a hole. Don Quixote comes along and rescues them and so they are reunited. They decide to travel to Barcelona to find Dulcinea, but again are unsuccessful. Don Quixote was so heart broken that his health began to fail and he eventually died. That was probably the most brief summary of Don Quixote ever written. There was so much happening in this book, I do not know if one could summarize it without rewriting the entire book. So, I guess the only way to discover the real story is to sit down and read one of the greatest works in literary history, Don Quixote by Miguel Cervantes."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"The only portion of this novel that is ever mentioned is the &quot;tilting at a windmill&quot; episode, which takes place in the first 20 or so pages of this 1000 page bore. I suspect most readers never got much farther. The protagonist, who is often spoken of as a long-suffering man on a noble quest who preserves his dignity in the face of numerous misfortunes, is actually nothing of the kind. He is a mean-spirited old crackpot who perpetrates repeated acts of violence against innocent people and who is deservedly trounced every time. The main character is offensive, the plot is thin, the story much too drawn out, and the style dull. The book was actually meant to be a satire of the romance novels of the day, but its intent is lost in the excess of its verbosity. Were it not for its few moments of humor, I would rate it a zero."},{"Title":"Don Quixote de la Mancha,","review":"very boring abou the squire, i encourage everybody to no read this boring book, althogh it was pretty amazing"},{"Title":"Blues Harmonica Collection","review":"Ordered as a gift from a family members wish list...

Once you get past that you want to play some real blues and almost every instructional book teaches you how to play &quot;Oh Suzanna&quot; and &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot;. This book shows you in simple tablature how to play all of your favorites by Sonny Boy Williamson 2, Little Walter, Howlin' Wolf and more. Some songs are more difficult than others, but Love in Vain or Don't Start Me Talkin' are not much harder than Oh Suzanna and a lot more fun to play.That is the kind of thing that keeps aspiring players interested.

If you're ready to really study a huge load of licks and choruses by the masters, buy this book!"},{"Title":"Blues Harmonica Collection","review":"There are many good books that teaches you how to begin playing the bluesharp. They have some short harpsolos that you can learn to play, but they are usually to few. For a long time I've tried to find a book with bluessolos containing tabulature for harmonica and finaly I found this wonderful book called Blues Harmonica Collection. The book is not suiteble for beginners but if you've played the bluesharp for a while and know how to play bendnotes, this is probably a challange for you. There are chords, notes, text and harmonica notation of songs recorded by great harmonica players as Sonny Boy Williamson, Jimmy Reed and Little Walter for example. Many of the solos are difficult to learn but many of the songs are possible to listen to on record and that is a great help. But even if you don't have the records there are still many riffs and licks that you can learn from and practice. I have played the harmonica for a while but I've always had trouble with creating/building a nice solo - but this book has taught me alot about how some of the great harpplayers played their solos and fill-ins."},{"Title":"Blues Harmonica Collection","review":"The other reviewers have very well said how great this book is so I won't repeat what they have written. It is amazing though that this is about the only book of harp tab available although given the fact that harp isn't as pop culture as guitar this probably makes sense. There's another book of tunes out by Glen Weiser (also on Amazon) that I haven't checked out and even though it only has about half as many tunes as this collection does I will probably eventually get it. Weiser also has a collection of fiddle tunes, Irish and American, for harmonica in tab form. After I got this Blues Harmonica Collection I also got the &quot;His Best&quot; collections of both Sonny Boy Williamson and Little Walter which have a good many of the songs contained in the book. It may be a good idea to have at least a C, D, and an A harp which will let you play along with about 15 or so songs in the book that are in these keys. There may be a good chance you already know a bit about harp and have a few of these keys so of course my &quot;tips&quot; here are maybe only for more novice players. (like myself!) A good choice of harp if you're getting started may be the Hohner Special 20 or the Lee Oskar. They were both about 20 bucks if you shop around a bit online although I recently saw the Oskars go up about an extra 5 bucks almost everywhere all at the same time! They are really nice harps though. Only other thing I might add is to also highly recommend the Rock n Blues Harmonica book by Jon Gindick and the Bluegrass Harmonica book by Mike Stevens."},{"Title":"Blues Harmonica Collection","review":"&#2951; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!When I purchased this book back in 2004, I was reaching an intermediate level of expertise with playing the blues, but my note bending was still wobbly and inconsistent. It has taken me a few years (and LOTS of practice) to grow into this great treasure chest of classic Chicago-style blues. When I purchased this book in 2004, I could find no other collection of blues harmonica tablature like this either in print or on the Internet. And now, 8 years later, there is STILL no other single collection of blues harp tablature like this to be found anywhere! This book's publisher, Hal Leonard, publishes many countless music books and sheet music collections. Some of Hal Leonard's books are better than others. This is a really great collection. But it seems that Hal Leonard hardly ever revise their books with later updates and more content, so many of their books remain in a \\"1st Edition\\" frozen state forever. And this excellent collection of blues harp tablature is no exception. I just wished that they would publish an expanded updated edition to this 20-year old book.There are 41 classic blues songs included in this book, annotated with a three-way combination of music notation, chords, and harmonica tablature. Here is the artist and song listing:Sonny Boy Williamson:All My Love In VainCheckin' Up On My BabyCool DispositionCross My HeartDon't Lose Your EyeDon't Start Me Talkin'Down ChildFattening Frogs For SnakesHelp MeI Don't KnowKeep It To YourselfLet Me ExplainLet Your Conscience Be Your GuideNine Below ZeroNinety NineOne Way OutThe KeyToo Close TogetherUnseen EyeYou Killing MeYour Funeral And My TrialLittle Walter:Ah'w BabyBack TrackBlues With A FeelingBoom Boom (Out Go The Lights)Can't Hold Out Much LongerI Hate To See You Go (Gone And Left Me)JukeJust Your FoolMean Old WorldOff The WallYou're So FineJimmy Reed:Baby, What You Want Me To DoBright Lights, Big CityHonest I DoHowlin' Wolf:Sitting On Top Of The WorldSmokestack LightningElmore James with John Brim:RattlesnakeJames Dalton with John Brim:Ice Cream ManLester Davenport:I'm A ManJimmie Rogers:Walking By MyselfThis harmonica tablature and songbook is for intermediate to advanced players only. In particular, beginning blues harp novices often have a hard time bending notes while performing the draw bends and blow bends that are often used when playing blues harp. The Amazon \\"Book Description\\" states that this book includes \\"an extensive introduction on how to play the pieces in this book\\". Ummm, seriously, the 2-page section on pages 4 and 5 entitled \\"How To Read the Harmonica Tablature Terms and Symbols\\" does NOT constitute extensive instructions on how to play the music that is annotated here. These are all intermediate to advanced level songs that will even challenge the advanced players. You can learn far more by reading an entire harmonica instruction book and watching videos, or you can learn better and faster by taking lessons from someone who is good at playing blues harp. There is no instructional guidance in this book.Even though these harmonica tab transcriptions are excellent, like any collection of guitar tablature, to play these songs with an authentic feel, you really need to be familiar with the songs too. Since the bulk of the 41 songs are from Little Walter and Sonny Boy Williamson, if you are not as familiar with their music, the following are two excellent compilations of these two blues harp masters:His Best (Chess 50th Anniversary Collection),His Best :(Little Walter)The Chess 50th Anniversary Collection. Many of the songs can be downloaded from iTunes or listened to online.If you are still a beginner who needs recommendations for good harmonica instruction books, here are two good ones:Rock n' Blues Harmonica: A World of Harp Knowledge, Songs, Stories, Lessons, Riffs, Techniques and Audio Index for a New Generation of Harp PlayersandHarmonica For Dummies.If you are an advanced harmonica player who also, like me, plays guitar, you will be pleased to note that the chords are also included in the music notation of all these songs. And then you can play both your guitar and blues harp at the same time using this:Lee Oskar Harmonica Holder, which I can now play with a few of the songs in this wonderful collection."},{"Title":"Blues Harmonica Collection","review":"Not necessarily a fan of Hal Leonard products per se. Still get some night sweats from them old accordion and piano book lessons I sat atop once upon a time. Nevertheless, this large blues harp collection is worth fighting off the spirits of those old ghosts.For Beginners, would only recommend as a place or something to eventually strive for. Hopefully, with enough desire, practice and heart, you can/will get it up there one day too.Intermediate & Advanced players will still have their challenges cut out and chops tested for them along the way also.There are more than 60 songs (way too many to list here); each song in both music and tablature provides the artist as well as which key harp i.e. A, C, F, etc. they played and whether straight or cross harp was used.The best way I'd recommend for everyone to learn any of this material is to hear it played several if not 10s or 100s of times more by the original artists. Yet while no discography is included, much of the original music can still be found. Additionally, Little Walter and Sonny Boy Williamson comprise and make up at least half the selections in this book between them alone.So in Little Walter's case, if you actually want to pay the current going rate of $70-150+ for his out-of-print \\"Essentials\\" - or even just download the songs at 99 cents a clip from iTunes whomever - by all means go for it.For those on different budgets, Sonny Boy Williamson \\"His Best\\" and Little Walter \\"His Best\\" - each sold separately but on the Chess 50th Anniversary Collection CDs; and available new on Amazon or wherever - will cover the book's songs fairly well.His BestHis Best :(Little Walter)The Chess 50th Anniversary CollectionAnd finally, for those who just like to collect these old Hal Leonard books for any type musical instrument or genre - Well, you certainly can't go wrong here anywhere either. {Just don't scare the grandkids with them, gran'pa!

If you can play these, you can work. Just don't stop there. Keep going until you have your own sound."},{"Title":"Blues Harmonica Collection","review":"The other reviews sound like advertisements for the book and don't seem to be written by anyone who actually used the book; no one related any detailed personal experience. In that respect, I can only claim to have dug deeply into Help Me, and for that song, I found many errors just on the first of the four pages; the page I cared about the most. To begin with, the key signature is wrong. The song is in F and the key signature should have one flat, not 4 flats. The key signature is also wrong for Smokestack Lightning, I Hate To See You Go and probably others. I'll check for errors as I need to. Next, McKelvy's transcription (or is he just the editor?) of Help Me is wrong in the first measure. It's not 4D 4' (4' means 4 bent); the correct transcription is 4' 4D 4' with appropriate vibrato and slides between the notes. Next, the transcription is wrong at the end of line 2. McKelvy has 3D 4D 3D 2D 1D, whereas, the correct transcription is 3' 4D 4B 3D. I could go on, but Hal Leonard needs to pay me first...This doesn't surprise me too much because Hal Leonard is noted for their beautiful book covers and big, easy to read sheet music which is usually littered with errors. I have lots of Hal Leonard books, and they are all flawed. They have a huge issue with quality control, as opposed to Mel Bay books, for instance, which are carefully edited. So buyer beware. Buy this book if you need a starting point for the music, but expect there to be errors, which you might catch with repeated listenings and good slow down software such as Transcribe! by Seventh String Software. By the way, don't make the mistake of buying the Amazing Slow Downer. ASD has a terrible 90's interface and more limitations than I care to mention. Transcribe! is cheaper and has a brilliantly designed graphic interface. You can set as many loops as you like--ASD has a limit of 10 the last time I used it. I have no affiliation with either company.Recommended for the book collector who needs a splash of purple on their book shelf."},{"Title":"Blues Harmonica Collection","review":"Blues Harmonica Collection isn't a blues harp lick book and isn't just a song book. And it isn't a harp tab book for playing the melody of songs. It's also not an instruction book. I have all these. \\"Blues Harmonica Collection\\" is different. It's a song book with the harp parts tabbed out in the appropriate places. If you've seen song books with the music tabbed out for guitar then this will look familiar. The difference is there's no guitar tab. The melody lines are written in regular music lines. So, what you may see is a couple bars of music (not tab) with the notation \\"guitar solo\\" as the intro, then two bars of melody line written in music notation (not tab) with the words underneath, then two bars of music with the harp tab underneath. Also, along with all of that, the chords are noted at the top like you'd expect to see in any music book. So, you can learn the song from intro to outro with the guitar chords, the harp licks and solos, and words. If you can play guitar and sing and play at least intermediate harp you'll love this book. If you have a friend or two to play with you'll love this book. If you want to learn just the harp parts for some great blues tunes, you'll love this book. I'll also be using it to help explain blues and blues structure to my (private) music students. If you're a beginner you probably wouldn't want to start with this book to learn on but you certainly would benefit from it by listening to the song by the original artist and following along in the book. You'll probably be able to get a mental picture of the song that will help when you're ready to attempt the songs. I would absolutely recommend this book to all levels. I'd even recommend the book to someone who only plays guitar and sings because the entire songs are there with the chords. I haven't had time to sit and play through the songs or learn the harp parts but based on sitting and looking through each page I'd have to say I would definately buy it again and I'd pay twice the price to get it. I'd like to have had a CD with just the harp parts on it but that would have been a huge project. Just pick up CDs with songs. jaysbluesBlues Harmonica Collection"},{"Title":"Swindled!

A conductor of distinction and a writer, scholar and thinker of substance, he offers a combination of personal reminiscences and exciting historical discoveries. He is a leading expert on Dvorak and his time, and offers fresh new insights into the material. His original research on Dvorak's American years has been quite influential in the development of this field more broadly and thus he may be considered the &quot;Dean&quot; of American Dvorak scholarship.This is a splendid book to read straight through, or to browse and enjoy."},{"Title":"Dvorak to Duke Ellington: A Conductor Explores America's Music and Its African-American Roots","review":"Peress's 'Dvorak to Duke Ellington' is necessary reading for any serious Duke Ellington fan or any student of the lineage of jazz.Despite long passages spoken in highly technical musical terminology (which will be manna for composers out there), Peress brings so many interesting anecdotes to light, so many fresh insights into Ellington's working methods to composing, laypersons too will gain profound wisdom into the infrastructure that later brought BeBop, hardBop, Modern, R&B;, Blues and Rock & Roll into reality.For Duke lovers, it is heartening to see Peress discover (tearfully) what we already had known: his music is a gift to world history. Peress's nuanced details as to how Duke scored his sobering emotional analyses of Black Culture is particularly stunning, he having access to rare Ellington family archives and an insiders association with the Duke.And Duke was a poet - literally. YES!I was completely taken aback at how much is owed to Antonin Dvorak, the Czech emigree, for shaping the jazz juggernaut, or more specifically, the jazz orchestral juggernaut. I am not sure that the limber modern Jazz idiom as we know it, or the Gershwin orchestral phenomenon, would have garnered legitimacy without Dvorak's extra-ordinary cheerleading of our indigenous arts such as Ragtime, sharecropper tunes, and gospel songs. There is an argument intrinsically proffered in the book that Dvorak might have assisted in the abolition of minstrelsy itself.Peress only missed a few related facts. For instance, he did not cover the Harlem Renaissance leadership and it's muscular shaping of the Jazz and Blues idioms. Those gentlemen (Dubois, et.al) also marketed the Duke heavily, and deserve a mention in this book. Peress also did not describe the original etymology of Jazz as being 'Jass,' a vulgar term coined by whites for early New Orleans jazz that meant something akin to Sexual Intercourse, which I believe should be defined in every sweeping analysis of this art.Lastly, this book reveals the star-touched career of the author, Maurice Peress, as a composer. I look forward to collecting Peress's jazz re-conditionings, as well as Classical recordings, on CD and vinyl at the soonest opportunity.Michael James HawkSeattle WA USAJuly 3, 2007"},{"Title":"Dvorak to Duke Ellington: A Conductor Explores America's Music and Its African-American Roots","review":"This book is very well written and insightful.

I also Like this book because it had great pictures. I think People of all ages should readthis book!!!"},{"Title":"Little Miss Magic (Mr. Men and Little Miss)","review":"It is well known that children process and learn information at an early age better than when they are older. Roger Hargreaves knows this fact and has chosen his children's books as a medium for conveying his bigotry and fascist principles he lives on. I will be analyzing Little Miss Magic in-depth and discussing not only plot developments but also the implications that could follow.It's easy to notice that almost all characters living in Miss Magic's social arena are fairly similar in their stature; short, lacking necks and fully developed torsos. On the other hand their skin tones vary considerably. Once would think this diversity of complexions would promote tolerance and is no doubt a mark of the author's racial attitude. However upon reading how Miss Magic justifies her treatment of Mr. Tickle, it becomes quite obvious that his form of expression is an excuse for her dogmatism.Not only did Miss Magic unscrupulously violate Mr. Tickle, she did so without dialogue or tact. Learning these traits are important in calming tensions that might otherwise lead to violence. By discovering the reasons behind one's intentions we can better understand what motivates them and possibly resolve issues diplomatically. It seems for all Miss Magic's gifts lie many shortcomings.It is quite possible that Mr. Tickle was unaware of the way his actions were negatively affecting others. Most of the feedback he received was in the form of \\"moans\\", \\"groans\\" and \\"quivering\\". From a subjective standpoint these responses could be interpreted according to ones wishes. None of these \`victims' tried to reason with Mr. Tickle clearly on a one-to-one basis. Who was the real victim of this book?Page 10 highlights an important philosophical point. What is fairness? I don't believe Mr. Hargreaves answers this question objectively. The illustration shows the majority smiling at Mr. Tickle's misfortune in much the same way Mr. Tickle smiled at them earlier. Is this fairness? It is right for our children to judge and punish others without their say while they delight in their misery?It seems very plausible that although Mr. Tickle and Miss Magic share the same social strata their upbringings were quite different. In Freudian psychology we learn how one's childhood plays an important role in their social orientation. From the beginning it is clear Miss Magic has grown up with supreme control of all her belongings; her knife, her door, her toothbrush, etc.. When she leaves her house she takes this control mentality with her and objectifies people for personal gain."},{"Title":"Al-Qa'ida: Unholy Dogs of War","review":"The book is one of the first explorations of Bin Laden's character as a MAN. He's not just a statistic at the end of this book, or even a name that used to be all over the papers. The gripping story of his beginnings, of his ever-increasing psychosis, will show any reader that there is a reason to be afraid.Personally, I loved the book - the facts were simply there, relayed for all to see, (in a way that the current administration SHOULD have done three years ago, in my opinion). Jack Mulcahey, the hero of the day, brings the perfect mix of fallible human nature and humour to a book that, without him, would probably have been too terrifying to read. Jack's travels through the embroiled Middle East and the equally-as-dangerous No Man's Land of bureaucratic red tape spoke of the glaring weaknesses in American government that the public SHOULD have known about. Jack Mulcahey represents the indomitable spirit that we as humans possess, showing us that, no matter how many times you knock him flat, he'l always get back to his feet. It made me proud to read his story, made me proud to know that, somewhere, there are still people out there who KNOW the threat, realise the threat of men like bin Laden, and will stop at nothing to keep the world safe from such a threat.The story was gripping, the facts were amazing, the characters well-rounded and terrifyingly human.

Maria Campbell's family was a mixture of Scottish, French, Cree, English, and Irish. They spoke a language completely different from the people around them. The half-breeds lost their land when the authorities reclaimed it to offer to immigrants. Thus half-breeds settled down along the road lines and crown lands where they built cabins and bars, giving them the title of \\"Road Allowance people\\". Maria was born in a home where Cheecum, her father's Cree grandmother, taught ancient Cree rituals and legends. Maria's struggle for existence was strengthened by the Cree traditions and by Cheecum's wisdom. However, this was weakened by extreme discrimination and poverty.When she was fifteen, she tried to escape from poverty and discrimination by marrying a white person. However, soon after she broke up with him and found herself alone in the slums of Vancouver where she faced drug addiction, prostitution and depression. After many years of hardship and struggle, Maria made new friends who helped her to remember Cheechum's lessons, advice and her heritage. Eventually she returned to her own people and decided to work with native organisations all across Canada. The text is mainly concerned with the frequent discrimination, its negative impact and the extreme poverty in which the Metis- Indians had to live under. The narrator of the book, Maria Campbell, conveys her sorrows and frustrations by emphasising what it is like to be a Half-breed woman and grows up between two opposing worlds: white and native. The text clearly demonstrates the existing problems regarding race within the pluralistic Canadian society. The narrator develops the argument by describing her experiences. Through her experiences, she explains how badly whites treated her and her people. She grew up as a social outcast and was constantly teased and mistreated by other school children. Throughout the novel, Maria Campbell provides many examples to show the white society's mistrust and rejection of her people. The examples show the Indians' isolation on every level of society, including the church. Not only were she and her family excluded and driven out of church, but they also had to suffer verbal insult. Whenever the Half-breeds went downtown, the town's people would yell \\"Half-breeds are in town, hide your valuables.\\" If they walked into stores, other white women and their children would leave while the shopkeepers'wives and children would watch to prevent the Half-breeds from stealing. The text discusses three important sociological concepts: discrimination, poverty and injustice. Defining these concepts in \\"cause-effect\\" context, one can see the interconnection among the three. Unjust government policies causes poverty, which in effect contributes to society's enhanced discrimination and mistrust of the Indians. While the Half-breeds represent a subculture, characterised by certain cultural traits that differs from others in the society, whites represent the dominant class who hold the power and influence. The Half-breeds were homeless because the Canadian government had unfairly taken their land away from them, so they have remained poor and unable to establish their own social institutions such as church and school. Consequently, the Half-breeds were subordinated and forced to speak the dominant language, behave the way whites do, and go to schools and churches that were built by the white society. Thus, the cultural diversity, different physical appearance, economical scarcity and a disordered life style, greatly influenced the discrimination against the Half-breeds. In the first fourteen chapters, the narrator relates the life style of half-breed families, their relationship with the white society, their traits, traditions, and their history. Through her experiences, she explains how badly whites treated her and her people. She grew up as a social ou, the Half-breeds remained relatively poorer and powerless. As the narrator states, due to poverty and lack of housing the Half-breeds had to move to \\"road-allowance-houses\\" (which are like shacks). The pages of these chapters also uncover the main cultural differences between whites and half-breeds by describing their family structure, distinct traditions and conception. These differences can be the structural elements that contribute to the uniqueness of Indian's situation. Firstly, unlike whites', half-breeds have extended family type in which two or more generations of the family members live together. Secondly, the half-breed families and other Indians live in a community where they practise their spiritual rituals, traditions and transmit their distinct cultural elements to the coming generation. It is also evident in the novel that Maria's family included her extended family and the Cheemchum taught Maria and her siblings their heritage, legends as well as cultural values and norms. Finally, the most important characteristic that sets the Indians apart from whites lies in their spiritual conception of the world. While the Indians are highly spiritual and believe in the interpretation of the natural and the supernatural, the whites strongly believe in subduing and dominating nature in order to create nature in men's image. With respect to such differences, in regards to family and community structure Indians try to sustain their distinct conception of the world as well as their distinct culture. Hence, their struggles to protect and sustain their uniqueness make them more distinct and marginal in the society. Maintaining these distinct elements also causes the Indians to remain economically weak in the contemporary industrialised Canadian society, since their belief is based on rationality rather than spirituality and the supernatural. The rest of the chapters are about Maria Campbell's life in Vancouver. The book mostly focuses on the realities of urban racism, prostitution, drug addiction and violence. Maria's husband left her without any money, which forced her to face prostitution. Within functional perspective, which is based on consensus and harmony for the benefit of society, prostitution seemed to be the only way for Maria to survive. Therefore she had to get involved in prostitution in order to survive and have enough money to raise her daughter; thus she carried out her function in society. In this process she also became addicted to drug and alcohol, because all the terrible circumstances that she faced were against her moral understanding and distinct (Half-breeds') conception of the world. So she lost her self-esteem and found herself in depression with the trap of drug addiction and alcoholism. At the end, she recovered from her addictions through the help of her own people. They helped her to regain her identity and dignity hence she started to work within \\"Native people\\" organisations throughout Canada.Campbell's experiences with discrimination, poverty, and other unfavourable things are realistic and persuasive. The examples that she gives in the novel strongly support her argument: the hardship of being \\"a half-breed woman in the white dominated Canadian society\\". Yet, at times her narrative tends to be biased since she conveys her story in a subjective manner. Especially, her easy and quick involvement in prostitution and drug addiction is questionable and difficult to understand since she was raised in a conservative and traditional Cree family. Nevertheless, The book \\"Half-breed\\" basically reflects an outstanding aspect of native people's difficulty in assimilating into the pluralistic Canadian society. It also provides a brief knowledge about how native people's distinct culture and subordinated economical or political weakness contribute their marginal and isolated position in the society. Overall, I personally think this book is useful for understanding the sociological concepts such as inequality, discrimination and poverty through the eyes of the distinct people who are discriminated against. The text offers an aspect of native people's lives in northern Saskatchewan through a half-breeds woman's experiences. The simple language and fascinating narrative makes the book more interesting and easy to read."},{"Title":"Half-Breed (Goodread Biographies)","review":"Maria Campbell tells a story of courageous survival from the perspective of a Metis woman.

My professor, a remarkably learned fellow with a tremendous knowledge of American literature, would occasionally reference it with amused appreciation. In our discussion of the Last of the Mohicans, I can still recall his enjoyment in recounting Lawrence's description of Cooper, sitting in a hotel room in a European city, with his gentleman's finery, surrounded by all of the trappings of a genteel aristocrat, living a sort of Walter Mitty life through his virtual antithesis -- Natty Bumpo, the protagonist of the Leatherstocking tales. To this day, I am amazed whenever I read this little tome, since Lawrence captures, in a few short essays, the essence of such authors as Franklin, Whitman, Cooper, and Melville. His style, so cheeky and incisive, is a joy to read. Lawrence had an astonishing grasp of what it is that makes American literature so fundamentally different from that which was composed by his own countrymen. He brings a pschoanalytic, Jungian perspective to bear on these great works, and sees in Natty Bumpo, Ishmael, and other heroes of American literature the archetypes of our collective American unconscious. Of course, this work tells us as much about Lawrence as it does about great American writers, which is why it makes such great reading. Lawrence is well known for being a novelist, but his corpus contains much else besides: travel literature, criticism, poetry, essays. This one is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature","review":"There are three reasons to read STUDIES IN CLASSIC AMERICAN LITERATURE by D.H. Lawrence. First: to better understand Lawrence and his themes. Second: to be entertained. Criticism is rarely rendered with so much passion, wit and clarity. Third: to experience American culture from an outsider's perspective, a very knowledgeable though albeit highly opinionated perspective (which makes for that entertainment value).DHL's prevailing theory is that to emerge as a distinct cultural, as well as distinct political entity free from Europe, America had to go through some growing pains before arriving at its authentic self. America had to kill off the European in its heart. He starts out with Ben Franklin, whom he gives a real trouncing for the overly self-conscious act of assigning an American character with a shopping list of virtues. (It should come as no surprise that DHL especially has trouble with \\"chastity.\\") Ben may be generating a fake, a lie, but he marks the beginning of an effort to break with the old homeland, Europe. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur is next in line for a beating. He moved his unfortunate family to the frontier, wrote the letters glowing with the accounts of the American Dream amongst the nature and the \\"savages\\" and then went back to France to revel in literary salons. When he returned, the wife and farm had met brutal ends in that American dream in which he had left them, so he settled in New York City. DHL screams, \\"Fake!\\" But Crevecoeur did announce the concept of an ideal tied to the unique attributes of the new world.DHL takes us through Cooper, Poe and Hawthorne, who begin to make progress (and also give DHL space to expound in ways that have annoyed his feminist critics), and onto Dana (TWO YEARS BEFORE THE MAST) and Melville, who go to sea to find themselves and their American consciousness. It is Melville who smashes the old mold forever and makes way for Whitman to plow through with a new road, singing that song of self.We get the tour of the past; we get, obliquely, a tour of post World War I intellectual preoccupations; and we get DHL being DHL at full throttle."},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature","review":"this is a masterpiece, and you do not have to know much about books to notice the expertise of the author, his sense of what he is writing.he has really given me an orientation into the vast lands of american letters.he has set me going into a different direction and has made me read some books again. i recommend this book to anybody with a deep interest in american letters, but please keep reading this author, he is wonderful. LUIS MENDEZ luismendez@codetel.net.do"},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature","review":"D.H. Lawrence's Studies in Classic American Literature is by no means a comprehensive analysis of the American classics at the time Lawrence wrote his collection of essays. The works of Harriet Beecher-Stowe and Mark Twain are notably missing. But Lawrence's aim was not to analyze all the seminal works of American literature. He chose specific authors who fit his agenda and constructed an evolutionary argument around them. Lawrence's main thread is that America can't emerge as a culture in its own right until it discards completely the influence of Old Europe and finds its own \\"spirit of place\\"--the sense of who the people are and what drives them. The author's search for this spirit of place results in a more or less disparaging analysis of each American author in turn, with few exceptions of genuine praise.We begin with Benjamin Franklin. Lawrence derides him for advocating \\"the perfectability of man\\" (Lawrence 15) and creating a list of virtues, and proceeds in doing the same himself. \\"I will try always to recognize and submit to the gods in me and the gods in other men and women.\\" This is of course merely a symbol; Lawrence was not pagan. But it begs the question: If we are supposed to accept all these new rules at face value, based only on Lawrence's discursive analyses and often abstract philosophizing, doesn't it stand to reason that Benjamin Franklin's rules were open to symbolic interpretation as well? I marvel at Lawrence, actually. He makes a good deal of sense, but he too hits a wrong note sometimes. And then speaks entirely in absolutes for the whole book, as if his opinion truly is the only one. Suffice to say Benjamin Franklin was a good deal more intelligent than Lawrence makes him out to be and was horrifically underserved by Lawrence.From Franklin onward, Lawrence hardly has a good thing to say about any of the American authors. Sometimes they deserve it. Hector St. John De Crevecoeur gets slammed for oversimplifying nature and idealizing the frontier lifestyle in his Letters from an American Farmer. Fenimore Cooper really gets it for romanticizing the frontier, the relations between white men and Native Americans, and for utilizing the 1800's literary conventions of his contemporaries when concocting a love triangle. I agree that the conventions were stale and unrealistic, but what can one expect when everyone wrote their historical fiction with those same tired conventions? I'm pretty sure somebody out there thinks The Last of the Mohicans is a classic of 1800's historical fiction right up there with Henryk Sienkiewicz's Quo Vadis.Poe is \\"rather a scientist than an artist,\\" because he \\"reduc[es] his own self as a scientist reduces a salt in a crucible.\\" Lawrence seems to like him until he accuses Poe of trying to make his \\"disease\\" (love) fair and attractive--which, as it turns out, is the \\"duplicity of art, American art in particular.\\" Good to know.Nathaniel Hawthorne writes hellish romance, says Lawrence, and has such a fixation with sin that it becomes stale. Thank you, Lawrence, for going after The Scarlett Letter with a vengeance. That one deserved it. Richard Henry Dana's Two Years Before the Mast is where Lawrence starts getting very metaphysical. (I wouldn't advise anyone to read individual chapters out of order. This really must be read as a consecutive whole or you won't understand a thing.)But Lawrence likes sea voyages. He has praise for Herman Melville--and criticisms. Melville is criticized for finding a tropical paradise and wanting to return to civilization. Then Moby Dick comes along, and we find out the white whale is a symbol of the \\"deepest blood-being of the white race...our deepest blood-nature.\\" We hunt him because we want to \\"subject him to our will.\\" That is, the men hunt him. Lawrence doesn't have much to say to us women other than criticize us for wearing our American suits.Walt Whitman. Lawrence really likes Whitman. He derives from Whitman the concept of true American Democracy, souls meeting on the Open Road, free to do as they please. But he still criticizes him for following the Christian doctrine in his philosophy, confounding \`sympathy' with \\"Jesus' LOVE, and with Paul's CHARITY.\\"Lawrence was a very brilliant individual, a devoted critic, and an insightful analyst. I enjoyed Studies in Classic American Literature immensely upon my first reading. For the most part, if there are faults to find in American literature he will point them out. That's all right, somebody had to do it. But I wish he'd rein it in just a little. No need to antagonize the ladies, Lawrence--or couldn't you predict that women would read your book some eighty years into the future? His trick of using he exclamation mark to prove a point was fun at first, and got really old by the time I got to Walt Whitman, though this could possible be attributed to the fact that Lawrence starts out very concrete and moves so far into the abstract that readers may have trouble following him unless they read the entire book in one sitting and keep all the cross-references fresh in their memories. He's also a little too self-important for my liking. We all know there are problems with the American classics. Did Lawrence never consider that we wouldn't like to be preached at the same way he didn't take to the self-righteous Americans like Benjamin Franklin and Nathaniel Hawthorne?"},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature","review":"In this analysis of (not always) well-known classic US authors D.

But he misinterprets sympathy as a feeling \`for', not as a feeling \`with'.

Franklin was a great man, but one of his more regrettable legacies appears in the modern WASP holier-than-thou type, the type that thinks it's inherently immoral to stay up late, and inherently moral to be a non-smoker. Take a close look at his interests and you'll see that it's to his advantage to preach what is, basically, servility. The rest of us Americans can't stand him (I'm convinced that Al Gore lost the election because he embodies this type), but his belief in his own piety remains unshaken to this day. Well, Lawrence gives him a perfectly-placed kick: check it out.All of these essays are thoughtful, funny, and insightful. Lawrence has a unique way of grasping the undercurrents of works of fiction, and many of his most surprising assertions ring true upon reflection."},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature","review":"This passionate brief survey of American Literature contains much spontaneous flowing masterful and original writing. Lawrence famous 'Trust the teller not the tale' is the motto of the work. It argues that the true creative work takes on a life of its own that even its creator cannot completely define and control.Perhaps the most famous essay in this book is Lawrence's hatchet- job of Ben Franklin who he found to be a spiteful, penny- pinching, calculating dead soul. In fact old Ben could be in certain places as lively and probably more lively than Lawrence himself.What however is most important is that Lawrence in this work understands the great subterranean and mysterious genius of a kindred spirit for him, the literary creator of the Great White Whale."},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature","review":"Useful book to understand America.Terrific.And there's more to come...."},{"Title":"Tyrant of the Badlands (The Accidental Detectives Series #4)","review":"Ricky is surprised when his grandfather asks him to come a few days earlier then his friends for their vacation in Alberta. Ricky doesn't know why until he arrives. Then, he's asked to become Rocky, juvenile delinquent. Ricky's great aunt owns a mobile home park, but recently there's been trouble. Two young men are harassing the residence, and there's a strange rumbling at night. The two adults are hoping that Ricky will be able to get a little information that will help them solve the problem. But Ricky starts to uncover a problem much bigger then anyone knew about. Will he be able to figure out what's going on?As with all the Accidental Detectives, this book moves along at a brisk pace. The characters are vivid. In this case, there's enough going on that you don't really miss Lisa, Ralph, and Mike, but they add something major when they do show up. The opening few chapters are hilarious. I thought I remembered the plot of this book from reading it years ago, but I found I'd forgotten lots and was still surprised by the ending.This is a perfect summer reading book. It's fast and fun and will keep anyone entertained from the first page to the last."},{"Title":"Dharma Beads: Making and Using Your Own Buddhist Malas","review":"Enough beads for making 3 small wrist malas (carnelian, an oddly colored tiger's eye, and an unfragrant sandalwood) are included in this very basic kit, along with an 80-page book that lightly touches on the history and use of malas, and beads in general. The photos and graphics are pleasant, but there is far less depth of information in this book than I was hoping for. A few mantras are included (along with some suggested affirmations) but not many, and the instructions for making the malas are so basic that if you've ever done any beadwork at all you could easily figure it out yourself. No information is included on using ornate knots for closing, or how to include a traditional tassel, and, in fact, the closure used for these three malas makes use of a specialized bead with an extra half-hole 90-degrees out from the usual holes -- I've searched but cannot find any more of these &quot;mother beads&quot; or &quot;guru beads&quot; out there so I don't know what use learning this method really is (unless you're going to drill your own). And, in fact, one of the three mother beads I got was very badly drilled and was useless.I did learn a few interesting facts, and the chapter on the properties of various stones was perhaps the most useful. As well, I gained three very basic home-made malas (one with a mother bead I provided myself, tied off in a different manner than suggested), but overall this book and kit was a disappointment.For those devoted to the Tibetan cause, it should be noted that the book and kit are made in China."},{"Title":"Dharma Beads: Making and Using Your Own Buddhist Malas","review":"I thought that this slickly packaged kit was a great idea and was looking forward to learning how to make malas and finding out more about other traditions than my own (I am a Zen Buddhist).Much to my dismay, I discovered that the small book included was definitely a case of style over substance. The info was sketchy at best and had very little hard information about Buddhist malas and their manufacture and use.The beads included in the kit were the icing on the cake. They were alleged to be tiger eye, carnelian and sandalwood. I know these materials and the beads were nothing of the sort. The &quot;tiger eye&quot; beads were some kind of synthetic chatoyant material. The &quot;carnelian&quot; beads appeared to be white plastic with a reddish coating. The &quot;sandalwood&quot; beads were white softwood,with a black finish, and no perceptible sandalwood scent.I was so taken aback by the disparity of the box and the contents, I took the kit back and got a refund for it. I also wrote a letter of complaint to the publisher protesting the inaccuracy of the labelling.It was perhaps my own fault for buying a kit put together by someone connected with a fashion magazine rather than a serious follower of the Dharma.This smacks greatly of exploiting a brief jewellery trend rather than any real attempt to bring this information and practice to others.I was very, VERY disappointed."},{"Title":"Dharma Beads: Making and Using Your Own Buddhist Malas","review":"I purchased this &quot;kit&quot; yesterday and was very dissapointed with it. Upon close inspection of the beads furnished with the kit I noticed that the &quot;carnelian&quot; beads, that the book leads you to believe are truely carnelian, are actually made of plastic. (You can tell by looking inside the drilled hole in the bead...it is white inside. True carnelian would be a uniform color inside and out.) I'm not really sure what the &quot;tiger's eye&quot; beads are made of. I'm sure they are some sort of synthetic fiber optic material. Also upon inspection of the drilled hole on the &quot;sandalwood&quot; beads i noticed that the outside of the bead has been stained to obtain its &quot;natural color&quot;. How dissapointing! I'm guessing the makers of this kit didn't really care about the true nature of the religion the stamped on the outside of the box, but instead were thinking about capitalism!"},{"Title":"Dharma Beads: Making and Using Your Own Buddhist Malas","review":"Well, to be honest, I bought this kit at (a store), but I must also voice a concern with the poor manufacture of this product. The sandalwood beads did have an aroma....but not sandalwood. It was easy to tell that they had been stained to make them darker than they really were. The tigers eye varied in color, from yellow to almost to a green, and if it werent for that fact I would guess they were plastic. Perhaps the most offensive to my intelligence was the fact that the \\"carnelian\\" beads were not just plastic, but white plastic with red paint that wears off gradually with wear. I have cut apart the wrist malas and used the wood and \\"tigers eye\\" beads in other various necklaces and whatnot. The \\"carnelian\\" beads for the most part i threw away. The book was slightly better than the beads, but not much. The bulk of the book was spent talking about the special properties of materials it didnt include, and most of them they didnt even profess to include, and also talked about what a mala is (decent enough, although little information) and rosaries in various other religions (although judging by the quality of this product, it isnt likely that this information is 100% accurate). They gave rather confusing and vague instructions on stringing the mala, and didnt really even make that great looking a mala.Also my kit was missing a few of the wooden beads! Please, do not purchase this product, you are better off learning about malas via the internet and purchasing your own beads from a craft store or something."},{"Title":"Dharma Beads: Making and Using Your Own Buddhist Malas","review":"When I first purchased the kit, I was pleased that there was a product on the market that was both entertaining and might get kids interested in meditation and/or Buddhism. I also thought it would be fun to make my own mala (I am a Buddhist).Like the other reviewer, I found the accompanying booklet an odd mixture of accurate, inaccurate, and incomplete information both on malas and their usage. Furthermore, the booklet contained general information on the healing powers of gems which, although interesting, had little to do with the malas themselves.What bothers me the most about this product are the materials supplied. The kit indicates that the purchaser is obtaining genuine tiger's eye, sandalwood, and carnelian beads. It also contains instructions that refer to a particular assemblage of beads around the &quot;guru bead.&quot; To my dismay, I discovered that the &quot;tiger's eye&quot; beads are not tiger's eye at all; they are at best a different natural stone known as a &quot;cat's eye,&quot; and look extraordinarily like synthetic, fiber-optic cat's eye beads. I do not know enough about carnelian to comment on the genuineness of the carnelian beads, but given the nature of the &quot;tiger's eye&quot; beads, I suspect that the carnelian beads are synthetic as well (they bear marks of being manufactured, such as uniformly pale areas where the holes are drilled). If the wooden beads are sandalwood, they are not perceptibly fragrant; and given the fact that they are dyed black rather than kept in their natural blonde color, I doubt that they are sandalwood at all. In any event, the workmanship on the wooden beads is very poor.To top it all off, the kit supplies no tapered &quot;head bead,&quot; contrary to what is shown in the instructions, but rather a barrel-shaped bead. The buyer is left to infer that he or she must use the &quot;extra&quot; separator beads to provide a place to tie off the elastic cord; otherwise, the knots just slip through the barrel-shaped bead.On a trivial note, the connecting elastic string lengthens with stretching, and the cut ends fray very rapidly and look &quot;cheap.&quot;How unfortunate! I think this product was well-intentioned, but cost-concerns must have led the publisher to substitute grossly inferior materials for what is promised on the box and in the instruction book.I would recommend that Buddhists and non-Buddhists avoid this product. Real malas are not terribly expensive, are beautiful, and are actually conducive to meditation."},{"Title":"Dharma Beads: Making and Using Your Own Buddhist Malas","review":"This book is full of pretty pictures, but that's about it.

It's a total waste of money.....borrow a copy from your local library!"},{"Title":"Dharma Beads: Making and Using Your Own Buddhist Malas","review":"Well, having read some of the reviews, I can say as a chinese pureland buddhist, the beads are overpriced. I have been to china on pilgrimages and full sets of the 108 beads are very much cheaper than what this set is priced. As I have strung and did decorative knots for many prayer beads for myself and others, readers should note that the beads are of the chinese type and wrist beads of 21,27 beads, normally do not have the tassels, only 36,54 and the 108 set have the decorative knots. however as readers have noted, the book should also feature the full set of 108 beads, how to string them either with extra seperator beads at every 27th bead ie 4x27=108, and how to tie the decorative chinese knots. I mean surely the publisher do not want to restrict the readers to learn how to tie the 21 wrist beads only, right? The photos featured the full 108 type used by serious buddhist for formal occasions. For those whose do not have the barrel shaped bead, I reccomend that a smaller round bead of the same colour be used. As for the frayed elastic strings, use a lighter to burn the ends after the knots are tied. As for the beads being of chinese origin, I urge people not to byocott chinese goods, I am neutral on the tibet issue but the chinese people are innocent, even chinese buddhist were persucuted on a similar scale."},{"Title":"Dharma Beads: Making and Using Your Own Buddhist Malas","review":"The book was extremely small and just a paperback. It didnt come with any beads as it should have, as this was the idea of purchasing the book, to use the beads to make a bracelet etc. Therefore the book is quite useless unless one can purchase beads elsewhere. I am very disappointed as, I was under the impression that the book came as a fixed unit ie beads, threadplus anything else to make, and the book enclosed to show how as for sale on other sites for the same amount of money .

Hyperbole? Perhaps. But few books succeed as this book does in both capturing their era (in this case the malaise days of the late 1970s) and speaking to all ages.This is the story of how one family, no more or less dysfunctional than anyone&iexcl;s, manages to do just the opposite of the title, namely, fall completely apart. It is about family whose members forget they love each other --or forget how to love each other-- until it is too late. The book is a tragedy writ both large and small.In short, not even Cheever does a better job of exposing the mix of boredom, depravity, lies and heartbreaking affection behind the picket fences of suburbia. And to top it all off Beattie manages to deal with the then trendy \\"battle of the sexes\\" without taking sides --and remember this she did nearly three decades ago. This novel needs to be rediscovered. Perhaps, its fate is due to Beattie's overshadowing success in short fiction. But there is room for both Beatties. There must be."},{"Title":"Falling in Place","review":"I knew someday I would be compelled to write a review of this book. I just had no idea it would be today. So here I am killing time on Amazon when I find out that this, one of my favorite novels, is going out of print? So naturally, I had to....I also notice the extreme polarity of opinion to Beattie's novels in the reviews below. One has to be in the right frame of mind to read Beattie, who when she wrote 'Falling in Place,' was just coming out of what the critics had called the 'minimalist' movement. Beattie's prose is quite terse, giving the reader a feeling fo averageness. Why? She is quite a realist and herein lies the hidden beauty in her words. In Beatties world the characters just are; They are not likeable or unlikeable and that is the point. No one in life is quite one or the other. And her words. At length, here's a passage from page 51:Why Spangle? Because there was no one like him, that was part of it. One day, he had taken her hand, before they were even out of bed, and asked if he could hold it all day. When they had to go to the bathroom, they walked back to the apartment, so they wouldn't have to let go of eachothers hands. They had walked along swinging hands. They had propped their elbows on a tabletop and hand-wrestled. He had kissed her hand, rubbed it. \\"I'm pretending I can keep you,\\" he said. \\"I'm pretending it's as easy as this.\\"The reader reads \\"Falling in Place\\" to fall in love with prose and characters, not plot and action. And my, there are plenty of characters worthy of attention here. Spangle, the all-too-grown up slacker, Mary, the dreary teenage girl obsessed with Peter Frampton, and Cynthia, the depressed summer-school teacher who, no matter how she tries, can feel nothing but contempt for her students.Honestly, this book is about the intertwining lives of several wandering souls and if you want plot, it's not here. If, like me, you can't help falling in love with beautiful, idiosyncratic, life-affirming characters and honey-sweet prose, pick this up. All to regretfully, you'll have to get it used."},{"Title":"Falling in Place","review":"What an excellent book this is, and what an original Beattie was, before she caved in to criticisms of her minimalism and started &quot;fleshing out&quot; her fiction (see Another You). Her gift for dialogue is without equal, and her eye is so specific she can forsake metaphor to achieve poetic, almost surrealistic, effects. It has been many years since I read this, but it was so immediate that I still remember parts as if I had read it yesterday."},{"Title":"Falling in Place","review":"I had to weigh in on this book when I saw that it had a 5-star rating because of one review. Here's a dissenting voice: I loathed it. Hated the experience of reading it, hated the characters, hated the writing style.None of the characters are at all likeable. As soon as you begin to even consider liking one, you get to hear the person's thoughts or see some action that renders them vile. People here just sort of exist, just slide through life, without dreams or ambitions or desires. They take what is handed to them--friends they dislike, stagnant relationships--without liking these things, but without even considering the possibility of taking action to change them. As much as I hate perpetuating stereotypes, I'd have to say that all of the protagonists act and think like stereotypical bored teenagers. Of everyone mentioned in the book, I can only think of one peripheral character whom I liked even a little, and that only because she showed enthusiam occasionally--and in a pivotal scene, two of the book's main characters bonded over making fun of her.The writing bored me, literally, to tears (which writing has the power to do when you absolutely have to read it for a class). I could not have cared less for her obsessive descriptions of rooms--attempts at characterization through listing, for pages and pages straight, each item lining the walls of someone's personal space. One such description went on for four entire pages. Pages simply listing objects in the room. Imagine an entire book filled with long, dry lists acting as descriptoins of mundane places inhabited by people you don't care about.If this still seems like something you'd be interested in--well, get it out of the library anyway. It's not worth buying on spec; it's only worth buying if you already know you find something redeeming inside. This was one of the flat-out worst books I read on my way to my English degree, and I can comfortably say that I found nothing to redeem it."},{"Title":"Falling in Place","review":"I had to force myself to finish this book. Just as I was going to put it down, &quot;something big&quot; happened, and I thought the story would pick up and things would be resolved. WRONG! I agree that none of the characters were likeable.

If you are a lover of poetry, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Modern Arabic Poetry","review":"According to Jayyusi view, the cultural bias favoring the group over the individual remains constant, with the poet seen as &quot;a worker producing for the group&quot; with the poetic &quot;product&quot; limited by what the group can accept and utilize. Jayyusi believes poetry is thus driven by a social functionalism expressed in two main directions &quot;one ideological of religious origin and the other musical, in the form of singing and tarab.&quot;In other words, poetry must serve a cause, and ideology in the first case, while in the second, and in fact the more keenly felt and popularly enjoyed function, the purpose is sheer pleasure and jubilation. Ideally, the two functions concur--this is the goal of such a poetry.Jayyusi emphasizes that &quot;tarab,&quot; i.e. singing, remains fundamental, indeed intrinsic to Arabic poetry past and present. Poetic verse is always subject to this standard. &quot;Don't we notice that the Holy Koran today, for example, is a matter of audition or tarab for most Muslims more than a matter of reading, and comprehension and contemplation,&quot; Adonis writes.Jayyusi points out that the two elements, &quot;song&quot; and &quot;function (the serving of a cause)&quot; are so fundamental that any poetic expression not embracing them is culturally relegated to the status of &quot;philosophy,&quot; something deemed complex and remote from the people. Thus, unrhymed, non-musical poetry, poetry based on &quot;contemplation and examination of inner worlds&quot; lies so outside Arabic poetic taste as to be utterly marginalized, removed from any but a tiny, refined audience.Jayyusi sees a conflict between this cultural reality and his own conviction that poetry must challenge boundaries and establish new aesthetics. This poetic effort means embracing rather than spurning the difficulty and ambiguity of meaning. &quot;The problem in this context, lies in the refusal of Arabic poetic taste to place poetry at par with the great cognitive and discovery intuitions.&quot;As Jayyusi points out, poetry continues to be judged by the causes and concerns it champions, and by the author's affiliations and ideologies. &quot;Original readings concern themselves not with the essence of poetry but with its 'soil' and the 'climate' in which it is produced.&quot;This phenomenon, according to Adonis, will only be reinforced by society's increasing domination by the non-literate media, TV in particular. Thus, modern communications technology only serves the religious and social traditions already so profoundly established. This leads Adonis to an equally profound pessimism regarding the present and future chances of Arabic poetry to escape its traditional limitations."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"What began as an experiment - United States Special Forces A-Teams commanding Khmer Krom (free Cambodians)in the exploitation of Viet Cong and NVA weaknesses in their own forbidden zones - evolves full-scale in this true-to-life thriller.In 1966-67, I worked with Jim (code named Fox-3), then a 19 year A-Team medic, on what became the most successful unconventional operations conducted by US forces during the Vietnam War. After the first two missions - Black Box and Blackjack 31 - I took the Freedom Flight while Donahue stayed on to play a key role in the evolution of the Mobile Guerrila Force concept - small, light-to-fight, highly (foot) mobile patrols that would locate Charlie's Base Camps &amp; Way Stations, then blow the B-Jesus out of the massed-Cong using Air Force F-4C Phantom jets in early morning,high-altitude, radar-bombing sorties. The author gives a detailed account of just how this is possible when, in fact, these missions featured no artillery, no routine medivac, no big guns, no reinforcements, no large units, and were pre-ordained, by some, to the scrap heap of bold, imaginative, high-risk, failures.The key? No large signature. Just a bunch of well-trained guys with good secret commo, excellent mining and disengagement techniques, innovative resupply techniques, and a commitment to work together deep behind enemy lines and, of course, were willing to stay out late (30-45 days), work (mostly) the night shift, and beat the guerrillas at their own game. Donahue describes the environment in chilling terms, and make no mistake, there are friendly casualties along the way. But, in the end, the Mobile Guerrila Force Rules!Donahue is on a roll! His first book, No Greater Love and his second book, Mobile Guerrilla Force, are excellent precursers to this, his most powerful work to date.Who says medics don't carry weapons?"},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"Jim Donahue's ability to convey the sights, sounds and smells of war in a foreign land are awesome.

I don't give it 5 stars only because I don't consider it a true must have/must read. But make no mistake this is a really fine book that truly captures jungle combat and all the hardships it entails. This book chronicles the exploits of a special unit, Mobile Guerrilla Force, in the heavily VC infested Warzone D in 1967. The author is a Special Forces medic (Green Beret) and sees lot's of action. The Mobile Guerrilla Force is basically a light company made up of Americans and Cambodians. Their job is to raid enemy base camps, conduct ambushes, and call in air strikes. The danger is constant as they get in ambushes &amp; battle after battle. Since the author was a medic he spends much of the time doing combat medicine. These parts are amazing as he treats the wounded yet fights off the VC. Donahue really brings the jungle and story alive and makes you feel like you are there. Get this book, and his others and learn about how Special Forces fought with amazing bravery in a far off land."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"A fabulous book for anyone looking for firsthand accounts of the great work our fighting men & women did in Vietnam, and an excellent antidote for the overplayed drivel Hollywood & the \\"mainstream\\" media try to spoon-feed us.The author provides a minimal amount of background info on himself and the Mobile Guerilla Force, and then jumps right into the action. He gets your heart pumping and your senses instantly alerted through first-person writing, and once you start this book it is very difficult to put down. Mr Donahue does not hold back anything from the reader either; he skillfully relates the sights, sounds, smells, and even tastes of combat in Vietnam.If you are looking for a well-written first-hand account about the experiences of combat in Vietnam, then I highly recommend this book. If you are a little squeamish, or prefer to research the unit histories and command structures of combat units in Vietnam, well, I STILL recommend this book (and all of Mr Donahue's books)."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"This book allows the reader to see the Vietnam War through the eyes of a Special Forces team Medic. From being a mentor to the Cambodian soldiers to his duties as a medic Donahue stirs emotions and feelings that makes any reader sympathize and get an idea to the action that was seen by the Mobile Guerilla Force. After reading several other books about Vietnam I've found that this book as well as No Greater Love to be the most entertaining and aweinspiring books written about the Vietnam War."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"These men brought the fight to the communists. They fought smart and hard and outguerrlla the guerrilla. There is action from the beginning of the book to the very end. Doc Donahue writes a descriptive and detailed account of his experience in the jungles of Vietnam fighting with a Special Forces led indigenous Cambodian fighting force. It is amazing the hurt they put on the Viet Cong and sad when many of these brave fighters gave their lives often fighting a superior force. I also enjoyed the story of Donahue's adventure of getting supplies in Saigon. An unconventional fighter making an unconventional acquistion of supplies through unconventional means. I plan on reading all the other Donahue books."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"I just found out why I contiue to read war books by the hundreds. It's a form of regression back to when I was 10 years old and read all the Sergeant Rock Comics I could get my hands on. That's how I learned to read. BlackJack 33 brought me back with the BLAMS and CRACKS, and TATATATAT's. Awsome! The book was a constant adrenaline rush. It never let up! I shall keep this book and read it over and over. The ending left me with a tight chest and a feeling of intense sadness. I only wish is that this book goes on to be made a movie. I have the sincerest respect for the author and his fellow sodiers. Thank you, from one American."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"The Vietnam war is still an enigma for many of us who were not there. It is fascinating and a bit frightening. Many people only understand it based on movies like Platoon or Full Metal Jacket. This book does a fabulous job of illustrating an unknown aspect of the war, yet makes you understand how the pieces fit together. Very descriptive and action packed, you feel as if you are close to the action and get a better feel for the life of a soldier in the bush.Overall, this was a very enjoyable book and increased my education and awareness of the war."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"Mr. Donahue brings out a little known aspect of the Vietnam War--the use of Special Forces and Cambodian soldiers to fight the VC on their own ground. You can get more of a description of the book by reading the adjacent reviews. I spent almost two years working with the Vietnamese day by day, and consider this book to be a must read for anyone interested in the genre. It is very well written and makes the scene jump out at you. For me, it was almost like revisiting my experiences back then."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"I love these kind of books so I read every one that I can find.

Hope this helps."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"A beautiful testimony to the courage of these elite soldiers whose mission was to serve as bait for enemy forces far greater in number. Blackjack-33 is the code name of such a perilous mission."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"Blackjack-33 is one of the best written first hand account of men in combat. Very well written and hard to put down. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great true account of the Mobile Guerilla Forces in action in Vietnam. I can't wait to receive and read the author's other books."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"Blackjack-33 is the name given to one of the operations that Special Forces in Vietnam undertook. James Donahue, the author, served on this mission and recounts it in detail through this book.Donahue was in Vietnam in 1967 as part of Special Forces \\"Mobile Guerrilla Force\\" made up of Americans and Cambodian Soldiers. The Cambodians, as he recalls, were extremely trustworthy, loyal and vicious fighters with a persistent bad taste in their mouths towards the V.C. and Vietnamese in general. This sentiment came from the Vietnamese stealing the Mekong Delta away from Cambodia back in history.Donahue's writing style is very laid back, there never seems to be any panic or urgency no matter how the situation is unfolding. I can only assume that the superior and world class training of Special Forces has somehow taught these guys to stay cool no matter what or, conversely, that's their natural state and Special Forces is a natural place to employ that personality trait.Throughout the book Donahue describes the jungle around him with such lucidity you feel as though you are there. He writes the calls of the monkeys as \\"kaa kaa kaa\\", describes the colors he's seeing, the smell of the air and the temperature all with amazing clarity and I feel this makes this book so much more than a look at Vietnam through a soldier's eyes. It's very obvious how much respect Donahue has for the place, for the people, for his job and for his colleagues.As all Special forces, Donahue is cross trained, in his case, as medic. He tends to the men with a clear caring for them. His descriptions of wounds and how he treats them are descriptive in the text and filled with unwritten emotion for the wounded. He describes in detail how the booby traps the Americans use work and how they are deployed with maximum potential to kill or harm the enemy. He also tells us about enemy booby traps they come across.You get the feeling Donahue enjoyed his time in country. These guys were always \\"on\\" and, I'm just glad they were on our side as, the amount of damage they could inflict either by themselves or with the help of supportive fire power was astounding.One aspect I love about these Vietnam memoirs is how \\"honed\\" you had to be when walking point. To most, walking point implies you are waiting to be shot at but, as Donahue and many others have explained, all the signs of the enemy are there if you know what to look for. The Cambodians knew the jungle, well and could spot the slightest most insignificant change with uncanny regularity.All in all a great read. The epilogue brings us up to the late 90's as Donahue reunites with some of his comrades from Vietnam. It's touching stuff as he tells us some of the stories of the Cambodians he served with.I can guarantee this book will hold your attention for the duration and you will gain even more respect for these warriors.A great read."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"this was a pretty good way to put yourself into the action. it is well written and conveys the author's respect for those he served with. all in all a good read, but kinda short. it left me wanting more. luckily, there are more..."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"I own just about every Vietnam war book out there.

There are few books that \\"I could not lay down\\" (another cliche') but this one was very hard to lay down, keeping me up late at night. I highly recommend this book. There are a few places where the author seems to have cut and pasted the same description of terrain but this is small criticism compared to the power of the narrative. Few people are aware of the cross-border excursions our troops made, or want to pretend they did not happen, but this book is about the unsung stories and heroes of the \\"other war\\" that we denied existed."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"Great book ,James kept this story moving from start to finish.Ive only read a couple other books of this type, Black jack 34 and Reflections of a warrior that were on parr with this book if you are in to these types of stories you will want to check it out."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"The main thing I took away from Blackjack-33 was the author's deep feeling of comradeship with his Khmer Krom men and their families. I enjoyed reading the extensive personal history of each of the operation's participants almost as much as the story itself. Sadly, even after the end of the war, the Khmer Krom continued to take extraordinary losses inside both Cambodia and Vietnam at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. The massacres of over 20,000 Khmer Krom civilians inside Vietnam during 1975-78 is not a subject of much interest to judges at the ongoing trial of the Khmer Rouge leadership. I fear much the same fate will befall our closest supporters in Iraq and Afghanistan.I wonder how the Vietnam-era Special Forces compare with the current generation in terms of foreign language skills. I doubt that the current generation could have the same close personal attachment with their Iraqi and Afghan counterparts that the old-timers had with their Cambodian, Thai, Lao, and Vietnamese brothers in arms. I ordered Blackjack-34 immediately after finishing this book."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"James C. Donahue has done an excellent job in \\"Blackjack 33\\" of capturing what it was like to serve in the jungles of Vietnam. His descriptions of both combat and the jungle are incredibly vivid. This book is filled with action from beginning to end, but what hit me as most authentic were the dialogues. His conversations in the book with his fellow American advisors and the Cambodians he served beside are remarkably real. He captures the bond of brothers in arms in a way that few other authors have. His descriptions of the various booby traps used by both sides are also enlightening. Besides Barry Sadler, we don't hear much about what it was like to be a Special Forces medic in Vietnam. Donahue fills that gap with extremely detailed descriptions of the medical side and the combat side of what he did.I recommend this book highly to anyone interested in military history or what it was like to serve in Vietnam. It's a well written book packed with action. I look forward to reading more of Donahue's work."},{"Title":"Blackjack-33: With Special Forces in the Viet Cong Forbidden Zone","review":"I rate this author a 5 star writer with the most authentic capture of the Vietnam War era. I've read all of his books and continually look for new ones in the future. His account of the actions of the Mobile Guerrilla Forces has illustrated the closeness and personal bonding of individuals regardless of rank, nationality, or race. Each character comes alive as you live each experience with them each day. If you were a real grunt and not a REMF you would understand this bond. I give Donahue 5 Stars!!!"},{"Title":"What A Time It Was","review":"Okay, I'll be the first one to review this book: I'm surprised someone hasn't beat me to it. Here is where you can find one of the beginnings of the New Journalism, which flowered in the 1960s in the capable hands of Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese, Hunter Thompson, and so forth. In his magazine pieces and newspaper columns, Heinz inspired a later generation of writers with what is possible when you apply the literary conventions of fiction to reportage. As a prose stylist, no one is better. You can savor virtually ever sentence collected here. The book also paints a vivid portrait of an Old America, a different time in sports and culture, the America of my parents and grandparents. This is a nice volume to keep on the end table next to the couch to dip into whenever you're in the mood: the same is true of the newly reissued BOOK OF BOXING, an anthology that Heinz edited."},{"Title":"What A Time It Was","review":"My father sent me this book when he was done reading it. I, frankly, had never heard of the author but I noted with interest that he was a sportswriter and had contributed to writing M*A*S*H*. I came across some of his stories in a different collection and discovered that this man can write. This book starts out with a number of profiles of different sports figures. Some are very famous (Red Grange, Stan Musial, and Sugar Ray Robinson) while others are very obscure (ever hear of Bummy Davis, Pete Reiser,or Jack Hurley?). Some of the profiles are heart-warming while others are heart-breaking; Heinz can handle either direction with skill. There is another section with selections from his works of fiction. This includes &quot;The Red Raiders of the Imjin&quot; which is where the football game in the movie M*A*S*H* comes from. The last section has a number of newpaper articles from over the years. The author's insights on boxing, baseball, football, and horse-racing shows that he really knows his stuff. He may not be a modern sportswriter but, from what I've read, he must have influenced a lot of the modern crowd. This was a very plesant surprize. Thanks Dad."},{"Title":"What A Time It Was","review":"This is most possibly the greatest collection of writing ever. Bill Heinz is a pioneer who started the era of New Journalism (away with all the touchy-touchy writing). As a large fan of Hemingway, I must say that Bill Heinz puts Hemingway on the bottom of my bookshelf. His first novel, The Professional, is a masterpiece of sports fiction and was highly acclaimed by Mr. Hemingway himself. Even though Heinz never received the acclaim of Red Smith or Grantland Rice, Heinz deserves to be recognized as one of the greatest journalist's alive, if not ever. The collections of stories in this book, especially that of Pete Reiser, a Brooklyn baseball player that was robbed of a hall of fame career in center field because of injuries (and the outfield wall), are some of the most magnificent writing you will see in your lifetime. Containing the same prose style that Hemingway was made famous for, Heinz was praised by some of the greatest writers in his business. This book includes excerpts from his book MASH, as well as other fiction stories. Maybe it's the fiction style he brings to non-fiction writing, but whatever it is that makes Bill Heinze so great, I wish I could write like he does. Just like the people he covers, Heinz posses' a talent spectators could only dream for.Also recommended: The Profesional; MASH"},{"Title":"Milestones: Turning points in New Zealand history","review":"Milestones: Turning Points in New Zealand History by Tom Brooking.Milestones tells the story of New Zealand in a distinctive new way.

I have highlighted this book all over the place and written in the margins, etc. and I still come back to it time and again to learn more.I liked the story about how he came to be a big PR guy in Hollywood. He's definitely walked the walk, so you really can't go wrong learning success principles from someone like him. Use what works for you and discard the rest, as is the case with anything.Great advice on topics ranging from networking to interviewing (Dress as if I'll fit in with those above me not those below me, be on time, arrive early, keep up with current affairs.), to appearance and selling.His advice to not buy another success book can definitely work but I'm too much of a self-help junkie to heed it.

Ehrhart is chiselled from the granite of raw experience. He closes his eyes to nothing, and his honesty carves verse which is spare and direct yet elegant-also often melodic and lyrical. His words pierce the heart like a steel-tipped arrow. Although best known for his meditations on and recollections of the war in Vietnam, here we experience a full range of life: his first French kiss; his dropping off of his daughter at school; his jogging through Chicago and Philadelphia; his cats; his hopes, his fears, and his joys. Ehrhart's words haunt. They reverberate in one's brain and invite rereading. Don't miss this retrospective of a voice pure as a midnight cry of love and pain."},{"Title":"Beautiful Wreckage: New & Selected poems","review":"All these years after Vietnam Ehrhart cannot let go. Yes he goes other places: love of wife and child, memories of childhood friends and the ever unresolved situation with parents. Work, and lack of it, career and setbacks are here too, also the awareness of age as friends suffer heart attacks, as the sense of \\"last time\\" invades visits, as old places of the heart vanish. All of it presented with Erhart's deceptive simplicity, his matter of fact voice. But Vietnam, oh Vietnam. He sucks the broken tooth of remorse. Reveals the horror lurking outside the circle of his personal fire. Suddenly it reaches in, a paw touching the present: Guatamala, Bagdad, or just a street corner in Philadelphia. And he condemns it looking, hoping for justice, like a child who has been told that last lie which reveals truth. He eschews excuse for himself as an adult who could have said that one soothing word that can no longer be said. One who looks upon his thoughtless childhood cruelties and rues. He cannot help touching the sore spot. He cannot forgive himself, even though others forgive him. And so for any reader swimming along in the poetic mind this is an examination of conscience.Ehrhart is not an academic poet, nor does his skill sparkle. Not as given to delicate images as fellow Vietnam poet Balaban, he nevertheless has some interesting pieces of wordwork in this anthology of often narrative lyrics. His diction is the diction of polite discourse. His familiarity with traditional poetry shows at times in congruent images and themes. For me, this is the work of an authentic poet. It shows why we need poetry."},{"Title":"The family (Foundations of modern sociology series)","review":"It is possible to learn much about the family as element of social structure, the biological bases of the family, legitimacy and illgetimacy in relation to the family, mate selection and marriage, organized descent groupings, role relations of spouses and parents in family and society, stratification, dissolution of family role systems, changes in family patterns from this work.Goode has a broad comparitive knowledge of the family in world's societies, and also an understanding of the family historically. He provides countless insights and often corrections misconceptions. For instance it is ordinarily thought that present American divorce rates are the highest in human history. He notes that Japan in the 1880's had very high rates. It is often thought that Chinese and Indian societies traditionally had very large families. He shows that from studies of his time the numbers were small 3.5 to 5.5 family members per household. It is often thought 'peasants' always marry younger and had larger families. He shows that in many societies peasants poverty prevented them from marrying until much later than did the wealthier elements of the society.There is thus a great deal to learn from this work. Time and circumstance however have dated much of the material. For instance he talks about the strong tendency of the Jewish family towards endogamy, indicating that over eighty percent of Jews who marry in the U.S. marry within their own group. Were it so the leaders of the American- Jewish community would be happily surprised, for the Intermarriage is at least forty- percent and some put it at over fifty.Goode needless to say wrote before Artificial Means of Reproduction helped produce 'new families' of a kind humanity has never seen before.One wonders what Goode would have had to say about the mulitplication of artificially created one- parent families, or the declining percentage of traditional nuclear families among the nation's families as a whole.Speculation aside, this is a very rich study and can give much to anyone interested in learning about the sociology of the Family."},{"Title":"The Quest (Survivalist)","review":"I have enjoyed all of the books in this series so far.

What isn't well known to the general public is that this progress is made in accordance with Moore's Law, which states that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits must double every 18 months, increasing capacity and speed while reducing manufacturing costs.Moore's Law is driving the advance of technology at a break-neck pace, and few insiders believe that it will be repealed anytime soon. Since it was enacted in 1965, Moore's Law has been a benefit to consumers but often a headache to computer chip manufacturers, who have been arguing for its repeal. Various consortiums and lobbying groups -- with members from industry lights such as Intel, AMD, and IBM -- contend that the pace of innovation demanded by the law is too intense, requires too much research and development expenditure, and commits corporate resources that could more profitably be invested in the development of consumer electronics such as high-definition televisions, phonographs, and celebrity-themed video games.Consumer advocates insist that Moore's Law should remain in effect so that advanced information technology will be increasingly accessible to the working class. Voices on the right decry Moore's Law as a violation of free-markets principles, insisting that the pace of innovation should be set \\"by the innovators themselves\\" (Milton Friedman).Aspray's book balances the different sides of the issue, showing on the one hand the great benefits that the use of computer systems has provided for the average consumer -- there is one touching story of a crippled Hispanic boy's first mouse-click -- and on the other hand the great strain that is put upon the corporations and individual engineers who must continue to innovate relentlessly (it's horrific when Aspray visits the psychologist at Intel's Santa Clara counseling center and reads some of the stories -- first published here -- of depression, divorce, and suicide.)Though Aspray makes a commendable effort to be even-handed, it is clear upon reflection that his sympathies lie with the consumers rather than the producers, noting in the book's epilogue that because of the law, the benefits of the information age will reach \\"even the remotest Inuit tribes and poorest Hmong families\\".Anyone looking for an overview of this crucial policy issue will be well served by this volume."},{"Title":"Against Capitalism","review":"Critics of American-style capitalism have been dogged in recent years by the question: &quot;What's your alternative?&quot; David Schweickart has provided the answer.In this book, Schweickart makes an impressive case for &quot;Economic Democracy&quot;, the name for his preferred version of market socialism. His arguments derive both from moral/political philosophy and from economic theory, with the emphasis on the latter. His command of moral philosophical concepts will not always please professionals in the field, but his economic arguments are impressive.His arguments draw, furthermore, on what empirical evidence there is of the performance of market-socialist economies around the world.A must-read for those seeking an alternative to &quot;the American model&quot; -- the internationalization of capital, accelerating corporate consolidation, downsizing of government, dominance of the political process by capital."},{"Title":"Against Capitalism","review":"The first thing to understand about this work is that Schweickart is most definitely NOT advocating Soviet socialism as an economic system. (Neither was Marx for that matter, but that's another story). If the extent of your logical reasoning is to think that anyone who dares argue against capitalism must be proposing Stalinesque reform, then this book is not for you. On the other hand, if you, like many others, have the gnawing feeling inside that something is not quite right with the proliferation of American-dominated global capitalism, Schweickart offers both explanations and alternatives.The strongest part of the book is the opening few chapters, in which the author systematically dismantles much of the economic argument for capitalism. And he does so not by resorting to hackneyed left-wing rhetoric, but with careful economic analysis. I recommend a detailed reading of this section - take notes, think critically, visit other sources to understand contrary viewpoints.The rest of the book, although excellent, does not quite live up to the opening. Scheickart sets forth his view for an alternative, which he calls economic democracy. But it would be impossible for any text to create a completely satisfactory economic system. The issues need to be discussed, different ideas need to be tried - this is not criticism, just reality.Schweickart will provide you with food for thought, whether you are a curious student just beginning to question the pseudo-science passing as economics in most universities, or a serious reformer looking for a fresh persepctive. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Against Capitalism","review":"In the aftermath of the failure of Soviet socialism, we hear over and over again that there is no alternative to capitalism. Schweickart shows, with great clarity, wide learning, and an accessible prose style, that this is not true. His alternative is a market economy in which the workers run the factories, farms, and offices. What is is that capitalists contribute merely by owning the productive assets, in virtue of which there might be a point in letting them take the profits? Schweickart answers: _nothing_, and backs it up. Workers can perform all the managerial and entrepreneurial functions themselves. He develops a model in which they do, based on empirical research into worker cooperatives. The economy has a large state sector for finance, but uses markets to allocate scarce resources and satisfy demand. Schweickart shows that this would be more just, more democratic, and more efficient than either libertarian laissez-faire capitalism or welfare state capitalism. He also tries to show, rather less successfully, that his economic democracy is somehow in the Marxist tradition, despite Marx's dislike of markets. But whether one finds this argument as plausible as his argument for the dispensibility of capitalism is really immaterial. Schweickart has articulated a compelling and practicable alternative to capitalism, something that would be different, better, and worth fighting for. The book is essential reading for anyone thinking about economic alternatives."},{"Title":"Against Capitalism","review":"One previous reviewer seems to not have even read the book, but i want ot reiterate what has been stated previously: this book is not about soviet communism, it is about something new called economic democracy. every reviewer should realize this when reading other reviews that deride this book by applealling to the stalinistic soviet union.the first chapter discusses marxian arguments against capitalism. the only real original writing in the first chapter is at the end when he attacks nozick, an argument that i think is particularly damning to nozicks argument; unless youre a are pure libertarian who doesnt really care about the bad stuff that other people suffer.after that, marx doesnt come into the discussion until the last chapter where he tries to align his theory with marxism. like mentioned previously, i am not sure if he sells his case.one last thing. as much as i loathe those previous reviewers who appeal to the soviet union to make a case against socialism, i must admit that even schweickart's central real world example of economic democracy has some flaws. a little bit of research will turn up that the socialist paradise of the mondragon cooperative has recently discovered that there were some serious corruption problems occuring within the system. that said, schweikart's book is still an excellent piece of social philosophy."},{"Title":"Against Capitalism","review":"Against Capitalism makes a strong argument for Economic Democracy, where essentially democracy is extended to the workplace. The book meticulously presents the arguments in a scientific fashion, and changed my view of the economy. Before reading this book, I had always viewed socialism through the ignorant lens of the command-form Soviet model (which really is not what socialists are for). This book opened my eyes to the true inherent flaws of capitalism, and prevented a constructive alternative system. The one earlier reviewer obviously did not read this book, which is very critical of the command-form Soviet Union.One must realize that capitalism does have flaws, and Against Capitalism presents an excellent alternative. It is worth a read to see if you think Economic Democracy is a good alternative. After I read it a few years ago, I still have not found a better system presented."},{"Title":"Against Capitalism","review":"I was very impressed with this book when I read it a number of years ago. I'm looking at purchasing his new book based on my positive impresssion of this book.He provides a pretty good argument for Economic Democracy, expains how it can and has worked, and explains the benifits of this type of organization.It definately gives you a lot of information to think about and provides another possiblity for an economic organization that is more human and more egalitarian while remaining productive in the usual sense. It also supports more modest proposals for worker participation in decision making and profit sharing."},{"Title":"Against Capitalism","review":"As a libertarian, I found this book challenging, provocative, well-argued and thorough. Of course, as a libertarian, I also found it to be completely wrong about everything, but I would still recommend this book to any libertarian, conservative or free-marketeer who is up for an honest intellectual challenge rather than the parade of straw-man fallacies, circular reasoning and populist rhetoric usually trotted out by the left."},{"Title":"Against Capitalism","review":"A tremendous book. Schweickart leaves defenders of capitalism looking foolish. Should democratic socialism ever become a reality, it will most likely resemble the model Schweickart describes here."},{"Title":"Against Capitalism","review":"I am not into fiction, therefor I did not find this book worth the paper it was printed on."},{"Title":"Against Capitalism","review":"Question: What's the difference between the author - David Schweickart and Karl Marx?Karl Marx can be given one break - he didn't live to see the days his communist ideals would be put into action.

I have recently become fed up with most of the self-indulgent, going nowhere, whiney contemporary lit I've explored and finally decided to give O'Brian a try. Keep in mind that I am most definitely NOT a military buff, or even a big history fan, but the O'Brian books are just pure pleasure. Clever, amusing, engaging, each one different, great characters. I see now why I have been hearing gushing references to them over the years. Yes, I confess that I sometimes skip a bit of the more arcane sailing terms, but no problem.

My fourth reading of this series. I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in the 1800's Royal Navy."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"In the continue Jack Aubrey/Stephen Maturin saga, this book focuses a bit more on Maturin. We see a little more of his human side, his insecurities, inners struggles and foibles. He is a man like the rest of the world after all. Diana is shown in a more flattering light, too. Great literature!"},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"No series about the Napoleonic War era nor any sea faring war era can hold a candle to this great series. All men should read this series to understand themselves and all women should read it to understand men. The interplay between Maturin and Aubrey is a superb study of men in war and society. It is an eye opener to the way late 18th century and early 19th century mores and social customs worked and is a tour de force in understanding how sailing vessels actually operated. Extremely accurate and detailed descriptions of ships, sailing, gunnery, exotic places, animals, birds, the sea, and never, never a tedious or dull part to trudge through. I cannot speak highly enough for this series this is my third time through all 21 books and I will no doubt read it a fourth time."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"A fantastic book (as are all in this series) and read beautifully by Simon Vance. To get the full impact, stay with Simon Vance for the entire series!"},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"This volume is the third in a mini-trilogy within the larger Aubrey-Maturin series, and it's rather more given to personal and political rather than purely naval affairs. Again, it opens where the previous volume closed, with the victory of Shannon over the Chesapeake and the arrival of both at Halifax. While they're being feted by local society for the victory, Jack, in a peke over his lack of mail from home, gets carried away in an indiscretion with a local fortune-hunter, which haunts him for the rest of the book. Diana Villiers, meanwhile, has a parallel problem as a result of her liaison with Johnson in the previous volume. The three finally leave Canada for England on the packet carrying the great news, but are hotly pursued by a couple of American privateers apparently in Johnson's employ; he wants both his papers and his woman back. When they reach England, Steven's own intelligence coup leads to his being sent on a mission to the Baltic, where he must convince a Catalan contingent to desert the Napoleonic cause, and this whole episode is one of the most interesting I've read yet. In the latter stages of the mission, however, Jack and Steven find themselves in the clutches of the French, and then in prison in Paris, and Steven's talents are called for again. This one is more a spy adventure than a sea story, but it's very enjoyable for all that. (It took me an embarrassingly long time to catch on to the title, though.)"},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"Seven books into the series, that O'Brian can still suprise me, intrigue me, and keep both character and story fresh astounds and pleases me to the bottom of my feet. This is why O'Brian receives such high praise and accolades, and it is well deserved. _The Surgeon's Mate_ has Aubrey return home after a long separation, only to find himself in financial and legal trouble ashore - a situation apparently as common to sailors in the early 19th century as it is now. Added to this, Cpt. Aubrey has to contend and deal with the consequences of his dalliance in Nova Scotia. Thankfully, Aubrey and Dr. Maturin are quickly dispatched to the Baltic.I will forego the details of the mission lest I spoil the plot - suffice it to say the past of Maturin and Aubrey's service in America catch up with both of them with rather suprising (and delightful) consequences. The title of the book, so often clear to readers as the story unfolds, was here a mystery until literally the final few pages, and was in any case a double-entendre of sorts. That O'Brian, as Aubrey, both enjoy a good play on words, I couldn't help but laugh out loud as I read the final few pages solving the puzzle. As I've said with each previous review on O'Brian's series, the 5 star reviews of his books are very much deserved. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"The focus is on Stephen Maturin in this seventh installment of the Aubrey-Maturin series, which, though it isn't the best or most exciting of the first seven books, is still a ripping good read. Returning to England following their escapades in North America, Aubrey and Maturin try to settle into life at home -- Jack with his family and Stephen with his scientific pursuits -- but their pasts catch up with them, compelling them to join forces for a spur-of-the-moment mission to the Baltic. Will they succeed? Will they overcome the old problems that dog them? And just who is the surgeon's mate?

Highly recommended.If you want a particular edition, though, get it somewhere else."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"Jolly Captain Jack Aubrey and his sidekick the bespectacled bohemian Doctor Maturin Return for this 7th book in the renowned Aubrey/Maturin series. In this segment, Maturin and fem fatale Diana Viller's romance heats up, Jack's money troubles become more pronounced, and Doc Maturin's career as a spy threatens to become the death of him.What can I say about this great series? The character of Jack Aubrey is just SO endearing and Doctor Maturin is so priceless as the inscrutable doctor, that this series simply cannot be missed! Even the presence of Diana Villers (a character I've simply loathed for quite some time), seems less irritating.I'm listening to the unabridged Narrated version by Patrick Tull, and this series is wonderful. Cannot be missed. Particularly love the parts where Jack/Maturin and The Swedish Envoy are in prison. Too funny! Wonderful series. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"It would be a disservice to the reader to expose the plot too much, but suffice to say that Captain Aubrey and Doctor Maturin have resolved their adventire in America ('The Fortune of War'), and now sail into the Baltic to turn certain Catalan troops there against their French masters.Stephen Maturin is fluent in the Catalan language, has land there, and is sympathetic to the people.And, of course, he is an intelligence agent for the British.This is a great series. The late Patrick O'Brian was a great story teller, and he knew his subject intimately. He probably knew more about the square-rigged ships of the era than any other writer alive. His recent death, at the age of 86, was a great loss to people who loved his work.If this series is new to you, may I advise you to go to the first book in the series, 'Master and Commander,' and begin to read there. You will enjoy the series far more. There are some twenty books in the series, so there is lots of pleasure ahead. Of course, each book will stand alone, but they are better read in sequence.Joseph Pierre,Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity"},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"I expected not to enjoy this as adventures on the high seas are not really my cup of tea. However this is excellently written, earthy and realistic, bringing alive the people and the time. My only criticism, and purely personal due to my lack of knowledge, is that there is a fair bit of incomprehensible sailing cant. however, since this is part of the scene and to explain it would break the narrative flow, i do not mark down on that.

The name of the narrator is not alway mentioned in the description, but it makes all the difference in listening satisfaction."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"If you read this volume in the Aubry/Maturin series right after #6, the title is somewhat ambiguous: I was not sure whether O'Brian was hinting at further occurences involving the young man who, in volume 6, was Maturin's helper as ship's doctor (and who may have had something to do with the burning of Aubry's last command), or whether the question of Diana was finally resolved. Read it yourself to find out (last several pages, of course!).This series is the best naval history fiction I have yet read - better even than the Hornblower series."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"THE SURGEON'S MATE, the seventh installment of the Jack Aubrey- Stephen Maturin series about the British naval captain and his surgeon friend at the start of the nineteenth century picks up the story as \\"Lucky\\" Jack and the Doctor, along with Diana Villiers (the woman Stephen has long pined for), head back to England after escaping Boston aboard the HMS Shannon and its subsequent defeating of the USS Chesapeake. The story continues with a series of loosely related episodes: Jack's losing himself in an affair with a woman of questionable character in Halifax, his and Stephen's mission to win over a Catalan unit from the French at Grimsholm (now in Finland) and capture the fortress there, and the imprisonment of Jack, Stephen, and Stephen's Swedish assistant Gedymin Jagiello by the French and our heroes' attempt at escape. Stephen's secret life as a super spy for the British Crown also becomes threatened.Throughout the book, the reader might assume the title refers to Jagiello, but it becomes apparent by the end that this is not so. Jagiello, in any case, is an odd character who's not well fleshed out. He seems to be present mostly for comic relief, and late in the book he also serves as a plot device.THE SURGEON'S MATE is the least satisfying of the Aubrey-Maturin novels at this point in the series, at least as a stand-alone novel. Although the last fifty pages are exciting, most of the rest of the novel, while still engrossing--Patrick O'Brian's prose style still pleases--is even more episodic than usual. It reads like a coda to the previous (and superior) book in the series, THE FORTUNE OF WAR (see my review on Amazon.com) than it does a cohesive work of its own merit. Still, to any fan of O'Brian's novels, this is not an important consideration."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"This series is great and this was another chapter in the ongoing story of Maturin and Aubrey. Their adventures are of another world and provide a great contrast to other books."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"Patrick O'Brian's scope of imagination is staggering. We are now into the seventh book in his series, and Captain \\"Lucky Jack\\" Aubrey and surgeon/naturalist/spy Stephen Maturin continue to find themselves in realistic-yet-dire circumstances of a personal, military, and intelligence nature. Through it all, these two characters never seem like invincible juggernauts, but instead very human, very capable men living by the best their wits and luck can offer.At the outset of the novel, Aubrey and Maturin need to flee the New World for the old, but find themselves hard-pressed to do so. Thanks to Dr. Maturin's single-handed destruction of French spy networks in Boston (including a wee bit of murder), a wealthy intelligence figure hires ships to track down the fleeing Maturin. The result is a thrilling chase off Nova Scotia and the nearby waters - while I prefer Aubrey's sinking of the Dutch 74 the Waakzamheid in \\"Desolation Island,\\" this chase is one of the most thrilling in the series so far.And the joys of this novel don't stop there. O'Brian once again finds various ways to inject humor into his novel. Dr. Maturin hits a personal and professional high (as a naturalist) when he gets the chance to address a body of learned scientists in Paris . . . only to bungle the presentation horribly. Aubrey allows himself to be seduced by a wanton woman while celebrating his escape from the jail in Boston, and is confronted with news of the natural biological result of such a transgression. Maturin and Aubrey are accompanied on many of their adventures in \\"SM\\" by the Swedish captain Jagiello, a supremely attractive young man, and Aubrey finds himself at a loss as to why the women fall all over themselves for this young buck when they could have a sailor \\"with the handsomest set of whiskers in the fleet.\\" There are joys in this novel that you just don't find in most swashbuckling thrillers.But at its heart, \\"SM\\" is an adventure yarn, and O'Brian does not disappoint. In a story that sweeps from the New World to Paris to Denmark to the infamous Temple Prison back in France, Aubrey and Maturin find themselves thrown from one pan into another fire. And God bless them for it!"},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"Patrick O'Brian evokes John Le Carre in \\"The Surgeon's Mate\\", the 7th volume in the splendid Aubrey/Maturin series. Having fled their American captors, Aubrey and Maturin endure a perilous chase by American privateers before arriving safely back in England, with Maturin renewing his relationship with Diana Villiers. Maturin journeys to Paris, ostensibly to lecture on natural history, while on yet another secret mission for Sir Joseph Blaine, inspite of the fact that he's become well known to French authorities for his intelligence activities in the New World. Aubrey is temporarily given command of a sloop, HMS Ariel, and sets out on an intelligence mission with Maturin to the Danish coast. Eventually the ship founders off the coast of France; both Aubrey and Maturin are sent to Paris' infamous Temple prison."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"This entry in the Aubrey-Maturin seagoing saga was probably my least favorite that I've read so far in this series. My quibble was with the novel's plot, which was pretty thin and derivative of other action novels and movies. And Diana Villiers, Dr. Maturin's love, is starting to remind of the character of Irenee in The Forsythe Saga. Everyone is always talking about how fascinating she is, but darned if I can see why. On the plus side, as always O'Brian serves up amazing historical details and makes Jack and Stephen witty and real. And the on-going story of their lives advances to a very eye-opening and surprising ending. So you can bet I'll look forward to the next installment of this series."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"I assume that people interested in audio versions of O'Brian's novels have already read the books. So, listening to them is a supplementary pleasure that can follow a great read. My rating here has nothing to do with the literary quality of the work in question. The whole Aubrey-Maturin series is superb. But if you want to listen to them I recommend that you stay away from the recordings of Simon Vance. He is unable to sufficiently differentiate the characters, with their diverse accents from around the world. For example, Maturin grew up in Ireland, and should therefore have a bit of an Irish accent. Vance can't do it, and offers stuffy readings that makes Jack sound like a bombastic jerk, and Stephen like a mincing prig. And in his hands, Diana sounds like a silly simpering ninny. The skills of an actor, not just a reader, are required. I highly recommend Patrick Tull, who recorded the entire series with consistent success and enthusiasm, as well as John Lee, who unfortunately only recorded the first 6 volumes."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"This was advertised as a used book, but the condition was fine! If I have one complaint it would be the shipping costs. I ordered three books at once and all were delivered in the same USPS envelope. In spite of that, I was charged three different shipping charges."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"Confession time. THE SURGEON'S MATE is the fifth book in the \\"Aubrey/Maturin Series\\" of seafaring novels that I have completed; however, it is the seventh book in the logical series order. Having subscribed to receive the entire series, I began reading the books in the order that they arrived, assuming that the publisher would send them in proper sequence. Such turns out not to have been the case, and some of my discontent with other volumes I have reviewed derived from the fact that I had missed some events because of reading the books out of order. Allow my experience to stand as evidence that, for maximum enjoyment and even comprehension, these books should be approached in their logical sequence.I have now edited those earlier reviews to correct any misstatements as to the books' places in the sequence of novels and have removed comments pertaining to missing events that actually were addressed in preceding volumes. Nonetheless, I find that my overall assessments of the books remain unaltered. I feel that Richard Russ (Patrick O'Brian's real name) is essentially a \\"three star\\" author. When he writes of naval engagements aboard men-of-war, sloops, frigates, and the other fighting ships whose maneuvering capabilities are largely at the whim of the prevailing winds, he is a most engaging author. However, when he delves into the interpersonal relationships of his characters, he is less successful in engaging his readers.Two other continuing weaknesses in Russ' writing are his heavy use of now-archaic seafaring terminology that often clouds the meaning of the passage and his frustrating lack of time transitions. The first problem could have been alleviated by judicious use of explanatory footnotes. The latter could have been corrected by use of transitional commentary. As it is, however, in one sentence, the captain may call for one of his officers, and in the very next sentence he is speaking to that officer. It is as though a time warp has occurred and the officer has materialized next to his captain at the very moment he is called for. This annoying truncation of time appears in each of the five volumes I have read thus far, and I fear it is a weakness to which the author is blind and may well continue throughout the series.By itself, THE SURGEON'S MATE, while subject to the general criticisms I have mentioned, is, by and large, readable and engaging. Is Russ/O'Brian improving as he writes additional volumes, or am I becoming accustomed to his style and more accepting of it? In either event, I found this volume a much faster and more intriguing read than some of the others I have already encountered. The single most perplexing thing about this book is its title. There is no focus on any \\"surgeon's mate\\" whatsoever, and where Russ/O'Brian found his inspiration for the title remains a murky mystery! (Some reviewers have identified the title as referring to the character of Dr. Stephen Maturin; however, he has hitherto been described as being much more than a naval surgeon, being a skilled physician while a naval surgeon was essentially limited to chopping off shattered limbs. If this is indeed Russ/O'Brian's intent, then his choice of title essentially demotes Maturin from his former position, which is not, I think, the author's intent.)If, gentle reader, you are determined to read the entire Aubrey-Maturin series of novels, you will certainly not want to miss this one. However, you will perhaps enjoy it most if you have read the preceding six volumes first. On the other hand, if one is interested in merely sampling Russ/O'Brian's work, this would not be a bad example to choose, although I would still suggest reading at least the first work, MASTER AND COMMANDER, before delving into any of the succeeding books, including this one."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"Jack Aubrey may be resigned to the perils of his profession, but Stephen must now be silently wondering if maybe he and Jack are the men who never return.Indeed, this story began two volumes ago, in &quot;Desolation Island&quot;, where it looked like they might have &quot;copped it&quot; in the horrible old Leopard.Then the next story, The Fortune of War, begins with the Leopard limping into a British port off the Malay Peninsula, where after being treated handsomely they board the fast-sailing packet ship La Fletch for England (at last) where Jack is to take command of a new frigate.But the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune say nay, for their ship burns and sinks, leaving them on the open ocean in a ship's boat whose sails had been stolen and sold by a corrupt boatswain. After many brutal, parched, sunburned days in the lifeboat terror strikes once more when a ship within hailing distance fails to see them and sails on.As they appear about to succumb to the elements, however, they are rescued by HMS Java. Just as they are recovering from the debilitating ordeal in the lifeboat, Java engages the American ship Constitution (it's the War of 1812), loses the battle, and Aubrey and Maturin find themselves prisoners of war in Boston.There they discover they are very special prisoners, for Aubrey or Maturin -- or both -- are suspected of being more than a captain and his ship's surgeon. They escape this peril by sailing a little sloop out of Boston harbor into the open sea where they meet and are taken aboard the blockading HMS Shannon. With them is the love of Stephen's life, Diana Villiers, who was in Boston due to entirely credible circumstances, and whose fervent desire to leave with them is equally credible.The long and perilous chain of events that lead us to this story seem to be behind them. But they must endure one more sea battle -- the Shannon engages the USS Chesapeake in a short but exceedingly bloody engagement (all true), takes Chesapeake, and lands them in friendly Halifax.Now comes the The Surgeon's Mate, where it seems that Aubrey and Maturin and Diana will at last reach England without further hair-raising adventures. Not so fast, mate. Shortly into this fine, fine tale they board the packet Diligence for England, but the Diligence is intercepted by two strangely determined American privateers. It soon becomes evident that it is Aubrey and Maturin -- and a person of no less importance to their pursuers, Diana -- that is the prize sought, not the dispatch-carrying Diligence.Like O'Brian is known to do by those who read the fine print and between the lines, and do with great cunning, here he throws us a nice bone to chew on. The first schooner seen is a sleek, fast vessel, one that Captain Dalgleish is familiar with. He lowers his telescope and tells Aubrey, &quot;Yes. She is the Liberty; and I see Mr. Henry has given her a new coat of paint.&quot;Interesting indeed. Those who have explored the lives of the Patriots know that the Patrick Henry who concluded his moving speech for independence with the immortal words, &quot;Give me liberty of give me death,&quot; owned a fast, sleek schooner named Liberty.So now, six points off the starboard bow of the Diligence is the American privateer Liberty, commanded, coincidentally, by a &quot;Mr. Henry.&quot;Like icebergs, some of O'Brian's most pregnant stuff is tucked away from the view of many readers. Its discovery is not necessary to fully enjoy the story, but when we do find a gem the satisfaction is as pure as being let in on a fine secret.We recall that in the very first volume of this wonderful series, Aubrey's ship Sophie took a much superior ship named the Cacafuego. &quot;Caca fuego&quot; could be translated into a seemingly vulgar phrase, which led a New York Times reviewer to prose disparagingly about Master and Commander and ridicule O'Brian's choice of ship names. But it so happens that the Spanish had not one but two ships by that name. Nothing is preposterous in an O'Brian tale. Patrick Henry died a dozen years before the War of 1812, and O'Brian is not implying it was Patrick Henry's Liberty that intercepted the Diligence -- he's just having fun and permitting a few readers to get a double dip."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"Some critics have referred to the Aubrey/Maturin books as one long novel united not only by their historical setting but also by the central plot element of the Aubrey/Maturin friendship. Having read these fine books over a period of several years, I decided to evaluate their cumulative integrity by reading them consecutively in order of publication over a period of a few weeks. This turned out to be a rewarding enterprise. For readers unfamiliar with these books, they describe the experiences of a Royal Navy officer and his close friend and traveling companion, a naval surgeon. The experiences cover a broad swath of the Napoleonic Wars and virtually the whole globe.Rereading all the books confirmed that O'Brian is a superb writer and that his ability to evoke the past is outstanding. O'Brian has numerous gifts as a writer. He is the master of the long, careful description, and the short, telling episode. His ability to construct ingenious but creditable plots is first-rate, probably because he based much of the action of his books on actual events. For example, some of the episodes of Jack Aubrey's career are based on the life of the famous frigate captain, Lord Cochrane. O'Brian excels also in his depiction of characters. His ability to develop psychologically creditable characters through a combination of dialogue, comments by other characters, and description is tremendous. O'Brien's interest in psychology went well beyond normal character development, some books contain excellent case studies of anxiety, depression, and mania.Reading O'Brien gives vivid view of the early 19th century. The historian Bernard Bailyn, writing of colonial America, stated once that the 18th century world was not only pre-industrial but also pre-humanitarian (paraphrase). This is true as well for the early 19th century depicted by O'Brien. The casual and invariable presence of violence, brutality, and death is a theme running through all the books. The constant threats to life are the product not only of natural forces beyond human control, particularly the weather and disease, but also of relative human indifference to suffering. There is nothing particularly romantic about the world O'Brien describes but it also a certain grim grandeur. O'Brien also shows the somewhat transitional nature of the early 19th century. The British Navy and its vessals were the apogee of what could be achieved by pre-industrial technology. This is true both of the technology itself and the social organization needed to produce and use the massive sailing vessals. Aubrey's navy is an organization reflecting its society; an order based on deference, rigid hierarchy, primitive notions of honor, favoritism, and very, very corrupt. At the same time, it was one of the largest and most effective bureaucracies in human history to that time. The nature of service exacted great penalities for failure in a particularly environment, and great success was rewarded greatly. In some ways, it was a ruthless meritocracy whose structure and success anticipates the great expansion of government power and capacity seen in the rest of the 19th century.O'Brian is also the great writer about male friendship. There are important female characters in these books but since most of the action takes place at sea, male characters predominate. The friendship between Aubrey and Maturin is the central armature of the books and is a brilliant creation. The position of women in these books is ambiguous. There are sympathetic characters, notably Aubrey's long suffering wife. Other women figures, notably Maturin's wife, leave a less positive impression. On board ship, women tend to have a disruptive, even malign influence.How did O'Brian manage to sustain his achievement over 20 books? Beyond his technical abilities as a writer and the instrinsic interest of the subject, O'Brien made a series of very intelligent choices. He has not one but two major protagonists. The contrasting but equally interesting figures of Aubrey and Maturin allowed O'Brien to a particularly rich opportunity to expose different facets of character development and to vary plots carefully. This is quite difficult and I'm not aware of any other writer who has been able to accomplish such sustained development of two major protagonists for such a prolonged period. O'Brian's use of his historical setting is very creative. The scenes and events in the books literally span the whole globe as Aubrey and Maturin encounter numerous cultures and societies. The naval setting allowed him also to introduce numerous new and interesting characters. O'Brian was able to make his stories attractive to many audiences. Several of these stories can be enjoyed as psychological novels, as adventure stories, as suspense novels, and even one as a legal thriller. O'Brian was also a very funny writer, successful at both broad, low humor, and sophisticated wit. Finally, O'Brian made efforts to link some of the books together. While a number are complete in themselves, others form components of extended, multi-book narratives. Desolation Island, Fortune of War, and The Surgeon's Mate are one such grouping. Treason's Harbor, The Far Side of the World, and The Reverse of the Medal are another. The Letter of Marque and the ensuing 4 books, centered around a circumnavigation, are another.Though the average quality of the books is remarkably high, some are better than others. I suspect that different readers will have different favorites. I personally prefer some of the books with greater psychological elements. The first book, Master and Commander, is one of my favorites. The last 2 or 3, while good, are not as strong as earlier books. I suspect O'Brian's stream of invention was beginning to diminish. All can be read profitably as stand alone works though there is definitely something to be gained by reading in consecutive order."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"In &quot;The Surgeon's Mate&quot;, as the title suggests, Stephen Maturin is the main protagonist. Although of course Jack Aubrey is always present to help Maturin accomplish his goals, most of the action revolves around intelligence activities.The book opens right where the previous &quot;The Fortune of War&quot; ended. Maturin &amp; Aubrey sail into Halifax Canada as conquering warriors &amp; are much acclaimed by the locals (with some humorous entanglements for Aubrey). Soon, tho, we are back at sea, being pursued by privateers paid to kill Maturin. From this point on there is almost constant action, for Maturin has new intelligence assignments as well as unfinished business with the French. Meanwhile, his personal life continues rocky due to Diana Villiers presence. Of course, all will end happily as Patrick O'Brian lets you know by his choice of titles.It is hard to critically discuss &quot;The Surgeon's Mate&quot; as a stand-alone novel, since so much of it is a continuation of plots begun in &quot;The Fortune of War&quot;. It is complex, exciting, &amp; definitely not the best choice as your introduction to the Aubrey/Maturin series. At the very least, read &quot;The Fortune of War&quot; before embarking upon this particular voyage. You will enjoy all the more for having done so!"},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"The Surgeon's Mate picks up where The Fortune of War left off. In the previous installment our boys had escaped from Boston just in time to participate in the epic battle between the Chesapeake and the Shannon. Victorious they arrive in Halifax and more trouble begins. Aubrey's lack of land sense and Maturin's unrequited love for Diana continue to cause them problems. In fact they are the underlying tensions that follow them through each episode in the novel. Along the way we are treated to O'Brian's philosophical discussions between his two quirky heroes and among their assorted friends and associates. Like the others in the series The Surgeon's Mate is a gem.Unlike earlier novels the action in The Surgeon's Mate is non-stop. O'Brian, always excellent in his characterization and use of language, has considerably improved the pacing from the earliest series entries. The reader is treated to the heroes travelling from Halifax to England to the Baltic to Paris and back to England in a rousing tour-de-force. Does O'Brian lose anything with the faster pace of The Surgeon's Mate? Absolutely not, he still has the strengths of the earlier books.One aspect of the series that has made it great is the ability of O'Brian to set some of the thorny discussions of our times in the context of the early 19th century. In The Surgeon's Mate, the abortion issue creates a marvelous balanced tension. O'Brian's presentation is even handed, airing both sides of the debate but ultimately not choosing sides. O'Brian has moderated some of the great debates of the last 30 years in his Aubrey Maturin series while providing great naval action along the way.Perhaps it's time to put O'Brian's novels in a special category- six stars."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"This is the seventh in O'Brian's 20-volume series. It follows the now well-established formula, as Captain Jack Aubrey and ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin sail smoothly from one book to the next. This book is really two tales, two unconnected sea voyages, split by an interlude in England that feels more like an intermission. Picking up where the previous volume left off, the two find themselves in Canada where Aubrey's behavior may surprise you. The first voyage brings them home for the first time in many months (and three volumes). The heart of the story is the second voyage that takes them to the Baltic for the first time (both for them and for readers) on an intelligence mission. As the voyage ends, they find themselves in France and Maturin at his most interesting in extricating them from a dilemma and in reconnecting with Diana Villiers.O'Brian is simply a great writer. This series is not for everyone, for the prose is spare and sophisticated, the plotting both delicate enough to sustain readers for many volumes on end, yet bold enough to satisfy fans of adventure tales. The nautical terms are easily mastered, this is not a book for sailors, but for readers who enjoy good adventure stories."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"When I purchased a few more of the Aubrey-Maturin series, the clerks behind the counter tried to recall upon which cable network the series was being televised. Their memories did not serve them well, because they had the Aubrey-Maturin series mixed up with the A &amp; E channel's Horatio Hornblower series. The mistake was understandable,though, because O'Brian's series clearly shows the author's awareness that he is plowing a field that a series of naval novels has already furrowed. Yet, the Aubrey/Maturin novels do not seem like &quot;knock-offs&quot; of the Horatio Hornblowers; instead, they are quite interesting in their own right. Aubrey, the sea captain, and Maturin, his ship's surgeon and an intelligence agent, are both interesting, larger than life, and yet human, characters. The technique of telling real-life sea battles and portraying real historical personages as minor characters is as old as naval historical fiction, but O'Brian does it so well it never seems forced or pedantic. The recurring themes of the novel--the consummate sea captain who is all asea on land, the consummate intelligence agent who is anything but intelligent in matters of the heart, do not seem too clicheed,though the author and the reader use them as touchstones, decorative fill-in between the exciting naval stuff. The Surgeon's Mate manages to make both its naval scenes and its &quot;other story&quot; quite interesting, which is not always as true as the other O'Brian books, in which the naval battles are so fascinating, one longs to be done with the romantic and personal troubles of the protagonists and move on to another sea engagement. The social commentary--people of the very early 19th C. were human like us, but the social structure was quite different--is, as always in this series, effective because it is not a centerpiece. We see over and over in these books how cultured and yet how barbaric the practice of this time could be.This is a really good read. This is a really good series. If you haven't given Maturin and Aubrey a go, you should!"},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"The Aubrey/Maturin cycle is not only one of the most exciting historical adventure series written in this century, but is also a work of deep psychological characterization, recondite literary symbolism, scrupulous historical accuracy, and surprising humor. In short, these books are fine literature and &quot;The Surgeon's Mate&quot; is arguably one of the three best out of the entire series of eighteen written so far. O'Brian's recreation of the cornucopia of humanity in the Napoleonic era is most impressive; but O'Brian's greatest talent, among a myriad of great talents, is to bring a subtle, ironic humor to the Yin/Yang relationship of the two heroes - inducing laughter out of tragedy, and sadness out of triumph. Look for the triple meaning behind the words of the title, &quot;The Surgeon's Mate&quot;."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"In \\"The Surgeon's Mate\\", Patrick O'Brian concludes the interior trilogy that is contained within his larger series- the previous two being \\"Desolation Island\\" and \\"Fortune of War\\". In these books Stephen Maturin comes into his own as the main protagonist driving the suspense and tension- in addition to the overt action on the high seas and the covert action of 19th Century espionage, Stephen struggles with an addiction to an opiate and a woman whose collective effect nearly destroys him. \\"The Surgeon's Mate\\" continues this trend and takes it to new levels, and concludes them rather than leaving us hanging. \`Lucky' Jack Aubrey is of course present, and often present at the heart of the action, and in this volume exposes the weaker side of his character in the form of an affair he has in Halifax- after so long away, he caves only a few months from home.From the harbor of Halifax, Stephen, Jack and Diana travel back to England and are pursued relentlessly by American privateers- so relentlessly that Stephen realizes they are sent to hunt and capture him as result of his recent exploits in causing havoc among the French intelligence service in America. From this tense chase, the companions are given a much needed respite in England. The are there long enough for Jack's mistake with Amanda Smith in Halifax to haunt him- for Diana and Stephen to drift apart, and for Stephen to accept his invitation to speak at the Institute in Paris on his beloved topic of Natural Philosophy. When in Paris he brings Diana and sets her up with his contacts, as she can no longer stand English society (mostly due to her own promiscuity), and terrified at the prospect that she is unmarried and may be with child. Jack and Stephen reunite and escape from their various troubles by accepting a mission to neutralize (peacefully if possible) a garrisoned fortress in the Baltic known as the Grisholm; a fortress manned by Catalan soldiers misled by Napoleon's propaganda and led by none other than Stephen's Godfather. This sets up Maturin to again take the lead and showcase the espionage that O'Brian writes so well.Along the way to the conclusion O'Brian writes some of his best descriptions of the Channel, and the sights to be seen there. The dialogue is crisp and sparkles- the addition of the Swedish \`hero' named Jagiello adds a lot of humor- the scenes of Stephen, Jack and Jagiello bumbling and scheming in prison is classic. The final chapters take the reader on a gale-force journey from cannon fire in the Baltic to the terrors of a lee-shore and eventually the infamous Temple Prison in Paris. . . ."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"Before reading each of the last couple of books in this series I think to myself that surely this book cannot be as good as the ones before it and each time, after reading it, I know that I was wrong. This book is as good as any of the previous books in this phenomenal series and I throughly enjoyed every page. This book has it all; action and suspense on land and sea, great character development and wonderfully sharp wit. I don't like to give away too much about the plot in my reviews, but in short, Stephen gets into more trouble for his espionage activities, his relationship with Diana develops further, and Jack's personal life gets more complicated and difficult. I thought that Diana comes across as a slightly more likeable character in this book than in previous books. Although this is basically a serious story, it is also very funny; probably the most humorous book in the series so far. O'brian introduces a great new character, Jagiello, a strikingly handsome, accident-prone cavalry officer that attracts pretty much every women he meets. Many of the really funny scenes involve Jagiello. In conclusion, I know that this series will probably decline in quality at some point, but not yet. As a side note, there have been many negative things written lately about O'brian's personal life. Even if most of what I have read is true and O'brian really wasn't such a nice guy, it shouldn't detract from his reputation as a writer. Whether he was good, bad or somewhere in between as a person doesn't change the fact that his books are brilliant."},{"Title":"The Surgeon's Mate","review":"I have read ALL of the P.O'Brian books in this series, a couple of times.

It conentrates on the youth worker, explaining what it takes to be effective. This book focuses on a specific philosophy of ministry: the youth worker's head and heart have to be focused properly or the ministry will not be as healthy as it could be. It details the necessary mentality, spirituality, and personal life-style for today's youth worker.

THE LAST JUDGMENT incorporates all of the elements that made us wish this series would continue indefinitely: mature and likeable characters, topical timeliness, and electrifying courtroom drama, all built on a firm, Biblical foundation of values and truths. Historical detail about the cults and offshoots of ancient religions help put current events into perspective. In addition, Parshall's skilled descriptions deftly transport the reader from the midst of Mideast mayhem to tropical island nations to the Oval Office without ever losing the thread of the story.Long a champion of lost causes, Will Chambers is called upon to defend a young Christian convert against charges of terrorism. Will had first met Hass-an Gilead Amahn when he was accused of inciting a riot at a Muslim convention. Having successfully defended him against those charges, Will was drawn to the second case against his better judgment and against the pleading of his wife, Fiona, who had just lost her Father and did not want her husband traveling to the Middle East, putting himself in harm's way. But, as a man of God, Will believed he was called to defend Gilead just as Gilead believed he had been called to preach to his former countrymen. When the Dome of the Temple Mount was destroyed, while Gilead preached, the fallout threatened more than the fragile peace talks between Israel and Palestine.Over the years, Will has gained the loyalty of many who are now more than eager to help him as he faces the most difficult challenge of his career. While not scriptural, you might say that Will is the recipient of some really good karma! Friends like private investigator Tiny Heftland, newsman Jack Hornby, and Special Forces hero Caleb Marlowe are people who we would all like to know and be able to count on if we got into a jam. And Will's old nemesis, Warren Mullburn, is back with another evil scheme designed to increase his wealth and power while dealing a death-blow to Christianity and the Israelis. Mullburn has power that goes beyond his corporate holdings and his island's political sanctuary. He personifies evil with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It is rousing good fun to watch our hero take him on in the courtroom and to see him squirm as he is hoisted on his own petard.Fans of the series will recognize faithful friends and treacherous enemies from previous stories, but the book easily stands alone as an outstanding work of suspense, courtroom drama, and diligent research. Like saying goodbye to an old friend, we hope that we will meet again.

(...)"},{"Title":"The Last Judgment (Chambers of Justice Series #5)","review":"From a spiritual perspective, Jerusalem's Temple Mount intersects three different religions - Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.According to Genesis 22, under the golden Dome of the Rock, Abraham tried to sacrifice his son Isaac to God. Generations later, King David built an altar upon the same rock to stop the plague. His son Solomon built the first temple that was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar on this site. Without question, the Temple Mount is the foundation stone of Judeo-Christian tradition.But the religion of Islam also lays claim to the Temple Mount. When the Muslims conquered Jerusalem in 1638, it set the stage for the first mosque to be built there. In fact, the Temple Mount is regarded as third in importance to Muslims, after Mecca and Medina.The confluence of the three religions on such a small plot of land in such a holy city has led to centuries inflicted with hatred-fueled conflict.Such an undercurrent serves as the focal point of Craig Parshall's new legal thriller \\"The Last Judgment\\", from Harvest House Publishers. In this, the fifth and final installment of his Chambers of Justice series, Parshall departs the breezy summer environs of North Carolina's Outer Banks (\\"Missing Witness\\") and takes attorney Will Chambers to the spiritual epicenter of Jerusalem.Older and wiser, Chambers is doing his best to settle into a quiet suburban lifestyle filled with school sporting events, recitals, and spending more time with his wife and son. The last thing on his mind is taking on a religious case that has apocryphal implications.But that is exactly what happens. Chambers makes the decision to defend a young Christian converted from Islam who is charged with staging a religious riot in the United States. With the case settled, Chambers does not hear from the young man again until he receives a call from Jerusalem. His client, Gilead Ahman, has been charged with bombing the Temple Mount into a pile of rubble and stone. At issue is whether Ahman has enlisted a terrorist cult to assist him in the Temple Mount's destruction or did he act alone.Now Chambers must figure out whether his client is on a mission for God, for Allah, or none of the above. Further complicating matters is a wife at home who wants him to have no part in the case.At the book's core, Parshall effectively explains why the Temple Mount is such a valuable piece of real estate in a world racing forward toward the end times.\\"I really believe that Jerusalem is the future,\\" explained Parshall, in a recent interview on CBN.com. \\"It is the future of the United States, it's the global future, and it is also the future of the Christian church. If we lose sight of its importance in God's grand scheme of things than we really forget why Jerusalem is so special and why it is at the heart of God. Evangelicals can differ on timelines and the eschatology but we all agree on one thing ... that is Jesus is coming again and Jerusalem will play an integral part in that. To forget that means we really forget to read the signs of the times.\\"Readers of the Chambers of Justice series will find a more seasoned Will Chambers both professionally and spiritually in \\"The Last Judgment\\". It has been refreshing to see the evolution of his faith, a process of spiritual maturity that culminates with some hard choices to be made in the face of cataclysmic events.\\"I challenged myself to show growth and change in him (Will Chambers),\\" Parshall said. \\"In my first book he comes to the Lord. He is about as unsaved as you can get. He is a man in turmoil, whose life is literally unraveling. In book two, he is trying to figure out how to integrate his faith into the workplace. In book three, his spirituality grows in a world view sense. The fourth book is more of a fun story but Will grows in his relationship with Fiona (his wife) as well as his priorities as a father. In this book, Will learns about sacrifice and the calling of obedience.\\"Parshall has made sure to include many of the colorful characters that have accompanied Chambers on his many previous adventures fighting for justice. Along for the ride this time are pilot Tex Rhoady, vindictive scientist Orville Putrie, and his reclusive mentor Len Redgrove.\\"These were characters I really liked,\\" said Parshall. \\"I didn't want to say goodbye to these people. A long time before writing \\"The Last Judgment\\" I decided that a lot of these characters I somehow wanted to bring back and give them a last curtain call.\\"\\"The Last Judgment\\" concludes in a hail of gunfire, explosions, and top secret aircraft. When the last gun has been fired and the last bomb has been thrown, readers are left with a man, his faith, and the knowledge that Will Chambers made a difference in the lives of many.Ultimately, this is a book that delves into the sometimes tense relationship between Christianity and Islam. In the books' 428 pages, Parshall probes many critical issues, politically and religiously, that may be addressed in the not too distant future.I highly recommend \\"The Last Judgment\\" for several reasons. First, Parshall tackles an issue (the contentious nature of the Temple Mount) he is very passionate about with aplomb. Second, as he has done so eloquently in previous Chambers of Justice offerings, he writes fresh, compelling narrative with mass market appeal. Finally, Craig Parshall is a master at weaving morality into the narrow, litigious margins of the courtroom.If you haven't done so already, do yourself a favor today and pick up a copy of \\"The Last Judgment\\"."},{"Title":"The Last Judgment (Chambers of Justice Series #5)","review":"I just finished this book, after reading the entire series over the past few months (this one was the last of the series) and it was by far Craig Parshall's best!

I just never thought Christians would ever get to read any 'high-calibur' fiction books. What a way to spend a rainy afternoon! It just goes to show that God DOES give good gifts to His!

In this one, he is representing Gilead Amahn, a young Christian pastor. He is a former Muslim who was born in Egypt and says that he has a calling to preach the Word to his own people.While back in the States, he had been defended by Chambers when he was charged with inciting a riot at a Muslim convention. Will has not heard from him in quite some time and then is beckoned when Amahn finds himself charged with a terrorist act by the Palestinean Authority. He is accused of passing himself off as a cult figure claiming to be the 'second coming' of a leading Muslim cleric from a millenium ago and killing numerous people.Gilead himself claims innocence and asserts that he has been simply preaching the Gospel.Chambers finds himself with a very difficult case and is trying to sort it out and defend his client.

The utterly amateurish cover and inside typography detracts a great deal from the enjoyment of the book, which collects 15 of the roughly 34 Inspector Chafik stories published in Colliers, Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine, and John Bull between 1947 and 1969. Set in post-WWII Iraq, the stories feature a cunning Baghdad police inspector. Drawing on his wartime experience in Iraq, Child created a kind of stereotypical genius inspector who's smarter than everyone else and has those abstract leaps of intuition that are the mark of the brilliant fictional detective. Fortunately, he's not infallible, and in several stories must be rescued by his faithful assistant or his adopted son. In each, there is an initial murder which Chafik tackles, although sometimes he metes out his own form of justice rather than proceeding strictly according to law. The stories need to be read slowly over time, otherwise they tend to blur into each other as the author's style and construction is unvaried throughout. As a portrait of Baghdad, it's occasionally insightful. For example, in the stories Chafik deals with Armenians, Greeks, Sunnis, Shi'ites, city folks, villagers, rich, and poor. In that sense it does a good job of showing the diversity that exists in may Arab cities, but otherwise it's a fairly static and romanticized picture of Baghdad just before rapid modernization hits. Altogether, a moderately diverting collection of old-fashioned stories in an unusual setting."},{"Title":"The Sleuth of Baghdad","review":"Crippen landru continue their LOST CLASSICS series with a great adition, the Child stories.

My bookshelf is running over with every kind of book on Diabetes 2. But, Diabetes for Dummies, gets right to the point. Easy to understand and helpful to those of us with diabetes and our families."},{"Title":"Diabetes For Dummies (For Dummies (Health & Fitness))","review":"This is by far one of the better books I ever read on Diabetes and related symptoms and conditions. It is organize in an easy to read manner, provides checklists, promotes good health, and explains why you must control your diabetes before it hurts you.However, few people ever read an entire book because they find it boring or confusing. So, you need to enroll in Diabetes Educational Classes offer at every medical center or hospital. You will learn how to understand and mange your diabetes within days.Also, one thing that all researchers agree that cuts across all races and cultures for anyone who has diabetes, you must walk at least 30+ minutes a day. You will be amazed how this will show immediate results and make you feel better. I know you will find it cumbersome and burdensome at first, but when you see that your excessive thirst goes Away, or your medication is reduced and you sleep better you will want to walk all the time. I suggest you get an AM/FM Radio headphone radio that has push buttons to change channels.In this way, you will enjoy listening to Talk Radio; National Public Radio, Sports or Music and you will walk even farther without any effort. The hardest thing about walking is starting to do it every day. Once you start you, will never stop and if you can get up to 3 to 4 miles a day or over an hour, you will feel terrific even with diabetes. If you walk early in the morning or early evening, it is beautiful to see the sunrise or sunset.Additionally, be sure to keep you feet clean, dry, and put powder on them using clean socks each time. Purchase &quot;New Balance Tennis Shoes,&quot; and make sure they are at least half inch bigger than your feet. One company called San Antonio Shoes, (SAS), actually makes comfortable formal shoes for diabetics to wear too. In this way, your feet will be comfortable as you walk.Moreover, in time you will learn to adjust to your diet. You can often eat what you want, but only in portions as the book points out. This book outlines this area but every diabetic is different and you have to adjust to what works for you.If you care about anyone with diabetes, get him or her this book. Once you take classes, read this book, start walking, and watching your diet, you will understand that you can control your diabetes so it does not control you.Dr. Rueben has done a terrific job by writing this book and you will never know it until you read it!"},{"Title":"Diabetes For Dummies (For Dummies (Health & Fitness))","review":"My husband and I have both been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (within a week of each other).

Between the two, a couple pills and some insulin, we have dropped his glucose count by more than 350 in just 30 days.

I thought I knew a lot of diabetes and diet, but Dr. Rubin had some information that I did not know.

You will find conflicting information on the internet. He does debunk the myth that diabetes is all about controlling sugar.He gives his opinion (which is well supported by the medical community) about the carbs, proteins and fats that you should be consumming, but be aware that not everyone will be respond to his recommendations.Also be aware that this book does not cover everything. For instance you will have to get another reference or two to become more knowledge about the GI index and what foods have a low GI index.That said, the book is what is claims to be - a good, basic, easy to understand, manual for those who have diabetes and their families.I recommend that you start with this book and then get another one in some depth if you need it."},{"Title":"Diabetes For Dummies (For Dummies (Health & Fitness))","review":"When I was diagnoised with type 2 diabetes in December 2009 I was so shocked and of course very afraid, after talking to the doctor on my second visit she advised me to purchase Diabetes For Dummies.

She reached some low numbers on her glucose recently (35,45, 51) so I decided to take charge. I picked this book. I have been studying it for one hour daily. After two weeks, I have nine pages of notes. I feel that this is the best way to approach such a topic. And I do feel that this is the best book on the subject. After one finds out that they have diabetes, it is a terrible blow. If one has trouble with the text, they might assign a relative to the task of studying this book and taking notes. If not, a psychologist trained in behavior modification could be useful. If no on both of these answers, then just do your best with this book. Try to read ten pages a day and write down the important parts. Please write down only the important issues or you will get overwhelmed. The way to win is to give in. Dr. Rubin does include everything. Try to get the gist of what he says and possibly disregard every-little-thing. 80% of the results are in 20% of the material on all these books, remember. I have references. One now. &quot;Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution.&quot; I can not have this as my main text. But you might want to consider it. High-protien Low-carbohydrate. I don't believe it is healthy. But I did have to propose the idea to my mother. She rejected the idea immediately. I can only tell you what I am doing. And this book is perfect for my caretaking needs So far, thanks to Dr. Rubin and his book, I immediately made an appointment with her primary caretaker. I sent in for an updated meter. And I sent for a &quot;Feet for a Lifetime&quot; kit in which we can test her feet! She also seems interested in some of the extras that Dr. Rubin talks about. Especially the &quot;magnifiers&quot; that can enable a diabetic with visual problems to see the syringe and bottle numbers better. So Rubin has helped my family greatly in this book.

He really makes sense out of what is available. The book is unfailingly clear.I was also impressed with his anecdotes, drawn from his practice, about the emotional experiences of his patients, and with his tips on how to cope with setbacks, glitches, and successes.Many books on diabetes lecture the patient. In this book, diabetics will find a physician-author who does not lecture and who is not afraid to evaluate treatments and approaches.

I've bought LOTS more. But this is the one I continually go back to for information, reminders, and research. Dr. Rubin's approach to managing diabetes makes a lot of sense. I particularly like his recommended division of carbs/protein/fat (40-30-30). After attending a daylong nutrition class on diabetes, being given a diet with a 60% carb ratio, failing to avoid &quot;spikes&quot; in glucose, and failing to continue losing the weight I'd been losing using Dr. Rubin's approach, I returned to this book. My weight loss picked back up, I felt better and -- best of all -- I was again successful at managing my Type II diabetes.

The book covers both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The first part of the book talks about the onset of the disease: the psychological reactions, what a diagnosis of diabetes means (&quot;it's the glucose&quot;), and the two types of diabetes. I found particularly interesting the list of famous people who had diabetes, including Thomas Edison and Elvis Presley. The second part of the book discusses the complications of the disease and their treatment. The author claims he did not intend to frighten the reader, and he does give you practical steps you can take to deal with and even prevent the problems. The third part talks about lifestyle changes, including glucose monitoring and other tests, nutrition, exercise, and medication. Chapter 11, &quot;Diabetes Is Your Show,&quot; really didn't work for me. It tries to make an analogy between diabetes care and the cast and crew of a stage show--but it seemed terribly contrived. The fourth part covers special issues: diabetes and children, diabetes and the elderly, insurance and job issues, advances in diabetes care, and bogus treatments. Overall, the book was interesting; even the lists of drugs and their characteristics was probably as interesting as it could be. The book provides both background information and practical advice. The orientation of the book is very positive, focusing on how you can take control of the disease. I especially like this quote: &quot;Is it possible that you could be healthier with diabetes than your friends who do not have diabetes? ...the answer to that question is yes.&quot; (page 102)"},{"Title":"Diabetes For Dummies (For Dummies (Health & Fitness))","review":"I can't tell you how many times I've recently accessed the new Diabetes For Dummies, by Alan L. Rubin, MD. Don't let the title put you off, it's one of the best guides to diabetes management I've read. From causes, symptoms, and side effects to treatments, diet and exercise--this book delivers! Parents may be interested to know that there's even a chapter on managing a baby or preschooler with diabetes. Dr. Rubin is way ahead of the headlines, as he's even included dealing with obesity and type 2 diabetes in children in this book.Being a &quot;checklist&quot; type of person, I like the way this book is laid out, highlighting and summarizing important points in each area, along with chapter references for expanded information on the topic at hand. For example, one short checklist identifies six things you should be able to do if your child is controlling his diabetes with insulin:1. Identify the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (with chapter reference)2. Administer insulin (with chapter reference)3. Measure the blood glucose and urine ketones (with chapter reference)4. Treat hypoglycemia with food or glucagon (with chapter reference)5. Feed your diabetic child (with chapter reference)6. Know what to do when your child is sick with another childhood illness (with chapter reference).Diabetes For Dummies is a book you can pick up and read from chapter to chapter, or use as a reference source to answer your questions. The index is very complete and the Appendixes include a mini-cookbook (my type of book!), diabetic exchange lists, website references (even including one for animals with diabetes) and a good glossary of terms.I would give Diabetes For Dummies a five-star rating."},{"Title":"Diabetes For Dummies (For Dummies (Health & Fitness))","review":"As a newly dialognosed Type 2 Diabetic, I had a lot of questions. Being familiar with the &quot;Dummie&quot; series, I thought this book would answer most, if not all of my questions...but, I have to say that it left me a litte short. The major issue I have with it is that it's kind of all over the place. Most of the information is about Type 1 Diabetes, with information on Type 2 interspersed into the particular topic. It has very little useful info on self-care &amp; alternative options, other than to say that most don't work. I could of did without the recipe section, since there are only a few listed.

But the surprising thing about his new book is how well he says it, and his support of the glycemic index shows in particular that he is current with the latest thinking on how to deal with diabetes.&quot;This blurb summarizes the way I feel about the book because I wrote the blurb after reading unbound galley proofs.Dr. Rubin does bring impeccable credentials to writing this important new book about diabetes. For the past quarter of a century he has been in private practice in endocrinology and metabolism in San Francisco. During that period he has also taught at the University of California Medical Center.However, few experts on diabetes can communicate their knowledge as well as Dr. Rubin has. Two who come to mind June Biermann and Barbara Toohey, the editors-in-chief of DiabetesWebSite.com share my enthusiasm for Dr. Rubin's book. In their own blurb for the book, they write, &quot;This lively and lucid tell-it-all guide will provide you with the information you need to leap from the valley of diabetes ignorance to the peaks of understanding.&quot;That this book is intended as a reference makes its readability even more exceptional. Dr. Rubin notes that he doesn't expect us to read it all the way through like a novel, although that's what I found myself doing.Dr. Rubin covers all the bases about diabetes, but what found me saying &quot;yes&quot; to myself the most was his chapter on Diabetes Diet Plan. He faces up to the biggest issue. &quot;If there were a more controversial area in nutrition for the diabetic person than carbohydrates, I would like to know about it,&quot; Dr. Rubin writes. &quot;You are free to disagree with me and use whatever level of carbohydrate you like as long as it helps to promote a lower blood glucose without increasing blood fats or weight.&quot;Likewise, he recognizes that &quot;all carbohydrates are not alike in the degree to which they raise the blood glucose.&quot; The glycemic index was created to quantify these differences. If only all endocrinologists could be that open-minded.Whether you have just been diagnosed or have an M.D., here's one of the first books about diabetes to buy and read. Yes, it takes humility to admit that you are a dummy. But as June and Barbara say in their blurb, &quot;When it comes to diabetes, almost everyone is a dummy, including, alas, a number of health care professionals.&quot; Dr. Rubin, fortunately, is not one of them."},{"Title":"Diabetes For Dummies (For Dummies (Health & Fitness))","review":"An epidemic of Diabetes is sweeping across the world and South Asians who adopt a modern diet are developing the disease at especially high rates. While no one has yet found a cure for diabetes, there have been great advances in the management of the disease. A diabetic who truly understands his disease and correctly uses all the tools available to manage it can expect decades of good health. On the other hand, poorly managed diabetes will soon lead to complications that range from amputations and infections to blindness, kidney failure and heart disease. As millions of people develop diabetes, there is no way any society can provide enough doctors to manage their disease on a day to day basis. It thus becomes essential that the patients and their caretakers learn enough about the disease to be able to take most of the responsibility for their own care. This has led to an explosion of self help books for diabetics and Dr. Rubin's \\"Diabetes for dummies\\" is one of the best in the field.The editors of the \\"Dummies\\" series made an inspired choice when they asked Dr. Rubin to write this book. While Dr. Rubin is a very well known diabetologist with solid scientific credentials, he is not an academic who spends more time on research than he does seeing real patients. Rather, he is primarily a clinician, with decades of practical experience managing thousands of diabetics. This perspective helped him write a book that is focused first and foremost on being practically useful. The book is easy to read and understand and the reader needs no prior scientific knowledge to follow it. The book begins with an account of how a typical person reacts to the diagnosis of diabetes. After some practical advice on dealing with the initial shock and dismay, Dr. Rubin explains what diabetes is and what we know about its causes. The only weakness in the book may be the fact that he tries to explain all the different types of diabetes (type 1 is what children usually get, type 2 is the more common adult type and gestational diabetes is seen in pregnant women) and this may unnecessarily confuse some of his readers. Since most of the target audience will have type 2 diabetes (it is at least 10 times more common than type 1, its increasing even faster, and it's the kind overweight adults usually get) he might have done better to focus purely on type 2 and write a separate book for the type 1 diabetics. Still, this is not a serious problem and with a little bit of effort any reader should be able to focus on the parts of the book which are most relevant to his or her problem.After explaining what diabetes is and what it can do to you, he comes to the most useful part of the book: how to manage your diabetes. The advice is up to date, practical and served up with wit and humor. The reader will learn all about the importance of testing your own blood sugar every single day (an occasional test at your doctors office is practically useless) and how to keep it in the acceptable range. All the complications of diabetes can be slowed or even prevented altogether if glucose is tightly controlled. Starting with diet and exercise and moving on to pills and insulin shots, the tools to control your sugar are out there and Dr. Rubin explains each of them in detail. Once you read the book, you will easily know more than most doctors know about this stuff. And you should! It's your health; the era when doctors behaved like God and the patient was little more than the passive recipient of care he could never hope to comprehend is well and truly past. Patients need to take more and more responsibility for their own care and books like this are exactly what they need to make informed decisions about their health.The book includes a section on what doesn't work (unfortunately, the quack remedies mentioned are mostly the ones being advertised in the US, the Pakistani reader will have to evaluate his local quacks on his own) and what may be available in the future. There is a cookbook at the end, but the recipes are mostly American and may be less useful in [Asia]. There is also a very nice list of websites where even more information is available. In short, a very useful book and a must for every person who has diabetes or cares for a diabetic. While it is obviously intended for an American audience, the information is universally useful and is needed even more in a country where access to quality healthcare is so problematic."},{"Title":"Diabetes For Dummies (For Dummies (Health & Fitness))","review":"I took a chance on this book, having been diagnosed with diabetes in 1999.

The requisite amount of magnesium typically is 500 mg to 600 mg daily -- preferably as chelated magnesium or magnesium citrate.As noted above, The Magnesium Miracle by Dr. Carolyn Dean discusses the role of magnesium in the prevention and treatment of diabetes as does the book The Magnesium Factor by Dr. Mildred Seelig. Both of these important books are readily available from Amazon.com."},{"Title":"Diabetes For Dummies (For Dummies (Health & Fitness))","review":"This is the second worst book on diabetes I've read. (I see that the worst book has got good reviews on amazon.com, and is not available on amazon.co.uk. I myself have reviewed it on Facebook.)After much consideration I've given the book presently under review two stars (at first I wanted to give it only one). It gets the two stars for the vast amount of medical information given, though as it is written by two traditional doctors, this is traditional information, much of it in my view erroneous. But it also provides a lot of presumably correct information I've seen nowhere else, such as practical information about driving in relation to diabetics and dealing with discrimination at work. This is a British book (I don't know whether there is also an American version), so much of it refers to British legislation and help available in the U.K.. It also contains information I haven't seen before about coping with diabetes and pregnancy, sexual function and diabetes foot care.I learn something from nearly all the books on diabetes I read, and in this case I learnt that the B-vitamin nicotine amide constitutes a protective factor against diabetes, Nice to know.The main criticism I have of the book is as follows:Though the authors in various places mention the importance of a low-carbohydrate diet, in practice it turns out that they have apparently little understanding of what this in fact involves. It is of course correctly stated that all refined carbohydrates should be avoided - at least theoretically they got that right. Except that they actually didn't since sugar, lots of fruit and sweet desserts are absolutely permissible in the view of these two doctors.But it is not even enough to eat only complex carbohydrates with a low GI-Index. You have to eat a reduced AMOUNT of these carbohydrates. Dr. Bernstein, the author of \\"Dr. Bernstein's diabetes solution\\", whom I regard as the absolute authority on managing diabetes, if not curing it, recommends a carbohydrate content of 6 g. for breakfast and 12 g. for each of the two subsequent meals. He has himself suffered from type 1 diabetes since the age of 12, and is totally dependent on insulin.The book under review contains a small section on counting carbohydrates. but there is no indication at all about how many grams of carbohydrate should be allowed at each meal for optimal blood sugar control. And in a, for me, shocking section of the book under the heading \\"Carbohydrate counting to maximum health\\" an example is given of a typical \\"well-controlled\\" type 1 patient's carbohydrate intake. His breakfast intake is stated as containing, for example, 80 (!) grams of carbohydrate, his lunch contains 120 grams carbohydrate and his supper \\"only\\" 60 grams of carbohydrate! Compare please these amounts to Dr. Bernstein's recommended 6g, 12 g and 12 g.There were innumerable irritating not to mention fallacious or outrageous statements in this book:1)Statins and aspartame are described as \\"excellent\\" (See \\"Fat and cholesterol are good for you\\" by Uffe Ravnskov and \\"The great cholesterol myth\\" by Malcolm Kendrick on the so-called \\"excellence\\" of statins) and google \\"aspartame\\" to find information on the toxicity of this potent additive. The use of the word \\"excellent\\" in connection with both these toxins seriously tarnishes the credibility of the authors of this book.2) The authors dismiss the possibility that chromium, Gymnema silvestre and other substances can be at all useful in the regulation of diabetes. Being doctors, they seem to regard minerals, vitamins and other natural substances as they would regard potent drugs, and don't realize that what is important is the COMBINED factors of a good (low-carbohydrate) diet and the provision of all essential vitamins and minerals, including, for example, Vanadium, which they have neglected to mention as an important mineral relevant in the treatment of diabetes, the importance of which they would call in question. Moreover, they claim that British people are not deficient in chromium. How do they know this?3) They state: \\"Genetic inheritance causes type 2 diabetes\\". This is a sweeping statement, the truth of which I would absolutely contest. There may of course be genetic factors involved, but the vital factor must be lifestyle.4) The authors propagate the myth that \\"you generally get enough vitamins for your daily needs.\\" Especially as regards chronically ill persons such as diabetics this statement is absolutely fallacious.5) They keep reiterating that \\"diabetes lasts for life\\", which is a negative affirmation to keep hearing, especially since in fact it is possible for some to be cured of diabetes, but only as long as they adhere to a correct diet (see Cass Ingram's book \\"Natural cures for diabetes\\").6) Being doctors, their main focus as regards a \\"cure\\" for diabetes is new drugs, and we know that drugs generally prove harmful in the one way or the other.As regards point 6), I would state that much of the book is focussed on the various drugs available for diabetics, and though many of these are recommended by the authors, to their credit their dangers are stated. I'm no expert on diabetes drugs, but I would like to point out that Dr. Bernstein, who is, advises against the use of sulphonyureas.I could write pages more on the criticizable elements of this book, but this must be more than enough.Suffice to say that I do not recommend this book, though it does contain theoretical and practical information about the disease and its complications."},{"Title":"Diabetes For Dummies (For Dummies (Health & Fitness))","review":"No matter how long you deal with diabetes, sometimes it helps to see things in writing.

However, when I went to the American Heart Association web site, entered the results of my latest bloodwork (including blood glucose, chloresterol, etc.), and had their \\"Heart Attack Risk Factor\\" calculator compute my heart attack risk, I found that my risk of heart attack with my elevated blood glucose readings is exactly the same as my risk of heart attack with normal blood glucose. (Most people aged 70 or over, I'm told, have a ten-year risk of heart attack of 20% or more. Mine, according to the AHA risk calculator, is 3% - though hey, I'm not quite 69 yet.) At this point, I realized that what I really needed was to educate myself, so I have some idea what dangers my doctor sees are real and what aren't, and I discovered this book and started reading.This is a great place to find out not only what the risks of diabetes are, but also what the symptoms are and how elevated your blood sugar has to be before they begin. I found it reassuring in my case, and think I would have felt the same way even if I'd found out I really was at high risk for something. Doctors are so drug-crazy, all the ones I've been able to find after moving to a new area, anyway - and too many of them don't seem to have a clue what risks are real and what aren't for individual patients. (I differ from many pre-diabetics in that I'm physically active and not overweight, and my problems come from surgery, not lifestyle or diet or heredity. My doctor is a bit weak on the benefits of exercise - shrugs off any reference to it and has just informed my health center that I should not be allowed to exercise due to my \\"elevated risk\\" until she does a full cardiac evaluation. I'll probably do it - I have no objection to finding out what REAL risks actually are, though I do feel a little guilty about the added cost to my health insurance provider.

I think that for many of us, &quot;wonder,&quot; and a sense of personal contact with grand mysteries, are best experienced through either astronomy or archaeology. What I mean by that is that both of these topics necessitate a personal confrontation with the unknown. The origin of the universe; the fate of ancient peoples; the mythic architecture of dreams uponst which olden folk drew, to explain their place in the cosmos... if these topics don't give you at least a slight frisson of wonder, then, face it, you're hopeless.This book provides a concatenated sense of wonder by drawing upon both archaeology and astronomy, and distilling many of the most provocative questions explored in each topic. Added to these topics is a tincture of anthropology, which in my mind solidifies the claim that this book has to true neato-hood.The focus is on the Western Hemisphere, as the title states. The book starts out with a collection of essays by respected, authentic scholars who study this kind of thing. Essay topics include &quot;Archaeoastronomy Today,&quot; &quot;Archaeoastronomy and Education,&quot; &quot;The Role of Architecture and Planning in Archaeoastronomy,&quot; and various and sundry allied topics. If you have a longstanding interest in this kind of thing, you might expect the book to spend a lot of time on the Mayans, because of all the work done on Mayan calendrics, etc. Well, true, there's a lot about the Mayans, but there's also plentiful material about peoples without written records, such as the Chumash, the Apache, some Algonquin tribes, etc.Let me just point out that the people who contributed to this volume are all respected scholars -- there are no von Danikens, no Velikovskies, no Stichins to call the whole book into question with wild claims about pre-historic extraterrestrial contact, or the like. This book is for real.The body of the book, like the introduction, is divided into essays by academics with backgrounds in the appropriate fields. The essays are broken up into geographical regions -- North America, Mesoamerica, and South America. Essays delve into all kinds of fascinating subtopics about many archaeoastronomical questions. There is a little essay at the end, about prospects for teaching archaeoastronomy in the classroom. This essay is over twenty years old now, but it still has much of relevance to say.If you enjoy this kind of thing, you may wish to know about the &quot;Journal of Archaeoastronomy,&quot; which you can find either online or in &quot;Magazines for Libraries.&quot; Also, you can't go wrong reading anything at all by Anthony Aveni. Anyway, this book is a lot of fun.

A seasoned traveler, fluent in Spanish, Theroux brings to life his trip through the northern and southern hemispheres, traveling without a schedule and observing his fellow passengers on the train and people at stops along the way.In Texas he is astonished at the contrasts between Laredo on the Texas side of the Rio Grande and Nuevo Laredo across the border in Mexico, commenting on society and governments. Traveling through Mexico and Guatemala, he observes the poverty of the Indians and their lack of opportunities. In El Salvador he attends a soccer game and gets caught up in the riots which follow. In Costa Rica, the cleanest country he has visited, he finds himself stuck on the train with Mr. Thornberry, a New Hampshire tourist so boring that Theroux cannot wait to escape him. In Panama he meets the \\"Zonians,\\" from the Canal Zone, and in Cali, Colombia, he meets a married \\"priest\\" who cannot tell his devout mother in Belfast that he has \\"left\\" the church to marry and have children.Throughout his trip, Theroux reads classics, particularly enjoying Boswell's Life of Dr. Johnson and Edgar Allen Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, both of which provide ironic reference points for his own journey. For literature lovers, the most fascinating section occurs in Buenos Aires, where Theroux spends many days visiting blind writer Jorge Luis Borges, who persuades Theroux to read to him. Ironically, one of Borges's favorite novels is The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym.Norman Dietz is a fine narrator, but Theroux's air of superiority, so obvious in his writing, is impossible to keep out of his voice. Sparing little sympathy for American and German tourists, Theroux rarely gets excited about his surroundings, and he (and Dietz) expresses genuine emotion only when Theroux talks with three boys, ages ten to twelve, who live in a doorway and scavenge for food because their rural families have abandoned them. Though Theroux's self-congratulatory attitude gets a bit wearisome (despite the narrator's efforts to be balanced), the picture of Central and South America, thirty years ago, and the section with Borges are unparalleled. With beautiful, carefully observed prose and a great ear for dialogue, Theroux's Patagonia Express is a landmark travel memoir, well read here. n Mary WhippleDark Star Safari: Overland from Cairo to CapetownSir Vidia's Shadow: A Friendship Across Five ContinentsHotel Honolulu: A NovelGhost Train to the Eastern Star: On the Tracks of the Great Railway Bazaar"},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"Terrific in every way, as all of Theroux's travel books are!

In a way it is due to train travel not having changed during that period.

At the end of it, I wonder is this a traveller writing a book on travel or a writer writing a book on travel.This book is almost exclusively about a train journey. PT tried to take train throughout the journey for the sake of it, even though everyone told him that bus was faster etc. But of course he was going to take the train so we read about him whining about its poor condition, its delay, how pathetic the people travelling on the train, how godforsaken the towns were etc.PT had this high and mighty attitude that he scorned about comments by the common tourists (a lower and more superficial class of people on the road whom he was not associating himself with); he had condescending opinion on people reading main-stream books, books which he considered less literarily acclaimed than his own selection on the trip. Oh yes, you get to read about what he read on the trip, with some thoughts and paragraphs included.Being strictly a journey book, PT travelled from point A to point B, with lots of observations and comments on the way, but don't expect him to write a bit about some of the sights he saw along the way (not even Machu Picchu) or some snippets of the history, culture and politics of the places he passed through. He did not even demonstrate a sense of humour! Worse, he was a first-class hypocrite, saying things he thought what the person would prefer to hear instead of his own unkind opinion.PT wrote a very vivid account, a very detailed description on colours, sounds and scents of his journey. But there was something lacking. A story that scored high technically but failed in spirit."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"Although I keep reading Paul Theroux, he surprises me at unexpected turns with negative opinions of the way people live, interspersing these into an otherwise fascinating journey. How much can he learn in a 15-minute encounter about the obstacles and centuries of cultural history overcome, the intelligence and perseverance employed to reach the current level, the reasons for the attitude, the challenges of moving past current obstacles?

I wondered whether it might not be as good as his others, but it is just as good as most of them and better than at least one. I don't think you can go wrong with Paul Theroux. He records everything on his travels and then distills his notes to the most interesting bits. The premise for the book is simple: Theroux takes the train from his native Boston all the way to southern Argentina. You will find all the trenchant observations and unusual \\"characters\\" you would in the better-known Great Railway Bazaar and you will find the same consistent quality of writing. With the completion of Patagonian Express, I have now read all of Theroux's travel writing, or at least his eight major works. Now I'm starting on his fiction.

Although Theroux can be witty, sarcastic and interesting to read, he has concentrated too much on the bad, boring bits such as the Central American section. I haven't read the whole book yet (he has just reached Colombia) but if things don't improve I think I will give up on it."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"For me, discovering a new author is like happening upon a gem of a restaurant that serves up a fascinating new concatenation of spices and flavors. Paul Theroux is the flavor of the month for me. I recall that several years ago I read his book about traveling along the perimeter of the Mediterranean - The Pillars of Hercules. I loved the book, and picked up used copies of some of his other titles. These volumes I placed on one of the many shelves in my home that I have mentally labeled: \\"To Be Read When I Can Find The Time\\"! In the past few weeks, I took the time to read two of those volumes, and I could not be more pleased.Let me offer you a soupcon from one of his travel books, and another morsel from one of his novels.How can you not love a travel book that begins on a cold winter's day on the Orange Line on Boston's legendary T - and ends in the wilds of Argentina's Patagonia region. I have had a fascination with Patagonia since my days of studying French at Governor Dummer Academy under the tutelage of Roy A. Ohrn. R.A.O., as he was called by all the students, had been educated at The Sorbonne, and taught in the classic style. IF he caught a student daydreaming in class, he would exclaim: \\"Monsieur, vous tes en Patagonie!\\" I am sure this was a subliminal reason for my picking up a paperback copy of The Old Patagonian Express - By Train Through The Americas.Theroux takes us to Guatemala:\\"Now there were volcanoes all around us, or volcanic hills with footstool shapes that the Mexicans call \`little ovens.' It was cooler, and as the sun grew pinker and a ridge of hills rose to meet it where it hovered drawn to the shape of a chalice, near the Pacific, the gathering darkness threw halftones across the hills. The fragments of white were the hats and shirts of cane cutters marching home. But it was not an ordinary jungle twilight, with the mold of shadow under wide, gleaming leaves, flickering hit fires, and the jostlings of mottled pigs and goats. The sky was in flames far off, and when we came closer, the fire was revealed as enormous: bonfires of waste cane burned in sloping fields and sent up cloud tides that were purple and orange and crimson; they floated and lost their color, becoming white until the night absorbed them. Then this smoke fogged the tracks and it was as if we were traveling on some antique steam locomotive in a mountain pass in Asia, through fog that smelled of stale candy. We roared by and left three men, still hungry on the tracks, ploddingly watching the tail lights wizen and converge, slipping gimleted and neatly out of sight.\\" (Page 104)\\"Churches were built - a dozen of Spanish loveliness, with slender steeples and finely furnished porches and domes. The earth shook - not much, but enough to split them. Tremors left cracks between windows and separated, in the stained glass of those windows, the shepherd from his brittle flock, the saint from his gold staff, the martyr from his persecutors. Christs were parted from their crosses, and the anatomy of chapel Virgins violated as their enameling, the porcelain white of faces and fingers, shattered, sometimes with a report that startled the faithful in their prayers. The windows, the statues, the masonry, were mended; and gold leaf was applied thickly to the splintered altars. It seemed the churches had been made whole again. But the motion of the earthquakes had never really ceased.\\" (Page 105)\\"Anyone who finds a frenzied secularity at a church service in Guatemala - and thinks it should be stamped out - ought to go to the North End of Boston on the feast day of Saint Anthony and consider the probability of redemption n the scuffles of ten thousand Italians frantically pinning dollar bills to the cassock of their patron saint, who is borne on a litter past pizza parlors and mafia hangouts in a procession headed by a wailing priest and six smirking acolytes. Compared to that, the goings-on at La Merced were solemn.\\" (Page 107)I admire that kind of writing. It brought back to me the sounds and smells and sights of Haiti.In addition to being a prolific traveler who writes prosaically about his travels, Theroux has penned over a dozen novels, including \\"The Mosquito Coast\\" that was made into a film that starred Harrison Ford. I just finished reading My Secret History - a thinly veiled fictionalized autobiography of Theroux. He tells the story of a writer from Boston whose habit of living double lives follows him around the world and throughout his life.Theroux sets an elegiac tone even before launching his story, as he opens the book with this epigram, quoting A.E. Housman:Into my heart an air that killsFrom yon far country blows:What are those blue remembered hills,What spires, what farms are those?That is the land of lost content,I see it shining plain:The happy highways where I wentAnd cannot come again.Through the eyes of his protagonist, Andre Parent, Theroux comments knowingly on the complexities of the human condition:\\"But nothing is worse than disgrace. It is lonely and irreversible - a terrible mess. The loud snorting laughter it produces is worse than anguish. Having to live through disgrace is worse than dying.\\" (Page 69)It is my understanding that Theroux, this son of Boston, now lives in Hawaii. I hope the day will come when he returns to the Hub so we can swap stories with each other while bumping along on the Orange Line!Al"},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"The descriptions of what Paul observed while on the trains, under varying conditions, are what I enjoyed the most- they are clear and powerful. Better yet, he lets you in on what he is experiencing while he is describing, so you can perceive his state of mind at the time (which often has a very strong influence on how he describes various places), and what he is reading. He also focuses in on the most quirky &quot;characters&quot; that he meets in the towns and on the trains. His writing style is highly entertaining thoughout the entire book. I liked the fact that he didn't travel first class, but &quot;mucked in&quot; (as Michael Palin said in his TV travel series)."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"Though I owned a copy for years, I never read this until now, and it's vintage Theroux. He boards in Boston and is soon stopping in godforsaken outposts in the wilds of Central America, seemingly having an awful time and taking notes along the way. This formula has served him well for decades, and this was one of the earlier efforts. I wonder what's changed today along the route? Probably not much. It didn't make me want to take the same trip, so thanks Theroux for saving me the trouble."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"In 1979, Paul Theroux departed from his childhood home in Medford, Massachusetts, and began his train journey from the East Coast of the United States to Patagonia, on the southern tip of Argentina. A seasoned traveler, fluent in Spanish, Theroux brings to life his trip through the northern and southern hemispheres, traveling without a schedule and observing his fellow passengers on the train and people at stops along the way.In Texas he is astonished at the contrasts between Laredo on the Texas side of the Rio Grande and Nuevo Laredo across the border in Mexico, commenting on society and governments. Traveling through Mexico and Guatemala, he observes the poverty of the Indians and their lack of opportunities. In El Salvador he attends a soccer game and gets caught up in the melee and riots which follow it. In Costa Rica, the cleanest country he has visited, he finds himself stuck on the train with Mr. Thornberry, a New Hampshire tourist so boring that Theroux cannot wait to escape him--only to have Mr. Thornberry \\"save his life\\" by offering him a place to stay upon his arrival in Limon. In Panama he meets the \\"Zonians,\\" from the Canal Zone, and in Cali, Colombia, he meets a married \\"priest\\" who cannot tell his devout mother in Belfast that he has \\"left\\" the church to marry and have children.Throughout his trip, Theroux reads classics, particularly enjoying Boswell's Life of Dr. Johnson and Edgar Allen Poe'sThe Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, and Related Tales (The World's Classics), both of which provide ironic reference points for his own journey. For literature lovers, the most fascinating section occurs in Buenos Aires, where Theroux spends many days visiting blind writer Jorge Luis Borges, who persuades Theroux to read to him. Ironically, one of Borges's favorite novels is The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym. As Theroux takes notes on his meetings with Borges, he becomes Borges's Boswell.More an observer than a participant, Theroux has an unfortunate air of superiority about what he sees and hears. Sparing little sympathy for American and German tourists, he rarely gets excited about his surroundings, expressing genuine emotion only when he talks with three boys, ages ten to twelve, who live in a doorway and scavenge for food because their rural families have abandoned them. Theroux's self-congratulatory attitude gets a bit wearisome, but the picture of Central and South America, thirty years ago, and the section with Borges are unparalleled. With beautiful, carefully observed prose and a great ear for dialogue, Theroux's Patagonian Express is a landmark travel memoir.

To me his sometimes acerbic observations get towards the truth of a place AS HE PERCEIVES IT. When I read travel books I likt to hear the author's point of view. That may or may not accord with my own or others'. I like also to compare them to other writers' experiences of the same place, whether it somewhere I will travel to by aircraft or mind's eye via the armchair only.How does Theroux strike up conversations with such odd collections of people? Partly because he travels alone, and partly because he is open to hearing the stories of others. Either he hits on the most interesting people in every place, or he endures more mundane conversations than anyone in order to cull the best! He must keep assiduous notes - really WORK at travelling to be able to relate in such detail.I know he gives us glimpses of his working modus operandi -references to the books he is reading, and the note-taking. A few times on the train I wished he had looked up longer i9n order to be able to tell us a little more about what was a bit further away from the track."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"You may find Theroux's openness and directness refreshing, or you may find his brashness, arrogance, condescension, and hypocritical judgementalism revolting. If the latter is true, take heart that this book actually becomes enjoyable once you get past the first hundred pages or so...Maybe others will better appreciate Theroux's attempts at humor, but the first hundred pages of this book could arguably compete for the most off-putting intro ever written. Before even beginning to prove a thing about himself (unless he's relying on an established reputation?), he devotes a few pages to trashing the state of current travel literature as being formulaic and overly focused on the destination vs. the journey. Beginning his story, he immediately picks a couple of confrontations with fellow passengers: correcting an elderly man who likens the New England winter landscape to Siberia (\\"Actually, there isn't this much snow in Siberia\\") and contradicting a 20 year old radical girl (\\"I wouldn't call them radical... they're smug views, self-important ones. Egocentric, you might say.\\").Clearly Theroux is self-aware enough that this impression must be intentional, but it just doesn't work. Theroux is trying too hard to *tell* you to how to regard his work and the people he meets, rather than let you draw the same conclusions by just portraying people and their behaviors. There are so many better travel writers out there today (maybe this wasn't the case in the 70s when this was written) that this is inexcusable. Bryson is far funnier, Dalrymple far more insightful and also pretty funny.Fortunately, Theroux gets more bearable further into the book. He's most insightful when he reflects on the nature of writing and his reasons for traveling alone, avoiding idle chatter that gets in the way of more thoughtful observation (\\"I am diverted, but it is discovery not diversion that I seek.\\") After pages of tolerating idle chatter from a fellow traveler Thornberry, I'm finally able to sympathize with Theroux's cruel fantasy of pushing Thornberry off the train. The stories get more interesting as Theroux's adventurousness and openness lead him into situations where tourists rarely go- a Salvadorean soccer game where the players stop to watch a fight in the stands, the \\"simmering anarchy\\" of a Panamian high school (liken to a \`50s American high school), the chaos of the utterly untouristy Barranquilla, mass altitude sickness on a train through the Andes... Throughout the journey, Theroux colors the narrative with short excerpts from books he is reading including the Adventure of Gordon Arthur Pym and Life of Johnson. By the end of the journey, Theroux seems a little more humble, reflecting on the pointlessness of his journey, but knowing the story needed to be told."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"Note: I made some immature Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books that attempted to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews almost as fast as they are posted.So, your \\"helpful\\" votes are appreciated.

In our current culture of materialism, where everything is hyped up into a commercial product, and sanitised and censored, it is refreshing to read Theroux, who tells it like it is. His descriptions of places can be very poetic and vivid, lasting in your mind, about countries far away, that have much beauty and much ugliness, but above all they are raw and real, in the travel writing of Theroux."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"The book, which I picked up at the airport on a whim, is about Paul Theroux's travel by railway from the US to Patagonia.Paul Theroux is an acquired taste. I have read a number of his books and there can be no doubt, that he is a good, even great writer. I would hate to spend even an hour with him in a train compartment though. Probably I will not have this opportunity because Paul Theroux meets more colorful characters than I do. A not totally original observation, as Bill Bryson also once wondered why it is that only Paul Theroux meets the interesting characters, wether these are criminal railway clerks or supremely boring tourists.Anyway Paul Therous travels down to Patagonia ensconced in his small and private world. He takes, wether by design or by nature, an extremely narrow view of the world outside. With very few exceptions, South America is a dirty and mean place. And its meanness has no grandeur, it is the meanness of everyday poverty. Paul Theroux seems to be constitutionally incapable of enjoying himself. And when the landscape is truly wonderful and the train nice as in Costa Rica, he sits with a boring tourist so that he has something else to complain about.In the end one is left wondering why Mr. Theroux did this trip. Or why he is travelling at all. After all, from the outset it is already clear that this trip will, for Mr. Theroux, be bothersome, boring and dirty."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"This is the third of Paul Theroux's travel books that I have tackled, (after Dark Star Safari and The Great Railway Bazaar) and all three have a similar tone - Theroux, who it appears likes the idea of travel somewhat more than actually travelling in practice, is a prescient yet difficult to please observer. His honestly expressed disdain for fellow travellers and locals alike combined with his refusal to automatically adopt what would be called a conventional or 'politically correct' view today can be refreshing and entertainingly expressed, although after a while the reader may be wishing for Theroux to express his forthright views to someone well-equipped to match wits with him (or, perhaps even better, to give him a thump on the nose), as opposed to his usual practice of expressing his 'forthright' views only to those unlikely to either take offence or lacking the intellectual, linguistic (or perhaps physical) attributes to respond effectively.That said, The Old Patagonian Express is filled with vivid, entertaining vignettes that make entertaining and diverting reading. Theroux's ability to write memorably and powerfully is perhaps best demonstrated in this book by Theroux's description of his encounter with the Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges - Theroux managed to transform a completely unfamiliar literary figure (to me - I had a vague idea that well-read people were familiar with Borges but hadn't got around to his work myself) into a graphic, detailed and unforgettable image in the space of a chapter. I suspect this is an ability well beyond that of the average travel writer.Recommended for the reader who values frank rather than gushing travel writing."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"Having read a few of Theroux's books, this one starts very slow...almost plodding along. It's very hard to read until he makes it through Central America. The characters (people) he meets from the time he leaves Boston until he reaches South America don't seem to add to the story. In fact, the author treats them in a seemingly condescending way. Once he reaches South America, however, the book becomes eminently more readable. I didn't enjoy this one nearly as much as &quot;Riding the Iron Rooster&quot;, but interesting in it's own way."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"Theroux is one of my favorites. &quot;Riding the Iron Rooster&quot; initiated me to his books; the &quot;Patagonia Express&quot; was a good follow-up.

He is at times a little bit naive about the way the world works but this is to be expected by an American. One should never expect a normal world view from an American.

Altough it makes an interesting read, and occasionally he is quite insightful (in his observations about the Argentinians), one is never sure if he is excited about the places and people he meets or if he is just irritated. His opinions on Mexico were a bit unfair, same as in Panama. And his impressions about Peru, a country in decay, despite being relevant to some extent back then, nowadays are not exactly accurate (the country in the 90's experienced something of a revival). Same thing goes for Ecuador and Colombia. And his beloved Argentina? he would not recognize it right now, since it resembles the other south american nations (poverty, corruption, you name it). And by the way the meetings with Jorge Luis Borges confirmed the widespread opinion held in the spanish speaking world: that he was a anglophile snob that can hardly be considered a Latin American writer (but snobbery was a defining factor of the argentinian people); and also a right winger (the general Videla he praises was responsible for the murder of 30,000 people)."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"When I saw this book at the bookstore I imagined it would be very good, a train ride trough the continent!, it is really about complaining on everything, he should have stayed home!, I kept reading because I was expecting it to get better, but it really did not, this was the first and last of his books that I buy, I am sorry but as a traveler I expected much more, I could not imagine a more unfriendly person writting about travels."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"Ok I agree with what most other reviewers have to say a disaster from the start, he should have flown to Patagonia and saved us the anguish of laboring through his journey.

Some readers seem to suggest that this makes him a worse traveler, not being pure-of-heart or sufficiently open-minded. On the other hand, some others suggest he is worth reading as a travel writer precisely because he's not afraid to tell-it-like-it-is. I think it is likely that both of these ideas are wrong.When Paul Theroux writes a travel book, he is not a journalist writing simply to produce a faithful depiction of the places he visits. He is not a social crusader writing in order educate the reader about the lives of the poor or to stimulate the reader to see the richness of life outside of North American. He certainly is not an egotist like Thomas Friedman who writes in order to put himself in a positive light. He is simply an intelligent man who has enough humility to try to write down what he has experienced without drawing too many clumsy conclusions or false symmetries. When he writes that he didn't like a certain person sleeping in his train compartment, he doesn't expect the reader to sympathize with either him or the unpleasant companion. I don't think he means to argue that his dislike has any special significance beyond the fact that it was part of the travel story that he is telling. I like the fact that when Theroux narrates an encounter with someone in his travels he doesn't smooth out the details to make the encounter unambiguously positive or negative. For example, when he describes meeting Jorge Borges, the Argentine writer, he clearly admires Borges' memory and sensitivity and yet he doesn't avoid commenting on Borges' stuttering and his clowning smile. And yet again I don't think Theroux's remarks are meant to be cynical or knowing. When he tells-it-like-it-is he is not trying to steer an intellectual or moral high road and he is not valiantly trying to see past illusions. I believe that when he writes down a conversation or encounter he intends only to include his side as one of the characters in his story.Theroux has the patience to travel by train across a hemisphere and, thankfully for this reader, he has the patience to delay the moment when the mind can no longer calmly observe and rashly commits itself to streamlined answers and silly pet theories about what one sees and what it 'really' means. His books are, to me, humble because in them he shows us moments when he feels superior and they are wise because he doesn't try to step outside of his story to engage in falsely-wise pronouncements.It doesn't matter whether Paul Therous is a 'good' traveler or not. Few travelers have the writing ability to produce any sort of record of their travels anyway, whatever their nature. The reason one ought to read Paul Theroux is be reminded of what the world and oneself can look like through the eyes of an ardent traveler who just happens to love books a bit more than he loves people."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"In 1979, Paul Theroux departed from his childhood home in Medford, Massachusetts, and began his train journey from the East Coast of the United States to Patagonia, on the southern tip of Argentina.

So you should ask me, then why did I give this book 4 stars, because its fun to read. Paul Theroux, a young writer in the seventies, one day decides to leave his wife and kids in their home in London, go back to his parents house in Massachussets and from there take a train to the Patagonia: the farthest south that he could go. Sounds fun for an adventurous man, but all the time, all the places he keeps bitching about everything: The people on the trains, the people in the cities, how he misses his family, what is he doing there, about the food, about the hotels. Well you name it, but in the middle of all this bitching you can almost find yourself in the forest, in the middle of a civil war, in the top of the mountain, meeting Borges, every day completely different from the other.Paul Theroux can be real obnoxious, but he sure can write."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"Paul Theroux, in his introduction to THE OLD PATAGONIAN EXPRESS, states that his wish was to make this \\"the ultimate book about getting there.\\" As in his other train voyage narratives, this book is about the journey rather than the destination however, as usual, we manage to glimpse quite a lot of the country and people he encounters along the way. Theroux, as always, plays the curmudgeon and misanthrope throughout. This, of course, is the main reason I enjoy coming back to Theroux time and time again. Who needs to read another travelogue of fluffy descriptions of tourist destinations and restaurant reviews?Theroux seeks \\"adventure\\" and he finds a fair amount of it in his train travels through the Americas. Although he speaks against the novelistic approach to travel writing, his own character consistently inserts itself into the story which in my opinion reads much like a novel in a positive way. Politically, the book is dated and we must expect that much has changed in Central and South America over the last 20 years. However, THE OLD PATAGONIAN EXPRESS remains a highly entertaining read and I recommend it heartily.Jeremy W. Forstadt"},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"I like all of the Theroux books. He is not flattering, he simply describes what he experiences. When he finds something displeasing, he says so. And that is missing in so many travel books.Theroux doesn't bore with cautions and warnings, he doesn't make pretty was isn't. When it is uncomfortable he says it's uncomfortable. When he finds it ugly or distasteful, he says so.I have traveled many of the places he describes, and reading The Patagonia Express, I could relive many of my own experiences. He is not sugar-coated, neither am I. He doesn't shrink away from hard experiences and misery, neither do I. He travels exactly the way the locals travel, so do I.Being squeezed in between six people on a seat made for three isn't \\"fun\\", but it is reality. And being between these people who haven't bathed in days isn't fun either, but it is reality. It is a good reality and readers should realize that most of the world doesn't live like we do.This - or any of his books - is not for the superficial traveler. It isn't for someone who just wants pretty or enjoys blinders as not to recognize that the majority of humanity lives is true poverty.Theroux is a wonderful writer who knows how to bring the real world very close."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"When I saw the title and read the introduction on the back I thought this was the travelogue I have been waiting for. I also like to travel and enjoy the process of travel much more than collecting souvenirs or boasting material. I find walking through the main street of a strange place and observing the public behavior of the people and sometimes overhearing their conversations much more interesting than visiting museums or other tourist locations about which I can read from any book sitting at home. When I got this book I wanted a third party confirmation of my ways. But this book disappointed me.It is about Theroux's travel from one end to the other end of Americas by train. He hardly feels anything interesting or appealing on the many trains he takes or the people he meets. He takes all in as a necessary evil so that he could write a book. When ever people offer him opportunities to get out of his self absorption he rebuffs them and if this is not enough calls them idiots. While spending a great deal of time in interpreting his enlightened reading material for us he seems content to call poor miserable and hot weather unbearable. If I believed that calling the poor miserable would make them rich I would have enjoyed the content of his descriptions much more.Here comes the best part of the book. His clear, precise prose and his ability to work with short dialogues to give as a prejudiced but clear picture. In this sense this book is a very interesting read and you feel compelled to finish it once you start. If you are one of those people charmed by clear precise prose with a bit of exotism thrown in this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"First book I read by Paul Theroux and was blown away by his refusal to play the all-too-easily-pleased and polite traveller/tourist. Theroux is a thinking traveller not afraid to mix it up with the locals or allow people to make fools of themselves. I just wished he had taken another route home and written another book about that."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"This is an excellent read. Theroux engages everything and everyone with a sort of biting-embrace. He doesn't mince words. He tells the story of the Americas as he experiences it. It's not necessarily pretty and it isn't always complimentary.Theroux's mixes observation with historical background and literary references that add to the text. Theroux's power of description can be breathtaking. &quot;Flocks of white herons blew across the grass tips like flecks of paper in a breeze&quot; It is this type of prose juxtaposed the poor living conditions of the people that adds allure to the story. I think Theroux's writing rests on the edge of what people find comfortable, but the reality is traveling to a third world country is not COMFORTABLE. One must fine riches and beauty amongst the squalor."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"The Old Pantagonian Express is about 20 years old now but I still re-read it every couple of years. From the starting point in Massachussets, Theroux remarks on how his fellow commuters are merely commuting a short distance, whereas he is travelling to the tip of South America! There are many great moments and observations in this book. Travelling through Panama, Theroux finds himself with a repetitive fellow passenger who keeps pointing out the re-appearance of a pipeline that is coming in and out of view. Mundane stuff, but Theroux weaves it into the narrative in a way that only he can. Of course there are there are many interesting journeys through Mexico, Central and South America, but told in a unique way that was unlike any travel book I had ever read before. Theroux's many other travel books are entertaining and stimulating, but none so much as this book."},{"Title":"The Old Patagonian Express","review":"Near the end of a two week trip to a far off land (for me at least), those uncomfortable things that at first seemed new and exciting start to become annoying and old.It seems like Paul Theroux started feeling this way after his first two weeks... actually maybe even before. He manages to leave his personal stamp of disaproval on every Central and South American country in his wake... er... track.The good thing is that his negative attitude is so obvious that you become desensitized to it, and it starts to feel like the grumpy narrative to a beautiful slideshow presentation by your Great Uncle Horrace.Theroux's descriptions of people and places are so vivid, that his journey becomes less of a personal trip, and more of a documentary film of the beautiful landscape and interesting people that he meets. He is but a character in the film that you can choose to ignore.Sidenote: Before I bought this book I had really wanted to go to the Patagonian area of Chile and Argentina. Since that was the only place that Theroux didn't seem to have a problem with, I instead went to Peru (he both hated it and got altitude sickness there, so I figured it must be a great place... and of course it was)."},{"Title":"Crystals R for Kids (Little Angel Books)","review":"I purchased this for my 7 year old, and he loves it!

It is a mouthpiece for the government (which would be fine if it also gave alternative points of view.) It's full of American bashing and yet does not point out the problems the Europeans/Canadians are now creating for the island in terms of prostitution and worshipping material goods.The book is focused more on Tourists rather than independent travel...great if you want to know about swimming pools and colour TV's in Hotels. Yet, it provides virtually nothing with regard to casa particulars (staying with Cuban families for cheap) and paladares (eating in Cuban homes). Both of which can save travellers lots of money and give them the experience of talking to real Cubans first hand. The book emphasises eating and staying in places in which the Cuban government can charge monopoly prices.I found the Cuba Handbook to be much more comprehensive."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Cuba (1997 ed.)","review":"The book is very unorganized and often contains contradicting information. I found it heavily geared to Canadians and much to political for a travel book. It read and sounded like official communist propaganda...badmouthing Cuban exliles in the USA and repeating Cuban economic and social facts of dubious truth. Often, timetables and other basics were given but they were generaly not authentic. They seem to be Official info but with little regard for the obvious or reality on the ground. It read like a political satire laced with travel info. It was as if somebody was trying to convince me to sway my opinions and not to evaluate the Island and its people on my own, It is almost patronizing in scope. I will recomend the Moon Handbook to anyone that goes. I was able to to see a copy of the Moon book three times in cuba and found it a saving grace. it was practical and real. Buy The MOON handbook and learn of the real cuba . I found that The Lonley Planet book is not very usefull in cuba."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Cuba (1997 ed.)","review":"I found this book to be very useful on my trip to cuba.

This book, however, seems to be far more geared to the Canadian package tourist than the independent traveler. The author notes what shape the recomended hotels' pools are, noting that better hotels have non-rectangular pools. &quot;Mayabe Beer&quot; is listed as one of Cuba's top 10 attractions.Moon's Cuba book by Chris Baker looks really great, and will be the book I take with me. Incidentally, I found it much better laid out and easier to read than the LP series. It has everything that you would usually find in a Lonely Planet book."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Cuba (1997 ed.)","review":"With a wealth of information and an easy-to-use format, Lonely Planet's guide to Cuba is probably the best on the market. Beginning with a comprehensive overview of the country, Lonely Planet gives information on the history, culture, religion and politics of the country in concise, yet detailed, synopses. The comprehensive Practical Information section is an in-depth guide to planning your trip, whether you prefer a package tour or to go it alone. You'll find information on Snowbird-style beach-only, all-inclusive packages, as well as information on city stays for the more urban among us. In contrast to many guides, Lonely Planet covers tour operators from a variety of countries, such as Canada, Mexico, and the Bahamas so that individuals may match their taste to a specific package. If you want to go it alone, Lonely Planet provides excellent information and contacts for airlines, hotels, restaurants, how to get your own visa, and the like. This is a rarity among modern Cuba guides. There are sections dealing with gay and lesbian travellers, the disabled, and students which provide contacts for things such as work/study programs, and other not-so-typical types of tourism. The island is covered in considerable detail, which is a real boon to those wanting to explore more than one location. Further, the would-be tourist is guided through the difficulties of local transportation and dining when you're not part of a tour group. For those wanting to visit the island without a clear idea of what to do once there, Lonely Planet really shines. It provides a Top Ten Best &amp; Worst places to visit, and a great overview of the island so that you'll be able to find/explore exactly what you want. On the downside, although the book is new, the text style is vintage Lonely Planet. It may overwhelm those who just want a week at the beach, and may frighten those not accustomed to international travel with its comprehensive detail of the ins and outs of coming and going to and within Cuba. The book caters to the more adventurous, but is still an invaluable tool for the more cautious, who, at least, will enjoy beachchair travel throughout this fascinating island."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Cuba (1997 ed.)","review":"Americans are clearly too sensitive.

Remembering that stubborn is the same as headstrong and recalcitrant just gave you 2 new words for the price of one. Linking words together by groups is a very effective way of learning- Exercises are provided at the end of each chapter, WITH FULL EXPLANATIONS, not just the answers. You'll never have to look up the answer to a question b/c there's the explanation.- The vocabulary-in-context stories are not too interesting, but very helpful for learning vocabulary. If you encounter a new word in your reading, and it is defined, when you see the word again, you'll recall you reading, helping you remember the definition- Several practice tests with full explanations are given- Has a section devoted to roots, suffixes, prefixes- Interesting little blurbs of vocabulary appear everything; one particular section was about words that sound dirty...- Example sentences are very helpful. They really allow you to grasp the meaning of a word and when to use it.- Keeps you laughing with her \\"funny\\" jokes.- VERY USER FRIENDLY!Cons- I wish there were more words!

Recently I bought a new edition and I have just finished self studying this book and I felt that it's quite excellent. The problems are challenging but that is precisely what I expected. I think it really deserves 4 stars but I gave it 5 because the average ratings given by other reviewers is too low. I would like to go through the positives and negatives of this text. However keep in mind that the negatives of this text are apparent pretty much in every physics text.Positives: 1) The text is easy to understand, the problems follow from the text 2) Answers to even numbers excercises in the back of text. This is absolutely crucial if you are self studying without an instructor. 3) Problems are random in their difficulty and individually comprehensive in their review of the chapter.4) The Mathematics is pretty elementary, with a solid understanding of Calculus and differential equations you should be properly equipped to handle the entire text.Negatives: 1) There are little to no difficult problems involving Newtonian formalism (Forces). Energy and momentum is predominantly used, for good reason, but it does not hurt to go back to the more rigorous approach of Forces for some difficult problems.2) It would be nice to have a chapter dedicated to cyclic coordinates, Poisson Brackets and Canonical Transformations.3)Impulses(chap 9) are dealt with in Integral form as opposed to differential form of the time change in momenta. The latter is much more intuitive and useful for solving problems.4)Wider use in problems and examples of Poisson's equation for gravity.5) Relativity should be introduced much earlier in the text. This is one of the formalisms of every undergraduate textbook in physics which I do not understand. Relativity always gets pushed back towards the end of textbooks. There is nothing particularly difficult about the subject that demands that it get treated in such a fashion. As opposed to the three chapters prior (dynamics of rigid bodies, coupled oscillations and waves) which are much more demanding. Furthermore it would be useful for students taking E&M; at the same time as Mechanics to have had some experience with 4 vectors before dealing with Maxwell's equations."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"Whether knowingly or unknowingly, most of the physics text reviews that I have read may be divided into two categories:- those who loved or hated the book because it was not written to teach physics through a conceptual framework.- those who loved or hated the book because it was not written to teach physics through the development of skills.Then the reviews may be divided again into two categories:- those who loved or hated the book because it conveyed an exclusively classic and/or historical treatment of physics.- those who loved or hated the book because it conveyed a modern treatments of physics.Therefore, I will write my review within the same framework that everyone else seems to...I loved this book because it was written to teach physics through the development of SKILLS; I loved this book because it did so through a CLASSIC TREATMENT of physics.Now I will explain why...The study of physics is FAR MORE than an extraction of information from a book, the way that, say, reading an encyclopedia entry is. The study of physics, rather, is a MENTAL DISCIPLINE, that takes 10,000 hours of intensive mental effort just to become a 'fairly skilled beginner', and at least half a lifetime of intensive mental effort to become an expert in just one, very small, sub-sub-field. It is a journey in which one must tavel the same mental footsteps that the great physicists of the past did before one is ready to travel the new and original mental footsteps of their own research activity. Along the way, one must start with easy treatments, must progress through the intermediate treatments, and must one day tackle the tremendously difficult advanced treatments, of every sub-field of study. Early in the study of a new stage of such a sub-field, one must obtain a solid understanding of every concept, and after this, they must move on from mere concepts, and must develop an exceptional skill set. And one day, if one has been utterly dedicated and unwavering, and if one has worked harder than they ever thought would be necessary when they stood at the beginning of the road... one WILL find that they have reached a higher realm.I am utterly convinced that this book is the ideal written work that one should study at the time and place in the journey that it is usually encountered on this road."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"This is a very solid introduction to classical mechanics. Starting from a simple review of Newtonian Mechanics, it covers many of the more advanced topics which would become useful in future studies: Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, rigid body problems, center of mass formulations, vibrations and waves, central force problems including planetary motions, and a little introduction to special relativity. The general coverage is solid, and the book is easy to follow. In particular, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian sections are probably the easist to read amongst alternatives. However, it does suffer from a few things: (a) pages of detailed calculations which are usually not particularly elegant, or illuminating, I have seen some of the problems get much more elegant mathematical treatment elsewhere, (b) some of the links with other branches of physics could be a little more illuminating, such as the Hamiltonian section could mention some applications in optics which will enhance understanding. Overall, a good book to learn classical mechanics from."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"I really like this book a lot. I never went to class for both quarters of my upper-division undergraduate mechanics class, and instead read Thornton and Marion religiously. I've heard friends express their dislike for it, but I think it is very clear and provides excellent perspective and insight. It is very mathematically rigorous, which I appreciate but others may not. The proofs given are typically very readable, although I often skipped over the sort of \\"obvious\\" things that the book shows in exquisite detail. Lots of great sections and topics, much interesting material covered, in addition to the basics. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"I came to this course after taking honors freshman physics at Yale with An Intro to Mechanics by Kleppner and Kolenkow. And, unfortunately, this book just is not as good. The mathematical derivations are often tedious and uninsightful, a good description as well for many of the problems. In addition, many of the problems, particularly the tougher ones, are already worked out in the text. For me, the text is a combination of mediocre treatment of material with exceptionally poor problems. The problems in this text are, in general, easier than those in K&K, but they often take three times as long to write out. Many of them are exercises in 10th grade algebra, or 12th grade calculus (read: horrible integrals and looong expressions to simplify). What is required is not insight, but exceptional care at not making simple errors and patience for long derivations of often obvious results. For a physics major, this book just seems like a colossal waste of time and money. If you want reinforcement of concepts, turn to Feynman in his lectures. For insightful and challenging mechanics (though Hamiltonian and Lagrangian dynamics are missing), Kleppner and Kolenkow is a far better text."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"People who read this book carefully will find that many of the examples in the book contain flawed reasoning. The sloppy logic often leads one to understand certain concepts in a wrong way. The book does have lots of long-winded mathematical derivations, but they don't really add to the reader's physical insight. (eg. in chapter 11, some simple linear algebra that can be done in three lines are instead derived in pages of summations and index swap)This book is a disgrace to the teaching of physics. Its tedious, sometimes illegitimate algebra spoils the elegance of classical mechanics. Compare it with Landau, and you will see the point."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"I use this text in my spring sophomore-level mechanics class. There are no perfect texts for this level, but this is the best one out there. The book does assume that you either have a solid base of mathematics or are willing to learn during the course. That's typical in a physics class; you learn mathematics while learning physics, and so its a good introduction to the style of more advanced physics classes. While the chapter on nonlinearity doesn't fit well with the other chapters, and I wish Lagrangian's were moved later in the text, its still a better choice then most other texts for most students. Less mathematically prepared students could use Taylor's text, for example, and more mathematically prepared students should use Goldstein and landau, but this book aims at the middle of lower division physics majors."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"I can't imagine a better text to introduce senior level classical mechanics. It's similar to Fowles and Cassidy but more advanced. It covers all the topics you need and goes through all the classic problems.

And the texts are not impressive, at least compare to Griffith's books. Then I decided to abandon the book and embrace the lecture notes by my professor.We started with Ch 6 calculus of variation, then Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, these are something new, but pretty easy to follow. Then Chp 12, coupled oscillation and normal modes, again, pretty simple, because for me they are no different from solving systems of linear ODE(I learnt ODE myself and took a course formally). However, the content became challenging immediately when we touched rigid body, I was much confused by the fixed and the body coordinate appearing simultaneously.(previously we dealt with rotational frame, but we that's way simpler) My professor used an intuitive and inductive approach,i.e. he calculated every component of the angualar momentum or rearrange terms in rotational energy EXPLICITLY, to invoke the idea of inertia tensor and principal axes. That was crystally clear, but you are simply lost in a bunch of terms. Though finally, he came to the matrix representation(which is actually tensor). But to me, there was obviously a chain missing. I would feel it strange if I could not derive every formula myself from the very basic starting point!(I also did these for EM and finally ended up reciting many of the vector identities).But if the drivation is not simple enough, I would not be able to master it at all!Then I turned to M&T;'s book. I was so delighted to find that their derivation for the inertia tensor is much more compact using index notation. I could grasp, memorize and finally internalize the whole logic by easily following these shorter form of derivation. The missing chain was fixed and I began to appreciate the value of the book.Looking back, the book does have the problems with its end-chapter questions, which are not intuitive, and do not contain much \\"physics\\". These can be a great hurdle for those who learn the basic concept by working on problems.But the mathematical rigorosity in the book is without doubt its greatest advantage which render the book link well with more advanced graduate textbook such as Classical Mechanics by Goldstein. University students should not expect to master something new immediately. Reading the text several times with some intervals in between helps with understanding.To summarize my review, I would suggest that the author add a little humour in the writing, which is otherwise boring for many. More interesting problems should be come up with and more physical insights are expected."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"This book really isn't as bad as everyone thinks it is. Personally, I would cover the chapters in a different order than the book, treating the Lagrangian formation first. Maybe that's what you're supposed to do anyways, since the first couple of chapters are intended to be review.

The best part of the book is the well assorted bunch of problems."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"This semester is my first in grad school and we're starting into Goldstein and I'm using Marion for review and backfill. The really negative opinions on this page are over done. AND so are the really positive reviews.Overall the book is just great for an undergrad who won't be going on to the PhD or masters. But once you're in one of these programs you may find yourself reaching for it to make sure you've got your basics covered.Hopefully Thornton will upgrade the book and not dumb it down as time goes on. A layered approach usually works."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"Pros: Great reference text. The examples are clear and there are generally a lot of them. The notation is generally very readable.Cons: The price. As with almost any physics text, this one is most easily understood if you can compare it to another book of the same level (might I recommend Taylor?) However, the price of this book makes that impractical at best.This book is a good text. It is one of the first books that physics students encounter after their introductory courses which makes for a very challenging semester. I think that may be why it has recieved so many poor reviews. . ."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"Usually a physics book will have some redeeming qualities. Not this one. The examples are often convoluted and the topic discussions are anything but clear. Even if you're an A student, this book will leave you scratching your head. Some parts just skip over necessary detail when building to a conclusion. Other parts give the detail but in such a way that you have to read it over and over. The first law of of texts should match the Hippocratic oath - do no harm. This book does just that.If you have some spare money, get a used copy of Taylor's mechanics book. It is by far one of the best written. It may save your semester. And just hope to heck that a bad book was forced upon your good teacher. Bad book + bad teacher = very bad physics learning. If you just need to muddle through for a passing grade, you may be ok. If this is your major or if you need to learn mechanics thoroughly, be careful. Bottom line, this book won't help and may even hurt your efforts."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"This book is one of the reasons why I am now a math phd student, rather than a physics phd student. Unfortunately, physics departments stick to the same awful books, when they really ought to know better. It doesn't matter how much math you know--I was a senior math major. You can follow everything that is written in this book and still not learn much because the book hardly contains any real knowledge. Very little physical insight will be found here, unless you think about it for yourself and come up with your own explanations. The idea of actually understanding anything seems to be completely missing. The problems are often tedious, involving excessive computations (not that some of that isn't appropriate), with a few exceptions. Not a good textbook or reference. If you don't at least question this book, you will miss out, big time--I promise.If you have the misfortune of having this as a text, please, at least try reading something else. Feynman's lectures cover some of the material at an elementary level. V. I. Arnold's Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics might be worth taking a look at, although it requires some mathematical sophistication for a full appreciation."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"As a third year undergraduate student in EE who has done fairly well with his studies (GPA > 3.0) and almost all of the introductory physics and math courses, this book was like a slap in the face. The treatment of physics in this book seems like such a jump from the introductory physics courses I was used to. Luckily I had some background in index notation so it wasn't a total loss. What I really would have liked was a book that bridged the gap between the \\"usual\\" brand of physics and undergraduate sees and theoretical physics.The problems were so complex and the solutions so long-winded that I hadn't the slightest clue how they were derived whatsoever. They seemed in no way related to the material taught in the book. Most of the solutions depend on \\"tricks\\" and substitutions that come out of nowhere.I've said this about other texts I hated and eventually came to deal with: This is a textbook for someone who already knows the subject. If you're trying to learn mechanics, look elsewhere or be ready for a wave of frustration."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"There is only one reason : Stephen Thornton has spoiled Marion's original masterpiece. If you can get the 2nd edition, which Thornton didn't join yet, just compare it with current one. Except this, I dare to say this book is the best intermediate classical mechanics text book. This was the bible of classical mechanics, but not any more."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"This book would probably be good if you already knew the material...the authors' explanations are often extremely poor. They skip many steps in derivations using phrases like the dreaded \\"it can be seen that\\" when the logical steps involved are not at all obvious, and often try to introduce subjects using excessively formal mathematical notation that bogs down the physical insight. Sometimes their examples are decent, but this is the exception rather than the rule. If you have a bad teacher for your upper level classical mechanics course and are forced to rely on your textbook for self study and this is the one you're stuck with, you will be in trouble."},{"Title":"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems","review":"I used this book as a physics undergrad in the mid '90s. Like so many others on this site, my copy of M&T; split in half before the semester was even half over. I'd sure love my $80 back plus interest...I thought some of the later chapters were quite good -- particularly the one on Lagrangian dynamics -- but the first few chapters didn't strike me as particularly well written. More than a decade later, I can still recall a problem in Chapter 2 that wasn't even remotely covered anywhere in the chapter itself. It somehow managed to survive to the 4th edition, and I'd be willing to bet it's in the 5th as well.There were lots of things I liked about Marion and Thornton, but generally speaking, if students are expected to plunk down this kind of money for texts on fairly venerable topics, the content should be QA-tested, and the book itself should be reasonably well-constructed."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself XML in 21 Days","review":"This book provides a somewhat technical introduction to several aspects of XML. Its 21 chapters are designed to be covered in 21 days over 3 weeks. The basics of XML are covered in the first week, followed by more advanced XML topics such as XML linking, and viewing and processing XML in the second week, and finally by programming and using style sheets with XML and real world XML applications in the third week. The book contains many examples, and a blurb on the back cover states that the code for the examples are available online at the publisher's Website. (There is no accompanying CD. A CD would really have been handy, since it could have contained all of the freeware validators and editors featured in the text, as well as the examples.)Having just been assigned to teach a course in XML, I hoped that this book would not only contain a clear set of lessons for mastering the language as I have found in other SAMS Teach Yourself books, but also provide strong justification for adopting XML. I found the lessons to be less than clear. At times they seemed to be little more than simple documentation for various XML rules of syntax. Statements such as &lt;element.type.name attribute.name=\\"attribute.value\\"&gt; leave me scratching my head and wondering \\"How do I use this?\\" Quite a few chapters in the second week and beyond are little more than introductory documentation for various bits of freeware editors or validators for XML. On the back cover, the publisher suggests that the book is written for beginning and intermediate levels. It may indeed be appropriate for beginners in XML, as long as the XML beginners happen to be already quite adept at HTML and fairly confident with JavaScript as well. It's definitely not a good starting place for Web newbies.As for reasons to adopt XML, I found the following preface to chapter 21 very telling \\"Although I have tried to relate everything you have learned about XML in this book to something practical, and preferably something visible, that hasn't always been easy...In today's lesson I'm going to stick to that policy and although I will review some of the more esoteric applications, I will try to concentrate on XML applications that already work.\\" In many areas in the book, the authors drag us through arcane details of XML syntax, only to point out that these features aren't actually usable yet because the required application software hasn't been completed yet, and that the specific syntax may change once the feature is finally implemented. It's all a bit too much too soon. This book may be of interest someday to historians of the Net, who want to learn about directions that XML might have taken as of 1999, but it's a bit frustrating as a guide to the future (if XML really does turn out to be the Web language of the future)."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself XML in 21 Days","review":"As the other reviews say this book is a 100% waste of money! For me it seems like the authors were just writing / speaking to here themselves speak.

I ended up putting this book down after about the fourth chapter, and went to Microsoft's Developer Website, which could use some improvement, but surely conveys XML in a better manner than this book.

Your countless hours infront of this book had gone to waste. It doesn't teach, it lectures. And it's structure is something to laugh about. Instead of teaching you how to make the simplest XML page and then show it with your IE5, it waits untill the 11th day to do that. Makes no sense at all. Stay away from this book...

Way to long, it goes on and on and although the husband and wife team of K.B. Gilden are very good writers, I question how in the world the editors allowed this rambling opus to go to print without cutting out about 500 pages. To compare it to Gone With the Wind is like comparing Valley of the Dolls to To Kill A Mockingbird. Yes, it takes place in the South, but I saw no other comparison. The characters are strange and unlikeable. There are times the dialog is very odd and ambiguous. I want to like this book. Maybe someday something will click, but for now, I can see why it never became a classic despite all of it's ballyhoo upon it's publication."},{"Title":"Hurry Sundown","review":"I too had always wanted to read K.B. Gilden's two volume book, \\"Hurry Sundown\\" (they are the husband and wife team (Bert and Katya)), but was put off by its unusual length, but taking Volume One with me on a 8-hr. bus trip to Pittsburgh, one that I knew I would need something to read as we traveled all night (I can not sleep for inordinate fear of missing my stop), I found myself enthralled by the vivid descriptions and compelling story. I think if you like to read and set aside the time and give it chance, you will have a wonderful time with this book. I quickly finsihed Volume Two upon my return from my trip. I had seen the movie version several times and to read the original novel was a heightened desire after really liking the film (even more today as critics are coming to see Otto Preminger's later films in a different light than upon their release). But I marveled at what had been cut and then, as I often do not do, found the changes for the screenplay justified, but in no way was I about to be disgruntled by the length of the book. I was just glad I could absorb more of the events and background of these characters. No, I do not compare \\"Hurry Sundown\\" with \\"Gone With the Wind.\\" I give \\"Hurry Sundown\\" credit on its own merits which are many. It is one of my accomplishments that I will never regret."},{"Title":"Hurry Sundown","review":"Hurry Sundown was a great read, if you like to read.

This book was one of a series of regional history books (61) based on the areas around American and Canadian rivers written from the 1940's through the 1960's. Like the other books, this one is in and out of print as it is periodically re-published. Some of the books in the series like \\"The Everglades\\" have become classics with multiple editions. Others are becoming hard to find. All of them are well-written by knowledgeable writers with local knowledge.This book was so engaging that I read it in a fairly short time. These are not the current historical books that disparage and insult everyone and everything based on the current political environment in the graduate history department. There are no 'all white Europeans are evil' sentiments; nor are there 'only white Europeans are superior' sentiments.I enjoy history books from this era because they are so apolitical and fair. And this book does a great job of expressing local sentiment and reactions without justifying slavery and other practices.The author concentrates more on Georgia than South Carolina because Savannah (the city) and Augusta are the largest cities on the river and the South Carolina cities are smaller. His narrative is particularly strong during the founding period by Oglethorpe (1733), the Revolutionary War period, the Jacksonian era, the Civil War era, Reconstruction, the Depression and War eras. This book does not concentrate at all on the city of Savannah. It includes history all along the river. During a recent trip to Savannah, however, I found myself explaining statues and other historical items to the guides because of reading this fine book.I was fascinated by the Civil War era in particular and found many incidents that I knew nothing of prior to reading this. It was so good that I wish the author had written a Civil War history.All in all, an historical work of note for its history and narrative power. 4 stars."},{"Title":"Ultimate Guide to Student Contests Grades 7-12","review":"Children love recognition for a job well done.

To me it is one of Shakespeare's funniest. I truly enjoyed it. One of my favourite Shakespearean characters is Falstaff, and he appears in a number of Shakespeare's comedies. He makes an appearance in this one, and he is wonderful. The scene of this play is in Windsor, England. The play follows the merry wives in their interactions with their husbands and with their families and servants. This play is unique too, because we see Falstaff in love in this one. This may be one of Shakespeare's lesser known comedies, but it should be read and enjoyed. Don't let some of these reviews stop you from the sheer enjoyment of this play."},{"Title":"The merry wives of Windsor; (The old-spelling Shakespeare)","review":"Book Report The Merry Wives of Windsor The Merry Wives of Windsor is loved by many people in the world because of the plentiful expressions, skillful characters' description and the natural laughable. It is not only a common comedy, but also a signpost from that we can see many things of the Elizabethan age when the author-William Shakespeare- lived. And this is one of the few works that he composed by himself, in other words, there are no any source to create it. The reason of coming into existence about this is unique and interesting. When Queen Elizabeth watched one of his historical plays (Henry the fourth), she was very pleased with John Falstaff in the play, then she ordered Shakespeare that he would make John be a hero and have him love in another play. It is said that the beginning of the story. There are lots of characters in the play as the other Shakespeare's works. The whole content is, Sir John Falstaff falls in love with Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, but the two mistresses make plan of ill-treating to him to refuse his love and to show their faithful and virtuous hearts to their husbands. Meanwhile, Fenton(a young gentleman), Slender(a country justice's kinsman) and Doctor Caius(a French physician) are all in love with Anne(daughter of Page and Mistress Page), and they think for wining her love respectively. At the end of the story, after Mr. and Mrs. Ford, Mr. and Mrs. Page and others make plans and ill-treat to Falstaff in the woods, all of them get reconciled with, while Anne Page get married with Fenton, and come to an end with joy. Besides them, some people who have strong personalities appear on the stage. For example, Mistress Quickly(Caius' servant) has a ready wit but a little stupid, or Sir Hugh Evans(a Welsh parson) who always speaks in rural accent but it makes us fanny and he plays an active part at the end of this play. We could see Shakespeare's genius in this play for there has many puns and unique accent which used by Hugh Evans. And it bring more cheerful mood to the play and laugh to the audience. Shakespeare described many men who is jealous of their wives or lovers in his works, and one of them is Mr. Ford who appears in this play. He has faith in his wife's affair and it brings some troubles. When this work was written, a woman generally could not get married to a man if he was not permitted by her father. However the times went by, many Pulitans came to insist that men and women could get married only when they loved each other. Fenton has also the pulitanical view for marriage. It was a new thought and I think Anne Page was attracted to his such way of thinking as well as his other good points. Also at that time in England, there was a tendency for every people to criticize about things which were against the social morals through passages of caricatures. For example, it was a fashion of the time for women to wear trousers but people criticized it, or they criticized for jealousy and affairs. In this play, John Falstaff is ill-treated by everyone and has a terrible experiences, and that's because he is immoral and unfair. Like these, this comedy has several points, and we can see the cultural features of the Shakespeare's period. Although I have ever read his works, I thought this one was very interesting and I came to like it the best. The character's personalities are made full use and I could see the author's abilities from that, too. The mistresses play active parts and they are very cheerful, livery and merry just as the title is. I think it made the audience(especially women) enjoy to watch, and the merriness of this play has been one of the most big reasons to attract people even nowadays."},{"Title":"The merry wives of Windsor; (The old-spelling Shakespeare)","review":"Legend has it that the Queen herself commissioned the writing of this play, saying she wished to see a comedy in which Falstaff, her favorite character from the histories, falls in love. Shakespeare, naturally, did a masterful job, crafting not only a comedy with plenty of belly laughs in it (literally), but also a play about women in power for the ultimate woman in power.I saw this play performed recently and it brought home to me how much it really is about the character of Mrs. Hood. She is written to be a sexually powerful, or powerfully sexual, character. Powerful enough to justify her husband's jealousy despite her trustworthiness -- for if we are to receive him as one of the \\"good guys\\", we must be able to sympathize with him. Powerful enough to justify Falstaff's return again and again. He is a fool, but a lovable fool, so again we need to be able to sympathize.This is not Britney Spears sexuality. This is Mae West/Marilyn Monroe sexuality. The kind where she could be doing the most vulgar thing -- eating a cheeseburger, for instance -- and the men around her are still aroused. And she is in full control of it, even as it causes chaos in the men around her. If an actress can bring this to the role, this play sings, it swings, it sparkles and flies. If this is missing, if she is simply a normal woman, the counterpart of Mrs. Whatever, the jokes are strained, the pacing slow and the whole thing feels a bit washed up."},{"Title":"The merry wives of Windsor; (The old-spelling Shakespeare)","review":"When rating Shakespeare, I am rating it against other Shakespeare; otherwise, the consistent 4-5 stars wouldn't tell you much. So if you want to know how this book rates against the general selection of books in the world, I suppose it might rate four stars; it certainly rates three. The language, as usual in Shakespeare, is beautiful. Still, it's far from Shakespeare's best.For one thing, this is one of those cases, not uncommon in Shakespeare's comedies, in which the play has suffered a great deal by the changes in the language since Shakespeare's time; it loses a great deal of the humor inherent in a play when the reader needs to keep checking the footnotes to see what's happening, and this play, particularly the first half of it, virtually can't be read without constant reference to the notes; even with them, there's frequently a question as to what's being said. At least in the edition that I read (the Dover Thrift edition) the notes frequently admit that there's some question as to the meaning of the lines, and there is mention of different changes in them in different folios.But beyond this, as an overweight, balding, middle-aged libertine, I object to the concept that Falstaff is ridiculous just because he is in fact unwilling to concede that it is impossible that a woman could want him. Granted, he's NOT particularly attractive, but that has more to do with his greed, his callousness, and his perfect willingness to use people for his own ends, to say nothing of his utter lack of subtlety.Is it truly so funny that an older, overweight man might attempt to find a dalliance? So funny that the very fact that he does so leaves him open to being played for the fool? Remember, it isn't as though he refused to take &quot;no&quot; for an answer; he never GOT a &quot;no&quot;. He was consistently led on, only to be tormented for his audacity. Nor is he making passes at a nubile young girl; the target of his amorous approaches is clearly herself middle-aged; after all, she is the MOTHER of a nubile young marriageable girl. And given the fact that she is married to an obnoxious, possessive, bullying and suspicious husband, it is not at all unreasonable for Falstaff to think that she might be unhappy enough in her marriage to accept a dalliance with someone else.If laughing at fat old men who have the audacity not to spend the last twenty years of their lives with sufficient dignity to make it seem as if they were dead already is your idea of a good time, you should love this play. I'll pass."},{"Title":"The merry wives of Windsor; (The old-spelling Shakespeare)","review":"The Merry Wives of Windsor is loved by many people in the world because of the plentiful expressions, skillful characters' description and the natural laughable.

Unequivocally, The Merry Wives of Windsor makes for a more enjoyable play if seen live. Nonetheless, reading it is the 2nd best thing.Sir John Falstaff is once again such a fool - but a lovable and hilarious one at that. Having read Henry V - where Falstaff ostensibly had met his end - I was pleased to see him so alive(pardon the pun) in this short, albeit clever play. It is no surprise that The Merry Wives of Windsor enjoyed such a long and successful stage run during Shakespeare's day and continues to be one of his most popularly staged plays. Recommended as a fun break from the more serious and murderous Shakespearean tragedies.\\"Why, then the world's mine oyster,Which I with sword will open.\\" - Pistol"},{"Title":"The merry wives of Windsor; (The old-spelling Shakespeare)","review":"This play is odd in that critics hate it, but theater companies love it. Harold Bloom's contempt for this play is so great that he refused to discuss it in his book on Shakespeare. But, unlike some of Shakespeare's less popular plays, Merry Wives is performed frequently in Shakespeare festivals across the land.You really have to see this play to understand how well it works on the stage. Played by an energetic cast it is hilarious situation comedy and easily understandable by people unfamiliar with Shakespeare. When Falstaff says at the end, with deadpan delivery, \\"I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass,\\" it brings down the house. Just reading the play in your living room, you will probably miss much of the humor.Shakespeare was a man of the theater. He wrote for production, with little thought given to publication in his lifetime.

Maybe as far as the comedies go, I was spoiled by the exquisite comical masterpiece &quot;The Comedy of Errors.&quot; But this is without a doubt my 2nd favorite comedy. I can not help but simultaneously laugh and feel sorry for poor Ford when he suspects his wife is interested in Falstaff and goes into his jealous rages. One scene I could not forget if I tried is when Ford feels bad for suspecting his wife, is humiliated in front of everyone, and apologizes.Only a bit later he finds his wife was with Falstaff and she has another arranged meeting with him! But this is only a small part of the many laughs that await.

This play doesn't have the great quotes or great drama or great romance or any great meaning, but it is just simply hilarious. Sir John Falstaff is one of the greatest comedic characters in all of literature and does not disappoint in this play.'The Merchant of Venice' is great if you are looking for a 'Comedy' with meaning and social significance, but if you simply want to laugh your butt off you have to read 'The Merry Wives of Windsor'."},{"Title":"The merry wives of Windsor; (The old-spelling Shakespeare)","review":"Among critics, this is arguably their least favorite of Shakespeare's plays but with audiences it is a perennial favorite. Also, Giuseppe Verdi chose it as the basis of his very last opera, Falstaff. So there must be something in it.Sir John Falstaff, the lovable rogue from The Henriad cycle of plays, needs money and he intends to get it from a rich wife. Just to be sure he gets something, he attempts to woo two women rather than just one. Never mind that both women are already married; this is not a problem for the shameless Sir John. He sends love letters to both women but puts them in the wrong envelopes, so that each gets the one meant for the other. OK, these middle aged women might be a little starved for affection from their husbands but they aren't stupid and they would have seen through Falstaff's ruse anyway.His mistake however does give them the chance to have a little fun at his expense. Falstaff appears at one woman's home to press his suit. Her husband arrives unexpectedly, and Falstaff hides in a basket that is then carried out. It's a bit heavy...Falstaff and his ridiculous plan provides the comic situation, the confusion that ensues provides the slapstick, foreigners with Welsh and French accents provide ethnic humor. And in the end, Falstaff receives a well deserved lesson.There is nothing wrong with this play, it's a very good, very funny comedy and as close to pure comedy as Shakespeare gets with the exception of The Comedy Of Errors. So why don't critics like it? Probably because they expect more from Falstaff. He fears getting caught by the husband but that does not keep him from courting his wife. He offers no catechism in this play about the evils of adultery or of the dark side of love, unlike in Henry IV Part One where he cautions the audience against how honor in war leads to injury or death. The fat man in this play offers us a barrel of laughs but no wisdom at all.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The merry wives of Windsor; (The old-spelling Shakespeare)","review":"\\"Merry Wives\\" is generally loathed by scholars, and loved by audiences. The reason is not hard to detect. It is a non-serious and very funny play. Shakespeare wrote low comedy farce. GASP!First off, the 3 star rating means as compared to other works of Shakespeare. I don't feel it fair to compare him to other writers. For the other writer's sake!\\"Merry Wives\\" is a fast paced romp that would be much better to see than to read. The first act of this play frustrated me as reading no Shakespeare has done before. The play is his only comedy set in (Shakespeare's) modern day, and in England. As a result it abounds with archaic English colloquialisms and regionalisms that mean nothing to the modern American reader. You will have to look at the explanatory notes often while reading this play. The reader's frustration will be added to by the inclusion of a French character, complete with accent, a Welsh parson, also with accent, and a servant lady who speaks with malapropos and misunderstandings most of the time.If you can get over that hurdle, you will find the play picks up steam and humor in the last three acts, and there are some truly comic, and often vulgar, moments. The groundlings must have howled with delight at this play.Many critics hate this play because they say the Falstaff of \\"Merry Wives' is a shadow of the character Shakespeare created for the Henry Four plays. He is. But I guess my question is, so what? Shakespeare created Falstaff and he can use him however he sees fit. To me it seems a minor quibble, and I am not sure I understand the passion it engenders in some people.Take \\"The Merry Wives of Windsor\\" for what it is, a lighthearted farce, meant as a diversion for its viewers, and leave all the academic baggage at home. You will be glad you did.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period. Well priced and well worth it."},{"Title":"The merry wives of Windsor; (The old-spelling Shakespeare)","review":"a horribly produced paperback- low quality coarse paper, difficult to open, note presentation muddled.

(Also back are Bardolph, Pistol, and Nym.) Some scholars such as Asimov feel that this Falstaff: \\"...bears no resemblance to the Falstaff of the \\"Henry IV\\" plays.\\" Well, Asimov was right, but Shakespeare was trying to do something very difficult. (Recreating an artistic moment. It may not be impossible, but it is not far from it either.)Well, onto the play. Shakespeare cleverly combines 2 plots. Anne Page is a young girl whose parents want her to marry someone other than Fenton (whom she loves). But Shakespeare adds a new twist. Her parents are not in agreement here. Her father wants her to marry the nice enough slender, while her mother wants her to marry the eccentric Dt. Caius. (So the Romeo, Juliet, Paris triangle isn't exactly repeated.)Moving on, Falstaff enters, and he intends to woo Anne's mother and Page's wife not out of love, but in hopes of increasing his fortunes. Well, even Falstaff's friends Pistol and Nym are repulsed by this and Pistol warns Ford, while Nym warns Page. While we may see the adult Pages as the 'wicked parents' who wants Anne to marry someone other than whom she loves, Shakespeare expands their characters by having mutual love and trust. (A great marriage! The not so bright Othello could have learned from Mr. Page!) So, we can see that the Page marriage is happy and successful.On the other hand, Ford is not so sure of his wife to say the least. He plans to disguise himself and encourage Falstaff to go ahead. (So he can catch Falstaff and his wife in the act.) Lady Ford has plans of her own though. We know that Lady Ford and Lady Anne are trying to teach Falstaff a lesson so to speak, and we can only imagine what is going through poor Ford's mind when Falstaff reveals his plans to woo Lady Ford AND Lady Page. Ford goes through some comical jealous rages, but unlike the so called 'noble' Othello, Ford DOES NOT lay an abusive hand on his wife, and it is hard for us to not feel at least a little sorry for Ford. (We can only imagine his frustrations when he feels bad and thinks he was wrong about his wife, only to realize that his wife has another scheduled meeting with Falstaff!)Well, keeping with the comedy, no one really gets hurt, and Ford is willing to admit he was wrong about his wife. Now it does seem after all the humiliating events Falstaff went through (such as being thrown in a river and being beaten) Falstaff would have learned by now. But such is comedy. The Pages and fords decide to subject Falstaff to one more practical joke.And of course there is the matter of who Anne will marry. (Fenton whom she loves, Slender whom her father loves, and Dr. Caius whom her mother loves.) In a bit of \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" nostalgia, Falstaff suffers one final slapstick moment, but all is resolved, and young love triumphs. And in the often found theme of reconciliation, all of the characters (including Falstaff) enjoy a happy gathering."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"The back story of the whole series.

I know it is not how the series should be read but I could not find Dragonquest and I needed, urged for a Pern book. So I decided to read Dragonsdawn. And I made no mistake. I loved this book. It has so much in such a wonderful way. You can actually believe that this may happen... fiction is no longer fiction. It all seems to plausible. And it's wonderful.You are faced with the Coloners from Earth in search of a world to colonize. They have come to the Rukbat System and found the third planet to be ihabitable. They named it Pern. And so it all begins. What they did not know was that Pern, for calmer and more beautiful it may seem, hides a dangerous and deadly secret. The threat of the Threads, brought by the Red Star, catches the coloners unware, unexpectedly. And from then on it is a race to protect the survivor's lives from certain death. You witness in this book the birth of the Dragonriders, and the beginning of the amazing relationship with the dragons. From the delicate fire-lizards there comes the dragons of Pern... to fight Thread, to breathe fire, to protect humans.

Make sure to read this one before reading &quot;All the Weyrs of Pern&quot;."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"After years of putting it off, why, I don't know, I finally broke down and started. What a pity. I have certainly been missing some very good reading. Anne McCaffrey in certainly a natural story teller and so far I am finding her delightful. I realize that this book probably is not truely a good example of the actual Dragonrider Series, but being somewhat familiar with the story line, I found it a good place to start. Yes, there was a bit more \\"tech talk\\" than I usually enjoy in a fantasy type novel, but that is okay as it was quite necessary, in this case, to tell the story. It, the tech talk, was not overwhelming and did add to the story which would have been difficult to understand the origins of the Dragonriders without. The story runs smoothly, is interesting and I felt the character development was quite good. All in all, late though it may be, I am glad I started reading these books and will now start with the next. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"A small group of settlers have risked everything on the information of a survey of Pern a hundred years or more before. They have traveled 15 years in deep sleep on older spaceships to reach the new planet and to start a whole new way of life. Some come because they want the chance to own their own land, others come for the adventure, others come for riches. When they first arrive on Pern, it truly feels like a paradise. The settlers choose a valley at the base of three inactive volcanoes to be their first settlement, which they call Landing. The settlers are eagerly experimenting with seeds and plants brought from other planets and trying to get animals settled and fertilized. Schools to teach children about their new life are quickly organized. Charter members of the group get first pick of land and set out exploring and claiming their small holdings. Others are content to live in Landing and to wait for their turn to spread out. All seems to be perfect...Eight years later, the settlers notice an unusual cloud formation and think that there is a storm coming in. But when silver thread-like things start falling from the sky and devouring anything organic that can be found, paradise turns into a kind of living hell. The only bright spot that can be found in the whole tragedy is that the fire lizards seemed to know when the thread was coming and warned their owners to get inside where it was safe. The colony hopes that the thread-fall was a one-time occurrence, but then they notice the star with the irregular orbit that has slowly gotten closer to the planet and they realize that the thread is going to keep coming back. Many colonists despair and demand that the leaders send out the homing beacon to bring help from earth, but that could take 10 years or more, if help comes at all. Others turn to the fire lizards for answers. Finally, in one desperate action, they ask a geneticist to manipulate the genes of fire lizards to build something bigger - something more dragon sized that would be more effective against the thread. With time running out, all of Pern's hopes rest on the project of one woman...This book is a stand-alone in the Pern series in that you don't need to be familiar with any other background before you read it, but there are many things that won't really make sense or won't seem important if you are not familiar with Pern's later history. Dragonsdawn answers questions such as how the dragons came to be, how they got their mental connection with their riders, how watchweyrs are different from dragons and why, how the colonists ended up in caves on the northern continent instead of the southern continent where they first settled, how the grubs were developed that ate thread, where the cat came from that caused a plague that decimated the population during Moreta's time, who the first dragonriders were and why they named the Holds and Weyrs what they did. The only complaint that I had was that the story was told from so many different points of view and contained so many characters that you really had to be on your toes while you read it. At the first part of the book, it wasn't so bad. McCaffrey refered to people by their first and last names and many of them were familiar to me because they had holds, weyrs and natural landmarks named after then such as Paul Benden, Emily Boll, Sallah Telgar, etc. Then the last names were dropped and we were left with the first names. After a while I got used to it, but then we had those long stretches of time where everyone got older all of a sudden and there are children and other people to deal with. Good thing there are plenty of references in the book to help you keep track of everyone! Although this book could technically be considered the first in the Pern series as far as chronology goes, I think that it is helpful to read the books in the order that Anne McCaffrey wrote them so that you can fully appreciate the detail of the world that McCaffrey has so painstakingly created. This book is a wonderful blend of science fiction and fantasy and I think anyone would thoroughly enjoy it as there really is something for everyone!"},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"DRAGONSDAWN chronicles the origins of human (and dragon) life on Pern. It begins with the original settlers and why they chose to immigrate to far off and isolated Pern. The settlers, weary of the seemingly endless conflict human civilization seemed plagued with and so had decided to establish an agarian society, sever ties with the rest of humanity, and begin again. They selected Pern as their new home based on a planetary survey (done over two centuries earlier) that indicated that Pern was a new Eden. The climate, especially in the Southern Continent, was balmy, there were no large predators and the native biology was either compatible with or adaptible to humans. The colony was established, the new society began to take shape all was going well and then Thread began to fall. The settlers had to act and act quickly. They had to determine just what this terrifying new threat was, how long it would last, and what they could do to stop it. And if this was not enough, the approaching rogue planet seemed to trigger volcanic activity, including the dormant volcanos near the main settlements.This novel, while not the first book written, gives the 'backstory' of the series. It would be a good place to begin the series or would give anyone already familiar with the series answers to the many questions about how this fascinating society came to be."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This was the first book i ever read of Mccaffery and i couldn't stop fom there now i own all her books and am constantly on the lookout for more of her writing. this book is about the dawn of Pern and the creations of the dragons that become the center peice of all her pern series. it sets the moral integrity that permeates all of the pern books. to the new reader i would recoment either this book or Dragonflight as you first book."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Dragonsdawn is inspiring, heartfelt, and moving. It is the story of how it all happened on Pern: when Thread started, how the dragons were engineered, who the people were behind the original hold names, why they left the southern continent. But McCaffrey also manages to make some wonderful characters and draws the reader into her world by giving views of the bad guys and the good. Sallah Telgar's death was poignant and sad but the budding romance between Sean and Sorka as well as the first dragons give Dragonsdawn warmth and vitality. In short, this is the best Anne McCaffrey book I have ever read"},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"It's amazing to go back in the history of Pern and really see what it was like, at Landing and during the First Fall. I love the way you can follow the growing up of the first Weyrleaders as you watch the colony develop. I particularly loved Poll and Bay, the biologists.

If you have a love of dragons, or an affinity with a story that draws you in and makes you feel that you're part of the whole experience, then this is a book for you. Thank you, Anne!!"},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Check out the arrival of the first Pernese. It's fascinating to discover exactly how the colony was founded. I keep thinking that these poeple would love Robinton or some of the other later-on Pernese. The colonists certainly seem to have passed their character traits along to their descendants through Anne McCaffrey's pen (well, nowadays, her keyboard). Nabhi Nabol and Lord Meron of Nabol both make records in creepiness. I've always wanted to know what the founders of the major Holds and Weyrs were like and now I love them as much as Menolly , F'lar, Lessa,and the Dragons. Gobs of great character developpement combined with the interest of seeing how poeple coped with a difficult situation (the first threadfall) makes for a great book.

Anne does it again with her attention to detail. She draws you in and makes you feel a part of Pern with her brilliant characterizations. Aside from being unique storylines, her stories are insights into the nature of man and woman. We all strive toward a future full of hope, change and exploration of the heavens. Anne not only gives us these she shows us what can happen when necessity drives us to seek new answers to seemingly insurmountable problems. In Dragonsdawn she begins with the colonization of Pern and tells us what necessitated the genetic development of DRAGONS and how it was accomplished. The prequel to end all prequels.

Certainly the most well-written Pern novel, bar none. Well-formed characters. Good plot. A villain you love to hate. Believeable heroes. And, of course, Thread.

I captivated me so much I went on to read the whole series"},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Would have preferred to give it a 3.5. This was my first Pern book. I liked the story of the dragonets and the dragons and how they interacted with their humans. So I liked the last half of the book better than the first. I didn't like the way some of the characters were handled. The &quot;bad guys&quot; might as well have walked around with &quot;BAD GUY - Warning - Extreme EVIL!&quot; written on their chests - it was way overdone, detracted rather than added to the story, and not in any way enjoyable. In general, this book suffered from what most science fiction books suffer from: while very imaginative in many ways, the human characters haven't evolved at all from current day humans. I wonder if her other books suffer from the same problems this one had."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Anne McCaffrey's Pern series is a favorite of three of my best friends, so they all conspired to push this book into my hands (I hadn't read any others before). While it wasn't a waste of time, I did feel a bit disappointed. Perhaps this was because it slipped between sci-fi and fantasy, and I definitely prefer science fiction (as I preferred the sci-fi parts of this book). But there were also places where I felt the characters were a bit unrealistic given the situations. While I've already promised to read Dragonflight, I don't think this series will hold my attention beyond that."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I have read some of Anne McCaffrey's other books, and I thought that they were pretty good. Not the case with this one. It seems like I'm the only one that thinks this book was awful, but I just didn't like it.I thought that the story did help clear up some of the Pern \\"mysteries\\" of the ancestors, but I was constantly being averted by the numerous swear words and nasty scenes that I won't mention right now. :-) I understand that some of them may have been affected by living on a \\"corrupt\\" Earth, but I really didn't want to hear that. This book has caused my respect for the series to downslide somewhat. I believe that the same effect may be reached without the above mentioned, and yet still not be classified as a little kid's book."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I saw the Dragonriders of Pern series in the SF and Fantasy Top 100 list, and since the book was both SF and fantasy, my two favorite genres, I snapped it up when I saw the book in the bookstore.(Enlish titles are hard to come by here, anyway.)And then I read it. And then I realized that not all books are good merely for being science fiction or fantasy, or even science fiction and fantasy at the same time. The whole book is about how resourceful, loving, and noble Sean and Sorka are, what an (unbelievably) evil slut Bitra is, what great leaders Benden and Boll are, and so on. The author's obsession with detail, which would have been pleasing in many other books, make reading this book laborious work. Phew! The other Pern book at the bookstore, Dragonquest or whatever, is about the same. What are all these people, reincarnations or something? First novel where I counted the remaining pages while I read."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I bought this book for my wife as a Christmas gift and she loves it.

I mean, why does it have to be in there, anyway? Some people might argue that it's a part of life, but sleeping with someone when the two are not married? If that's a part of life, it shouldn't be. Anyway, I would recommend this novel to anyone if you can deal with the above topics, or do not feel objectionable towards them. Myself, I read it to learn about Pern's earliest history. If you really feel objectionable to the flaws (like I was), and decide not to finish the book (although you should;the ending is pretty good), then I would recommend The Harper Hall of Pern, or maybe Chronicles of Pern: First Fall."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"The villains are overstated and the other characters are bland. The opening is without interest and slow. The best scene is the discovery of fire lizards and even that is repeating an event from a previous book.To be fair, the author has a difficult task in front of her. Her previous books, set in a later era of Pern, contain many references to the the founding of Pern. Now, writing the \\"first\\" book, she is left with the task of connecting her dots and making a story out of them. This isn't her best work, but she manages a credible story that may be more enjoyable to those who have not read so much of the Pern series as I have."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who's read the dragonriders of Pern books.

I have read all of the Dragonriders books and this rates up there with the best, although I think for us die hard fans, it may be a case of reading anything which says Pern in the first paragraph, even if it were on the back of the cornflakes. Some fans may find it annoying having everything explained and if you want to leave things to the imagination , then don't read it, because it shatters a lot of illusions of the medievel land we were first introduced to in Dragonflight, which was where it all began 38 years ago. But, at the end of the day, its 100 times better than Renegades, which was dire. But is not up there with the White Dragon, which was 10 stars, or All the Weyrs of Pern.

Whether a new read or a re-read the stories are wonderfully vibrant"},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Dragonsdawn is McCaffrey's best, and the most sci fi oriented of the pern series(which is mainly fantasy). The Pern colonists are faced with the unforseen horror of &quot;thread&quot;: a kind of macroscopic selfreplicating complex molecule that falls from the sky and eats anything organic. To fight &quot;thread&quot; they turn to gengeneering native lifeforms. The character interaction is superb, all of the characters come off as people, even the extra's. The tech requires no great suspension of disbeleif, and its a smooth read. I loved this book and have read most of Anne McCaffrey's work, which is all pretty much the same. Anne McCaffrey is great... and then you wake up and realize that these are kid's books and you start buying Mercedes Lackey books instead. McCaffrey's work is the TRAINING WHEELS of sc-fi/fantasy!"},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This book was a terrible drag to me. Not only is the plot very slow, but it's also unbalanced in a sense that AMC procrastinates pages after pages on irrelevant points and quickly bundles up essential matters in a few sentences. For example, results of essential conversations are reported in three sentences instead of providing the conversation itself. The same occurs with the experiences with Dragons, or with the death of some characters.Then it makes the book complicated to read because you can't predict what you can safely skip... After a while, you get frustrated and end up skipping paragraphs because you just don't care about anyone any more. Never mind who is who and who does what.Eventually, less than 10 pages out of 420 remain in my mind. A pretty bad score, indeed."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"That is how I summed up this book, not worth the time. This book is very confusing. This comes from the number of characters there are. In every incident in this book, you usually have to think back and remember who the characters are before reading on. There are a whole lot of villagers, then you have to keep track of all the different dragons too. The only way to accurately keep track of all the different characters would be to make a notebook with the character's name and what they do next to it. This book was also very boring. The author just doesn't have the flare in her words that keeps you reading, so most things don't even stand out to you when it is a important event. A good book would take a whole page to dramatize an important characters death, but Dragonsdawn takes about three sentences. Then, once you figure out that someone died, you have to go back and figure out who it was!I would compare the theme of this book to the book Ender's Game. In both books, mankind has to fight a alien hazard to stay and survive on their planet in a futuristic world. The main differences are that in Dragonsdawn, the battle against the alien hazard is on a different planet. The fighting in Dragonsdawn is done by a group of colonists on a new planet who are trying to escape the corrupt society on other planets, but the fighting in Ender's game is done by the military of planet earth. Dragonsdawn also uses dragons to fight the threat to their survival.Overall, I consider this book a waste of my time. I just couldn't get into the plot enough to keep me reading. Two stars."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This was McCaffrey's worst book (okay, Renegades did suck worse), and the reason is that it destroys all the thrill of discovery that we felt all through the first three books and the rest of the series. The &quot;ancients&quot; are revealed to be boring, stiff characters not half as interesting as the best of her 2nd string characters. The &quot;main characters&quot; are stupid and allow themselves to be duped, the evil characters are way too evil, and it basically takes much of the magic of the series away. All this history is meant to be subtle, to be something you think about after you put the book down -- but it's just a lot of dreck. It offers nothing that we didn't know, but a lot of flat, boring characters named Benden, Bitra and so on, and does nothing good. Please, do NOT read this book. Spend time with your kids instead."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"ALLRIGHT, THIS IS THE FIRST PERN BOOK THAT I'V READ, (AND PROBABLY THE LAST,) SO I MAY NOT HAVE PICKED UP ON ALL THE FORESHADOWING TO LATER BOOKS OR SOMETHING, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY BORING. ACTUALLY I THOUGHT THE BEGINNING WAS PRETTY GOOD(HENCE THE TWO STARS INSTEAD OF ONE) BUT IT RAPIDLY DEGENERATED TO A COMBINATION UNIMAGINATIVE FANTASY, LAUGHABLE ATTEMPT AT SCI-FI, AND A SOAP OPERA.AFTER ALL THE HIPE THESE PERN BOOKS HAVE BEEN RECEIVING I EXPECTED MUCH BETTER. FOR A BOOK WITH A REALLY GOOD PLOT I WOULD RECOMMEND TOLKEINS LORD OF THE RINGS OR ROBERT JORDANS WHEEL OF TIME, OR FOR SCI-FI, ISAAC ASIMOVS THE ROBOT SERIES."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Dragonsdawn, my all time favorite science fiction novel, is about colonists who travel to an out-of-the-way corner of the galaxy to escape from the stresses of their increasingly technological way of life. The book begins with their arrival on the planet Pern, and tells of their struggle to survive against unforeseen odds. To combat the evils of Thread, a strange organism that falls from the sky and devours anything organic, they bioengineer the planet's natural inhabitants - creatures they call fire lizards - into dragons that can char Thread in the sky.It's a great example of science fiction because Anne McCaffrey deposits her audience in a society extremely far removed from our own and proceeds to illustrate that the fundamental elements of human nature extend even to the other side of the universe. Her multitude of well-developed characters depict the good and the bad of humanity, explaining that even in a world that could be perfect, people's basic nature remains unchanged. No matter where you go, there will still be greed, dishonesty and despair, but there will also be hope, courage and passion. Although the beginning may seem tedious, it's important later on to understand the motivations behind the characters. Allow McCaffrey about 50 pages to set up the background of the story and then her amazing characterizations and storytelling ability will suck you in and you won't be able to put the book down until the end."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Nothing can top the first six books of the Pern series but this is definitely one of the best after those first six.Moving and beautfully told, it really shouldn't be read until you have read the first 3 books(Dragonflight, Quest and White Dragon) and then Moreta.Even though this is a stand alone novel I just can't imagine folks having the same reaction the stories of the founders of McCaffery's wonderful world of dragons, harpers, holds and weyrs if you haven't at least read the four books I mention.The sacrifices made in this book brought me to tears and at one point sobs. Just simpley well done with wonderful memorable characters, both good and bad and just so well researched so that all the genetics and science sound right but not too tech so that nontech readers like me keep my interest.Well done!"},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Dragonsdawn is the beginning to arguably the best Pern series written by McCaffrey. The novel and the subsequent novels suck the reader in with realistic characters and the pageturning force of a tidal wave. These novels are only surpassed by McCaffrey's amazing Freedoms Landing and the final books of that trilogy. If you havn't read these books and are a fan of the Pern novels, you must pick them up! If you are looking to jump in to a new world this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This was the first of McCaffrey's works that I have picked up. This book lays some foundation material for her world of Pern. It was a pretty good read as I was able to see what she was establishing and what could be done with it. The Characters were a bit shallow for my liking, but it was an overall good book. It piqued my interest enought to pick up some more of these books in the future. I have read that new readers are better off reading the Dragonriders of Pern trilogy first. Recommended."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Though I do not love Anne McCaffrey I am beginning to like her just a little.I read the Harpor Hall trilogy 1st and to some that would be a mistake but thats where my taste lies.Dragonsdawn is a good book.If you love fire-lizards its a good read.It kinda lets you into the dragons world little by little until you feel at home.Because of this book I want to read more not only of the fire-lizards but of the dragons themselfes and their bonded.The charachters are well written and I did cry twice to my surprise as I read the book.I got attached to the characters...Now my only problem is what is next after this book?...hehehe"},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I highly recommend this book as a useful prequel to the Dragonriders of Pern series. By giving a background for how the world was colonized and how the dragons came to be, otherwise confusing terminology is introduced gradually, so that by the main series it's not something to stumble over."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I cannot emphasize how much I love Anne McCaffrey's work. Dragonsdawn is a touching and amazing view of the first people on Pern and the creation of the dragons. The blend between science and fiction was perfect. I greatly enjoyed the genetic engineering (I'm minoring in BioMedical Engineering) and the honest look at how easily things can go wrong when trying to play with genes and with creatures' natures. An absolutely marvelous book, once again from McCaffrey."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I love this book. i know it sounds weird, but this is the book that got me hooked on reading. i fell in love with reading (not to mention one of the books main charecters sorka. just kiddin!) this is a good book and i reccomend to everyone. its possibly the one book i am missing in a now huge collection of books"},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I love this book. i know it sounds weird, but this is the book that got me hooked on reading. i fell in love with reading (not to mention one of the books main charecters sorka. just kiddin!) this is a good book and i reccomend to everyone. its possibly the one book i am missing in a now huge collection of books"},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I thought that this book was one of the best I have ever read. It is for mature readers but is a good book. I would highly recomnd it to young adult readers. About a sivilization on a different planet and how it grows. About how the humans got there and how some people shoulden't be there. A touching story about people trying to populate a new planet. How they have a problem and solve it. I won't get into how they solve it that would give part of the story away. I think that for fantasy readers this is a must read."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"My first book from the Pern series was the White Dragon (Dragonriders of Per), it was the on that won me on this saga. I was really thrilled when I found a book which was going to tell the story of the first dwellers of Per and the book did exactly that:it tells the story from the beginning, the only fault may be the end: too sudden, left me with a sens of anticipatin non fully satisfied. Made me look for next book thoug.If you like to have a look at what the people of Pern loose during the many years passed from the colonization of the planet, this book is a must-read, even if I can't say it has the same driving writing as the Dragonriders of Pern series. Good book."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I loved Dragonflight, Dragonquest, and The White Dragon. They remain my favorites of the Pern series, combining interesting characters with compelling storylines. I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up Dragonsdawn. From the prologues of the previous books, we already knew the gist of Pern's history, so I wondered how McCaffrey would flesh it out. Not very well, in my opinion. The first half of the story is slow, introducing us to the colonists, their hopes and dreams, and their discovery of the fire-lizards. We are also given a glimpse of the main human villain, Avril Bitra, who is completely unnecessary to the story. Thread is enough of a menace that the book didn't need any other antagonists, and indeed, Avril's plotline is weak.Things start to pick up once Thread falls and the colony falls into disarray. But here, the book falls down in its logic. A reader doesn't have to agree with the actions of the characters, but those actions need to make sense to be believable. The fire lizards had proven themselves effective Thread fighters without any human intervention. The idea that the fire lizards needed to be genetically modified to be obedient, more intelligent, and to carry a human rider is, therefore, baffling. But the author needed to get us from fire lizards to dragons with riders, so that's what she gave us from the beginning.All in all, the story didn't captivate me as the previous books did. There was a certain mystique when Pern's colonists were shrouded in time and details left to the reader's imagination. Sometimes, the reality doesn't live up to the legend."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"After you get past the beginning techno stuff, you will have trouble putting down this book.Dragonsdawn is about the colonists who came to Pern. They settle in at Landing and start building houses for families and Crafthalls to set up apprentinceship.Soon young Sorka and Sean find miniature dragons who come to be called firelizards. Their friendship blossoms soon after they get firelizards of their own.Unexpected danger comes all too soon in the form of mindless silver worms that fall from the sky to eat anything organic in it's path. Thread!Only fire, water or stone will stop the Thread, but the sleds that the colonists brought with them weren't for often use and soon they weren't adequate to protect the people, but there is one hope. Those little firelizards that Sorka and Sean found can teleport themselves and breathe fire. They protect things from the Thread.If only they were big enough to hold a rider. Kitti Ping genetically engeneers dragons and her granddaughter tries to keep on where Kitti left of, but fails with breeding a watchwher, a dragonlike animal who is sensitive to the light and is very protective of those it knows.Soon, the volcano near Landing erupts and everyone is driven out to live elsewhere and leave a lot of technology behind.This book is the basis for some of the themes in other later books such as The White Dragon and All The Weyrs of Pern."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It combines the fantasy charm and character development of the best of the other Pern books with more of a standard &quot;Science Fiction&quot; feel due to the higher tech action of the colonists arriving in their space ships. I personally found it a felicitous combination. When I read this, I had already read the Dragonriders and Harper Hall trilogys, as well as Moreta, Dragonlady of Pern, and it was fascinating to go back in time to the original settlers and learn how dragons came to be. However, this could also be a good introduction to Pern for someone who had never read anything in the series."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This book is my second favorite McCaffrey-book after Dragonflight, and Anne McCaffrey has certainly done a good job at describing how the dragons were created. At some points the plot goes a little slower but it picks up again later and gives a triumphant ending. This was defenately something I needed to explain all the smaller bits about Dragonflight, and I still refer back to it while reading the other books."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This is an awesome, awesome book. It was my first Anne McCaffrey book ever, after buying All the Weyrs of Pern, and realizing that this was not anywhere near the first Pern book. I finished it in about a day and a half. I'm only 11. I also finished the White Dragon, and Dragonflight in that same week! This book is about how the first Pern colonists came and settled on Pern, and how Sorka Hanrahan and Sean Connell find the first fire-lizard/dragonets, which help them battle against the deadly silver Thread. They are developed into Thread-scorching dragons, which are to become the most important creatures in Pernese history."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I've read this book before when it was first released. I decided to re-read the series in chronological order so started here. I have to say I enjoyed it more the second time around, although it's been over a decade since I first read it. Excellent story and Chronicles of Pern: First Fall makes a great follow up. Binding was very good, an off white color which surprised me and the bond has a rough finish to it, kinda nice."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Anne McCaffreys Pern series manages to encompass both science fiction and fantasy and does it very well. For any fan of McCaffrey or Pern this is a 'must have' book for the collection.With the first books of Pern the theme was more fantasy than sci-fi with the usual medieval type world, dragons etc. As the series progresses, McCaffrey brings in the sci-fi element, the fact that the Pernese are descendants of colonists from another world who, over the generations have lost their technology and reverted to a simpler way of life. All that is left are the \`gengineered' dragons.Dragonsdawn goes back to the time when Pern was first colonised and is the story of the struggle to survive this new world. It also explains how and why the dragons of Pern were created.I was engrossed from the first word until the last and was totally caught up in this tale of the 'beginning'. The characters are believable and not one dimensional as in many books. Their struggles to make a life on Pern and to live in harmony make a fascinating read. It isn't a lengthy book and is certainly no heavyweight of literature but it is an entertaining tale that is worthy of anyone's time. This is a book that I did not want to come to the end of.... highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This book will keep you guessing how one thing relates to another, at first it's confusing but when you get into the book it starts to make more sense, for instance, why one of the pilots wanted to save so much fuel, at first you don't understand then later it makes sense. The relationship of the characters is very well thought out, but there are so many characters that play tiny parts, it's hard to remember who did what. Only the main characters have a real solid background on what they did throughout the book, while the more insignificant characters are just that, you remember what they did but not who they were. What I didn't like most about this book was the long introduction, they are on a spaceship, and they're going to Pern, what more is there to know, I don't really care for how slow it is at the beginning. Another thing that relates to the long introduction, is the long explanations, some of them take up quite a few pages that I'd rather not read, it's relevant, but the length of them is awful. There are also quite a few characters that have very significant roles, so you have to constantly remember who did what and why, some of them are in little groups so it won't be too hard to figure what they did in relation to the others.All and all this book was a very good read, minus the lengthy explanations and introduction. So if you are thinking about this book or are not sure, read the first 50 or so pages, you'll know if you will like it from there."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Ever wonder where the dragons of Pern came from? This book gives a satisfying answer to that question.Anne McCaffrey goes back to the beginning in this novel, describing not only where the dragons came from, but how the people got to Earth.

Highly reccomanded!"},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I loved this book, not only because it was writen by one of my favorite authors, but also because it informs you on any questions you might have.

This opens my eyes and is thoroughly brilliant, I reckon that some of the above reveiws have small minds and even smaller imaginations. I believe this to be among her best work, it is fast and exciting allong with the real threat of thread. It is a lengthey version of the history bit they give you at the beginning of the other books.

It has many characters and a great plotline about the colonists battle to keep everything they had worked so hard for alive. I cried once, when Salla Telgar died a horible and cruel death from Avril Bitra. It had many happy, sad, and scary parts. This is a great book. I couldn't put it down and I read it in one day. A great book for people being introduced to this series, or read in order."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I absolutely loved this &quot;historical&quot; Pern novel chronicling the fist settelers of Pern and their lives up to the move to Fort in the Northern Continent. I thoroughly enjoyed learnign about the individual people and their activities. I was finally able to understand the naming of the holds in the north, as well as certain happenings hinted at in All the Weyrs of Pern. Despite all this, I do wish Anne McCaffrey would have enlarged upon some of the more obscure refrences in this book, such as giving an explanation for why the probes sent to the red planet all blew up, or whether there really was a second cycle to thread that fell to the ground and didn't die. Little things like that weren't totally explained to my satisfaction, but they can be excused in teh face of what a great work this novel is over-all."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"First, I'm impressed with the technical thought that went into this book. The merging of space technology with a basically primitive planet could not have been easy, and I think it was done well. The plot that's weaved in and among these details, as a group of people from an advanced civilization try to make a new home on a world nothing like the one they left, quickly drew me in and kept me reading.My biggest problem with this book, though, is the number of things that were started, but never finished. Some of them are important, and some of them aren't, but there are enough to make me wonder. Perhaps they're answered in other books I haven't read; but if so, the author must surely understand that not everyone has read every book in the series.This book is a must for die-hards, but can be taken or left for others."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I fell in love with the first 3 books in the Pern series when I was in high school. Dragonsdawn takes you back to when Pern was first inhabitated and the first encounters with thread and the creation of the dragons. It is and adequate read and certainly anyone who loves the stories of Pern would find it interesting enough. It is just not of the same standard as the first 3 books in the series."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I was rather disappointed by the lack of drama I felt with this book, especially at the end when you've got a volcanic eruption and a big Threadfall coming. To me it seemed the Pernese settlers dealt with it in a business as usual attitude.However, McCaffrey handled the development of Sorka and Sean very well. They were by far my most favorite characters in this book. Liked how Sean starts off as a total loner and very, very slowly warms up to Sorka. Soon finds himself learning to depend on her and starts opening up. This is especially true once they discover the dragons on Pern.The dragons were pretty cool, especially when the Pernese start genetically altering them to grow bigger. And I did like the very first Threadfall, as debris from an Oort Cloud falls across Pern, burning almost everything it touches. McCaffrey really drew you into the scene and gave you a grand tour of the disaster and its emotional impact on the colony.On a whole, the book seemed to have its up moments and down moments."},{"Title":"Dragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I thought theis book was very well-written, if a bit long. Then again, Anne Macaffery is a brilliant author. This is, essentailly, a history book on ancient Pern and I loved it. The setting was fantastic, as always, and the plot was fun, though sometimes a bit slow. I can't say I loved the characters, but the relations within the colonie was fun to watch and, as always, the dragons were my favorite characters.

Since then I have read every one in hardback, paperback (multiple times), and finely Kindle (also, multiple times). Anne McCaffery's character building from the very beginning was exceptional, and as her PERN Society grew, her technical knowledge grew even faster, yet, she made us feel like we were learning along & at the same pace as her PERN students. Now that she has left us for a better place, I truly, truly hope that her son & daughter publish the last book that Ms. McCaffrey was finishing up &#34;after thread.&#34; We all need closure. (And, Todd, please, keep PERN alive for us. Thank You.) NOTE: All of my PERN reviews will be the same, because I love all of them. They are all a great read and a wonderful way to drop into another unique world when you want to escape this one."},{"Title":"The Towers of Trebizond (Braille)","review":"With a minimum of fuss and a maximum of reading pleasure, Macaulay's narrator takes us along on her adventures in northern Turkey with her eccentric, camel-riding Anglican aunt and a grumpy missionary. Her aunt's mission is to study the condition of women in Turkey; the priest's, to convert Muslims; and the narrator's, to draw pictures for her aunt's &quot;Turkey book&quot; and enjoy some travel. This simple premise yields a rich harvest of comic character studies and a gradually unfolding, more serious subtext in which Laurie, the narrator, struggles with her agnosticism and the adultery she has been carrying on for ten years. Macaulay has a wonderfully deadpan writing style marked by compound sentences strung together with &quot;and&quot; and often ending in a short, droll phrase. She is so amusing that you hardly notice how emotionally reserved her narrator is, as she recounts her Anatolian adventures with and without her aunt and the priest - exploring Trebizond, heading into the mountains in search of good fishing, alone on the camel with a high fever and money running out, cadging favors from a fellow Brit whose personal duplicity she has discovered and could expose, meeting her mother and her mother's wealthy &quot;protector&quot; by chance in Syria, and traveling to Jerusalem. Until it's back in print, find it at the library or through used book sellers."},{"Title":"The Towers of Trebizond (Braille)","review":"One of the strangest aspect of this excellent book is that the sex of the narrator is left undefined. Most people (including the blurb writer on my edition) assume that Laurie is female, but there is no clear evidence for this; and indeed the adventures described -- in remote rural Turkey in the 1950s -- would be remarkably intrepid for an unaccompanied female. But nowhere is this commented on.Not only that, but Laurie's lover, Vere, while presumably being male, is never explicitly referred to as such and the author goes to some lengths to avoid using gender specific pronouns.Which raises the question, whether the &quot;sin&quot; which Laurie is in, and which excludes him/her from the Church, is more serious than heterosexual adultery."},{"Title":"The bride wore black (A Collier mystery classic)","review":"If anyone ever wanted to cite a story that would best illustrate the observation that revenge is a dish best served cold, then I think this one would fill the bill. As a story of revenge, it's a classic with the big mystery being, what on earth could have happened to prompt such violence.The person who is seeking revenge is Julie Killeen. She is a beautiful woman, but she's also a careful, cold-blooded killer. She is on an unstoppable mission of painstakingly tracking down, stalking and then murdering men before casually walking away, unconcerned about whether or not she leaves any witnesses. She gives little away as she carries out the murders, although she does feed us with snippets of information which merely serves to add to the mystery surrounding her actions and drives us on to find out more. None of her victims seem to recognise her, nor do they seem to have anything in common with one another, which also adds greater interest to the event that started her off.Attempting to track Julie down is Lew Wanger, the detective who, while not exactly hot on her trail, is the only one who believes the murders are related. It's through him that the pieces are put together forming a coherent chain of events helping us understand what went on in the past to cause the events of the present.This is a captivating story told in the typically brutal fashion of the hardboiled genre. The unexpected ending caps off this highly entertaining book very nicely indeed and I found myself well and truly put in my place, just as I was congratulating myself for having figured everything out."},{"Title":"The bride wore black (A Collier mystery classic)","review":"She was a mystery dame if ever there was one. Julie Butler was what she called herself, or sometimes Josephine Bailey, or Mrs. Baker. But to the men she met her real name spelt D-e-a-t-h. The author introduces the heroine of this quintessential noir novel, looking out of her hotel window one night: &quot;She seemed to lean toward the city visible outside, like something imminent, about to happen to it.&quot; Although Woolrich was one of the founders of the noir genre, his name is not so famous as that of Chandler or Hammett. This is to be the first reprint in a laudable series, repositioning Woolrich as &quot;America's Master of Suspense&quot;, with &quot;Phantom Lady&quot; coming out in august. The cover is magnificent, even better than it looks on this page. The only thing the editors have forgotten is to put in the original year of publication, but then again, this femme fatale in black (&quot;Where have I seen her before&quot;, one of the characters wonders, &quot;those ice-cold eyes, that kissable mouth?&quot;) is of course timeless."},{"Title":"The bride wore black (A Collier mystery classic)","review":"Raymond Chandler (The Big Sleep), James M. Cain (The Postman Always Rings Twice), and Cornell Woolrich were among the creators of the noir genre of crime fiction in the 1930s and 1940s. This uniquely American literary genre had its roots in the terse, violent, and often poorly written pulp fiction. More talented, innovative writers evolved a dark, modern mythology that exploited themes of crime, guilt, deception, obsession, and murder.I am familiar with other classics of noir genre, but The Bride Wore Black was my first introduction to Woolrich. The innocuous beginning, a young woman leaving home with no particular destination in mind, transitioned rapidly into an audacious, calculated, carefully planned murder without any apparent motive. Woolrich shifts the perspective back and forth from character to character, adeptly disguising the inner thoughts of the killer. Unlike the police who are uncertain whether the deaths are accidental or deliberate, we readers know it is murder, but not how the victims are chosen. I was unprepared for the ending.The Bride Wore Black has been often republished and you should not have difficulty finding a copy.Many novels and short stories by Cornell Woolrich have been adapted to the screen (the most notable was Rear Window), radio, and TV. I Married a Dead Man, Phantom Lady, and his \`Black' series of suspense novels were among his best works."},{"Title":"The bride wore black (A Collier mystery classic)","review":"Cornell Woolrich is one of those 1940s writers who pumped out loads of pulp fiction that have by now largely gone out of print. He was a very good storyteller but only an average writer - that is, his prose and characterizations are not particularly good. 'The Bride Wore Black' fits this rule completely.In 'The Bride Wore Black' we have essentially five different murder stories with one seemingly common element: the same murderess. In the end we understand a bit more about her motive and why these victims were chosen. Woolrich also delivers a delicious surprise ending. Don't expect any subplots or side romances. This is pure, simple reading enjoyment that doesn't tax the brain but keeps your eyes glued to the pages.Bottom line: certainly among Woolrich's better books. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The bride wore black (A Collier mystery classic)","review":"I had heard my mom talk about the book The Bride Wore Black by Cornell Woolrich for at least 35 years. It was one of her favorite books and was out of print and nowhere to be found. On my first try on Amazon, I not only found the book, but it was so reasonably priced that I was a bit skeptical. It was a used paperback, but since the price was so great I ordered it and hoped for the best. I received the book within 7 days, and it was in pristine condition. It was the best mother's day present I've ever given my mom, and she was thrilled when she got it."},{"Title":"The bride wore black (A Collier mystery classic)","review":"I've been trying to track down this book for a number of years after hearing Tarantino may have taken the Kill Bill story directly from the book. The similarities are striking...in both, an unnamed woman tracks and kills the five assassins who killed her husband on their wedding day.The differences are more interesting to me and have made me reflect on the evolution of the vigilante hero.For one, the Bride in the book isn't a Kung-fu fighter killing female assassins in brutal sword fights. Instead, the book's Bride is an everyman character who's on the hunt for five men. She kills by outsmarting her targets by playing off both their egos and their ideals of a perfect woman. The book really shines through in these parts by making the reader wonder just how she'll ensnare her next target.From here on out, my review has MAJOR SPOILERS.The book falls apart with the twist ending and the discovery the five targets weren't assassins at all, just five drunkards in the wrong place at the wrong time. Unfortunately, this means they were innocent men. I say unfortunate because these are the least likable five men in the history of fiction. Each one is a miserable, irredeemable character and it's hard to accept they'd function in normal society. The detective in charge of the case is also completely unlikable and it's disappointing he's vindicated.The plot twist itself makes very little sense. A minor character who happens to know some of the victims turns out to have been the gunman who killed the groom at the exact second the five drunkards drove past the wedding. I have to assume contrived plot twists were common in novels in 1940. I can't think of any other reason something so stupid could be accepted.The revelation the Bride was a villain all along made me reconsider modern heroes. Now, the audience not only empathizes with a woman out to kill the men who killed her husband, they cheer it. Lisbeth Salander is the female literary hero of the moment and she brutalizes any man dumb enough to mess with her. But, not too long ago, trust in the police trumped all and a vigilante was seen as a villain, not a hero. I took it for granted the Bride was the hero and the detective was simply there for narrative exposition, but I think that's because I'm used to stories like that.END SPOILERSOverall, the book was very enjoyable for the first 95%. The characters are thinly developed to keep the plot moving at a brisk pace, but it's quite the plot, so I'm ok with it. I really enjoyed how the male targets were fleshed out through the Bride exploiting their weaknesses. I wish the plot twist didn't exist, but at least we have the superior Kill Bill movies to watch."},{"Title":"The bride wore black (A Collier mystery classic)","review":"I enjoy Cornell Woolrich.

No sexual content. Many of these codices were burned by the Christians coming into Mexico in the train of the Spainards such as Cortez. This represents a preserved fragment of another way of life. If you are interested in the Mayans, it's a short read, large pictures."},{"Title":"The Codex Borgia: A Full-Color Restoration of the Ancient Mexican Manuscript (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)","review":"This Codex is remarkable at any price. The colors and reproductions are simply gorgeous and the text is helpful. Present are a bewildering number of religious pictograms, some calendric and other representing the mystical or dreamlike journey of the strange character 'one-eye.'The characters are, overwhelmingly, bloodsoaked and violent. There is decapitation, dismemberment and heart sacrifice. This document gives the lie to those anthropologists who claim that the mesoamerican societies are 'misunderstood' and were not human sacrificial--that tales of human sacrifice and cannibalism were tales perpetrated by the Conquistadores to justify their conquest and subjugation of gentle cultures.Well, not quite. Judging my this and other codices, as well as archaeologic revelations, suggest that these societies were just as bloodstained as advertised. This is not to justify the Spanish Conquest but just a simple fact.At the same time, many of the characters in this codex require major interpretation. Virtually everything is split, injured or vomits blood. Depictions of people [children?] being tortured and blinded are especially disturbing. Nevertheless, this is a document well worth owning.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexic"},{"Title":"The Codex Borgia: A Full-Color Restoration of the Ancient Mexican Manuscript (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)","review":"Even if you, like me, don't have much of a knowledge base about ancient Mexican history, it's cool just to show people the book.

This is a reproduction of an ancient document from the Mixtecs, around 1400 AD, from the area today known as Puebla or Oaxaxa. The project took seven years to complete as they painstakingly reproduced the Codex with accuracy and authenticity. The color plates are a delight to the eye as they depict kings, mythical warriors and the Mixtec belief system. Each plate is explained, in great detail, in the beginning of the book for your convevience. The colorful plates are intricate and exact on thick high quality paper.

Full photographic facsimilies of these codices are hideously expensive, and really, most are not in great shape. After extensive research, we have here a great reproduction of what this important work looked like when it was \\"fresh off the presses.\\" It is beautiful, and in comparison to Dover's similar Codex Nuttall, this work comes with a MUCH better introduction that explains more of the text, the context, and the ideology. Readers will be able to better understand some of the religious principles of the ancient Mexicans (and there is some debate whether this book was painted by Aztecs or Mixtecs, which I won't bore you with!). It shows gods, ceremonies, the calender, and other religious iconography which is interesting, and would be a revelation for more the artisticly inclined.

It is cheap, it is light and it is well made. Another thing to keep in mind, the codex borgia is read left to right, this reproduction was printed right to left, so it forces you to read the codex in the wrong direction.Look at the \\"plate number\\" and the page number in the book, they do not match.

It reads like a dream if you tune in to it, and reveals very deep meanings about the relation between life and death, the human relation to the forces of nature, and time. Even though there are no words, it is possible to understand. If you get into it the symbols become more and more recognizable, and they begin to speak. the calendrical symbols and the spirit deities are completely recognizable. The sequences are all about times, and there is a big element about sacrifice. It has to do with the consequences of change; there is no life without death.

This overview is followed by a review of the criticism from more \\"established\\" schools of thought (i.e., feminism and the social sciences). This collection does not seek to rectify the critiques of those fields with Queer Theory; it simply draws attention to the current critiques. Corber and Valocchi offer these criticisms a basis for critical examination of their texts that the reader-- even a Queer Theory novice-- can then apply to the texts held within _Queer Studies_.This collection is clearly designed to give classrooms a single text to work from when teaching queer studies. While a more advanced understanding of Queer Theory would require reading some of its founding works (e.g., Michel Foucault's _History of Sexuality Volume 1_, Judith P. Butler's _Gender Trouble_, Michael Warner's _The Trouble With Normal_, and etc.) this collection is helpful for the new student of queer theory._Queer Studies_ manages to be queer from cover to cover and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a broad overview of the field of Queer Theory."},{"Title":"On Social Concern: Encyclical Letter Of John Paul II","review":"Social concerns have always been at the forefront of Catholic Church's teachings and actions, and this encyclical by Pope John Paul II reaffirms this focus. However, it is important to distinguish what the Church considers to be the social concerns versus what is commonly thought of as \\"social issues\\", especially in the United States. The latter deal mostly with the problems of individual personal, morality, while the term social concerns is used in this encyclical and other Church documents to denote more general social developments - economic, civic, and political. In the eyes of the Church these social developments ought to be founded on the individual morality as a bare minimum for a just social order, but the term is much more comprehensive.The Catholic Church has long emphasized the distinction between raw progress on one hand and genuine human development on the other hand. The two are not exclusive, and in practice they can reinforce each other, but if we put too much emphasis on material progress without the regard for the uplifting of our fellow human beings we may end up living in a very unjust and disordered society.The authentic human development goes well beyond the economic concerns. The Church has never professed a preference for one economic system over another, and has no desire to play an arbiter in the domain of economics. At the time of writing of this encyclical Marxist collectivism still seemed like a viable way of structuring the economy, but the Church didn't find it necessary to either endorse it or condemn it. However, this encyclical makes it clear that the freedom to engage in private enterprises is a fundamental freedom for the proper functioning of a just society.This is a well-written and instructive look at Catholic Church's view of the development of a society as a whole. Some of the concerns may seem a bit dated today, but overall this encyclical addresses the perennial problems that all societies face as they struggle to provide the prosperity and security for all of their citizens."},{"Title":"Latin for the Illiterati: Exorcizing the Ghosts of a Dead Language","review":"This is a book which might well bore the serious student of Latin for whom it was not written.

Stone, \\"and its use is foundational to our major branches of knowledge from law and medicine to literature and commerce.\\" _Latin for the Illiterati: Exorcizing the Ghosts of a Dead Language_ is a personal reading list of terms that the author encountered in his days as a graduate student. As such, it is a good reference book to keep on hand for looking up basic Latin words or Latinate expressions. Compared to Dr. Eugene Ehrlich's _Amo, Amas, Amat and More_ and _Veni, Vidi, Vici_, this book is not as humorous. Further, Dr. Stone has taken the excellent _Cassell's Latin-English/English-Latin Dictionary_ as a guide and added his own parenthetical translations._Latin for the Illiterati_ is like a phrase book, except it is for a \\"dead\\" language. If one wants to learn Latin, then _Wheelock's Latin_ is the best. The essential reference book for the Latin language is the _Oxford Latin Dictionary_ [OLD]. However, Dr. Stone's handbook is quite comprehensive: 6,000 entries, with 300 abbreviations; geographical place names, colors, calendar months and days, and Roman numerals (written out); an English-Latin index, (which is not as useful as the Latin-English section); and a quite good guide to Latin pronunciation. (It really is \\"weenie,\\" \\"weedie,\\" weekie.\\")The Latin-English section has two parts, with listings in alphabetical order: \\"common words and expressions\\" and \\"common phrases and sayings.\\" I recommend this book for people who read books on philosophy or religion; for crossword puzzle fanatics; and for those whose work or worship includes the use of Latin."},{"Title":"Latin for the Illiterati: Exorcizing the Ghosts of a Dead Language","review":"No explinations or verb conjugations in this book.

These books are innocent and engaging, focusing on two young girls, Kirsty and Rachel, who meet while on vacation with their parents, and are drawn into the magical world of the fairies, who are in conflict with the mischievous Jack Frost. The structure of this series is nearly identical to the first: the girls are given a quest in which they must help seven fairies (each with sparkles aplenty and cute, super-girly outfits and princess-y names such as Hayley, Heather, Iris, Amber and Iris... ) who have been bothered by Jack and his goblin helpers. In each book they complete one part of the quest and meet one new fairy.It is important to know going in that these books are interconnected -- each individual volume ties in with the others, so you will want to start with book #1, then go on to #2, etc. The plots are not very complicated, but they do make reference to each other, and the idea is to read them all together.The other thing to know is that these books are not very scary or troubling - there is action, but no violence and not much real danger (the goblins are easily beaten, and not very frightening) so if you are looking for longer narratives for young kids to read, but don't want anything disturbing, this series is good option. One criticism is that the books are pretty WASP-y, and while a couple of the fairies might be seen as Asian, basically the entire series takes place in an all-white, middle-class world, populated with thin, blonde girls and a few brunettes. Other than that, though, this is a good series for families looking for light, engaging, age-appropriate stories.

Wu, the author's son and a novelist and short story writer. Monsoon Season tells an extraordinary life story of someone who is not a public figure. He's neither an entertainer nor a politician. He is, however, one of those people in the generation now being recognized as \\"the greatest\\" in numerous books and magazines. He's also my father. This autobiography, with a foreword by former U.S. Ambassador to China Leonard Woodcock, recounts the varied experiences in my father's life. Born in a Chinese peasant village, he first learned of the United States from his grandfather, after a monsoon had passed; as a child, he left his mother and father to journey to Philadelphia, where he lived with an uncle in Chinatown, working in a restaurant and attending school. A simple summary of events here, however, does not do justice to his experience. Maybe a better way to convey the strength of this book would be to describe a few high points: A shipboard romance during a trip back to China in 1935, with a woman whose parents had arranged a marriage to someone else for her; his volunteering for the U.S. Army as a surgeon in a field hospital staffed in large part by Chinese American doctors and dentists, and his campaign experiences against the Japanese in the China-Burma-India theater; his diagnosing his wife's mysterious illness shortly after their marriage and a years-long struggle to save her life. He then attempted to start his private practice in Kansas City, Missouri, at a time when only white doctors were allowed into the local medical society; he became a test case for their policy. This book does not have the glamour of celebrity biographies, with famous names on every page; rather, it's an account of a real life, with a happy, triumphant conclusion."},{"Title":"Monsoon Season: an Autobiography","review":"Dr Wu writes this Monsoon Season, an autobiography of two countries and two cultures in a wonderful romantic life journey. In the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, he came to US for a better education but had to cut short for his sister's death in China. He felt the Chinese fraternal family tradition in facilitating his return voyage with great expectation from Chinese crews for the elite intellectuals to contribute for a better China. He was lucky to have Grace to and Ruby from China across Pacific Ocean.William's culture upbringing earned the trust of host family Helm who offered to finance his college education in engineering. Unhappy, he switched to medicine and University of Michigan where he met Cecile Franking and developed a romance. Busy as he was, he kept abreast with the world events especially what happened in 1937 Nanking China. After MD degree and internship, he applied for commission in US Army which led him to war torn China for his bilingual ability. With the abolition of the Chinese Exclusion Act, he was granted US citizenship in Oregon before heading the battlefield of CBI. War was horrible and William put his medical training into saving lives. A strange moment was that he passed water by the mountain and found a half-buried dead Japanese soldier staring at him (P169). Another incident was a Japanese soldier in Chinese uniform for meals for several weeks before being caught. Another racial incident reflected the reality. General Chennault's Chinese-American attendant born in Brooklyn, New York came for dental service and the dental officer, Major Stuart made the remarks \\"We are strictly responsible for American armed service people, American civilians, and the diplomatic corps\\".He came back and landed August 8 1945, totally ignorant about the atomic bomb. He married Cecile 11 days later. Cecile developed the disease of myasthenia gravis and commuted from Washington DC to Boston for treatment where he worked as a neurosurgical fellow. Eventually, they settled in Kansas City, Missouri and started a family and private practice. Dr Wu was the first non-white to break into Medical Society. It was sad to see that he lost his scholarly father and he chose not to participate the cultural monthly long mourning as a Christian. It reminded of the Pope in 18th Century issued an edit forbidding Chinese converts to participate honoring Confucius and deceased family members till 1939 abolition.Dr Wu shares his life in this book with extraordinary achievement. With his kindness and good deeds, he was rewarded many times over. He continues to promote cultural and professional exchange between US and China with UMKC Scholarship. He led the elite group of Chinese-American in medical field, a Confucius teaching of love of studying in the pursuit of excellent. He had the chance to serve both countries in war time and shared this book and scholarship. To know him is to esteem this remarkable Chinese-American in Mid-West who showed by action \\"do not ask what the country can do for you but ask what you can do for the country\\"."},{"Title":"Collecting the Mercedes Benz SL 1954-1993","review":"great book perfect for Mercedes Benz SL 1954-1993 owners I love it ...highly recommend it for anyone involved with a Mercedes SL"},{"Title":"Portraits of Hope: Conquering Breast Cancer : 52 Inspirational Stories of Strength (Portraits of Hope)","review":"It's hard to visualize how women go on with their lives after the diagnosis of breast cancer.

The masculine grieving style is described in eloquent, lyrical language and mirrors the experiences of many men who seek counseling and support in my bereavement groups. The author gives sound advice about how women can better understand and support men who grieve, while also honoring their own feelings. Additionally, this book points out how unfair it is for our society to raise young boys as protectors, providers, and thinking problem solvers and then expect them to suddenly become sensitive, expressive emotional experts in times of loss. This work is a reality check for women who grieve - a call to re-examine the level of our neediness for emotional support from the men in our lives. It vividly demonstrates how important it is for parents to help children understand and express their emotions appropriately and to realize that doing so makes them both courageous and authentically human."},{"Title":"When Men Grieve: Why Men Grieve Differently and How You Can Help","review":"Excellent book for explaining how men go through the grief process.

The author's style of writing is eminently readable. The book introduces you to many of the people involved in saving Paris, makes you love some and loathe others and keeps your attention glued to the end.The book is based on interviews with as many of the key players in the liberation of Paris as possible, including the German commander of the city. The facts are laid out clearly, and the differing points of view are based on the actual opinions of the people involved, unlike some histories which seem to attempt telepathy.The only (minor) problem I had with this book was a lack of footnotes, although there is a good bibliography some explanation in the text of where some of their information comes from. I could have used a bit more support for some of it, but on the whole I was pleased with and enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"I purchased this book, in part, because of it's excellent reviews on Amazon. Although the authors obviously did a considerable amount of research for this project, the book as a whole seemed to me rather tedious, with an overwhelming number of characters who contributed little to the final outcome. Although the liberation of Paris was a momentous event and is depicted well in the final chapters, I think a more profitable line of pursuit would have been to examine the critical miscalculations made by Hitler which resulted in the loss of Paris for the German army, or morale among the Germans as the European campaign collapsed. As such , the book offers little in the way of insight into these events, and this, I believe, is its greatest weakness."},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"\\"Close to 10 million copies\\" of IPB have been sold, and in the intervening decades, countless published historians have demonstrated they have learned absolutely nothing about the connection between near-flawless writing and book sales (as their various wasted efforts have been pulped - a growth industry in academia).Just re-read IPB, and am identically amazed - as I was when I first read it in the late 1960s - at how well Collins and Lapierre Kept It Simple, Stupid (even with an impossibly complicated story).

What I learned that astounded me was that Hitler had ordered the total destruction of the city if the Germans could not hold it. So Germans placed explosives under every bridge crossing the Seine and inside most of the great monuments. However, the German general in charge dithered and never gave the order in time to obliterate the city.This book is a great read in the vein of more or less popular history, and by popular I do not mean inaccurate.

This is not a comprehensive, academic-style study of the German occupation and surrender of Paris; rather, it reads like a collection of anecdotes and vignettes (mixed with generally known facts about the events) that weave together to present a reasonably clear picture of what sounds like a fascinating time. You don't have to know a lot about the war, Paris, or military strategy to enjoy and benefit from this book. Another comment: This made the liberation of Paris sound like the world's greatest celebration, and leaves one feeling sorry to have missed it."},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"Yet another riveting foray into nonfiction. Prior to reading this book, I did not know much about the liberation of Paris during WWII. I was fascinated to learn how desperate Hitler was to have the city destroyed before the Allies could take control of it. And, had it not been for the refusal of Dietrich von Cholitz, the general in charge of Paris, to become a scapegoat of history, he would have had his wish. The Nazis had mined all the bridges in Paris and all of the famous landmarks (The Eiffel Tower, The Louvre, Notre Dame Cathedral), and all it would have taken to decimate the city was the order from von Cholitz. Thank God he thought better of it!"},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"The book is very well written, as have been their previous books, like Freedom at midnight.

Well done lads"},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"A detailed account, in the mould of Cornelius Ryan's great second world war trilogy, of the 1944 Paris insurrection. The story of its initiation and its relief is drawn from the personal reminisences of participants and witnesses, French, American and German.This leads to a gripping and at times very moving book. Though the vastness of the cast occassionally makes it difficult to keep track of characters this never detracts from the coherence of the sprawling narrative.The account is broadly pro-de Gaulle in its sympathies, but otherwise the authors keep to themselves their views of the wider controversies associated with the relief of Paris, such as the decision by the resistance to stage an insurrection in the first place and the relationships between the resistance in France and de Gaulle's government in exile. The arguments of various participants are outlined and examples of the tensions are recounted but the authors don't exercise much their own judgements rather letting many of the real people speak for themselves and the readers decide.An exemplary work of journalism rather than history, and none the worse for it."},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"Paris itself is a Hero of this story and the German, and presumably Nazi party member, General Von Choltitz is another. It is difficult to imagine now, from the perspective of a new century, just how much raw courage it must have taken to defy Hitler and the Nazi Regime of WWII. But Choltitz, the last Nazi Commandant of occupied Paris, did just that - repeatedly and persistently defying, ignoring and circumventing Hitler's mad order that Paris, the world's city of light, must be burned and destroyed on the German retreat.Von Choltitz's defiance, despite his family still being back in Germany, virtual hostages to Hitler's murderous madness, saved this city from the careful plans of destruction by explosives and fire. With a mixture of machination, Nelsonian \`blindness', the connivance of Frenchmen and the creative \`loss' of communications Choltitz ensured the order was not carried out. This reflects his sense of historic responsibility and great personal courage and this brave and exceptional General deserves better and wider recognition. As does his defiance of even a personal direct order from Hitler - he defied and survived. An interesting outcome considering all those legal defenses built upon the claim that \`Direct Orders' in Nazi times left no choice but obedience that were consistently deployed in Germany.An excellent well written book that grips the readers interest with a firm hold."},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"What better book to give my son days before he and his family left for a week in Paris.Is Paris Burning is now one of his top five favorite books -- he loved being able to visit many of the places mentioned in this hisotircal WWII story (with a happy ending!!!!)"},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"Another great book from Dominique Lapierre, Larry Collins.

Paris was the pinnacle of Western Civilization with its lengthy history, culture and prestige. Indeed, Paris was probably the crown jewel of Hitler's conquest. This city represented a victory for German forces and the vanquishing of the humiliating World War I armistice that Germany signed with France. The Germans had nearly taken Paris in 1870 and threatened it in 1917.Hitler's instruction to his Commanding General of Paris was clear and he had only one question: \\"Is Paris Burning?\\" The Germans were ordered to set demolition charges on all major bridges, monuments and cultural monuments. The city was set to be destroyed for a worthless exclamation point of the Wehrmacht inevitable retreat across the Rhine into Germany. The General had to wait for the Allies advance and stall the German High Command in the process - all the while trying to keep the various guerilla groups from rising up under his feet. It was quite a balancing act. I used this book as a reference for my novel,A Cold Death: An Aristotle Witzer Mysterywhich has echoes of World War II in its central premise."},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"For aficionados of WWII history this book is a must read. That statement would apply to anyone who has a deep interest in Paris as well. The book depicts the last days of the Nazi occupation of Paris through a series of carefully reconstructed events that appear with all the drama and vividness they deserve. As the allies began to push back the Nazis from formerly occupied territories such as in France, Hitler demanded that Paris be rigged with bombs and destroyed. The Nazi general in charge arranged for the bombs to be placed but hesitated in the execution of Hitler's orders. Hitler apparently called him with this persistent and famous question, \\"Is Paris burning?\\" This book explains the response of the general and the subsequent controversy over his decision. The battle scenes are not for the faint of heart. The book is a page turner and provides excellent historical information."},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"This is one of those rare books that continue to be important, fresh, and exciting long after their time.

I recommend it to anyone interested in that historical period. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"This well documented and compelling account details the last days of the Nazi regime in Paris. The authors, former journalists, detail how the German general in charge of Paris was ordered by Hitler to ravage and destroy the city rather than let it fall, how knowledge of this information reached Eisenhower, and how American troops were able to arrive quickly enough to save this from happening. Written in the form of a non-fiction novel, the book is suspenseful and fascinating"},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"The liberation of Paris was a coup de grace for the Allies. Paris did not suffer the fate of Berlin or Stalingrad, to name a few cities, in becoming a contested battleground. Nor, as the book pointed out, did the German commander follow Hitler's orders to destroy the city's major monuments, bridges, and other sites. It is interesting to note his actions in view of other German officers' claims that they were \\"only following orders\\".However, this book is written by two journalists rather than historians, so it does not have the academic research nor analytical insight that a serious work might have. Cornelius Ryan comes closer to the style of writing that might have made this a heavier book. This is understandably difficult, in some ways, given the relative sparcity of combat and drama; or so this book would suggest. Again, a better writer and researcher would find more material to include.Some material that might be considered, for example, are Allied intelligence estimates, Axis intelligence estimates, operational orders, etc. It is not clear to me, for example, how the German commander could fail to execute Hitler's orders in August 1944 when the Gestapo and SS were omni-present, especially after the failed July plot on Hitler's life.Moreover, good research might show to what extent the Allies knew of Hitler's intentions. The Allies had significant intelligence capabilities, not the least through Ultra. And if they knew of the plans to destroy large parts of Paris, why didn't they send in commandos and special forces to disarm any explosives? Indeed, the French themselves seemed to put a higher priority on erecting road blocks rather than disarming explosives.This is an easy, enjoyable read; and one of the few on the subject in English. However, it's about time someone else updated and added value to this book."},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"The book is great! In fact, one of the best I've read.

The Allies didn't stop him, a brave German general did. At a tremendous personal risk, he resolved not to be the man to destroy the most beautiful city in the world.The story is told with the in-your-face realism of two journalists. Yet it's full of humor and even downright silliness. Would-be soldier Enrnest Hemingway captured a German soldier and relieved him of his pants. Why? He figured no man would escape half-naked. He was right.This isn't about troop movements, it's about real people risking their lives (and those of their families) to liberate Paris. After all, Eisenhower didn't think he had enough fuel or time to fight a mini-war for Paris. He desperately needed to push east to Germany.So how did it all happen? Read the book, in Paris if you can, but whever you can find a good lamp.

A huge job, a piece of history novel, good as only a few can be, with a great work of investigation; interviews with people like General Dietrich von Choltitz, (who recieved the order from Adolf Hitler, to burn Paris, in case that the defense couldn't be accomplish) or for example the Chief of Operations in Europe, the General Dwight Eisenhower. As usual in their books, Lapierre and Collins, put the reader inside of one of the most importants chapters in the history of the XX century, the liberation of Paris, with precisions of days, hours, and places. The order of Hitler, the beginning of the resistance, the slow arrival of the allied, the clear disobedience of General Von Choltitz.... in fact, a crucial moment in the history of one of the most beautiful citys in the world, a turning point in the development of the Second World War. A different way to learn history."},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"I just finished reading Is Paris Burning? by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre. The book is the fascinating tale of how Paris evaded the fate Hitler envisioned for it at the end of the Second World War. It's a complex tale, , with characters including Hitler and his staff in his bunker, the last German military governor in Paris and his staff, the French freedom fighters in Paris (both the Gaullists and the Communists), de Gaulle himself, Eisenhower and Bradley and the various other members of the Allied command structure, the Swedish ambassador in Paris, and common people, in the armed forces and in the streets of Paris. The title is drawn from a question Hitler asked, when he found out that Allied troops were approaching Paris.The tale starts with the uprising in Paris, and ends just after its liberation is celebrated in the streets. Hitler had hand-picked the last military governor of Paris, based upon his reputation from attacks against Rotterdam and Sevastapol, and he had the task of holding back the Allies at Paris, or, failing that, reducing Paris to ruins, much like Warsaw had recently suffered. The Allies had every intention of bypassing Paris and moving onwards, but the freedom fighters in Paris knew the Allies were nearby, and hoped to push things to their advantage. All of these things should have spelt disaster for the City of Lights, but opportunity and stubborn resistance and collusion and soldier's honour led to a different outcome.The authors tell a spellbinding tale, based upon much research. My copy is a used copy, and dates back to the mid-1960s (bought it on amazon, used). There are a great deal of photos, documenting scenes from throughout the story. The authors, in my opinion, did a commendable job, and I would recommend this book to those interested in Paris, or in the Second World War."},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"As part of Adolf Hitler's nihilistic resolution to decimate all traces of his infamous conquests and satanic occupations, Paris was to turn into a victim of Warsaw proportions. Lapierre and Collins masterfully direct the reader to the grueling scenario Generalfeldmarschall Dietricht von Choltitz had to endure: a German army turned decadent from Parisian amenities; allied troops slowly filling in the fringes of the French capital; and most importantly, Hitler's irreversible obsession to obliterate le Champs Elys&eacute;es, the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, the perennial scars of European history.Hopscotching between enemy lines, the authors draw the nauseating political picture of Paris during August of 1944 with Resistance militias and FFI agents vying for eventual supremacy, de Gaulle battling against time and the insensitive Eisenhower to avoid internal military strife and eventual Communist hegemony, and Wehrmacht officers contemplating the insurmountable fate of the City of Lights. They also explain in detail the military background of the liberation of northwest France and the strategic and political dilemma facing the Supreme Command of the Allied Expeditionary Forces: chasing after the subdued German army all the way to the Rhine or liberating a Paris overshadowed by the hammer and the sickle.\\"Is Paris Burning?\\" is superbly documented, intelligently written, and scrutinizingly researched.

Few books have made me feel a bizarre mixture of feelings like this one did. From one page to the next I found myself feeling happy, angry, surprised, sad, worried (yes, worried... even though I'm able to see every day that the city was not destroyed). This book has given me new eyes to see my own city. Paris is full of little plates with the dates and the names of the persons who died for her liberation. I didn't use to pay attention to these things. Today, I look at them with new interest and gratitude. There's only one little detail I would criticize about the book: its continuous repetition about Paris being the most beautiful city in the world. Even though I agree with the authors about this fact, I think their use of this remark was a little exaggerated and sometimes you loose the real context with so many repetitions. But well, no book is perfect and at the end, this is a very negligible thing compared to the interesting stories the authors share with the reader. They did a marvelous job researching the existing documents and interviewing the different intervening persons.

There are certain moments of privlege, and certain moments of exclusion, but a gripping and often touching read is the end result. You get the 'high end' of the story, with de Gaulle and Patton etc, but also many ordinary anecdotal stories, which are often the most interesting, and devastating. Many of the internal conflicts within the allied forces are laid bare for those that thought this was purely a 'them and us' kind of thing."},{"Title":"Is Paris Burning?","review":"The dreadful question \\"Is Paris burning?\\" was put by Hitler himself to the German commander of Paris.It anticipated the mad politic he will follow in the last year of WWII: burn it all, destroy it all (enemy or German alike).The authors of this book had done a great work performing a very readable and entertaining piece.They apply the technique of interviewing key witness, ranging from public figures to almost unknown particulars, from Allies military thru Resistance members, from Diplomats to German military. All of them have their saying and express their viewpoints unrestricted.The collective memories of the witnesses generate an enormous \\"collage\\" of the period.Collins and Lapierre take this huge mass of information to produce a coherent, ordered, dynamic and griping story that keep the reader going on.An excellent 1966's film of the same title with an all stars cast is done based on this book.This is an informative book commendable for anyone who is interested in WWII history or in the curious and dangerous events that endangered the existence one of the most beautiful Capital Cities of the world.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Great Unsolved Mysteries","review":"This is a classic collection of unexplained murders and mysteries. Everything from the assination of President Kennedy to the death of Robert Maxwell (was it an accident, suicide or murder?) Also covered are mysteries of the sea and air, historic enigmas, ghosts and the occult, and monsters. Eight pages of photographs round off this interesting book."},{"Title":"Manual of European Languages for Librarians (Topics in Library and Information Studies)","review":"As a librarian, I have always found the online dictionaries for various languages unsatisfactory. The key words a cataloguer is searching for are either not covered at all or else have a different meaning in another context. And how many libraries have a run of foreign language dictionaries to cover everything from Hungarian to Welsh.Faced with a large multi-lingual project, we were happy to discover this volume. Bibliographic terms are covered neatly under each language; words for volume, edition and so on are all there. There is also a glossary of common terms and sections on ordinal and cardinal numbers for each language. There is abit of grammatical information, which was perhaps not so relevant to our purposes. The only problem I would mention is that the languages are arranged linguistically not alphabetically. We overcame this by bookmarking the sections we found we were using most.Heartily recommended."},{"Title":"A Message from Garcia: Yes, You Can Succeed","review":"I would recommend this book for two reasons. One, I am responsible for motivating a team of employees to make my company a success, and Garcia offers plenty of business related insights that can help me. I can't wait to share the four success strategies with my people. The second reason I like this book is more personal: I don't want to be stuck here in middle-management-limbo all my career. My goal is to eventually become a CEO, I have an idea for my own company and this book is giving me the personal strength and the professional techniques that can help me visualize achieving that dream. A Message From Garcia offers some very powerful advice on setting goals and meeting them. I have read many books on success and this one takes the genre to a new level. Kudos, Garcia! This is the holiday gift I am giving to my entire staff and my boss. And his website, successcompass.com is amazing...check it out!"},{"Title":"A Message from Garcia: Yes, You Can Succeed","review":"What can I say about this book? I loved it! In less than a year I will have to face the &quot;real world&quot; armed only with a bachelor's degree and my own resourcefulness. A Message From Garcia makes it clear that I have everything within me that I need not only to find a job but to build a life that I love. You wouldn't believe how glad I was to receive this message. So many of my classmates are frightened about the economy and discouraged about their job prospects. Sometimes I get discouraged, too, listening to their negativity. I guess I am still nervous but now I realize that achieving my dreams is a realistic goal if I'm willing to work hard, think creatively and not give up. I don't usually write reviews like this, but I felt compelled to say that this book is definitely worth reading. It gave me hope at a time that I really need it."},{"Title":"A Message from Garcia: Yes, You Can Succeed","review":"There is a story in this book that really touched me. It's the story of Charles Garcia's little daughter Olivia, who was having trouble making friends at school. Her Dad gave her a \\"magic bracelet\\" and told her to wear it when she introduced herself to new people. Guess what? It worked-the first day Olivia tried it, she came home and reported that she made three new friends! Of course the \\"magic\\" in the bracelet was only in the little girl's mind - but it was, nevertheless, real. Being a teacher for more than 20 years, I've seen how easily children grasp the concept of belief, while adults continue to find reasons and make excuses for why things won't work. This story beautifully conveys the fact that we only need self-confidence and the ability to believe in ourself in order to succeed, whatever our goals may be. It's a theme that Garcia repeats throughout the book, illustrated by many real-life stories of people who pursued their dreams and caught them. Read this book if you need a little extra push - you will come away from it convinced that you can do great things."},{"Title":"A Message from Garcia: Yes, You Can Succeed","review":"Why don't more people have a go-for-it attitude? As a high school guidance counselor, I often see students who feel hopeless, trapped in circumstances they've either created or fallen into. They don't know that all they need to \\"be all they can be\\" (to borrow a phrase from the army) is initiative and determination. You don't have to resign yourself to your fate. A Message From Garcia conveys this idea in much more inspiring language than I just did. It's a powerful concept: life as a masterpiece you can shape and mold in any way you desire. I think it's a true concept-but when you look around at most people's lives you realize it's also the best-kept secret in the Universe. I wish more people would read Garcia's book and really take its words to heart."},{"Title":"A Message from Garcia: Yes, You Can Succeed","review":"Good book. Great message. Lots of useful information and good stories. As a person who has never quite &quot;fit in,&quot; I liked Garcia's emphasis on forging your own path in life. Sometimes people don't fall into predictable categories and need to think creatively about how to get from Point A (where they are) to Point B (where they want to be). &quot;Message&quot; offers reassurance that these &quot;outside the box&quot; thinkers are often the ones who find the greatest success. I especially enjoyed the SuccessCompass.com -- free stuff!"},{"Title":"A Message from Garcia: Yes, You Can Succeed","review":"The recipe for success isn't so tough to figure out, writes financial entrepreneur Charles Patrick Garcia. Start with a heaping helping of passion, then mix in equal parts hard work, integrity, belief and positive attitude. The quality of the final dish resides in the details, of course, so the former military intelligence officer outlines the actions you must take to succeed and the mindset you need to adopt. Garcia's easily digested writing style, peppered with plenty of real-world examples from the military, politics and business, makes this motivational book a rewarding repast. We suggests Garcia's success manual to managers looking for a refresher course in staying focused, inspired and on task."},{"Title":"A Message from Garcia: Yes, You Can Succeed","review":"here is a light read with a heavy dose of motivation! if you are down about having resigned yourself to a life of mediocrity, mr. garcia has crafted just the pep talk you need. replete with apt anecdotes and real-life success stories, the book inspires you to greatness and a life of deliberate action.&quot;yes, you can succeed&quot; fortuitously appeared in my life just as i was reevaluating my future. i gave a copy of the book to a friend wrestling with similar issues. if you are ready to start turning your dreams into reality, you should get yourself a copy, as well."},{"Title":"A Message from Garcia: Yes, You Can Succeed","review":"This book does a good job helping you prioritize your relationship between work, success, family and personal growth, with clear &amp; concrete advice. Like most books of this type, it suffers from the vacuum effect--advice as textbook. But it is inspirational and helpful. Coming from a completely different angle, I love how author Bruce Stockler discusses the way he shifted his priorities--work, marriage, kids--in &quot;I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets.&quot; Very inspirational, but a humorous memoir, not a self-help book."},{"Title":"A Message from Garcia: Yes, You Can Succeed","review":"I have never been a big fan of motivational books, because they seem so \\"pie in the sky\\" if you know what I mean. But a friend recommended this one to me and told me it was different. He was right. It was easy to read and in fact I didn't want to put it down. But what I really liked was the \\"how to\\" part of the book. After all, it's no good reading about other people's success stories if you don't know how to make your own. Also, something I thought was interesting is that the author has a website called Success Compass which helps you set goals and then e-mails you a reminder several times a day. I guess the real key to success is not allowing yourself to forget what you want, and this website doesn't let you forget. Hmmmmm . . . electronic nagging as the key to success! ;-) Hey, whatever works!"},{"Title":"A Message from Garcia: Yes, You Can Succeed","review":"I just completed reading A Message from Garcia on a recent trip to Chicago to see my son graduate from Navy Basic Training at Great Lakes. I intend to give him the book to read when he comes home for the holidays, as it contains an extensive amount of practical advice on living life to the fullest and how to be successful along the way. It provides many first hand experiences from Charles that will help others learn how to succeed.

I can truly recommend this book to anyone who has high aspirations in life and is uncertain as to how to go about making them a reality. . Regardless of your race, gender, ethnicity, educational achievement; you can benefit from this book.But don't buy this book if you are just curious about how a successful CEO made it big or if you are looking for a \\"how-to-book\\" describing a few simple tips to improve what you currently do. Buy this book if you intend to put to practice what Charles P. Garcia describes in it. Buy this book if you have made a commitment to your dreams and aspirations to succeed. Buy this book if you have a burning desire to achieve your potential and have the drive and commitment to stick to it until you succeed!Yes, this book describes a step-by-step principled based process you can use to achieve; but it's more than that. Yes, Mr. Garcia outlines a process you can use to succeed in clear steps: \\"Success Beliefs\\" and \\"Success Strategies\\"; but that's not all. Yes the author describes a process of success using humorous personal stories and does these things while inspiring. Mr. Garcia's message, that everyone can succeed, is as evocative to us all as the American Dream has been to countless numbers of immigrants. With a plan, and determination we all can make it!Finally, I also liked this book for the many useful references it provides and the free on-line resources. Readers who seek to expand their understanding of any of the many useful points made by the author will have easy access to the respective sources. Readers who don't have time to read 200 best sellers will find a distillation of them therein. The free online resources provide are an excellent compliment to the concepts presented by the author and a great way for readers to stick to their plans."},{"Title":"A Message from Garcia: Yes, You Can Succeed","review":"I am only in high school, but this book meant a lot to me. I am really glad that I read it now, while I still have my whole life ahead of me. The pressures that young people face (to &quot;slack off&quot; in their school work, to take the easy road) often push them to make decisions that do NOT lead to success. I see this all the time. And I think that if more high school students read this inspiring book, they would realize that they have a whole world of exciting possibilities at their fingertips and that they can, we can, all reach out and get them, Garcia shows us how!"},{"Title":"A Message from Garcia: Yes, You Can Succeed","review":"This book is an easy read that packs a good punch, and I recommend it. I read it in a couple of sittings. Its prescriptions are good and straightforward, although by no means original. Frankly, they can be found in one way or another in many other books of the genre. But I loved the optimism this book radiates. The message is one of self-awareness, belief in oneself and the importance of action, a message rendered more powerful by the fact that the author himself has trod the path he recommends. Many of the vignettes from the author's work with recognizable names from the military and Washington DC, and as an entrepreneur, are also quite interesting and entertaining. Read this book, mark it up, take notes, share it with someone, and then go out and make things happen."},{"Title":"A Message from Garcia: Yes, You Can Succeed","review":"I'm a pretty big fan of motivational books, because they seem to be exactly what I need at any particular moment.

But, it was easy to read and kept me turning the page. I really liked the \\"how to\\" aspect of the book. After all, it isn't any good reading about other people's success if you don't know how to make your own.A big \\"different\\" -- The book was augmented with a website called Success Compass which helps you set goals and then e-mails you a reminder at whatever frequency you wish, even several times a day.

The Message, as I understood it, is that Successful people do not sit around thinking about success, they take action and that is how they achieve success.I live in Boca Raton, Fl., which is the headquarters of the company Mr. Garcia founded, Sterling Financial Investment Group, Inc. I was, therefore very familiar with Mr. Garcia's achievements, success, and dedication to the community, in particular his dedication to education, prior to reading &quot;A Message From Garcia&quot;. I purchased the book out of curiosity and expected a rehashing of what I had read in the local press, from time to time, about Mr. Garcia.When I read the book I was pleasantly surprised. Although Mr. Garcia does use himself as an example of how to achieve success the true emphases of the book is on how other individuals have overcome unbelievable obstacles and have succeeded. The stories about these individuals inspired me to work a little harder and not to take for granted a lot of the thing that I do.

Prior to reading this book, I was very aware of Mr. Garcia's numerous achievements. This book details the path that lead to his success and it gives you a fine blueprint to follow.The most impressive thing about the author is his desire to make a difference in our society. He fully understands the impact that an education can have during the course of a lifetime and he continues to work tirelessly to make sure that ALL children have access to a proper education.He's not afraid to lose power for the sake of something he believes in.

They encounter one another amidst the depressing situation of the halfway house (of the title)and grope for connections that will help them understand and support one another. She shows great insight into schizophrenia, alcoholism, sexual orientation confusions and the need for more enlightened public policies and agencies.

The relationship between the characters is fascinating and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Chance Place","review":"Two men with different problems in a half-way house learn to accept each other. The causes and results of the problems are explored by Frankie Schelly as she uses the novel to educate the public. She writes from personal experience having worked with individuals with mental illness and addiction. Not an easy book to read due to its intenseness, but should be read by anyone dealing with persons suffering from mental illness or addiction."},{"Title":"Chance Place","review":"Anyone who reads CHANCE PLACE will be changed in a positive way by its content and that in itself is a success for the field of mental health care."},{"Title":"Chance Place","review":"It was the early seventies when Nathan Waite finds himself in a Princeton dorm, the sound of Roberta Flack's music taunting his memories of making love with Cheryl and her pleas that he find help. He sees his handwriting on notes he has been studying for a test, but does not remember writing the words. As the cacophony of his growing illness crowds him mind, it results in chaos, and leads to Nathan's confinement to the mental health system.At fourteen, Frenchy Bibideaux flees his alcoholic and violent home life for the streets. Chance brings an offer of a ride from a stranger. Despite his mother's warnings about riding with strangers, Frenchy climbs in the warm car to ride home with Peso. Clothes, money, fantasies are all lavished the boy. He enrolls in a Catholic school and lives a luxurious life. But when he turns sixteen, Peso seeks payment. Life continues to spiral out of control until French wrongly lands in a halfway home for the mentally ill in Minneapolis.Desperate for companionship, Frenchy befriends Nathan. Nathan's family has suffered financial and emotional devastation from his illness, remanding him to the halfway house out of necessity. Both men struggle with an incomprehensible mental health system. Eventually, Frenchy's sexual confusion results in a terrible affront to Nathan. Their alienation finds unexpected healing, however, when Frenchy compromises everything for the one chance to save Nathan from a mental health system gone awry.Author Frankie Schelly pens a stunning novel with CHANCE PLACE. With compassionate humor, poignant opportunities and unexpected joy, CHANCE PLACE finds powerful redemption. As the child of a schizophrenic mother, I am very critical of the presentation of the mentally ill in fiction and fantastically pleased with Schelly's presentation of this difficult topic. Schelly's understanding of mental illness and the sensitivity she displays reveals her own battle with schizophrenia in her son, and her awareness of the human face the illness attempts to mask. A poignant tale that weaves the disparate elements of friendship, betrayal and forgiveness into a fascinating narrative, CHANCE PLACE earns the WordWeaving Award for Excellence."},{"Title":"Chance Place","review":"Anyone who has had experience with mental illness will identify and know that this book rings true. Schelly exposes the shameful lack of effective help in the System and allows us to view life from the inside of a schizophrenic's mind. CHANCE PLACE, well researched and sensitively written, arouses compassion and understanding. I recommend it as a must read on this subject."},{"Title":"Chance Place","review":"Ms. Schelly captured the human dilemma. We see that pathological symptoms in the human being can be understood through relationship process. She struck soundly at the core of challenges we face as we try to maintain a sense of Self and form meaningful relationships. Ms. Schelly's work causes us to pause and take stock of our own behaviors in relation to our fellow man. Although she selected mental health as her focus, this book is instructive for all of with every contact we have. I applaud Ms. Schelly for the telling of this story."},{"Title":"Chance Place","review":"The thing I liked about \\"Chance Place\\" was its stark honesty. The twin stories of Nathan and Frenchy are not always easy to read, but they have a reality that is more than compelling. The book jacket promises \\"a real find\\" for the literary reader, and it lives up to that promise in spades. We often tend to gloss over the world of the mentally ill. We are content to know that we are \\"doing all we can for them,\\" but Schelly walks us behind the walls of \\"Chance Place\\" and into the reality that makes the return trip to our \\"acceptable standards\\" a bigger journey than we ever dreamed."},{"Title":"Chance Place","review":"If you want a comfortable read--something tried and true, something just like the one you read last week--don't order this book. \\"Chance Place\\" is raw, tender, frank, funny, genuine and it rips the cover off the treatment given to some of the forgotten members of our society. This is not a \\"feel-good\\" story, but every page of it rings with a truth we shouild all face up to, and the sooner the better."},{"Title":"Chance Place","review":"Once I picked up Chance Place, I had trouble putting it down. Fascinating view into the schizophrenic mind, and the mind of a trouble youth turned young man trying to figure out his life. This is a true tale of redemption - of a brilliant man who's mind turns against him and has to pull into his deepest wells of reserve to pull himself back from the edge of insanity; of a young man who's life has been crap and yet has the wherewithal to choose to make is life better once he is in control - after he finds the courage to take control; of a family torn apart by the ravages of schizophrenia who comes together to save their son. The realistic depiction of the holes in our social safety net is both troubling and enlightening. Overall a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Chance Place","review":"Frankie Schelly's Chance Place is one of the most compelling novels I've read lately, but it's not for the romance-minded or the faint-hearted. Intense, powerful,well-crafted, the story might be considered an \\"indictment\\" of a society that allows abuses against its citizens (if not through lack of compassion, then through lack of essential moral and financial support), yet the story is a tribute to the love, care, understanding that can evolve, must evolve if individuals are to survive. The characters are not your lovable, nice guys (and it is a story of men--without much help from women), the actions may make you flinch, the settings are realistically unpleasant, but the reader (this reader, at least)is ultimately left with a sense of the positive: a \\"brotherhood\\" --a goodness prevails.

The vegetable tart featured on the cover is simple to make and always a hit. Every recipe I have tried has been delicious. Some can be more time consuming, but if you plan accordingly, they are worth it. This has definitely become my &quot;go to&quot; cookbook when entertaining, as the dishes are varied, uncomplicated, taste wonderful, and it's unlikely my guests have cooked them recently- although I don't know for sure- I've been giving everyone I know who enjoys cooking this book!! The bejewelled squash cubes are another crowd pleaser, and the herb-roasted root vegetables went over big with an avowed vegetable hater. Whether you are looking for a new side dish or a complete meal, I highly recommend this cookbook."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"I really love this book. I have long been a fan of oven-roasted vegetables and found this book to be filled with unique recipes utilizing roasted vegetables. I did find that most of the recipes are heavy handed with the oil or butter. I have tried about six recipes (I reduced the oil, butter or other fats) and found all of them to be delicious. I especially loved oven-roasted green beans and cabbage with dill seed.My children love roasted vegetables. In fact, my six year-old can't get enough roasted root vegetables.This is a great book for those who already roast vegetables and want more inspiration or those who want to try it and need a place to start."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"Andrea Chesman, The Roasted Vegetable (Harvard Common, 2002)A cookbook dedicated to the vegetable? Not a vegetarian cookbook, necessarily, but one that tells you how to get the most flavor out of the vegetables you use, and a number you don't but probably should? Sign me up. The Roasted Vegetable is that cookbook, and vegetarian as well (not vegan, as a number of these recipes call for chicken broth as opposed to vegetable; the flavor of chicken broth, according to Chesman, is more neutral than most commercial vegetable broths). Most cookbooks, even the vegetarian ones, seem to give the vegetable short shrift, relegating it to second-fiddle status behind the protein of choice, be that meat or soy, but it's the greens (and purples and reds and oranges and...) that take center stage here, and that is a wonderful thing.There is a dark side, however. In most cookbooks, the concentration of any given ingredient is kind of spread out, so you can gloss over the subset of recipes that contains, say, coconut or pigs' feet or whatever makes you cringe. In my case, however, one of those things is eggplant, and once you get to the main dish section of this book, glossing over is an impossibility; Chesman, unlike most vegetarian cooks I've read, seems to consider the eggplant, rather than the portobello, the best way to make a vegetable into a meat substitute. (Soy fans take note: there is a small, but decent, section of tofu and tempeh recipes.) Of course, as Chesman points out once or twice, you can simply substitute meat, and I'm more than willing to admit it's just my personal ick factor that turned me off here, but man, there is so much eggplant in these pages. Ugh.Don't let my eggplant phobia color your judgment (unless you're as repulsed by it as I am). There's so much other great stuff here it's worth your time. Where else are you going to get the definitive recipe for the most underused vegetable in America, the rutabaga? ***"},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"I love this cookbook. I really enjoy roasting vegetables because the flavors become so intensified. I haven't found the recipes to be too complex - they generally have 5-6 steps, and the first one is usually to preheat the oven, the last one is to serve hot or whatever. So I've found it pretty straight forward. The ingredients are a great mix - not your basic salt &amp; pepper but adding things like honey or spices like cumin or cilantro. Really really tasty stuff here. Highly recommeded and I'd definitely buy it again!"},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"I thought I knew what you needed to know about roasting vegetables: a 425 degree oven, vegetables drizzled with oil, an hour for sturdy root vegetables, less time for everything else. Then I found this book at the local library and discovered that I knew diddley. I went out and bought it.Chesman offers recipes for appetizers, entrees and other dishes. She makes magic with the vegetables anyone can easily find in the supermarket or roadside stand. She uses fresh herbs frequently, but is not fussy about any specifics, so you can work with what you have. The first thing I discovered, as someone who is gas-grilless in this age of the grilled vegetable, is that many of Chesman's roasted vegetables, particularly the spring and summer ones, do a great stand-in for the grilled variety. She provides a general chart for roasting times and temperatures of various vegetables and I've been able to extropolate off it and make up my own dishes. My balsamic and cardoman roasted mushrooms have transformed pizza.The recipes all revolve around vegetables and none call for meat of any kind. That's okay. You don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"\\"The Roasted Vegetable\\" is a wondeful example of a cookbook which stays \\"on task\\" and fulfills the promise of its title.I'd had good results with recipes for roasted root vegetables, roasted asparagus, and roasted nuts from other cookbooks, so you could say that I was \\"ripe\\" for this volume, but still...5 minutes after picking this book off the racks and sampling the recipes, I was at the register and on my way home to try some of them. And \\"The Roasted Vegetable\\" has completely rewarded and repaid my faith in it with a wonderful variety of well designed dishes that even an undistinguished cook like myself can make and enjoy. I am also reasonably confident, given the nature of most of the dishes, that many of the recipes could also be reproduced on a smaller scale in a good toaster/convection oven, which adds to the convenience and possible applications for smaller families, couples, and solo diners.You will understand the possibilities of roasted vegetables just by glancing through this book for a few minutes. Even if you have little-to-no interest in vegetarianism, even if you wolf down a Delmonico 4 times a week, you will find plenty of recipes to spark your interest here. The dishes are fairly simple to execute (there are a few more involved exceptions) and reward the cook with flavorful, satisfying dishes. Not only that, but since you are indeed \\"eating your vegetables\\" just like your mother wanted, you get the satisfaction of knowing you are doing something good for yourself.And it does all this without the tedious self-righteousness and endless \\"cut the fat\\" mantra of the typical \\"low fat healthy cooking\\" book. This book is about the flavor and about the enjoyment of your veggies and nuts, and health benefits are just a side effect of good food, done right. That's my kind of cookbook.This is definitely worth your time if you come across it, and worth seeking out if you are looking for ways to make a more balanced diet without feeling deprived or put upon."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"My husband and I were bored, bored, bored with vegetables until we picked this up. Easy to make recipes with a minimum of cleanup and absolutely delicious. We use our gas grill to roast the veggies for extra kick and ease of preparation. All the recipes use common ingredients- many of them you can just whip up with what you've got in the house left over from your weekly shopping! Serve any recipe in the book with a nice grilled steak or piece of fresh fish for an exquisite meal."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"This is an okay book insofar as roasting methods, etc., for vegetables. However, why were there no recipes for the non-exotic vegetables, i.e., broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts?"},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"Some of the recipes are very complicated and require lotsof esoteric ingredients. That's fine, if you're cooking for fun, but hard to deal with on a daily basis. There are some terrific, quick recipes that are really delicious. I'd never roasted asparagus before; I'll never boil it again. Delicious!"},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"If you are looking for new and inventive ways to work those 5 recommended veggies a day in to your diet, this is the book for you. While I had roasted asparagus before, I had never thought of roasting green beans, never one of my favorite veggies. I was eating them straight off the cookie tray as they came out of the oven! I agree with the previous reviewer who found the oil/butter a little heavy handed, so reduce to make veggies more healthful. She includes some wonderful roasted veggie sandwiches and pastas that make the book well worth purchasing."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"When I first started using this cookbook, I used it more than any other. After a year, I was still using it more than any other. And so it goes on.... This is the way to cook delicious, healthy and simple food that is easily adjusted to your taste preferences. Recipes are clear and ingredients are readily available. Best to buy at the Farmer's Market."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"So many great recipes here. As with the author's other cookbook on grains (which I recommend), you can very the recipes to your own taste. I prefer more vegetables than pasta so when I make the Summer Roasted Vegetable Pasta Salad, I make it with just 4 oz of pasta without reducing the vegetables. The flavor in the recipe is *amazing.* I'm surprised how much I've come to love this cookbook- she makes vegetables taste so delicious."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"Overall the recipes in the book are quite good. They use simple ingredients, are easy to prepare and taste quite good. As some others have found, there is quite a bit of use of eggplant. In the introduction, the author advises against the use of mushrooms, because she finds the taste of mushrooms dominates other flavors. I find the taste of eggplant can be similarly dominating, though a few recipes with them would be okay. The author also makes heavy use of oil. There is no nutritional breakdown of the recipes, but I would imagine that use of oil in the recommended amounts results in a lot of calories. For example, the recipe for linguine and vegetables calls for 6 tablespoons of oil for a recipe that feeds 4 to 6. I used half that amount and am happy with the results. Next time I make it, I may cut back even more."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"I checked this book out of the library but I will be ordering a copy. Since checking it out a few days ago, I've roasted about 4 lbs of green beans. The green beans are sooo delicious...like eating french fries. I've also roasted asparagus and made the Parmesan Fennel Roasted Tomato tart. Really, if you want vegetable ideas and are bored with the same-old, this is a great book."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"I have both the Roasted Vegetable and The Vegetarian Grill by Andrea Chesman for almost 6-7 years and I still love them both. There are so many recipes for grilling and roasting vegetables that you can't run out of ideas! When I feel lazy, I stick things into the oven and when I feel like grilling, I use the recipes from The Vegetarian Grill. Some of them have become our family favorites. This book is good for vegetarians and occasional vegetarians alike."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"We all need to eat more vegetables and this book, The Roasted Vegetable, will make your vegetable dishes delicious! The recipes are easy to make too!"},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"I've been looking for heart healthy vegetarian ideas since I had been diagnosed with a heart condition. I initially became interested in roasted vegetable recipes while watching a cooking show on PBS and began searching for cookbooks at Amazon.This book, \\"The Roasted Vegetable\\" fills the bill for the most part and I have already tried one of the recipes. I only wish that each recipe would also include a full color photograph of the finished dish as that also helps me with creative plating ideas when serving the food. I'm debating about whether or not to get the companion book that Ms. Chesman wrote as I'm not certain how to adapt those recipes for indoor cooking."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"This is an eye-opening little book in that it gives recipes for roasting vegetables that I have never considered. I especially liked the sweet potato & \\"Best Ever Green Beans\\" recipes. Everything is so easy"},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"This cookbook had been recommended by a friend and it was just what my wife wanted.The best part is the ease with which you can find a fairly obscure book on Amazon. This would probably have been a special order item at a bookstore. And, I probably wouldn't have take the time."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"Until I bought \\"The Roasted Vegetable\\" the standard preparation in my home was to steam or boil the vegetables or add them raw to a salad. Needless to say, vegetables were pretty bland-tasting. I had no idea they could be roasted. For example, roasted zuccini in a light lemon sauce tossed with feta cheese and the honey-coated carrot coins are just a couple of easy-to-make recipes in this vast repertoir of selections! Roasted asparagus and eggplant are two more inspirational preparations. All in all, a remarkable cookbook!"},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"I love this recipe book. It has a lot of recipes that will be easy to try. I like the layout and the design. Worth the purchase."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"The \\"Roasted Vegetable\\" is a \\"must have\\" for vegetable lovers! Since veggies are a big part of my diet, when my son saw an excellent review of the book, we sent for it. I am delighted with the easy, delicious recipes for everything from asparagus to zucchini. I recently tried a recipe for roasted parsnips drizzled with maple syrup - superb!Measurements and times are accurate. So get healthy and enjoy those veggies. Thanks Andrea Chesman!"},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"Very good cookbook. I have already used several recipes in this book and am very pleased with the results. Also, there is several useful and interesting tips for roasting vegetable successfully."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"Only tried a couple recipes so far, but they've been super. I really look forwarrd to trying more. I'm hooked on raosting veggies."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"The author has produced a comprehensive aid to roasting vegetables. Her instructions are clear and her reasoning sound. And the results are healthy and tastey."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"We like Ms Chesman's way of presenting food-related ideas, and &#34;The Roasted Vegetable&#34; was the guide for us to venture in the world of meatless meals. Her presentations have caused us to plan roasted veggies for every meal, including breakfast! Our grown children have followed our lead and enjoy the books as well."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"I got this cookbook 6 years ago (I think), bought it then for my sons, just got it for my mom. I love the recipes, I love roasting veggies."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"We needed some advice on how to prepare all the veggies that are being delivered to our doorstep from a local organic farm and this cookbook is great. It's simple (even the non-cooks in the family can handle it), the recipes are tasty and now we eat the vegetables before they end up in the compost heap."},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"The Roasted Vegetable, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it, love it"},{"Title":"The Roasted Vegetable (Non)","review":"I looked through this book when it 1st arrived and found a few things I thought interesting. I happened to have a Delicata squash on hand and remembered that I'd seen a recipe that featured this squash in the book. So I looked in the index under Delicata and is says \\"See Vegatables; Winter squash\\". So I turned to Vegetables and no Winter Squash. I looked under W found the recipe under W.The Table of Contents lists starting page for a chapter, like side dishes. But when you go to that page the list of recipes at the beginning of the chapter does not show page numbers for the recipes. I really expect it to be easier than this to get to a specific recipe.The other big missing is nutrition information. While it does give number of servings, or at least a range like \\"serves 4 to 6\\", there is no additional information on calories or nutrition. All in all I am very disappointed from the standpoint of usability. The squash was good but not special."},{"Title":"The Daily Mirror: A Journal in Poetry","review":"I am not surprised that &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; is fantastic. I have yet to meet a poem by David Lehman that I don't like.That being said, I'm still deeply pleased by how much I like this book. These poems are so full of joie de vivre that every time I read one I find myself smiling.The poems in &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; are terrific in part because of their immediacy. As daily poems they comprise a kind of poetic journal; they are crafted out of the everyday. What's great is that they also transcend the mundane; they're made of ordinary stuff, but they're *poems*, with the heightened consciousness and precise language that poems require.These poems are witty and intelligent and creative and funny and sad. I recommend them highly."},{"Title":"The Daily Mirror: A Journal in Poetry","review":"A magnificent collection of poems -- each one a shiny little jewel! The world comes alive through date references, NYC locales, and the fertile imagination of David Lehman! Who do YOU see in the Daily Mirror?"},{"Title":"The Daily Mirror: A Journal in Poetry","review":"The Daily Mirror is David Lehman's writing at its finest. So many of the poems move as water falling and turning, fluid and full of surprise. His sense of the poetic line and his innovative use punctuation (almost none) blossom into moments that hold and propel the reader. He uses the timing of poetry in concord with the pace of a life moving and moved by people, images, and ideas. The world of particulars in his verse captures a time (our time) that the reader will want to return to again and again. These poems read like a treasure hunt that never ends. Everyone will have their favorite day in this book of daily poems."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"Without going into detail I'd like to echo the sentiment of other reviews here. This book was spectacular. I couldn't stop and finished in one sitting of a couple hours. Really good on every level."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"This is a really good book, but I needed to keep track of what universe it was in on paper! Its a complex storyline and it digs into both the characters and the plot really well. I didn't begin watching Voyager until the end of it's third season, and I found the history that kept this book cannon to the series really interesting (I didn't know our Harry was from another universe!). A good book to read, but keep some paper and a pen handy..."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"This Book is awsome, but it gets kind of confusing, because there are about 19 different parralel universes in it. Don't get me wrong, I love Star Trek books with parallel universes in them. A must have book."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"This is one of the few Star Trek novels that I could not find much fault with or errors in the plotline or Star Trek lore.This not a &quot;happy&quot; novel. Like many tragedies, Echoes focuses on the overwhelming tragic situation of billions of people dying every hour. This book is not for the squimish Star Trek fan.Solid plotline, storyline, and almost believable final resolution."},{"Title":"Echoes (Star Trek Voyager, No 15)","review":"This has to be one of the best Star Trek: Voyager books ever. I loved the plot and the characters were well written and believable. I will admit that I had to think and work to keep track of which universe I was in while I was reading this book.
